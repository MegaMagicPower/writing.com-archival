One wrong sign, and the a spike in the amount of chakra used, caused by someone sneaking up behind him at the last moment, and Naruto Uzumaki was sent spiraling through the space between the different universes.  When he landed, it was a shock to find himself smaller than a mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large feet of those who were walking by caused his world to rock and shake.  Everyone was in styles of clothing that he did not recognize, and Naruto could not identify any landmark that might tell him where he was.  All he knew for sure was that every single giant around him was about his age, and were all wearing uniforms of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is this some kind of military academy?' he thought mistakenly, it was his first time experiencing a Japanese high school after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only pieces of clothing he could kind of recognize, having seen similar during his training trip with Jiraiya, was worn by a black-haired, pigtailed boy and someone in a kendo uniform the former was beating into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, all of this was happening at a much larger scale compared to him, so each blow that landed sounded like thunder to his tiny ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto decided that enough was enough and chose to run away from this meeting place of titans, and turned to do so.  Sprinting before he even had his head facing the right direction, he ran headlong into a foot with the all his leg strength, causing the foots owner to notice him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person he saw had</span></div></div>",

At first, the ninja thought he had dropped dead from some sudden malady or enemy attack, but quickly ruled that out after biting his own tongue as he screamed at the thought of that. No, whatever was happening he was definitely alive, and since there didn\u2019t seem to be anything in any direction he could only prepare himself for whenever he landed so he didn\u2019t shatter his legs. This proved to be the right decision, as he was soon thrown from the strange limbo into his final destination, skidding and rolling until he stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce his eyes quit spinning in his skull, Naruto managed to get himself back on his feet and get a good a good look at where he had been regurgitated. His senses gathered a few things almost immediately that stood out to him. For one thing, his surroundings were gargantuan in size. He could see what appeared to be a bed that looked like his occupant could sleep on comfortably. He could see that he was now in the middle of an expansive floor in a room sized for titans. A theory further supported when he felt and heard what could only be described as the footsteps of a massive creature. He needed more info, and the rest of his senses went into overdrive to gather any stimuli that could help him. What he found however didn\u2019t really help him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As the spiky-haired blond continued to pass through the vortex he could only wonder at what the hell happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Earlier*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs best as he could remember, Naruto was heading home from his favorite ramen stand.  It was a quiet night in Konoha, and there was almost no one left on the streets.  The young man had eaten his fill and was now ready to return to his apartment, lie down, and go to sleep.  Too bad he would never enter his apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto turned onto the street leading to his apartment complex when he fell into it.  A swirling vortex appeared unseen beneath his feet, and the genin plummeted feet first into the abyss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Just before the fall, in another universe*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife at the Masaki household had become dull since Tenchi had been taken on a visit to the Jurian homeworld.  It was a trip he was meant to take alone, so, much to the girls' horror, they were left on Earth while the wielder of the light hawk wings was off world.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe the atmosphere in the household had become depressed and heavy.  It was as if all energy had been drained from the occupants.  A fact that was not lost on the greatest scientific genius in the universe, Washu.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redheaded genius couldn't stand all the depression that seeped from the others, and took it upon herself to at least try and lighten the mood.  The idea was simple, she would just give a little demonstration of her latest invention and fill the others with a sense of wonder that would take their thoughts off of Tenchi's absence, at least for a little while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWashu gathered everyone in her lab and proudly presented her latest creation to the lovesick girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Presenting the dimension spanner!  A little device that allows the user to open gates to other worlds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all would have gone off without a problem, if only Mihoshi hadn't been the first person to touch the device.  With a bright flash of blinding light, the device activated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Back to Naruto falling through the dimensional hole*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like hours to Naruto, there was a light at the end of the tunnel.

He was soon enveloped why a pleasant warmth that completely cut all light from his vision. He screams of shock were muffled by chocolate colored skin and body fat as he was pressed deeply into the generous bust of Mihoshi Kuramitsu. He was trapped by the giant masses and could barely move his fingers, much less escape from the tit flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver the ditz, Mihoshi failed to notice anything out of place, or even that something landed in her valley of cleavage in the first place. She was too busy coughing up smoke from the sudden, and rather violent, short circuit of Washu's invention. Those group of women who had gathered in the redhead's laboratory were, one by one, picking themselves off the floor. Each of them were filthy with smoke and ash from the incident, and it was unanimously decided to call it quits for the day and adjourn to the giant bath. The blonde quickly left to collect a change of clothes and bathing supplies from her room, and jogged at a brisk pace out of the lab, her breasts swaying heavily with each footfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill stuck in breasts of the space detective, though he did not know it yet, Naruto struggled to free his hands from the firm grip that held them to his sides. He had no idea where he had landed, but it felt like he was caught in an earthquake unlike anything he had experienced before. He was flung about by his restraints and felt like he was about to expel his last meal with each powerful bounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihoshi stumbled into her room and almost fell over her small desk in her attempt to quickly fetch her clothes. It was a fortuitous trip as her slip up jostled the tiny ninja in her breast valley and sent him sprawling across the wooden surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What's this?\" she asked as her bright blue eyes fell on the tiny form of Naruto. The young man had bumped his head against the solid wood and was currently too dazed to move or even make a noise. Mihoshi brought her face closer, her eyes inches from the mystery thing that had fallen on her desk. Unsure of what to make of it, the galaxy detective lifted him into her hand to get a good look at him.</span></div></div>",

She let out a shout of embarrassment, and rushed to her dresser to grab a change of clothes, before she bolted out of the room, leaving Naruto alone on her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the giant lady had left, and he was certain there was no one else nearby, Naruto slowly got back to his feet. His stomach had finally settled down, and he had regained his bearings enough to move without feeling like he would barf. He moved to the edge of the desk, and looked down to the floor below. It was a drop that would kill a normal person, but with his training it would be no problem for the Konoha ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, where the hell did I end up?\" Naruto asked out loud, his eyes surveyed the room until he found a route out that would have the least chance of getting found. He had no way of knowing if that giant was friendly, and he wasn't about to find out first hand. No, he would have to keep to the shadows and observe until he could say for certain he wouldn't just be made into a meal or something worse by whatever lived in this strange place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gathered himself, and officially began his exploration of his new surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar above the household where Naruto now found himself, outside the outer reaches of Earth's atmosphere, an odd vessel orbited the planet. The exterior, oddly enough, was constructed almost entirely of wood. Yet despite this choice of material, it was probably one of the most powerful ships in the galaxy. This was one of the Royal Tree ships of the planet Jurai, and its passengers were eagerly awaiting their arrival to the surface of the blue planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think the girls will be happy to see us?\" asked a woman with long blue hair which was pulled back into a ponytail that reached past her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sure they're rife with excitement since we let them know of our visit,\" replied a woman with regal bearing and long, straight black hair, a tiny smile on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship began its descent towards the little blue planet after it cloaked itself against detection from the primitive technology their destination possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter much exploration, and some close calls, Naruto had managed to find a room that was the ideal base of operations. It hadn't been an easy journey, and he had plenty of scares. The coco skinned giantess who had found him before had nearly stepped on him with her bare feet...twice. Then there was the weird rabbit/cat thing that was hopping around that had nearly found him multiple times. He needed some place to rest, and regain his energy, and this place was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room appeared to be bare of any sign of being used. There was no personal effects anywhere, and the furniture was bare. If he had to guess, he would say this was a spare bedroom, and it was exactly what he needed. First thing he had to do was find a place to sleep, and preferably somewhere not on the floor, where ditzy feet could step on him. A quick climb later, and he was atop the bare dresser  where he quickly flopped down and let himself drift to sleep.</span></div></div>",

They strode towards the family home with a noble elegance that came from many years of diplomatic experience and etiquette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome along sister, I want to see the girls as soon as possible!\u201d said the cerulean haired one as she almost danced on her toes in anticipation. This woman was Misaki Masaki Jurai, second empress and mother of Ayeka and Sasami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down Misaki, it won\u2019t do if you break down the front door in your excitement,\u201d answered her co-wife, Funaho Masaki Jurai, first empress of Jurai. The two of them shared a husband, the Emperor, and were as close as sisters if not more so, and now they were going to visit their family on Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyoko lounged in her bedroom, though in actuality it was a ceiling beam, a copy of shoujo manga that she had borrowed from Tenchi\u2019s father\u2019s library, and a cup of sake in the other. She was trying to take her mind off of the absence of the boy she loved, and had just began to enjoy herself when the doorbell chimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRyoko could you answer the door?\u201d called Sasami from the kitchen. The young girl with twin pigtails was currently diligently preparing dinner for her mothers\u2019 arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether it was due to the slight buzz she had going from the amount of alcohol she had consumed, or the feeling of dejection from Tenchi being away, Ryoko had apparently forgotten who their visitors were. Either way, she regretted her memory lapse a few seconds after she opened the door and was bowled over by a hug tackle from Sasami\u2019s mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSasami!\u201d cried Misaki happily as her arms circled around Ryoko in a bone crushing hug. The air was driven out of the space pirate\u2019s lungs with horrible speed. She tried to push the overly affectionate woman away, but could not even loosen what was now technically a choke hold even a bit. Luckily, the actual Sasami joined the three in the foyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMama!\u201d Sasami called as she opened her arms ready to receive the inevitable, all consuming hug that was coming her way. Ryoko was casually thrown into the wall by the Juraian royal who darted towards her youngest daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026she has to be doing this on purpose\u2026\u201d grumbled the former space pirate, still pressed to the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot even I can say for sure if she is or not,\u201d Funaho replied as she went further inside the house, following Misaki and Sasami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m almost finished with dinner, so for now we can get your things placed into the guest bedroom. Please follow me.\u201d Sasami happily stated, playing the hostess perfectly. The two followed behind, letting the precious girl show them to their room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your room for the tonight.\" Sasami declared proudly as she ushered them inside. The happiness radiated off her as if she was alight with it, brightening the room. She twirled about as she brought her mothers inside, giving them each one last hug. \"I need to finish setting up for dinner. I'll call you when its ready, so please get comfortable.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasami practically skipped from the room, leaving the two empresses to their own devices while they unpacked a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a good girl,\" Misaki chuckled, a sentiment shared by Funaho, who shared in the laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I shudder to think how the rest of them would fare without her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a small flash of light, their luggage was transported down from the ship. A pair of intricately designed bags made out of the material more durable than anything their host planet was capable of producing faded into existence on the floor beside them. Chances were they could survive re-entry from upper orbit, hit the ground, and have nothing more than little bit of dirt on them to show for it. Misaki grabbed her bag, always eager to get started, and began searching it for the essentials for the night. Funaho, however, decided to go and greet the other occupants of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misaki, I'm going to go say hello to everyone. Why don't you finish unpacking and join me after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Is there anything you want me to fetch from your bag?\" Misaki asked, and got a polite no from her co-wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Funaho slipped out of the room, the energetic woman dug out her night gown and moved to place it on the bare dresser. As she did, her eyes caught sight of something tucked in the corner, where the furnishing met the wall. She leaned in to take a closer look, and saw what appeared to be a toy of some sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, she reached down and picked it up before heading over to the bed to examine her discovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down, Misaki looked at the figure. It was clad in a slim, form fitting orange tracksuit outfit with black on the upper shoulders area and the color extending from around the neck and shoulders, down the front and sleeves, as well as around the waist, a white swirl on the left side, a red swirl crest on the back, orange pants, it's feet were covered by black sandals that covered the instep and ankles, yet left the toes and heels exposed.covering it's head was short, blond hair that stood up all over like the spines of a sea urchin, and a black headband with a metal plate attached to it that had the symbol of a spiral arrow engraved into it. It had some bandages on his thigh and a carrying case along with it and a small pouch on the back of the belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquinting, the second empress of the planet Jurai was able to make out small, pencil-thin whisker-like markings on the face, three per cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How cute! And it even feels real!\" Masaki smiled. She started twitching the figure's limbs, delighted when it moved. \"It's poseable, too! Oh, this is just covering all bases, isn't it?\" she gushed to herself. Continuing to manipulate the toy's body, she smiled, amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the doll up to her face as it dangled between her forefinger and thumb, the woman perked up as a thought struck her and she beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...I know just what to do with you, little dolly! You're coming home with Jurai with me! You'll love it there. I'll make sure you get loved on for the rest of your days, and I'll keep you with me forever for always and always and always till the end of time as my property!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat decided, Misaki grabbed her luggage and opened it, \"In you go, my darling dolly! You'll be nice and comfy-cozy in here. Now don't worry...mommy will take you out and love you to bits on the way back home. Now...time to tuck you in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Misaki brought the doll to her lips and kissed it before placing it in with her belongings.\"Oh! You're so cute! I'm going to keep you no matter what!\" That said, the royal closed her bag, trapping her prize within it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was hours later when Naruto awoke from his deep slumber. The rest had done him some good, as he felt his normal level of energy return and was eager to continue his exploration. He opened his eyes and was greeted by absolute darkness, unable to see more than a few inches in front of his face. Carefully, he rose to his feet, and immediately noticed that he was no longer in the spot where he had fallen asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell? Where am I now?\" He asked aloud to no one. After allowing his eyes to adjust it became very apparent that he now had a new problem to deal with. Now that he was able to see, his surroundings came into view, and they appeared to be neatly folded clothes, some of which Sakura would deck him for looking at. \"Well...shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he took a moment to keep himself from completely freaking out, Naruto squared his shoulders and followed his training. First, he had to find an exit, if there was one, and if not he would make one. With this mindset, he began to climb over the mountain of clothes that spread out before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisaki and Funaho returned to their provided room, bellies full as well as their spirits. Talking with the women of the Masaki home was always uplifting, especially since they got to spend time with Sasami and Ayeka. They had spent the the last eight hours catching up and enjoying quality time with their daughters and friends which had left them pleasantly tired and ready for bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second empress of Jurai began to disrobe, exposing her perfectly toned body to slight chill of the night air. Her body was not that of a model, but rather closer to an athlete's, with shapely legs and flat stomach that had just a hint of muscle, an appropriate body for the person who was considered one of the strongest fighters on Jurai. With a casual grace, she slipped into her night clothes before heading towards the bedding prepared for her so graciously by her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping under the covers of her futon, Misaki was soon joined by Funaho as she got into her own bed. It was regrettable that they could only spend the night and nothing more due to their busy schedules. That thought brought about a melancholy in her, but that was soon dispelled with the creak of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasami entered, a pillow in her arms and Ryo-Ohki on her shoulder, and asked to join them for the night. A request that was fulfilled without question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some exploration, Naruto came to the conclusion that he was now trapped inside a piece of baggage. His attempts to find a way to leave had turned up nothing, to his frustration. Even worse was the fact that when he found the boundary wall and tried to make his own way out proved to be a fools errand. No matter what he through at it the material held without so much as a scratch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Dammit! I need to get out of here and find a way home!' Naruto brooded, his eyes narrowed and hands clenched into fists as his last kunai chipped against the impossible strong wall. Exhausted, Naruto slumped into one of the pieces of clothing and chose to conserve what remained of his energy while he thought up a new plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could tell that he something was outside his current prison from the muffled noises that seeped through. Besides that, the only sounds he heard were that of his own heartbeat and breathing, which soon lulled his weary mind to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning arrived soon, and with it came the time for Misaki and Funaho's departure. The former gave a teary eyed goodbye to them, Sasami almost needing to be pried free of her mother's arms. As the group of women waved goodbye, the two empresses were transported aboard their ride home and departed towards space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the two were back in the residential area of the ship, Misaki split from Funaho, and went to her lodgings. While it was always sad to part from her beloved daughters, she at least had the cute souvenir she had grabbed during her visit. She went to her luggage and reached a hand in to grab it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a locking mechanism coming undone awoke Naruto from is frustrated slumber. He opened his eyes, only to be met with a blinding light from above. Bracing himself, he used a hand to shade his vision, and caught a glimpse of what was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'SHIT!' he screamed mentally, biting his tongue to keep from screaming and giving his location away to the giant outside. He shot to his feet as quickly as possible and tried to move away from the probing appendage. It closed in on him fast, but he managed to dodge the first grab by whiskers margin. His landing, however, was not so lucky, as he slipped on a piece of loose fabric and flopped onto his face just as the hand made another pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant fingers clasped him by the thigh, and began to haul him out of the bag. On reflex, Naruto tried to push against the grip keeping him trapped, and regretted it immediately after, as the speed that he moving went from careful to lightening quick, and he then found himself before a pair of ruby pink eyes.</span></div></div>",

His stomach lurched as she made a sharp turn and hopped over to a desk. Naruto was dropped onto the hard wooden surface were he sprawled out spread eagle. Panic raced through him as the giant eyes bore into him. The only thing he could do was try to play dead and hope she thought it was her imagination and he was just a toy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was an effort that failed as soon as he tried. The giantess gave him one hard prod with her finger with enough force that it felt like Sakura had gut punched him. His reflexes one again betrayed him as he double over with an audible grunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess your not a toy after all,\" said the woman as she began to prod him again, lighter this time. \"Little one, I am Misaki Masaki Jurai, and you have much to answer me about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes darted back and forth, in search of any escape route he could find, but only found all options blocked by the imposingly massive woman who sat before him. A pair of hands were within easy grabbing distance, so even if he tried to get away it would only end in recapture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, little man, I have some very pressing questions to ask you,\" the giant blue-haired beauty asked, her eyes narrowed as they stared down her nose at him. \"First thing I want you to tell me is who you are. Can you do that for me?\" Her intense gaze left no room for refusal, and the ninja boy complied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...uh...I'm Naruto Uzumaki...ma'am...\" he managed to squeak out as he flinched back from the glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Naruto, would you mind telling me what you were doing in my daughters' home?\" his captor asked in a sickeningly sweet voice, a voice which he had heard Sakura use many a time just before she drove him into the ground with a punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know it was! I don't even know how I got there! Honest!\" Naruto cried out as loudly as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a hard time believing that someone of your size just randomly shows up at the place where two princesses of Jurai are living. Now you are going to tell me the truth. Do you have accomplices? Were you sent there to case the house in a kidnapping attempt?\" the giant woman pressed only for Naruto's denials to be met with more skepticism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we will have to take this a step further,\" she said ominously as she reached into a drawer and pulled something from it. She brought it down towards Naruto, and he shivered. It was a giant feather, and he knew exactly what it was going to be used for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later, he was laughing uncontrollably as he answered her questions. Now he could only hope that she would believe him.</span></div></div>",

Otherwise, the tickling will continue.\" Misaki said, although she was enjoying this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did...please, I don't even know where this Jurai country even is. And seriously look at me, how could I do anything to your daughters with how small I am, if anything they're more likely just to step on me and not even notice!\" Naruto protested between his laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisaki's eyes widened when she heard Naruto between laughing, '<i>Country?! This little guy thought Jurai was a...?!</i>' Now it was Misaki who was laughing. That was too funny! She then set the feather down and let Naruto catch his breath, she was now looking him over and after a moment she placed a finger on her chin. \"Hmm...I suppose you do have a point, you are far too itty-bitty to have done anything to my daughters, after all.\" Misaki said while thinking that Naruto was telling the truth, she had even imagined that both Ayeka and Sasami literally stepping on Naruto's body and continue to walk away not even noticing that the just stepped on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sighed, relieved that this giant beauty accepted that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the two had fully calmed down from the laughter, they both relaxed and began to talk to eachother about themselves Naruto told Misaki all about his adventures and missions he went on as a ninja for Konoha, as she listened to Naruto's story Misaki had cried when she heard about Naruto's childhood Misaki had grabbed Naruto and shoved him against her cheek and nearly drowned him in her tears as she cried, Mikaski was happy for Naruto when he told her that things had gotten better for him while he was at the academy as he made friends, then he told her about the various missions he went on during his shinobi carrier, Misaki didn't like the idea of having Naruto at such a young age risk his life in some of these missions, but at the sametime she understood that it comes with the job. But that doesn't mean that she has to like it in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Naruto told her his story, Misaki began to tell him her's, Naruto was amazed to hear that Misaki has an enormous power inside her, he laughed when she told him about how she managed to outrun all of her nannies and babysitters as it reminded him of his days outrunning the jounin and even the anbu of the village when he was still an academy student, even mentioning that her nanny named Mama was the only one who was not afraid of watching over her, it made Naruto think of Iruka, who was the only chunin willing to put up with him and his pranks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was then shocked about hearing that Jurai wasn't a country but in fact a whole planet altogether and that Misaki was also one of the queens of it to boot, Naruto was also shocked to hear that Misaki has to share a single husband with another woman, but then again there were members of the village who were allowed something simalier in the village too when he thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Misaki finished telling Naruto her story Misaki then had an idea as she then gently lifted Naruto, \"Hey, I just an idea Naruto, I think that I'll show you...\"</span></div></div>",

The warmth radiating from her skin caressed him gently, soothing his previous stress away. Her grip, while firm, was still comfortable enough that he didn't feel like he was being crushed, in fact, it was like a full body hug from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are just the cutest little thing,\" she cooed, and rubbed the top of his head with a finger. She couldn't help herself, it was in her nature to smother the cute things with as much love as she could, and seeing the tiny young man in that fit in the palm of her hand was almost irresistible to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blushed at the skinship she was sharing with him, even more so when she began to calmly stroke him with her finger. It was oddly relaxing, and he had begun to release the tension in his muscles. Everything was going nicely for the two, until Misaki caught a whiff of his building body odor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Sniff...sniff*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Smells like you need a bath,\" Misaki giggled as she finally relented from cuddling, and held him before her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I haven't really had a chance to clean up since I wound up here.\" Naruto's cheeks were red, highlighting his whisker marks all the more, and earning him another nuzzle from Misaki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get you to the bath then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiding in her palm, Naruto became one of the few lucky people outside of Jurai to see the inside of a Royal Tree ship. He was shocked to find out that the beautiful, tree-filled environment was actually a spaceship, and he couldn't quite grasp the explanation he was given by his hostess. What shocked him even more was the fact that there was a hot spring equipped with all the bathing necessities, and Misaki gave him a thimble to use as a bucket so that he could wash off before entering the water. She set him down next to the spring, promised him he would be safe from danger, and turned to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto decided to accept the kind hospitality and disrobed, placing his clothes aside, where they were taken away for cleaning by the ship's systems.

Another park of him was telling the Uzumaki boy to remain silent and hope to pass himself off as a doll, lest this behemoth hold malicious intent. There was a chance he could escape as long as the giantess didn't realize he was alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Naruto was trying to play possum, or some facsimile thereof, Mihoshi continued her detailed inspection of the unidentified thing in front of her. Being a first class detective for the Galaxy Police, the wavy haired blond had possessed an almost unnatural intuition, though she may not be fully aware of it most of the time, which let her know when something was not quite right. That was when she began to get more thorough in her examination, and got a little more hands-on, in a very literal sense, as she extended her right forefinger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thick, bronze digit began to prod Naruto's midsection, forcing the air from his lungs. Thankfully he had managed to fight back his nausea moments before, but it didn't make it any less easier to keep himself from being discovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this some kind of toy Ms. Washu made?\" she asked as her finger trailed around his stomach and chest. The appendage wandered around Naruto's body aimlessly, as if she was giving trying to explore every bit of him, until it reached his crotch, where it gently stroked over his privates. He let out a noise that was part gasp, part moan, and part scream, which shattered the illusion of him being a lifeless doll into a million pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you are alive!\" came the surprised voice of the cocoa skinned giant as she brought him once more before her sparkling blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto knew he had blown it, just another reason why he was not suited for the stealthy missions like a more traditional ninja.

Looking around, Naruto's eyes widened when he looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHUH?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of the sky, Naruto saw what looked like the  ceiling of a house!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto clawed at his scalp, Naruto then noticed something off with his hands and looked at them. That lead to noticing that his outfit had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was wearing a full bodysuit that was colored black and dark green combined with the main base color being the dark green. The colors merged in some places, while splitting off in others. On his back it was all dark green but nine red lines split and roamed all over while in the middle of his back between his shoulders was a mandala comprised of nine reddish-brown circles of varying sizes atop a larger green-grey circle , before somehow all nine or the red brown lines made it to his legs. He had on black tabi shoes made for Parkour and Freerunning, as black gloves, both the shoes and gloves were seamlessly made as part of the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk...how the HELL did this happen?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto as the forest of spiky cyan things shifted suddenly and he fell over before it stopped suddenly and Naruto went wide-eyed.

Rushing north, Naruto froze as what he saw as the forest he was on abruptly ended..and that the cyan things were no forest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was on the top of a woman's head! But she wasn't just any woman, he could tell. She had power, a lot of it, and that kinda scared him. But then he looked past that and saw a woman that blew Sakura out of the park, hell, the damn whole stadium and beyond. She wore a pink dress that was over a green kimono top. In a way, it resembled something he saw that Tenten girl wore. He could tell it was a dress that was for battle as well as everyday uses. But what got him was her unique hair, spiked backwards, cyan in color. Her ears almost like an elf, if he remembered the description of their ears, only it was rounded at the end. Her face was really beautiful and her eyes were yellow in color. When he squinted his eyes to look closer, he saw they were slitted, much like a cat's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was looking in a mirror and that also caused Naruto to catch sight of himself. His fingernails had become sharp, pointed claws on both his hands. His lips were jet black in color, while as for his hair, it was in spikes that stuck up in every direction like the spines of a sea urchin and was dark purple in color. His canines were longer and sharper, making them fangs. His eye shape was more vulpine than normal and had dark circles under his eyes, his eyes themselves were bright crimson red with an animistic black slit for the pupil. His ears were tempered and pointed like those of an elf ever so slightly. And as a final touch, his whisker marks had widened and become more defined and pronounced, widening and darkening until they resembled feral-looking abysmal scars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis jaw dropped and he went red in the face. WHO was THIS?! And what the HELL HAD HAPPENED TO HIM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was brought out of his musings as a shadow fell over him and he looked over his shoulder and gasped to see a giant hand coming at him. Yelping, Naruto jumped off  and landed on the woman's shoulder. Thanking that it was so puffy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Naruto heard a pretty, if loud, voice say. Seemed the woman had noticed him so Naruto leapt down and landed on the couch of the gigantic home. Best to AVOID being mistaken as a bug, after all. He wasn't ready to die...and being stepped on or smashed with a magazine or something was way too embarrassing a way to go. Looking around, he knew he had to get someone's attention and help. If not, he knew he was in trouble...that much was obvious. Using chakra, Naruto walked down the couch and leapt lightly to the floor once he was close enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk...where to go now? Naruto needed to explore this place and avoid any giants and/or giantesses that were around...find out where he was and how he'd gotten here. Most importantly, finding out how he'd shrunk and (hopefully) find a way back to normal!</span></div></div>",

It needed to be to properly fly and use her powers, as many factors had to be taken into account when using them.  As such, the feeling of Naruto's hands and feet on her scalp and hair alerted the alien powerhouse to his presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the feeling moved from her head to her shoulder, her hand followed.  When when whatever it was fell from her, Ryoko turned to see what had been on her body.  Seeing that the couch was directly behind her, in the direction she felt the mystery thing slide in, she noticed a small, moving form on one of the seat cushions.  She leaned forward to take a closer look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Ryoko thought it was some sort of strange Earth bug, but then she noticed that it only had four limbs and appeared to be wearing some type of clothing.  If she didn't know better, she would swear it was a tiny human, and that peaked her interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well,\" she began, her natural mischievousness surfacing, \"what do we have here?\"  Her hand descended down to capture him.  Her thumb and forefinger pinched him around his waist, and Naruto soon found himself face to giant face with the woman he had previously been standing on.  \"What were you doing messing up my hair, little guy?\" she said in a playfully manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of her giant fingers poked Naruto stiffly in the stomach, forcing the air from his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you're kind of cute, and I am bored without Tenchi around.

Looking up at this woman and hearing what she said, he instantly started to struggle, he didn't want to find out what this woman meant by 'playing'!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, something caught the woman's attention as a door suddenly burst open and a redhead rushed into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Washu!?\" Ryoko shouted, \"What's the deal?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red-headed genius stopped and turned to Ryoko, looking so excited that she seemed like she explode from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dimension spanner! I knew I made device to allow the user to open gates to other worlds. But THIS?! Something actually came THROUGH! Something from another dimension! WHERE IS IT?! I NEED to study it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyoko went pale at that. Washu, while undeniably brilliant, had a tendency to go overboard when she was conducting experiments. No telling what would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...what are you looking for and how do you intend to find it?\" Ryoko asked. <i>'I want to be far away when you do find this...whatever-it-is!'</i> the semi-reformed space pirate thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWashu held up a hand-held device in her hand, beaming.  \"This scanner picks up on space-time radiation, so whatever came from that other dimension must be glowing with it since it passed from one reality to another! As for what I'm looking for, I don't know yet! That's part of what makes it so exciting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Washu's scanner went nuts beeping and lighting up. Washu held it to her nose, eyes shining. \"It's close! I'm practically on top of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyoko backed up, gulping. Ground zero was right there in the room with them?! But what could be that crazy...even with what NORMALLY happened in the Masaki household!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, seeing the two admittedly attractive ladies talking with one another, decided to put this distraction...as well as his fangs...to use. He was gonna pay for this later, but found it hard to care just then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCHOMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEOW!\" Ryoko shouted, letting him go and waving her hand that he'd just bitten, damn little bastard had a good set of chompers for such a small guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was surprised when, rather than dropping to the ground after the Cyan-head had released him, he was actually hovering in mid-air at the height of where he was being held at before. \"What in the hell...?!\" he shouted. Then noticed his error: he'd drawn the attention of both the giant beauties to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWashu looked first at the strange incest, then her scanner and back again a few times. \"BINGO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwiping at it, she firmly grasped it in her hand and rushed back into her inter-dimensional laboratory in the closet of the Masaki house, leaving Ryoko standing there, gawking. No way...that little guy was who Washu was after? As mad as she was over the bite, he must've panicked at the thought of being Washu's guinea pig and wanted to get away from her...ANYONE could understand that! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\nInside her lab, Washu was ecstatic as she looked at the pinned-down being, tapped in a spread-eagle fashion to a dissection pan. She'd already used a magnification device to expose he was a human-like being wearing a full bodysuit that was colored black and dark green combined with the main base color being the dark green. The colors merged in some places, while splitting off in others. On his back it was all dark green but nine red lines split and roamed all over while in the middle of his back between his shoulders was a mandala comprised of nine reddish-brown circles of varying sizes atop a larger green-grey circle , before somehow all nine or the red brown lines made it to his legs. He had on black tabi shoes made for Parkour and Freerunning, as black gloves, both the shoes and gloves were seamlessly made as part of the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fingernails under the suit were sharp, pointed claws on both his hands. His lips were jet black in color, while as for his hair, it was in spikes that stuck up in every direction like the spines of a sea urchin and was dark plum in color. His canines were longer and sharper, making them fangs. His eye shape was vulpine and had dark circles under his eyes, his eyes themselves were bright crimson red with an animistic black slit for the pupil. His ears were tempered and pointed like those of an elf ever so slightly. And as a final touch, he had defined and pronounced, widened and darkened feral-looking abysmal scars on his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter running an initial scan on him, Washu discovered he had a set of pathways similar to a blood circulation system going through his body that was transmitting energy throughout his body and a secondary, crimson energy was focused on where his navel was, and was seemingly in the process of merging with the blue energy in her subject's body. Also, it seemed that being exposed to Ryoko after the dimensional transportation had caused the residual dimensional radiation to mix with Ryoko's own energy and that in turn bonded with his cells and granted him powers like Ryoko had, as well as using her connection to the gems on the Tenchi-kin sword to also grant him the powers or the Juraian  master key, such as the ability to control most royal tree-ships and call upon the power of the Light Hawk Wings. And all of that added onto what he could already do! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all so fascinating! Washu couldn't decide what experiment to conduct on him first!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shuttered as Washu's face came much, much closer to him. As soon as she stopped, it was like her face had become the sky to him. She was well over a mile long to him, and her face itself was bigger than two football stadiums put together. She grinned at him as her face loomed over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry...I'll try hard not to conduct anything on you that might kill you. You're the first chance to study a being from another reality that I've ever had!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto went pale and started to struggle fruitlessly at that. He didn't want to be some labrat!</span></div></div>",

She had secured her lab and made it impossible for any outsider to enter without her consent, phasing ability or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started with the basic tests, taking measurements on his size.  He was only around three inches tall relative to her.  He was clearly humanoid, but the size scale he was at was vastly different than her own dimension's.  It was here goal to see if this difference in size would lead to any major differences in his physiology.  Was his skeleton the same?  Were his muscles denser?  She had to know!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, various sensors and wires were attached to the young ninja's body, and every move he made was monitored and recorded for later analysis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fascinating!\" Washu exclaimed, her fingers racing across multiple keyboards as more and more information poured into her database.  Each bit of data was cataloged and archived for later reference, while the more pertinent data was examined immediately.  Soon, the genius scientist and number one mind in the galaxy had almost all that she needed to go on to draw some conclusions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really are quite fascinating, my little guinea pig.  While your body is very similar to what a human body would be if it was scaled down to your size, there are some key differences.  Specifically, your internal energy network is something I would love to get a better reading on, but that can wait for later.\"  Washu advanced through the presented data, when a certain piece of information caught her eye.  \"Huh,\" she said, before a smile broke out onto her face, \"it seems that there have been some residual effects of the dimensional travel.  It appears that due to some of the unique energies created by the dimension spanner have caused your physical form to become rather indestructible.  You could be run over by a car, and would walk away fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto wasn't quite aware of what was being said, his attention was still on the fact that he was staring at a woman who's foot towered over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, putting that aside, I think it's time to get on with the examination,\" Washu stated with glee.</span></div></div>",

It looked so simple, but when it comes to Washu, it's much more than simple...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like it my little guinea pig? This is a dimensional growth machine! this machine is 100% guaranteed to make you into your correct height by your universe's standards, but only in our universe's standards and it can even go in reverse! I'm an absolute genius!!!!\", Washu said with pride clear in her voice, until she saw smoke literally coming from Naruto's ears and he had swirls in his eyes as he was trying to understand the words that came out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud sigh, Washu then held Naruto closer to her face, \"I put you inside this machine and you grow...\", Washu said with a strained tone in her voice as she also had a face that clearly said that Naruto can <b>NOT</b> be this clueless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding just to start the machine, Washu then places Naruto onto the \"Entrance\" side of the machine Washu then went to the middle of the machine and began typing in the codes for the machine to get started and when she finished, Washu looked at the tiny Uzumaki, \"This is it my little guinea pig... Are you ready?\", Washu asked Naruto, but not waiting for his answer Washu then finished entering the code for the machine to start the process and she was just about to press the button to start the machine and as she pressed the button the machine activated as she watched the treadmill take Naruto into the metallic box chamber and began it's job and just when the middle part was about halfway done Washu waited on the other side eager to see the result until...</span></div></div>",

The ground shook and a series of vibrating booms traveled through the ground and knocked him flat on his back, leaving him shocked as a giant person stopped in front of him. Making his eyes widen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was young woman that appeared to be in her late teens, same as him, with light skin, blue-green eyes and a buxom figure. Her most distinctive feature was her long, crimson red hair that reached down to her thighs, with a single hair strand,  an ahoge, sticking out from the top. Her hair also had loose bangs covering her forehead and side bangs framing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wore an outfit which consisted of a white long-sleeved, button-down shirt with a black ribbon on her shirt collar worn under a black shoulder cape and a matching button-down corset, a magenta skirt with white accents, and brown dress shoes over white crew-length socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto felt his jaw drop and heat flooded his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere he was at...he didn't know how small...with a VERY attractive  girl in front of him. What was better (or worse) was that she was a redhead!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurse his father's blood! If that theory of guys liking women who were similar to their mothers was true, it would easily explain why he had a weakness for redheaded women!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only that, but looking at her, Naruto felt Kurama's chakra inside him start to stir...like this girl's presence was causing a reaction.  But why? How? He didn't understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked around her like she was looking for something, frowning with a troubled expression on her face. She sighed, tucking her chin to her collar with her eyes shut. When she opened them, she had yet to raise her head, as they opened, they seemed to lock onto the different color he presented--a small blot of orange and black topped with bright yellow--against the green of the grass around him and her eyes widened, then it turned to a look of shock mixed in with as if she were thinking of a million things at once. Carefully kneeling down onto her hands and knees, she brought her face close to him. Naruto shuddered involuntarily, finding it frightening that he could see his whole body reflected in those blue-green eyes of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe  noticed that, and reached a hand towards him, palm up. She stopped short of actually touching him, though. It took a few moments  She was letting him have a choice as to pick if she was going to hold him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sighed, letting out a shaky breath of relief he hadn't know he had been holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding that if she were like this, he might get some answers and PRAYING that this wasn't a mistake, the orange-and-black wearing, reduced blond tentatively pulled himself up onto the girl's hand and moved until he was in the center of her palm before sitting down. Cupping her fingers to guard him from the kinetic energy-generated wind that happened as a result, she stood up, looking at Naruto as she brought her hand to her face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there.\" she said softly, keeping her voice down so her voice wouldn't hurt his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto waved, smiling nervously. So far, so good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm Rias Gremory.\" she said, smiling kindly, yet her eyes still held a spark of curiosity as she studied him. \"What's your name?\" she asked him, then brought the hand he was in over to her ear, brushing her long hair behind it so it wouldn't get in his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked, taken aback. Well...looked like he lucked out, being found by this Rias girl. But why was she acting this way? Far as he could tell, she was a civilian. Since when did civvies react like THIS? He walked over and stopped right at the threshold to the crimson-headed female's auditory system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...My name's Naruto Uzumaki. Uh...thanks for being nice about this and not freaking out...but why are you taking this so well?\" he asked, his voice echoing through the fleshy cavern, \"Er...not that I'm complaining or anything! It's just...you act like you're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use to seeing things like this?\" Rias supplied helpfully, finishing what he was going to say. \"That's because I am. Small size isn't the weirdest thing I've ever seen. When I noticed the  summoning circle, I came to investigate. You see, this place--this whole area--is the Gremory family territory, roughly 1300 kilometers long and ranges from 50 to 230 kilometres wide, and its total area is 230,500  kilometers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's jaw dropped, \"Damn...\" he said at last, impressed. So this girl was a noble from the sound of it, considering how much land her family had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias laughed, \"I can tell you're surprised. Now...what happened? Who summoned you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sputtered at that. Stunned. \"So...so...summoned me?! What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't know you were summoned?\" Rias said, frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Naruto shook his head, \"No, I was just minding my own business at my apartment on my day off,  nearly bored to death from having too much time on my hands and nothing to do with it, then this glowing green portal or whatever opens up beneath me, I get sucked in into it, and the next thing I know, I end up here in the land of the giants!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias brought her hand back in front of her face, studying the one on it...Naruto, he'd said his name was...with a thoughtful frown. Land of the giants? Portal must have done something to shrink him if he was making a comment like that. And an unnotified summoning? That was troubling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blotched summon shrank you...Two inches tall from the looks of you...\" she murmured, eyeing him.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" Naruto shouted, his legs giving out beneath him and he fell down onto the warm skin under him. Rias raised an eyebrow. Impressive set of lungs. This close to her face or no, she'd heard that as if he was his normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was brought out of his shock as he lightly pet him on the head, pushing his spiky locks down. Looking up, he saw Rias was the one doing it with her soft, smooth, fingers. Her eyes and expression was sympathetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, you're safe now. I'll help you and we'll find out what happened and how to fix things.\"  she said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sighed, feeling he could trust this girl. Besides, he NEEDED help right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll trust you,Rias,\" he said, \"one last question though: how do you know all this stuff, no offense, but you don't look the type.\" Naruto said, she didn't seem to be a kunoichi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar from being offended, the redhead smiled, \"That's easy,\" Rias said, walking away with Naruto in her hand. \"I'm a devil, can't you tell?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto paled. SAY WHAT?!</span></div></div>",

He took a step back, awed by the sheer size of the almost human creature who was so large he was absolutely insignificant in comparison. This was a dangerous situation, especially when he considered all the other times he came upon giant beasts. He could be eaten, crushed, or made into some kind of toy if he wasn't careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA comparatively loud groan from the sleeping woman put him on edge, and when its body began to shift, sending tremors along the bed, and he worried it was about to awaken.

If her appearance was anything to go on, there was a chance he may be found before he was ready. The sniffing deepened, and her eyes narrowed in thought.

The darkness transformed into a painful shade of pink, and the spiraling nexus of black changed into a heart shape, with little bubbly hearts popping up everywhere. It was sickening to look at, and it made Naruto crave for the darkness he had been in to return once more. Luckily enough for the ninja it was not long before he was sent flying out of the neon pink nightmare and into his destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwin orbs of warm softness proved to be a suitable landing spot for the ninja, though the owner of said padding may prove to be a problem for him.</span></div></div>",

With a grunt, he tried to dig himself free, having sunk far into the mystery ground. It wasn't easy going, as each bit of progress was met with a small slip and he would have to get back to where he had been, but his salvation finally came in the form of a tremendously large gloved hand, which picked him up and removed him from his predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? What's this?\" a somewhat cute sounding voice said as he was lifted to a giant pair of eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianne de Chateau had just finished dealing some people who had offended her,  and now, in her Ribrianne form, had left for home. Following the Tournament of power, she had been filled with the need to strengthen her power of love. When she lost to the woman from Universe 7 she had taken to re-examining love and its various forms to better understand herself and why she fought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally arrived home and made a b-line for her bedroom, exhausted from her day. Not even bothering to de-transform, she flopped back onto her mattress and stared at the ceiling. She just wanted to sleep, and nothing would have stopped her from doing so if not for the sudden appearance of a swirling pink vortex of lovely hearts that dropped something directly onto her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fatty tissue of her transformed stated wobbled wildly at the sudden intrusion but settled down after some time. Ribrianne was not in the mood to deal with the unexpected, but seeing as it landed in a rather intimate spot, she had no other choice but to dive her hand in after it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she pulled free from her cleavage was a tiny man, just small enough to fit in the palm of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? What's this?\" she muttered cutely as she pulled him in for a closer look. While he could certainly be considered a cute guy, something that his size only helped, she didn't know if she could trust him or not. She had, after all, seen some strange fighters at the tournament, and even ones of stature similar to this, and this guy could just be a perv looking to feel her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey can you understand me?\" came a cry from the tiny man. \"Can you help me out?\" he asked nervously.

Her physique was near-spherically rotund and her skin was teal. She wore a sleeveless red and green dress with a very thick petticoat underneath it, yellow gloves and boots, and a rubber cap with an antenna-like protrusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...shocking...to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill...no matter how stunned he was by her appearance, Naruto NEEDED help if he was going to figure out where he was and how to get home. That fact in mind, he spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, can you understand me?\" came a cry from the tiny man. \"Can you help me out?\" he asked nervously. Then for good measure, bowed his head. But when he did that, he ended up looking down at where he had been fished out of. Seeing where he'd been located, he went red before paling rapidly. OH CRAP! He was in trouble! He'd landed between her breasts?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing him sputter out apology after apology to her, Ribrianne rolled her eyes and had to lightly squeeze him to make him stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're really sorry, how and why did you end up there?\" She frowned. She was fully prepared to punish him if he was a pervert, but his reaction didn't seem like one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Experimenting with one of my techniques and it backfired...sent me here...<b>I'msoSORRY!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRibrianne blinked, then nodded. That made some sense, would explain the sudden appearance of the swirling pink vortex of lovely hearts that dropped him here, at least. She knew about transportation-based abilities like Instant Transmission being out there, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you are...?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right...sorry...I'm Naruto Uzumaki.\" he said, recalling it was polite to give your name before asking someone else's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding while de-powering to her base form of Brianne de Chateau, she saw the little one's eyes widen as she became a slender young human woman with shoulder length green hair with an orange hairband with two pink gems with a white case outlining them on both ends and a pink dress with a white collar. She also wore a white belt, black leggings, and pink high heel shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Brianne de Chateau, but I also go by Ribrianne. Nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stared with as the giant woman introduced herself. The sight of her...transformation...was certainly odd. He had never seen pink heart-shaped energy and the gap between her current form and what she had looked like before was not something he would soon forget, but that was just another reason he had to get as much information as he could from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was with that transformation? Which one is your normal form? Do you have other powers?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can transform into a magical girl who can draw power from the love of others. This,\" she indicated her current state, \"would be my normal form, but I can change into that super powered beauty you saw before. I can also gather the love of others, and with enough of it I can change to an even more powerful form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Naruto declared as he still wondered if 'beautiful' was the proper term for her other form, but he'd heard the saying beauty was in the eye of the beholder, \"you must be incredibly powerful in that state.\" He complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used to think that too before the Tournament,\" Brianne muttered sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tournament? What kinda tournament?\" Naruto asked as he noticed the drop in her mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Tournament of Power! It was a giant multi-universal battle royal that pitted our universe's best fighters against those of the other universes. It was there that I discovered the limits of what I thought to be the power of love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" the little ninja pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianne divulged the details of her final stint in the tournament against the blonde woman from Universe 7. How that one fighter's love for her husband overpowered the love she had received from her entire team, and how it had caused her to question herself. It was a lot to absorb for the tiny ninja, as he was already having trouble with the fact that he was in a different world, let alone that were multiple universes that coexisted with it, but he did not let that deter him from lending an ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how about you?\" Brianne asked after she finished her tale. \"What is your home like? What about your parents?\" The second question caused Naruto to flinch, a reaction that Brianne did not miss. \"Is something wrong?\" she questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because of some...issues...during my birth, I lost both my mom and my dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, the maiden gasped, struck with the horrific realization that he was orphaned at a young age. \"I'm sorry!\" Brianne cried, truly apologetic that she had no doubt drawn up some deeply traumatic memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto merely shrugged, \"You didn't know and besides, I made my peace with it. I didn't have the best of childhoods, but it shaped me into who I am. Plus I know that my parents truly loved me to their dying breath, and that's all I need to know. I didn't have the best of childhoods. Growing up people would either treat me like I didn't exist or like I was some nuisance that they had to deal with, because they had no choice. Nobody told me why and whenever I asked the leader of our village why, he'd just dodge the question, telling me they needed time.\" Naruto said. Just because he had come to terms with his past didn't make it any less shitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the green haired girl could only feel both anger and sadness. Anger that not only was someone treated like he didn't and shouldn't exist, but equally angry that no one told him why. To just leave him, a child no less, in the dark like that was cruel. It was for those same reasons she was saddened, to hear how a child was left alone. Nobody to care for him, nobody to tell him he was loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't abused, psychically at least. Wasn't till I was thirteen that I found out why I was treated so differently. It wasn't for another three years that I found out why no one was allowed to touch me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did raise some questions. He was never harmed physically? If others so despised his existence what stopped them from taking out their disgust and aggression on him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I turned sixteen, my godfather told me that my village's leader had ordered that no one harm me and he had an almost round the clock guard to make sure the law was carried out. At first I wondered why I needed so much protecting. Turned out my father had been our previous leader. Ironically the people had loved him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianne couldn't help the scoff of disgust that escaped her lips. To love the father, but hate the son for something no one could control was abhorrent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In my home village we had this philosophy that each of our warriors fought and died for, the belief that their sacrifices were not in vain. Our leader, the Hokage, was supposed to be the epitome of it, they were to see the entire village as one big family. Growing up I always wanted was a family and what better family could you have than your entire home village?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianne smiled. He had aspired to become the leader of his home, not out of an attempt for power or authority, but because he wanted to have a family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But my godfather taught me a different part to the ideals. He believed that not only could it make Konoha safe, but that through loving others, peace would be possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Brianne felt herself choke up. Naruto...he treated his friends as family. He always looked on the bright side. His heart...the way it burned with love and sheer will...this was someone who had seen and done a lot, but still held tightly to his convictions and knew who he was as an individual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was truly beautiful! Before she could think, she slammed Naruto against her chest in a hug that nearly made him black out. Naruto would have lost consciousness completely if the young woman hadn't released him from the swell of her breasts. A realization had dawned on her, which she immediately made known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about where you're going to stay? We can't just let you go out at that size, you could be crushed, or eaten! We need to find you a safe place to live!\" Brianne ranted as she gazed at him before worryingly rubbing him against her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm open to ideas,\" stuttered Naruto as he tried to push away from her face. He did see her point, he couldn't exactly go anywhere when he was the size of a child's toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maiden thought for a few moments, silent as she worked through the problem. It wasn't long before she reached a conclusion. Setting the little shinobi down on her bed, Brianne rushed over to her closet and began to dig furiously for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had an obscured view, as his sight was mostly blocked by the giant girl's bubbly ass, which wiggled teasingly as she sorted through her stuff. A pile of boxes, bags, and clothes built up behind her by the time Brianne pulled free what she had been looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found it!\" she declared happily as she stepped back from her closet. Taking out an old dollhouse, Brianne opened it up. \"This is perfect. I already have all the necessary furniture, and the bed even has a tiny pillow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set the dollhouse down on the table beside her bed, and once her hands were free, she plucked Naruto up and cuddled him into her chest once more. After taking a moment longer to enjoy it, she deposited Naruto into the bedroom, before closing up the front of the old plaything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto yelped as he turned to see that obscuring the window's view was a gigantic eyeball that was as big as his entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianne smiled as she looked at the little cutie. Come to think of it, since she and her friends Rozie and Kakunsa based their team off the magical girl genre, then not only would Naruto make a great boyfriend for Brianne herself, but with how cute he was, he'd be a perfect little pet/mascot for the Love Maiden Trio!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to your new home! You'll learn to <i><u><b>LOVE</b></u></i> it here!\"</span></div></div>",

Perhaps a little training session was what he needed, and besides, she was curious to see his fighting style anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince we have you set up with a place to stay here, why don\u2019t we get some exercise with a friendly spar?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stared into the gleeful eyes of his new caretaker, and gave an exaggerated nod so that she could see it. Getting back to something as simple as trading blows with another fighter would allow him to work through his frustration, even if it didn\u2019t really solve anything immediately. He gave a slightly enthusiastic thumbs up, and was led to the middle of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that the miniature fighter wouldn\u2019t need much space to fight, as anything bigger than the room they currently occupied would be too much space for him to cover. The transforming young woman placed her charge on the floor gently and backed away about a foot before going through her change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, the rotund form of Ribrianne stood before him, a smile on her face, and her fists clenched eagerly. The small ninja gathered his strength, and prepared to charge forward towards his new training partner. His opponent lifted a gloved hand over her head, and after a short pause, swiped it down quickly to signal the start of their match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny ninja surged forward like he was shot from a cannon, aimed at a target that was impossible to miss, he reared back his hand to strike his first haymaker at the transformed young woman. With a mighty leap, Naruto propelled himself at the midsection of Ribrianne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her new housemate dashed towards her, Ribrianne stood defiantly, ready to take his first blow. It was unlikely that he could do too much damage with just a punch, especially due to the size difference, so this training match would be more about precision for her, as a tiny moving target would prove much more difficult to hit. Once his jump had reached its zenith, the rotund magical girl squared up and went to meet is fist with her stomach. It quickly proved to be an uneven match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto\u2019s fist impacted the wall of fat like a mortar shell, only to sink into the yielding flesh before it rebounded and sent him sprawling across the floor like a marionette with its strings cut. The breath had been driven out of him, but he forced himself back to his feet in time to see the momentary expression of smugness on Ribrianne\u2019s face as she showed him just how little his attack had affected her, giving her belly a mocking slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his initial failed attack, the ninja, still determined, reset his stance and prepared for his next move. Steeling his muscles with as much power as he could he charged forward once more, with a kick more powerful than his previous attack. This time, he would not simply be bounced back, and he was right, as his attack landed, and darkness engulfed him, and he found himself unable to move.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A sigh was heard from an unusual-looking woman as she looked through a glass orb as<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had long white hair, light blue skin, and purple eyes. The left side of her hair was longer than the other and hung in front of her chest. She had a golden ring hair accessory on the left side of her hair. She wore gold earrings that had a purple peril-like jewel dangling from them. She was also dressed in a red and black skin tight body suit that had a v-shaped hole around her stomach, and wass missing the bottom half, exposing the bottom of her breasts. She wore a a white open leg cape that was jagged at the bottom, and red and black high heels. Added onto all that, she carried a brown staff that had two golden points on each side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowa sighed as she beheld the image in the orb: A young man, no older than thirteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his head was short, blond hair that stood up all over like the spines of a sea urchin, and on his face were three pencil-thin, groove-like markings that resembled whiskers on each cheek for a total of six of them. His eyes were a deep soulful blue that would be the envy of any sapphire, and had lightly tanned skin due to the amount of time he trained outdoors. He wore a tracksuit that consisted of orange pants and an orange shirt that had blue near the shoulders and was white at the neck, on the back of the jacket he wore was a red spiral symbol, He had some bandages on his thigh and a carrying case for what she guessed could be throwing knives. He also wore a small pouch on his belt, and blue sandals that left his toes and heels exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd first come across him when examining other dimentions for powerful demonic energies. At first she'd been baffled by it, him, and there were still so many questions, but she'd long since declared them irrelevant. They didn't matter. What did matter however, was the end result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere was someone who'd once been nothing. The weakest of all. Yet through sheer strength and perseverance, he'd risen through the ranks to prove even the greatest fighters wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just needed a push.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was on the cusp of becoming something great. Something more, something...glorious. She wasn't sure what, the prospect excited her regardless. She'd peered into the darkest depths of his heart and seen the beast within. He might pretend to be good and pure, he might even fool himself into thinking that he was, but the truth was known to her. His true nature betrayed him. He'd been born into an era of war and strife, and even after his trip to that waterfall, that darkness hadn't diminished. That he held it at bay through sheer force of will was something to applaud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Mira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all his strength and fortitude, her creation didn't seem to understand his limitations, what he was missing. He might be one of the strongest beings to exist, but he lacked something, a key component that other fighters did not. An iron will. Spirit. A soul. He did not have a goal to strive toward beyond becoming stronger. He did not possess that indomitable drive, that sheer force of being that would make others-allies and enemies alike!-follow him to the ends of the universe. All he had was power. Nothing else. And why should he? A fighter was all she'd meant him to be, and perhaps she'd made him too well. Yes, he still had his uses for now and his strength was necessary to achieve her goals, but then what? His infatuation and blatant jealousy were beginning to become bothersome. She would need to be rid of him, and soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat one, however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would truly become something glorious. Not just a pawn, or even an ally. But a partner. He utterly facinated her.  This power, if nurtured properly, could bring the very universe to its knees. And he held it back, knowingly limited his power, prevented himself from giving in for fear of what he would become? Unacceptable. He was destined for greatness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowa knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just had to acknowledge it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe a...she chuckled to herself at what she had in mind and her choice in words...\"little\" test? That would be delightful! Granted, it meant sending him into another reality, but that made it all the more fun seeing how this would play out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumming softly to herself, the sly demoness hefted her staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcentrating, she thrust it outwards, seeking him out. Sure enough she felt him there. As well as feeling, rather than seeing Mira's frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowa sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something that should have been done a long time ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTethers of ebony energy gathered at the weapon's razor tip, beading like droplets of dark water. As her brow furrowed the the ink-colored condensation began to coalesce around her, bending to her will as she forced it to do her bidding All the negative energy she'd gathered only served to strengthen the sinister spells, enhance it to its utmost limits. Reaching into the blond's pysche, she bypassed his defenses and penetrated into the very heart of his being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA single command was uttered, imperious with weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto jerked awake at the voice in his head. The first thing he was immediately aware of was something on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the...what was he wearing? Reaching up, he removed whatever it was and looked down at himself and at what he'd removed. He saw he was clad in an outfit that consisted of a white kitsune noh mask with three ringed eyes that were colored red, a dark blue-grey robe with grey lining and a fur collar, and a tattered grey-blue cape emblazoned with the emblem of a mandala comprised of nine reddish-brown circles of varying sizes atop a larger green-grey circle. Along with that was a fighter's gi that consisted of a sleeveless dark grey uwagi, a long-sleeved black undershirt with a turtleneck, a red sash, black pants, fingerless opera-length black gloves wrapped in studded red-brown leather straps, and red-brown boots that had dark red toe caps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere had these come from? For that matter, where was he? That was when he took onte of his surroundings and Naruto's jaw dropped like it weighed a metricton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHY THE HELL WAS EVERYTHING SO DAMN HUGE?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompaired to everything around him, he was only an inch high! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later, something slammed into the ground near him, resulting in a crater, his body responded to the sight and flung himself backwards all the same. His feet did not touch the ground. Much to his disbelief, he found himself floating, in midair, completely off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell am I flying?!\" Naruto sqwaked in surprise. No sooner did he inquire that than he grabbed his head, as memories not his own flodded his mind, granting him enough to have a rudimentary grasp on his newfound power as far as flight went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the memories stopped, Narutos attention was brought back to the crater as someone climed out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nasty-looking guy who's appearance consisted of extremely long, spiky black hair with a prominent widow's peak, brown and black colored Battle Armor with boots, armored gloves, and a device on one side of his face that a green lense covering one eye. Additionally, he wore two red accessory bands: one tightened around his left arm, and the other on his left leg. Added onto that, he had some kind of furry belt around his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe individual tsked after looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this planet is still teaming with life. Dammit Kakarot, what have you been doing all this time?\" he growled. Then the thing over his eye suddenly beeped and the figure look in Naruto's direction before it shattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piece  of junk Scouter...a power level that high with onone around? Must've been broken...no wonder it blew up...ah well, at least it pointed a few other power levels aside from that nonexesistant one...one of them must be Kakarot...\" the man tsked, then, to Naruto's shock, he floated upwards then suddenly took off into the sky, flying under his own power much like Naruto was, rocketing off somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the individual gone, Naruto frowned. He may not know what was going on, but he didn't like that guy's vibe, it was obvious he was bad news. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't just let someone like that do whatever they wanted, but how could Naruto do anything to stop him? Shaking his head, the Uzumaki decided that whatever that guy was after might lead him to answers about what was going on, and even if not, that creep had to be kept track of, and try coming up with a way to stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting his new mask back on as a way of keeping the wind out of his eyes, Naruto decided to put his new flight ability to use.</span></div></div>",

Naruto saw that the man had landed right in front of the house surprising the people, diving towards the nearest palm tree Naruto over looked the gathered crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside the long haired man there was five other people a young boy that was green clothes with blue with, an awesome in Naruto's opinion, orange ball on top, an bald old man with a white beard holding a cane, a short man with a bald head wearing an orange gi and a pretty blue haired woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last man was wearing the same colored gi as the other man but was far taller then him with pointy  black hair, Naruto's gaze bounced between the two black haired man noting that they looked very much alike but the feeling that they gave off couldn't be more different. The armored man practically oozed disdain and arrogance while the other radiated determination with a bit of anticipation mixed in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was shaken from his thoughts as the armored man used his tail to smack the young bald man into the side of the house, Naruto listens as the man calling Raditz went on to explain his and Goku's origin, it wasn't every day you see actual aliens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku wasn't interested in following his brother it seemed as he charged the older man only to be easily knocked down by a kick to the stomach while Raditz grabbed Gohan giving his brother an ultimatum be before flying off in the same direction he had come from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching from his tree Naruto was torn between revealing himself and helping the people get back Gohan but he wasn't sure how much help he would be at this size, or would he stay hidden and try to help them from the shadows?</span></div></div>",

But either way, he wasn't sure how much help he would be at this size, but he still had to at least try and help, cause that just the kind of guy Naruto Uzumaki is!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was about to follow Raditz, Naruto heard a sudden female's voice that said, \"Oh my, a human at the size of one-inch in height and yet he's about to go into battle with literal giants; but maybe I can help you level the playing field.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he knew what was happening, Naruto suddenly vanished into thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---- Meanwhile in the Demon Realm ----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!\" Towa screamed in absolute fury as she blasted the first of her demon henchmen by the name of Jeff into oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW DARE SOMEONE TAKE AWAY WHAT'S MINE!!!! I DON'T CARE WHO THEY ARE BUT THEY WILL PAY FOR THIS, DO YOU HEAR ME, I'LL FIND YOU AND YOU WILL PAAAAAYYYY!\" Towa screamed to the heavens swearing revenge for whoever took away her toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---- With Naruto----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Naruto reappeared, he fell on his butt and looked around, disorented. Huh? Why did the ground feel so soft and warm? He must have been more out of it than he thought he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he registered his surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the...?! Where was this?! The place he was at was somewhere that a vast environment, complete with warped oceans, mountains, forests, and various animal species. Several villages were built across the landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole place was a mountain town with block houses. The village looked like it had been abandoned long ago, but it looked like it survived through a war. Not to mention a feudal-era castle inside of what looked like a sun, but seemed to actually be an alter that consisted of two separated parts, its case and the main content. The case had had a spherical-shaped structure made from gold with an eight-pointed star-like symbol carved, which had been chained and mounted inside of a shrine; along with floating islands that had temples. The islands and castle all orbited the \"sun's core\", which was a floating cavern in the shape of an eight-pointed sun ray symbol, along with a crescent moon and a sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main content was a sun-like, eye-like orb structure with a double-layered yellow hexagon-shaped pupil (one fixed and the other rotated counterclockwise) surrounded by an orange-yellow flower-like iris, which had been stored inside the core of the artificial sun and protected with some huge pieces of metal bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was even an 50-by-50 meter arena that possessed pyramids and pillars, ensuring lots of room for the contestants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...not a bad recreation of the enviorment of the Otsutsuki's original world. Still, better atmosphere inside the barrier here...based off the Planet Zorert because its atmosphere is pleasant, wouldn't you agree, little one?\" the calm voice of a woman said pleasently, making Naruto leap to his feet and spin to look behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis jaw dropped like a hunk of iron a second later at the sight before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one who had spoken was a tall, female, humanoid with pale blue skin, violet eyes, and long white hair worn as a high ponytail. She carried a long scepter with a gem that floated above it in her right hand. Around her neck was a large light blue ring like a halo. Her attire consisted of green robes, a black cuirass with a white and orange circle decoration, and a red sash. She also wore white high heeled shoes with black soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gaped in shock under his mask, while he'd seen plenty of strange things, this was weird! Furthermore, he noticed he was standing on the woman's palm! He hadn't even noticed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-who are you?\" he sputtered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill smiling at him, the woman spoke in a polite tone, \"I am Vados, my little Naruto. Pleasure to see you again. Especially in person this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you know me? And what the heck do you mean by \"again\"?!\" Naruto said, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVados shrugged, \"I've been watching over you. and let's just say that I will train you to stand a better chance of standing against those giants on earth, at least they are giants compared to you. Why, you're no bigger than a infant's pinkie toe, yet you want go into a battle between two sayians?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto went bug-eyed at that and he started to sweat. What was with this woman?! She a stalker or something?! He wouldn't deny she was cute at the least, beautiful at most, but that seriously freaked him out! He shook that off, recalling the scenee that had happened earlier that he had witnessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what that Raditz guy did was unforgivable and even though I somehow shrunk, I gotta help somehow. To know what is right and choose to do nothing is the act of a coward, after all. If I can use my skills to help those who need it, I will. That's what the power I have...what <i><b>I'm</b></i>...for, after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVados looked at him with...was that affection?...\"Alright, then I'll train you, but in return, I want something from you, just think of it as something to pay me later, okay?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded, \"Deal.\"</span></div></div>",

I can help in this fight, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But your lessons in the basics have barely just started. Are you sure?\" the female angel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde Uzumaki nodded and said, \"I may be new to this ki stuff, but I can still use my chakra and the skills I know already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVados smiled at him as he put his mask on. \"Very well, my little one. Can't rightly argue, you do know your way around a fight, after all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding out her hand, palm up, Naruto climbed on top of her palm and she raised him to her face, \"Keep in mind however that you and I do have our agreement still after this 'Sayian' business is sorted out.\" she reminded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I won't forget. I gave you my word, after all.\" Naruto nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling a bit wider at that, Vados then tapped the butt of her staff against the ground and she and Naruto were both enveloped in a shaft of white space and warped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant they both arrived where Raditz could be seen but Vados hid her power so she and Naruto couldn't be found and she gently placed Naruto on the ground and said, \"Now Naruto, this is your fight so I will not help out or still be here either, however I will be watching over you and if I think you are in to much danger I will teleport you straight to me; Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded seeing how that's reasonable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVados then smiled and nodded at his response and then she was enveloped in a shaft of white space and warped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Vados vanished Naruto flew over to a nearby rock and did a quick look around and saw Raditz standing still, seemingly waiting for Goku to show up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around for the kid Raditz kidnapped, Naruto saw a strange space-pod in the center of a very large crater and saw that the kid was inside crying inside of it.<br>\r\nNaruto was now doing something he hasn't done much of as a very dangerous pass time, thinking up a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was thinking, he saw felt a large energy source fly over him and looked up and saw Goku fly directly over him on a yellow cloud of all things and he was followed by Piccolo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto watched as both Goku and Piccolo landed in front of Raditz as he said, \"Well, well, well look who decided to drop in, if it isn't little brother; Oh and he's brought the green man with him; I was wondering who that second insignificant blimp on my scouter might be I confess, I didn't expect it to be you, What a pleasant surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to hand it to you brother, I didn't think I'd see you until tomorrow, you are a little more resourceful than I thought, and more foolish as well.\" Raditz finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well see about that.\" Goku replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Far enough, So what brings you here Kakorot? do tell, Have you already killed 100 earthlings?.\" Raditz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hear to get my son back, Where is he?\" Goku said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are testing my patience Kakorot, I've been more than generous with you so far, Now for the last time, I strongly recommend that you join us!\" Raditz said beginning to lose his temper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care what you recommend, the answer is still NO!!!\" Goku yelled at his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should listen to your big brother.\" Raditz warned Goku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as I'm concerned I don't have a brother.\" Goku said to Raditz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then, You can have it you're way Kakorot; I didn't come here to kill you, but it seems that you left me... no choice.\" Raditz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too bad little brother, I do think you would have found the life of a saiyan quot invigorating.\" Raditz said before eating a pear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right I've heard enough talk, You know why we're here, so let's get on with it.\" Piccolo said taking off his hat and cape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku then realized that his clothes were weighted and said, \"Huh, Piccolo, I didn't know you wore weighted clothing too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Thought you were the only one?\" Piccolo asked sarcastically. As the Namekian rubbed his shoulders while saying, \"Oh yeah, I feel much lighter now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>His power level has gone up to 400.</i>' Raditz thought to himself as his scouter scanned Piccolo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Goku began to take off his shirt saying, \"There's thirty pounds.\" Then he began to take his shoes off revealing his bare-feet while saying, \" and here's fifty, and another fifty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Raditz watched Goku's power level continue to rise, Goku then took off his arm bands saying, \"and two little fivers, that outta do Piccolo, unless you can think of something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you? a tailor?\" Piccolo said and as Naruto was watching this, he had to agree with the Namekian, not understanding why he took his shirt and shoes off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaditz then threw the pear away and began to laugh saying, \"Do you two REALLY think that's going to make a difference?\" Both Goku and Piccolo were surprised by that remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FOOLS! Who do you think I am? A few weight aren't going to affect the outcome of this fight. I'm still ten times stronger than you are.\" Raditz said filled with confidence in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That maybe true, but strength isn't the only thing that matter.\" Goku said as Piccolo and Naruto both looked confused by what Goku meant by that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not when you can outsmart you're opponent.\" Goku said with a confident smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaditz looked unconvinced and said, \"You really don't have a clue, do you little brother? You know what? I think I've decided, that I don't want you to join us anymore, a fool like you would only slow us down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU'RE A DISGRACE TO ALL SAIYANS, NOW PREPARE TO DIE!!!\" Raditz yelled in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku and Piccolo braced themselves as Raditz raised his hand up in the air, quickly forming a small blue and white energy sphere in it, and taking aim at Goku and Piccolo, glaring hatefully at them both \"Now Die!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so!\" Naruto growled, zooming right up to Raditz's back from behind and forming an \u014cdama Rasengan. Slamming it into Raditz's back making him yell in pain. Naruto then watched with satisfaction as the long-haired saiyan was launched forward, spinning as he went, even when shrunken the rasengan no matter the size was still very powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku and Piccolo gaped as Raditz zoomed right at them before they both dove out of the way and watched as Goku's apparent brother kept going until he smashed into a rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...ow...\" Raditz groaned, pushing himself up, then he glared around, hateful and confused, \"WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?! WHO DID THAT!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku blinked and turned to face Piccolo and asked, \"Not that I agree with him or anything, but what was that? and who did do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiccolo frowned, getting back into his fighting stance, \"It doesn't matter, whatever it or who did it just helped us, and that's all we need to know.\" the Namekian pointed out sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto felt insulted from hearing that and whispered in an angry tone of voice, \"Well, You're welcome, jerk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Raditz quickly rushed at both Goku and Piccolo seemingly running passed the both of them, until hit them both with his elbows sending them flying, but Goku and Piccolo quickly recovered and bounced off the ground and took there stances, as Raditz laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you not only brought the green man to assist you but you also brought a hidden assassin to face me too, huh Kakorot?\" Raditz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't bring anyone else but Piccolo.\" Goku replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it really doesn't matter, once I've killed you both he's next.\" Raditz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to find me first.\" Naruto said in a low tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Whoever got him from behind, I gotta remember to thank him for it, but he's so fast, I've never seen anyone move like that.</i>' Goku thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>It's like he disappeared, I couldn't follow his movements at all, one second he was in front of us and next...ugh.</i>' Piccolo also thought to himself in a shocked state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll give you both this, you both know how to take a punch; Good, that should only make this all the more enjoyable, Oh yes, Let's see how much pain you both can really stand.\" Raditz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>I knew he was strong, but for his power to be that much greater...</i>' Piccolo thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>We need to find a way to grab his tail, that's the only chance we have.</i>' Goku finished as if he knew what Piccolo was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? You look so pensive Kakorot, are you still trying to outsmart me? Well think about this while you're at it, your situation is even more hopless than you realize, he,he,he if you think I'm strong now, just wait until I catch my stride, truth is I'm just getting warmed up.\" Raditz said, shocking Piccolo, Goku and Naruto who was still flying around to attack Raditz again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto grinned. He had FINALLY tracked down the old horn dog's notes and, much to his delight, rather than smut, it was instructions for a jutsu!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure using an unfamiliar technique without supervision wasn't a good idea, but what else could he do when the guy who was SUPPOSED to be overseeing his training put a higher value on his peeping...AGAIN! So Naruto was FORCED to train himself since Jiraiya felt being indecent was more important...ah well, not like he expected any different from a lecherous old man who stays at home watching porno twenty-four-seven with the disposition of a child with an overly-eccentric and boisterous personality to compensate for still being a virgin, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with it being a week away from the date they'd assured Tsunade that they'd return to the Leaf Village from this training trip, he wanted to show something new so the two and a half years of training weren't just wasted on remedial lessons of stuff he could do before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went through the series of handseals the notes said. When the final handseal was made, however, things quickly went south. Firstly, the glow of the technique was a mix of evil crimson and dark violet and he felt himself lock in place involuntarily. Second, sparks of pale gray lightning danced around the room. The dancing sparks began to multiply, and his inability to move left him vulnerable to dozens of them striking him and making him scream silently; such was the intensity of the pain. Finally, the sparks began to swirl around the center of the room, and Naruto forced himself to look towards it through the pain. His eyes were wide at the sight of space in front of him twisting and distorting before cracks began forming in midair. The cracks grew and spread like spider webs forming, and parts of them broke off and revealed a space of distorted light and color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vacuum effect emanated from the cracks, and the whiskered blond felt himself being dragged towards it along with Jiraiya's notes on how to perform the jutsu, the pages scattering as they were sucked in. Then Naruto blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a jolt, Naruto awoke. Looking around frantically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to the top, his jaw dropped. WHAT THE HECK WAS THIS? LAND OF THE GIANTS OR SOMETHING?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was in what looked like an indoor pool. Everything around him was so huge, he was only an inch-and-a-half tall compared to it all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo top it off, on the other side of the room, there stood a large group of teenage girls all close to his own age, all dressed in one-piece swimsuits, and all of them gigantic compared to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of himself, the the Jinch\u016briki couldn't help his first thought. <i>'Pervy Sage...youre fucked, I'm in your dream world and YOU can't get here!'</i> Naruto thought, smirking vindictivily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<i>'I feel as though I'm missing something amazing right now.'</i> Jiraiya thought to himself, pausing in his peeking as a silent wail of anguish and annoyance escaping him with a frown as his fingers twitched as if wanting to strangle someone while he had a sudden urge to cry in disappointment at whatever he was missing out on.<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were all talking about something called \"Keijo\". From what managed to gather about it by overhearing them, it was an all - female water sport where girls stand on a small floating arena called a \"Land\" and compete against one another. The aim was to push the other contestant off of the arena into the water, but players were forbidden to use their limbs. They were only allowed to use their butts and boobs to fight. However, they were freed to launch their attack to any body parts of their opponents, including their opponent's face and vital points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlayer types or \"fighting styles\" in this Keijo thing were divided into three types.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ones called Infighters were close range fighters that mainly focused on power. The Infighters fully utilize their strength to sink their opponent. However, their attacks are usually standard. Thus it's easy to find an opening to counter them. The Infighters usually aimed for one-hit kills as they focus all of their strength into their butts. The Infighters are disadvantaged when fighting on a narrow-type Land, as the Outfighters are able to move faster to corner them. However, they have more strength than the Outfighters. As such, they are able to wipe out the Outfighters with little effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Outfighters were hit and run fighters that focused on speed and strategist. The Outfighters fully utilized their speed, and they were hard to countered. However, they are also pretty small and light. Thus they can easily be wiped out by the Infighters. The Outfighters are also usually unable to bear the weight of heavy butts, thus they will fall down to the Land. Due to their lack of strength, almost all the Outfighters tend to defeat their opponents by launching successive attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, there was the classification of Counters, those were fighters that focused on defense and utilized their opponent's strength to convert it into their own attack. The Counters usually tend to reflect their opponent's movement before striking them down if they manage to find an opening. Due to their lack of speed, they were disadvantaged if they face off against the Outfighters. However, they have the advantage if they face off against the Infighters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, the swimsuit-clad giantesses were being explained to about an exam they were going to take to help determine which type they were between In, Out, and Counter. The part of the exam was currently the \"Outfighter\" test, where examinees were required to hit a bunch of small balls by using their butts. Examinees were tested on whether they could differ the normal balls and the squishy balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH FUCK!\" Naruto swore as he realised where he was: among the balls that were going to be used for this exam! Just great! And for better or worse, out of the T&amp;A-fan department, Naruto was a butt guy! Looking down, he went red as he saw he was already sporting a boner tent in the front of his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto dropped back and checked his surroundings for Jiraiya's notes, then recalled with utter dread that the pages had scattered when the jutsu had been used. Until he found them all and used the jutsu again, he was trapped here, wherever \"here\" was!  Then the cart with the exam balls was rolled across the room and the massive hand of the exam proctor reached in and grabbed several of them, taking Naruto along for the ride as the balls were tossed to the girls as they all stood on \"Land\" platforms in the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it wrong that part of me is gonna enjoy this...?\" The Uzumaki asked himself as he fell towards the waiting, powerful-looking asses of the numerous teenage giantesses.</span></div></div>",

Naruto couldn't help but spread his arms as if he was flying and suddenly the tennage giantess' planet sized butt (to him) collided with his body and Naruto quickly realized that he was now stuck inside this gigantic beauty's swimsuit ontop of her asscheek so he clung to her flesh with all his might while enduring the quick collision with the exam balls her butt made and as he was holding on for dear life he couldn't help but think to himself, 'I wonder if the Pervy-Sage noticed that I'm gone yet?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- With Jiraiya ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TSUNADE'S GONNA KILL MEEEEEEEE!\" Screamed a horrified Jiraya, he maybe an old man but he didn\u2019t want to die soon. Just when he finished peeping and having a strange feeling to wanting to strangle someone while he also had a sudden urge to cry in disappointment for some reason, but when he returned to check up on Naruto the room was silent, too silent knowing Naruto as he did it shouldn't be silent and that alone set off waring bells in his mind. He opened the door to Naruto's room and he wasn't there and it was already night so he couldn't be outside there was only one place left to look, his room and as Jiraiya turned the knob he felt dread building up inside himself and saw that Naruto was in here given the mess in here but that was not his biggest concern for it was the mess of papers scattered around the floor and he saw that there was a bunch of papers missing and he realized that the dimension jumping jutsu he was studying on was also gone it didn't take long for him to put two and two together, \"Naruto was bored so he ransacked my room to look for a jutsu to learn, then finds the dimension jumping jutsu, he used the jutsu opens a portal and he and the jutsu instructions get stucked in the portal and now he's most likely stuck in another dimension and cannot leave unless he uses it again.\" Great, just great...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- With Naruto ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Naruto was stuck inside this gigantic girl's swimsuit he was getting tired of getting nearly crushed by the exam balls and her butt continuously hitting against them, even ignoring his boner he decided to try and break free from his unknowing giantess captor, so he began to struggle inside her swimsuit and began to constantly move and crawl as he looked for a way out of her swimsuit with little to no success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- With Nozomi Kaminashi ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi Kaminashi was having a great time in this exam until suddenly she felt something itch in her swimsuit, it started from her right butt cheek then it began to literally move up to her back and continued to move to other places that she couldn't get at, she tried to just ignore it but it was driving her crazy but she didn't want to fail this exam. So she had no other choice but to grin and bear it, as this happend Nozomi thought to herself, 'Ugh! This itch is driving me CRAZY!!!', 'But I can't let it destract me from the exam,  so I just have to stay focused.' but as this was happening she was unkownly doing better than she was earlier as she was moving all over the place hitting each ball sent her way and the exam proctors watched with amazement as Nozomi kept hitting ball after ball after ball, After a while...</span></div></div>",

Whatever that irradiance was, it'd have to wait! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe HAD to do this! She needed to become an official Keijo player! Her family was counting on her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still remembered how around the time she was six years old, her mother was hospitalized and eventually passed away, while Nozomi helplessly cried. Right before her death, her mom told Nozomi, as the eldest daughter, to take care of her siblings. Nozomi and her siblings then lived in very poor condition. Due to this poverty, Nozomi kept working hard, to the point where her friends said that her body never stopped moving. Nozomi attended Shinkou High School in Kobe. Upon entering Shinkou, Nozomi has became a pretty skilled gymnast. Thus Nozomi was invited by colleges with the best gymnastic programs. However, Nozomi then learned about Keijo, a gambling, water sport, knowing that its players got paid so much if they win in the large scale tournaments. As such, Nozomi refused all offers of joining athletics college and decided to become a Keijo player in order to bring her family out of poverty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was truly anything evil about money, it was that people were made to depend on having it to live without difficulty...she shook her head, clearing it of those thoughts as she made her way onto the floating pathways between the Land arenas in the pool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the bell rang for the start of the ten-minute-long test, Nozomi rushed towards one of the other girls and leapt into the air before bringing an axe kick down and causing a splash of water to blind the girl and while the water wall was up, she spun and thrust back, slamming her butt into the girl's cheek, making her stumble backwards near the edge of the land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- With Naruto ---<br>\r\n\"There is something deeply wrong with the fact that part of me doesn't care if this kills me...!\" Naruto moaned out as the the G-forces of the girl's movements caused him to be pressed into her buttcheek. And damn, did this girl move a lot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe constant motion wasn't helping his stomach, and the impacts hurt like HELL!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the sudden weightless feeling and the way his surroundings shifted, this girl had just done a midair flip, then he heard the girl shout a \"Where're you going?\" at who she'd obviously clashed with. Then she moved, giving chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid rookie mistake I made starting out as a Genin...\" Naruto muttered. But at the moment, he was more concerned with a way to ensure his own survival. The girl's constant movements made moving to a more secure spot impossible with the G-forcespinning him, and getting between her butt cheeks was a BAD idea if she clenched them (down boner!). Naruto felt it as this girl he was with flipped forward several times to build momentum, spun on her heel, and smashed her butt (and him) into someone with a cry of \"Butt Cannon!\" followed by a splash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike he said, out of the T&amp;A-fan department, Naruto was a butt guy, and he found something deeply wrong with the fact that part of him didn't care if this killed him, but the rest of his disagreed! He needed some kind of defense, here! Like Gaara's sand of Neji's rotat...Wait a second...That was it! He grit his teeth and brought his hands together, gathering his chakra as he extended it around him into a membrane to act as a form of protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto sighed, resting against the rump of his \"new friend\", he shut his eyes. Since he did, he missed seeing his chakra that he was having spread around him also spread to the girl he was with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- With Nozomi ---<br>\r\nNozomi yelped as she suddenly felt full of energy for some reason. Like her every cell was suddenly charged with 1.21 gigawatts of electricity! She felt it pouring out of her like light from the sun. She felt limitless, invincible, almost godlike. WHAT WAS GOING ON?! She looked down at herself and could swear her skin was glowing a light blue hue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her distracted state, and Nozomi moved...faster than she knew she could--faster than she knew she SHOULD BE ABLE TO--dodging the other girl's butt, she lashed out with her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMISSED!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the sheer energy of the blow sent out a shockwave that not only sent the other girl flying, but it continued along the water and blasted a chunk out of the wall of the pool!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone, the proctors and the other girls all stared as a nightstand-sized piece of the pool's wall was broken off and sunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWha-?! Nozomi gawked. HOW had she done THAT?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA girl with short, wavy, light magenta hair and purple eyes froze as she looked over at Nozomi, then gaped as she saw what seemed to be the flickering, azure, silhouette of a humanoid demon with three faces and six arms, an Asura, radiating off of her briefly before vanishing like a mirage in the blink of an eye later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas that illusion...a manifestation of that Kaminashi's fighting spirit?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magenta-haired girl gained a creepy smile, and her pupils turned cross-like and started shining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTarget acquired!</span></div></div>",

Nozomi and her remaining attackers stood in place frozen at the sight of what just happend then Nozomi said, \" Uh, she's out cold.\" Then the magenta haired girl jumped right over Nozomi and again did a very swift blow to the second girl and just like the first she passed out but the only difference was she stayed on the land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi was surprised to see that this girl just take out two opponents with one blow each and thought to herself, 'No way, what's with this girl? She's knocking them out, but how's is she doing it?' While Nozomi was thinking this the strange girl had a creepy smile, and if she looked at her eyes she would see that her pupils gained a strange cross-like symbol in them and they were shining ominously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Magenta haired girl stepped over her defeated opponent's body and began to stalk towards Nozomi's final attacker with her head down, \"Aw what's the matter?\", \" Your afraid to take me on all by yourself, without your friends to back you up aren't ya?\" She then raised her head and said, \"That\u2019s the whole thing with bullies, their really just cowards.\" The final girl growled at that remark and yelled while attempting to attack Nozomi's savior, \"Why you!\" She thrusted her butt at the magenta haired girl who just dodged it easily and swiftly one-hit her as she fell on the land counted as a fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Magenta haired girl then turned to Nozomi who just thought to herself, 'Here she comes.' And as she thought that the Girl was suddenly upon Nozomi who said, \"she's fast.\" with her eye crosses glowing full force and still had that creepy smile and their battle had begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- Naruto ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the Clash of the Titanesses (to him) Naruto was passed out while resting against the rump of his \"new friend\" completely unaware of what's happening outside of the swimsuit as he slept he began to dream he had strange visions that he could not explain their origin, but he saw a little girl around at age six standing in front of a woman who is laying on a hospital bed holding her hand and she was crying as he could hear the monitor's beeping getting less and less and the woman said in a very weak voice to the six year old girl, \"Stay strong my little Nozomi and remember as the eldest sister, you must take care of your siblings and know I'll be watching over all of you and I'll always and forever love you.\" And with that said Nozomi's mother left this world and Nozomi couldn't do anything but cry, Naruto also shedded tears while saying a silent prayer for Nozomi's mother. After that Naruto saw another vision of Nozomi and her siblings living in a very poor condition. Due to this poverty, Nozomi kept working hard, to the point where her friends said that her body never stopped moving. Naruto then saw Nozomi attended Shinkou High School in Kobe. Upon entering Shinkou, Nozomi has became a pretty skilled gymnast. Thus Nozomi was invited by colleges with the best gymnastic programs Naruto had no-idea what college is but if Nozomi was invited to so many he was very impressed. However, Nozomi then learned about Keijo, a gambling, water sport, knowing that its players got paid so much if they win in the large scale tournaments. As such, Nozomi refused all offers of joining athletics college and decided to become a Keijo player in order to bring her family out of poverty. Before the visions could continue Naruto felt a tug and was instantly infront of a giant cage in some kind of sewer and said in a bored tone, \"Alright fox, what do you want this time?\" As he said that a gigantic eye appeared in front of him with a blood red iris and a black slit going straight down and in a demonic voice said, <b>Look you little pathetic hairless ape as much as I loved to exchange insults with you I'm going to go straight to the point and ask how in Kami's name did you perform the ninsh\u016b?</b>\" Naruto looked confused at the question and said, \"The what?\" The Kyuubi growled and roared \"<b>DON'T PLAY GAMES WITH ME YOU USELESS LITTLE INSECT!!!\", \"HOW IN KAMI'S GREEN EARTH DID A IDIOTIC DUNCE OF AN APE LIKE YOU PERFORM THE NINSH\u016a!?</b>\" Naruto was already getting tired of the fox's attitude and said, \"Look fox I honestly don't know what the hell your yapping on about!\", \"So unless you called me here for a reason other than to yell and insult me I'll be on my way out.\" And with that Naruto left the Kyuubi alone in his cage and thought, 'Hmmm, maybe the brat didn't know how he did the ninsh\u016b and besides if he did use it he most likely would've come to me with questions.', \"Oh well ethier way it's not my problem, I'll just keep this brat alive so I won't die and if he does do the ninsh\u016b I'll let him come to me.\" And with that the Kyuubi went back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- Nozomi ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the events with Naruto was happening Nozomi was having a tough time with the magenta haired girl who she remembered meeting earlier and knew her name is Hanabi Kawai as once thier battle began Hanabi already landed a direct hit on Nozomi's face with her butt, but Nozomi figured out how Hanabi was able to one-hit her opponents and saved herself, then Hanabi jumped high into the air and quickly desended while her butt was aimed at Nozomi's head while yelling \"Butt Guillotine\" which Nozomi barely dodged Hanabi then cheerfully said, \"Wow, you dodged it, You just don't know when to give up, do ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi was breathing very hard while holding her right arm thinking to herself, 'This girl's insane, it's like she's aiming for my vital organs, how am I supposed to fight her when I don't know which one she's going shoot for next?' Nozomi then readied hrself thinking, 'Only one thing to do!' Nozomi then rushed toward Hanabi and pressed her breasts against hers, this caught Hanabi by surprise as Nozomi said, \"It's my \"Bust to Bust Attack\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi struggling against Nozomi asked, \"What are you doing!?\" Nozomi then proudly responded, \"Oh please, you know exactly what I'm doing! As long as I'm this close to you, you can't use your pinpoint attacks!\" Hanabi knew her pinpoint jig is up said, \"Ok, you got me!\",\"But the same thing goes for you, it's not like you can attack me in this close range.\" Nozomi glares at Hanabi with defiance in her eyes while saying, \"Oh yeah? WATCH ME!\" And begins to push Hanabi towards the edge of the land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hanabi appeared to about to be pushed off the land she giggles as she says in a dark tone of voice, \"Alright, You want a real fight? Fine I won't hold back anymore.\", \"Only one of us can win, and that's me.\" And in a sudden burst of speed Hanabi had Nozomi suddenly near the edge and Nozomi says in defiance, \"NO I WON'T LOSE!\", \"I HAVE TO WIN!!!\" As she pushes Hanabi back to the other side of the land Hanabi then looks at Nozomi and says, \"You know your pretty good at this, you've got plenty of power but you don't know how to use it.\", \"I'll teach you, Lesson one Breasts can do more than push.\" As Hanabi pushes Nozomi with enough force to knock her off but Nozomi used her breasts to clamp on Hanabi's swimsuit and say, \"I maybe new to keijo, but I'm not stupid I know what they can do!\" As she threw Hanabi away from her Hanabi says in her cheerful voice , \"Oh goodie, that was fun, your amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith thirty seconds left Nozomi realized that she won't get anywhere by just pushing into Hanabi so she decided to go full force to knock her off the land and rushed to do so, Hanabi the prepared to attack by moving her leg and said, \"thought you could attack me?\" Hanabi swings her butt to strike Nozomi but she dodged it while saying, \"You already tried that move on me, looks like your running out of tricks!\",\"YOU'RE GOING DOWN!\" Nozomi lands a blow with a butt to Hanabi's gut and knocks her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi recovers from the blow and says, \"I don't get it, noone has ever broken down my moves this fast befor- AHGH!\" Nozomi attacks Hanabi before she could finish while saying, \"I'VE HAD IT WITH YOU!\" Nozomi knocked Hanabi right back on the edge of the land and attacks one last time while yelling, \"THIS IS IT! GAME OVER!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the sidelines of the pool everyone the exam proctors and examinees were shocked to see that Hanabi not only dodged Nozomi's attack but also used the opening to finish her off, as Nozomi feel into the pool Naruto woke up and felt that he and the Nozomi were now under water and he had to get her to move so he quickly began to move as he could making sure to hit her skin but it just wasn't enough and due to his body's small size and his body rapidly dropping temperature he along with Nozomi passed out underwater...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nozomi awoke some time later with a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...?\" she groaned as she slowly pushed herself up. The medical ward? It didn't surprise her that the exams had one; after all, Keijo matches were, like all contact sports, a dangerous physical competition with the risk of injury and incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I doing here...?\" she asked, then with a jolt, she remembered everything...the exam...clashing with that Hanabi girl...and how she was knocked out and fell into the pool...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as the memories hit her, what struck her hardest were the questions. Where had that...that power, whatever it was, come from? How had she used it? Why had it suddenly just stopped like it had? She needed to know!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even more importantly, did she make the cut?! Did she pass the exam?! Was the road to using Keijo as a means to support her family available to her or not?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up, Nozomi suddenly felt that itch in her swimsuit return and this time, she pulled the bottom of her suit open and the itch rushed towards it, then it was gone. Turning around, her eyes widened before setting into a glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, relieved he didn't drowned from what happened earlier, turned when light entered his prison and bolted across the flesh of this girl's  ass and leapt out of her swimsuit, landing on the sheets of an enormous bed. Glad to be free, he turned to look up at his unknowing warden and was met with the sight of a girl around his age that had navy blue eyes and long dark blue hair that she kept in a ponytail, tied in a white ribbon, and two visible ahoge on top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes widened. She looked a bit older, but...the girl he'd seen in his dream?! What the heck?! Nozomi Kaminashi...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EeeWWW! DisGusting! A bug was in my swimsuit?!\" she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A....BUG?!\" Naruto yelled, jaw wide open in disdain. \"I am NOT a....OH CRAP! WAIT! WAIT! STOP!!! DON'T!!!\" he was cut off as Nozomi's butt was brought over him, ominous as a guillotine blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you like my ass, little bug? Well fine then, you can just stay there forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUD!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi slammed her her booty down on Naruto like two meteors of armageddon and starts wiggling her rump and causing him pain. Naruto began to try and squirm to break free but her butt's pressure on his much smaller body was too strong. All his attempts caused was making her cheeks jiggle and smack him around. It was almost as if the cheeks were mocking his futile efforts as the teenage behemoth surprised herself when she ended up moaning deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?! Hey, that...actually feels....really good.\" Nozomi said as a smile formed on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving her swimsuit, in a display of dexterity, Nozomi positioned her butt so the bug was directly between her cheeks, then clenched them together in order to pick the bug up, and then used only her butt muscles to pull the bug deeper into her butt until it collided with her anus as she closes her butt cheeks up after feeling it sink deep in her ass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe results were instantaneous. It started thrashing and squirming like crazy to get out, it's actions massaging the inside of her butt, making Nozomi moan deeply again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you in there, you're doing great! Don't stop!\" Naruto felt his whole world compress around him as Nozomi clenched her butt a few times in response to his struggling. \"That was actually fun...I hope that little bug never leaves my ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet it be known that Naruto Uzumaki had the devil's luck, because as soon as he heard her say that, he heard a deep rumble, then a fart blew him out of the girl's butt and onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gasped, hunched over hands on his knees. \"...Deeply wrong with the fact that part of me doesn't care if this is how I end up dead...!\" he panted. Death by attractive buttock? He felt he needed to see a therapist over how he felt he wouldn't mind choosing that being how he went out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Get back here, little butt-y!\" Nozomi cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto moaned, oh great...butt puns! He yelped as Nozomi made a grab for him. The Uzumaki was NOT looking forward to being kept as an insert in Nozomi's butt...NO MATTER HOW MUCH HIS BONER GAVE TO THE CONTRARY!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bolted as a huge hand landed where he had been, Nozomi attempting to pick him up. Frowning, she pulled her swimsuit back on quickly then gave chase to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick little sucker...too bad that mystery energy can make me faster!\" she smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto skid to a halt at that. Nozomi...she was...trying to access chakra?! Naruto wasn't sure this place HAD it, but it wouldn't hurt to be sure. The way that weird jutsu he'd tried reacted when he used it, and the fact that if this Keijo sport existed here and that letcherous dumbass Jiraiya had NEVER heard of it was proof he wasn't even IN the Elemental Nations any longer (really, an all-female water sport that only allowed competitors to use their boobs and asses? No WAY would Jiraiya have never heard of something like that if it existed in the Elemental Nations!).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto watched Nozomi try to acess her non-existing chakra, he saw her do some rather strange poses, first she crouched and began yelling as loud as she could while standing straight with her arms bent. This only made Naruto cover his ears, when that failed she then tried something different she then moved her arms into a series of quick moves that ended with her arms in front of her in the shape of a Z.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...?! That energy from earlier...what happened?! Oh man, don't tell me it was a one-time thing!\" the girl cried in alarm as she looked down at herself, shocked when nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked as an idea struck him. If it was chakra Nozomi wanted, it was chakra she was gonna get!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde gave a faint smirk before he made a ram seal and flared his chakra. To Nozomi, it was like a tidal wave of energy flowed from him and washed over her as she could only gawk. A literal dome of chakra surrounded him before it slowly grew larger in diameter and stopped at the one-foot mark. In the center was Naruto, releasing the energy with no sign of stress or exhaustion on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok...definitely not a bug...\" the hopefully-Keijo-player-to-be said, dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, Naruto's smirk grew. Well, at least Nozomi didn't assume he was a bug any longer. He watched as Nozomi got on her hands and knees, bringing her face closer to him for a better look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Are you a fairy...?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was caught so flat-footed at that, he lost focus and his chakra flow halted. A...fairy...? \"NO! I'M NOT!\" he cried indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how do you explain the magic energy and stuff?\" Nozomi asked, now that she looked closer, she was able to actually see that the so-called \"bug\" was actually, indeed humanoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's brow twitched. \"My name is Naruto Uzumaki, Nozomi!\" he snapped without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...how'd you know my name?\" the verifiable giantess frowned down at him. Naruto covered his mouth and she snatched him up in her fist. As Nozomi brought him to her face, Naruto groned. He was in trouble. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Nozomi brought him to her face, Naruto groned and thought to himself, 'Great, just great me and big mouth.' When Nozomi brought Naruto to her eye level she then frowned at him and said, \"Alight my little fairy \"butt-y\", ethier start talking about how you know my name and explain to me all that magic energy and stuff or I stuff you right back inside my butt and this I'll make sure you never get out again.\" Naruto groned again before speaking, \"Ok, I'll talk just PLEASE don't ever call me that name ever again!\" Nozomi wanted to keep calling Naruto her little butt-y but if it might cost her the knowledge of that mysterious energy she used earlier then she would stop, besides he never said she couldn't tease him with that name. So with that in mind Nozomi nodded and said, \"Alright, Alright no more calling you \"butt-y\" (for now) so first off who are you and how did you know my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Naruto answered he thought about ethier telling Nozomi the truth or telling her a lie but when he looked up at Nozomi's face and looked in her eyes he saw that there was no evil intentions or deception in them only curiosity and wanting to know all about him and his \"magic powers\", Let it be known that as Naruto was growing up in the hidden leaf village on the streets after being kicked out of the orphanage at the age of five he quickly learned how to read people's eyes as well as their faces while they talk, a trait that has served him very well to this day and has no plans to ever stop now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo seeing that the curious giantess was true to wanting to know about him Naruto said, \"Alright Nozomi, I'll tell the truth, First of all my name is Naruto Uzumaki and I come from a place called Konohagakure no Sato...\" After what felt like hours to them both Naruto told Nozomi practically everything that has happened to him during his life from him learning about being the Kyuubi's jinchuuriki to his misson to wave country, the chun in exams, Sasuke's abandonment of the village for revenge and to how he got here and by the end he looked up at Nozomi's face and was surprised at what happened next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nozomi listened to Naruto's story, she was amazed at how the place he came from was, there were not only others who can use this \"chakra\" as Naruto calls it but it can be used for practically anything! From walking on walls to even walking on WATER! But then she learned about how cruel Naruto's life was, in a way he was just like herself and her siblings with some differences like atleast she still had family with her while he had no-one and she made some friends while Naruto had more assassination attempts on his life than most political figures combined and at the end of his story Nozomi couldn't hold back her tears anymore as she quickly brought Naruto to her cheek and nuzzled him against hers while saying, \"Th-th-That\u2019s the most saddest story I-I e-ever h-h-HEARD!\", Naruto was surprised to say the least at how Nozomi took it but she wasn't done yet as she continued, \"H-H-How could those people <b>NO!</b> those monsters do that to you!? That village dosen't deserve to have you!\" Naruto was stunned to hear her say that and was surprised that this giantess felt like he was treated unjustly for a crime he didn't commet and he unknowingly hugged her gigantic cheek and said a silent \"thank you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Nozomi finally calmed down and turned off the flood gates (to Naruto) she then said, \"So, what are you going to do now?\" Naruto paused when she asked that, that's a good question, What will he do now? He figured that he has to get all of Jiraya's dimension jumping jutsu notes to figure out how to do that jutsu again to go back home but if he went on his own, who knows how long that could take and once you add in the fact that he was at an inch-and-a-half tall that alone would take years or maybe his whole life to accomplish. Naruto then looked up to Nozomi's face, he then had an idea and said, \"Well I still have things to do in my world and like it or not I have to go back and finish them, so it looks like the best way to do that is to find them all and I know you want to be the best Keijo player there is and if you help me find the Pervy-Sage's notes I'll do whatever I can to help you become the greatest keijo player there ever was, so will you help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi was surprised to hear him say that he still has business to take care of in his world and then he asked for her help in looking for some notes of a jutsu that brought him here in the first place and he promised to help her become the best keijo player there ever was so she said, \"Alright Naruto you got yourself a deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was glad to have someone like Nozomi help him out with this but then Nozomi remembered something and said, \"Oh No! I forgot I have to check to see if I passed the exam and if I'll be able to go to Setouchi Keijo Training School!\" After Nozomi said that a voice called out, \"Nozomi are you OK in there?\" Nozomi and Naruto looked at where the voice came from and they both saw...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto and Nozomi both turned to see a short, white-haired, girl that had blue eyes that actually bordered on violet in coloration. She poseesed a small, agility-based build. Yet for how much of a figure she had, if Naruto hadn't been working with Sakura so much, he would've assumed was in her pre-teens!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miyata,\" Nozomi said in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyata snaped out of her mood, for some reason, she'd suddenly started glaring ant, and had a sudden urge to strangle the miniture figure her friend was holding. But why was that? Made no sense...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came to see how you were doing, took a nasty blow.\" the white-haired girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi winced. She had noticed Hanabi hit her opponents in the front of the jaw, which shook their brain and knocked them out, before the girl had gone after Nozomi herself. If the exam's time limit hadn't been an issue, Nozomi wouldn't have gotten reckless enough to where she left herself open to that maneuver, she knew that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut did the proctors of the exam? If they didn't, there went the chance to use Keijo as a means to get enough money to help support her family...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer idea made her guts churn over and the pit of her stomach seemed to vanish, leaving only an abyss of fear in it's wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo...please, no...the examiners noticed the time limit made her rush recklessly at the very end...they just HAD to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her friend on the verge of a panic attack, Sayaka winced. Then with a heavy sigh, she walked forward and gave Nozomi's face a quick slap. \"Sorry Nozomi, but you need to relax...they said they'd decide the exam outcome to select who passed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi visibly deflated in relief at that. She still had a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled slightly. He'd had to consider a tent city shanty town in the slums of the Red Light District his definition of \"lucky\" before the Third Hokage had proverbally  gotten his arm twisted by someone (he still didn't know who, but wished he did so that he could thank them) into helping Naruto get his appartment and stipend until he was made a Genin. So he understood why using this Keijo thing to support her family was so important to Nozomi. The girl had other people who were counting on her and she bore the weight of that responsibility as best she could in the name of being able to help the people she loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, Naruto felt Nozomi would have done great for herself as a kunoichi back in Konoha with that attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayaka walked over to the pair and looked at Naruto, who went as still as possible. While he somewhat trusted Nozomi, this other girl was an unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this some kind of lucky charm?\" Sayaka asked, wondering why Nozomi would have the figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...yeah. Was also practicing my but dops on him just before you came in, Sayaka...\" Nozomi said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayaka blinked. \"A stress toy that doubles as both a lucky charm and a training dummy, then? Interesting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call him 'Butty'.\" Nozomi said, and Naruto fought down a groan. Oh, that'd better not stick...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shorter girl's lip twitched at the wordplay. B-U-T-T-Y in place of B-U-D-D-Y? That was actually amusing. \"Mind if I give your friend a try?\" she asked and she swore the figure paled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi winced, then handed him over with reluctance. \"Just be careful with him. More delicate than you'd think.\" she said as Naruto found himself changing hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayaka smiled and nodded before she marvled at how real and life-like the object in her hand seemed. Even FELT like an actual person. No wonder Nozomi wanted her to be careful with \"Butty\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The girl decided on doing something simple to amuse herself with it, while also humoring Nozomi's wish she be careful with him, then started rubbing him for good luck, rubbing the figure all over with each, then both hands. She could see why Nozomi had this little guy...it was oddly addicting and therapeutic about manipulating him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto started to sweat as Sayaka started to rub around his waist. Even though Naruto was primarily a butt guy, he could still get a boner from a good rub down under after all!</span></div></div>",

Naruto was trying everything he could think of to NOT get a boner by thinking un-sexy thoughts but nothing seemed to work as the gigantic fingers continued to rub until it was to late...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sayaka continued rubbing Nozomi's lucky charm she named \"Butty\" she couldn't but be marveled at how real and life-like the object in her hand seemed. It even FELT like an actual person, and as she was rubbing the figure all over with each hand, then both hands. She could see why Nozomi had this little guy...it was oddly addicting and therapeutic about manipulating him. She was now rubbing his waist with her index finger on top while rubbing the underside with her thumb until she suddenly felt something poke against her finger and looked down at the charm and her eyes widened to see when she moved her index finger away to see that there was a bump in \"Butty's\" pants and she yelped as she suddenly dropped him to the floor while Nozomi looked horrified by what Sayaka had just done to Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Sayaka dropped Naruto he quickly applied chakra to the soles of his feet and landed safely on the ground and looked up at the white haired giantess who stared down at him and saw she had a look of Shock, Confusion and for some reason Interest and he saw her turn her head to Nozomi with a look that demanded an explanation and Nozomi just dropped her head and sighed and gave a look to Naruto that silently asks for his permission to tell her the truth and he reluctantly nods, seeing that the cat's out of the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of Nozomi telling Sayaka the whole story about Naruto's life, how he got into their world and how he helped her during her match, Sayaka had an understanding of what happened and promised both Nozomi and Naruto that she'll keep what she heard a secret and also agrees to help out Naruto find Jiraya's notes for the dimension teleport jutsu so he can go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi then remembers what Sayaka came in here and asks \"Sayaka do you know the results of the exams? Did I pass?\" Sayaka answered \" I honestly don't know Nozomi, I tried to see if you did but all they said is that they'll send a notice of our results in a about a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayaka could fully understand at why Nozomi was so fidgety about the results as she wanted to become a keijo player not for herself but for her brother and sister who are counting on her. So after she and Nozomi picked up Naruto from the floor they proceeded to go home and wait for the notices to come in.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto winced, feeling guilty as Nozomi struggled with her bags. He would have gladly helped her with them, if not for the size difference making doing that impossible...not that Nozomi hadn't caught him trying to move her bags earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had left her amused and touched that her new friend wanted to help her that much. Then she'd picked him up and added him to her belongings. Placing him into the lightest of her bags and leaving the zipper open just slightly at one corner so he got fresh air and could see what was going on outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up, Miyata!\" Nozomi cried, strained under the weight of her baggage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are your carrying so much? You could have had it packed up and sent here, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why waste the money when I can do it for free? Seems silly. Although Butty did try helping me with it...\" Nozomi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayaka's eyes widened, \"...You brought him with you...?!\" she hissed, her voice dropping to a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't just leave him behind. Other than you and me, he doesn't know anyone else, and I did promise to help him.\" Nozomi said back, her voice just as low as her friend's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nozomi...!\" Sayaka hissed, but she did understand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back, Naruto sighed after Nozomi put her bags down and tried to get an interview, the shrunken ninja took the chance to peek through the opening in the bag to see the other possible classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nlooking through the space in the zipper, he saw a female reporter with a formal suit,  long braided hair and glasses walked up to Nozomi. He was interested in learning she was named, Satomi Shiomi, and was a reporter from something called \"K-Sports Magazine\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well at least someone wants to give Nozomi a intervew.' he thought, smiling. He knew Nozomi was the dark horse among the students here. But was honestly happy that Satomi woman felt Nozomi deserved being recognized. Then the reporter's partner had to mess it up by showing up and scolding Satomi for wanting to persue a \"nobody who passed on sheer luck and was bound to drop out.\" rather than the members of the Elite Class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Naruto growled and unconsciously released killing intent, causing the entire student body, faculty, and the reporters to pause as the feeling of death passed over them. It only lasted for a second before Naruto managed to regain control but the brief exposure left everyone frigthened and confused. None of them knew what that was, nor did they know what had caused it, and luckily for Naruto, none of them had caught on to the fact that he was the one who produced it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto took a deep breath. He couldn't afford to get so worked up, but he just couldn't help it. Considering what Nozomi had gone through, and was even willing to give up her own future for the sake of the people that she loved, the idea that she was seen as if she were nothing made him angry. He'd been in that position himself. Constantly passed over for the \"golden child\" no matter his own efforts or accomplisments. It was a sore spot for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hmph, seems like he's a real \"SWELL\" guy to be around.' The Uzumaki thought bitterly, then Naruto was plesently surprised when a member of the Elite Class, Hanabi, was happy to see that Nozomi made the cut to get into Keijo, and that Hanabi respected Nozomi and regarded her as a friend, if Hanabi saying she was worried she'd never see Nozomi again was any indication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd RIGHT in front of the jerk reporter, too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ah, karma...chomp, chomp away!' Naruto thought gleefully as he watched from the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen attractive and very tall teenage girl with the long blonde hair and blue eyes that Naruto could've mistaken for his long-lost sister if he didn't know any better, went up to Nozomi and introduced herself as Mio Kusakai, then asked which one she preferred between cars and motorcycles. Nozomi answered to prefer the latter, and Mio shocked everyone when she hugged Nozomi and stated that she loved her, revealing that her hobbies were bikes and flirting with cute girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn! Is that girl straight forward, or what!? I mean, Nozomi DOES have a really GREAT ass and all, but even I wasn't that clingy!' Naruto thought as he watched Mio start gropping Nozomi's butt...and considering where he had been when he and Nozomi first met, that said a lot about his opinion of Mio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanabi eventually pulled Mio away from Nozomi and the reporters all followed where Mio went since she was apparently the top of the Elite Class, but not before Satomi gave Nozomi a business card and asked to see if she'd be allowed to watch Nozomi Race in Keijo. Naruto smiled at that. As Nozomi picked up her bags again, Naruto thought he'd try that \"ninsh\u016b\" stuff again to try communicating with her, but as he gathered his chakra, he jerked up, eyes wide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNO WAY!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Naruto wasn't a sensory-type, it was a good thing for the fact that there wasn't anyone in this world who could use chakra besides him! When Naruto flared his chakra  just now, he'd felt several others with traces of his OWN chakra signiture do the same like echolocation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne...two...TWELVE of Jiraiya's notes were here?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto whooped. Thank you, Nozomi! He ment it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bag shifted and Naruto suddenly found himself facing a massive eye. \"Well, you sure are excited all of a sudden. Something good happen, little Butty?\" Nozomi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you agreed to stop calling me that!\" Naruto cried, \"But yeah, there's actually a lot of those notes I need here at Setouchi!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Awesome! That's great.\" Nozomi said, glad her eye was all Naruto could see or he'd notice the strained smile she wore at that. As eager as she was to start chakra lessons, she didn't want to loose a friend so soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Nozomi, I haven't forgotten my promise.\" the blond smiled at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should you two really be talking like that out in the open?\" Sayaka asked. \"Come on, we need to get to our dorm room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLowering the bag Naruto was in, Nozomi nodded.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Inside the training school dormitories, Nozomi and Sayaka search for their assigned room, while Naruto was still inside Nozomi's bag he couldn't help but be glad that he stayed with her and came here to Setouchi Keijo Training School if he didn't, he didn't even want to know how long it would take him to find those notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before he could think about where the note's locations were, he heard a loud yet friendly and playful voice and Naruto took a peek outside of the bag to see who the voice belonged to and what he saw made his mouth drop into a silent scream and his eyes widen in shock and horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt really wasn't a what but more of who he saw and who, he saw was a titaness of a woman who has side ponytail hairstyle. She is a huge, tall, and muscular woman who was wearing a Setouchi Keijo Training School uniform but she appeared very friendly to Nozomi and then he sensed his chakra coming from her body somewhere, Naruto gulped he now knew one of Jiraya's notes was on this giantess' body somewhere and like it or not he had to scale her body if he wanted to find it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Naruto heard Nozomi say, \" Hey Oshima, this means you passed too right?\" The now identified Oshima then said, \" Well of course I did, although there's just one problem, I did so poorly on the exam's mock race that they bumped me down from elite class to regular class.\" At first she sounded very confident then she sounded sad while she said that but then she continued, \"With that said, I think you guys have worse than me.\" Nozomi asked in a confused voice, \"What do you mean Yuko?\" Yuko then answered, \"Well I hate to break it to ya, but from what I heard the room your in, room 309 is kinda cursed as they also call it the \"Empty room\".\" Nozomi still confused about the room she Sayaka was going to stay in she asked, \"Why do they call it that?\" Yuko then said, \"Apparently they call it that cause they put the students who are most likely to quit Setouchi because they can't keep up with the classes, and during every semester it always empties out so fast.\" Nozomi couldn't believe what she heard and asked, \"What are you serious!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto hearing this from Nozomi's bag, couldn't believe his ears when he heard Yuko say that, How could the staff of this place do that to their students? Some of them may not have been bookworms but that dosen't mean they can't learn, like him maybe some of them were more practical learners as in they prefer the hands on experience than read a book about the rules of Keijo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he knew it Nozomi and Sayaka were already in front of room 309 and Nozomi said, \"So this is where they send the failures huh?\", \"How did we end up in this stupid room? We're winners.\" Sayaka igored Nozomi's complaint and said in a calm voice, \"Let's just go in.\" As she just opened the door and the girls and Naruto who peeked out of Nozome's bag they saw that their was already two other girls in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the room's occupants has long light crimson hair, tied up into two pigtails and has light crimson eyes and has clear skin that seems very sweet in appearance. The second occupant also has clear skin and has long light brown hair, routinely tied up into a high ponytail. She has also a striped scarf. They both wear the Setouchi training school uniforms and both looked up to see the new girls enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi introduced hersef by saying, \"We'll be joining the empty - uh! I mean room 309, Hey we're your roomates, my name is Nozomi Kaminachi, I'm so thrilled to be here, I think it's great.\" Nozomi kicked herself mentally for almost saying the cursed name of the room. Sayaka then calmly said, \"and I'm Sayaka Miyata, pleased to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pigtailed crimson haired girl cheerfully said, \"Hi it's a pleasure to meet you both, anyway I'm Non Toyoguchi, I'm looking forward to getting to know you ladies better.\" Nozomi couldn't help herself when she said, \"Wow your voice is too stinking cute!\" From inside Nozomi's bag Naruto couldn't help but agree with Nozomi as he thought he would get diabetes from the sound of her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNon then said, \"Oh, I almost forgot I brought something for you, it's a little treat from my hometown.\" As Non gave both Nozomi and Sayaka some kind of chocolate candy. As Nozomi and Sayaka say their thanks and Sayaka began a conversation with Non, Nozomi walked over to the ponytail haired girl and said, \"Um, Hey there.\" The girl looked up and said, \"Oh, hi I'm Kazane Aoba.\" A pregnant silence hung in the air for a moment. Nozomi then said, \"Kaya is that all you got?\" And Naruto couldn't help but be amused at how the girls were interacting with each other, until he saw Non trip and fall on her face, he could help himself but let out a small laugh but quickly covered his mouth as his eyes widened and he was hoping that the girls outside the bag didn't hear it...</span></div></div>",

CRAP! This wasn't good! The three of them had agreed to keep as few people as possible from knowing about him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't hear anything.\" Sayaka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi, however, wasn't as good at playing things cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?! I didn't hear a thing! Certainly not a shrunken person from another dimension in my bag laughing! Nope! No sirie! Ahehehhehe...!\" she cried frantically, waving her hands in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Non asked as both her and Kazane looked at her, then turned to the ribion-wearing girl's bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a groan, Naruto knew the jig was up and climbed out of Nozomi's luggage. Shocking the two new gigirls. As Non and Kazane stared, Naruto looked up at Nozomi flatly, \"Damnit Nozomi...you just have to be an honest girl don't ya!? Don't get me wrong, I like that you are, but we agreed on keeping things secret!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi chuckled nervously at that \"Aheheh....sorry, Naruto...\" she aplogized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Non and Kazane gasped, leaning over to look at the miniture ninja in shock. Non's eye sparkled \"Wow...he...he's so...CUTE! Is that an elf?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto twitched at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. He's human, just really small. When I first met him, I thought he was a bug and then a fairy, though.\" Nozomi said, the reminder making Naruto twitch in annoyance again. \"ALRIGHT THE JOKES HAVE RUN THE'RE COURSE!!! SO THAT'S ENOUGH!!!\" he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh-Kkkaaayyyy...relax, Naruto, geeze...\" Nozomi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but its really irritating...\" Naruto growled before he started taking deep breaths to get himself to relax and calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazane reached out with her right hand hesitently. Unsure if it was ok, but she seemed nervous about it...something that reminded Naruto of Hinata almost. Though he did wonder about the twitching ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where'd he come from?\" Non asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long, and hard to believe story, trust me on that.\" Nozomi said, to which the two new girls looked down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I don't want to say...digging up bad memories and all...\" he said looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi nodded, having heard her little \"butty's\" story, she coldn't really blame him. With a sigh, Nozomi looked at Naruto regretfully, her expression asking a silent, yet personal question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her look, Naruto let out a sigh of his own, he stuck his fingers in his ears and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulping, the girl that the Uzumaki had known longest since arriving in this reality explained Naruto's story, having to include his past. As that was described, the others all grew utterly horrified. How could Naruto's hometown treat someone like that?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Nozomi finished, Naruto removed his hands from attempting to block his hearing and gave the four titanesses a stern look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save it...I don't need or want your pity. It won't do me a damn thing. That's not to say I don't appreciate it, but I've found that you can either piss and moan and feeling sorry for yourself OR you can actually get up and do something about it to improve the situation. That's why I don't or won't ever accept anyone's pity. You can't change the past, but I decided to pick myself up and move forward towards a future that I can be proud of.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, the four girls all stared. That...that was pretty awe-inspiring to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...come here, you!\" an overcome Nozomi cried, snatching him up in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gack...! Nozomi...! Crushing...!\" Naruto gasped out at the girl as he was being squeezed. Sheesh! Didn't Nozomi know that \"love you to death\" was a descriptive expression! You weren't literally suppossed to kill them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nozomi cuddled Naruto, she looked at the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can see why Sayaka and me didn't want to say anything about him. We need to keep him a secret as much as possible.\" Nozomi said, only to receive a series of deadpan stares from everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you did?\" Sayaka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi hug her head, chuckling akwardly. Point there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I don't get is why you'd want to go back there.\" Sayaka said, refering to Konoha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shrugged, \"Bad experences aside, place is still my home. Need any other reason than that?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked skeptical, but nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what'er we going to do, we don't know where to start looking for those notes.\" Non said in worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually...before Nozomi and Sayaka came to room 309, I sensed chakra from a note with my chakra in it from that Yuko girl. It was faint, but I sensed my chakra coming from somewhere on her body, I couldn't pinpoint where exactly but it's there somewhere on her body and like it or not I'm gonna have to search her body from her toes to her ponytail until I find it.\" Naruto said, already not looking forward to the task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls blushed at the thought of the shrunken blonde ninja wearing mountain climbing gear and about to climb Yuko like she was a living mountain while she was naked, but they somewhat understood and they all reluctantly agreed to help him find her so he could get this over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could sneak him out later like at night and help find her room so he can serch her.\" Nozomi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad idea...what if we get caught sneaking out of our rooms at night? Most live-in schools do have rules about that, after all...besides, even if we do pull ofv sneaking around at night without getting caught and get back here, how will HE find his way around in the dark at his size?\" Sayaka said, arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could do somethin' to leave him a trail back to our room.\" Non pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazane sighed, still being silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So during the day, we can carry him around and claim he's a lucky charm, and at night, help him find the notes from who has them...Oh! And if we face them in a Race, we can have him with us.\" Nozomi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, the group of five exited Room 309 and started creeping through the school grounds and...</span></div></div>",

Nozomi told the others that she'll stay to wait for Naruto, the rest of the girls agreed and headed back to their room to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Naruto is inside Yuko's room he soon finds her bed and crawls up to her feet and using his chakra to stick to her body and as he climbs he is also flaring his chakra occasionally to see were the note is hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto progressed in his search, there where a few close-calls such as Yuko's feet when Naruto searched there as well as her toes, he couldn't help but think to himself 'Geese who knew that Yuko was so ticklish?' as he swore when he touched her feet, he heard a series of giggling from Yuko and she almost knocked him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen when Naruto climbed up her leg, he had to stop to rest for a moment and he couldn't help but take in all of her body and Naruto had to say Yuko really kept her body in great shape and he even tried to punch her leg and his hand hurt from her pure muscles in her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto continued he kept flaring his chakra and searching every inch of Yuko's body and he even looked under her panties and ventured under them, now while Naruto wasn't crazy about a woman's neither regions he still could feel his penis in his pants becoming erect from the smell of pheromones in the air as well as the heat he was feeling from Yuko's womanhood but then he quickly turned back after he looked all over and when he came back out he was surprised to see that Yuko was still asleep but she did have a big smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring that he kept on searching and soon made it to Yuko's stomach which was rising and falling with each breath the sleeping giantess took, Naruto had to be careful here as if he lost his balance he could fall off and have to start the search all over again, so he slowly but carefully advanced forward but he suddenly stopped when Yuko snorted and saw her gigantic hand reach over and Naruto braced himself to run but he then saw that the hand ignored him and went under Yuko's panties and began to scratch an itch from her womanhood, Naruto released a relived breath and slowly continued reaching Yuko's mountainous breasts again flaring his chakra and moving he also climbed both breasts and flared his chakra and when he flared his chakra while atop of Yuko's left nipple he sensed a response from a little further and when he reached her left arm he flared his chakra again and barely felt another response from under her arm and realized that the note was in her armpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto couldn't help but whisper to himself in frustration, \"Great, this is just great, how in the name of Kami-sama am I gonna get Yuko to move her arm in her sleep? Naruto tried everything he could think of he even tried using the shadow clone jutsu to summon a legions worth of clones to lift her arm and when he almost gave up he got an idea he sent some clones to Yuko's left foot and they began to tickle her foot and toes just enough to keep her asleep and when Yuko moved her arm to reach the tickling feeling on her foot and that's when Naruto took his chance and quickly dived in her armpit and flared his chakra and was surprised to see a flash of chakra in a seal in the middle of her armpit and he could already see that Yuko's arm was falling back into place he had to act fast and quickly placed his hand on the seal and it popped into a form of a piece of paper and the seal disperses. Leaving not a shred of evidence it was on Yuko's body at all, he then quickly jumped out of Yuko's armpit just as she turned to her right-side and Naruto was on her left breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto quietly whopped at the task complete and he looked at the sleeping giantess, he couldn't help but walk up to her sleeping face and not knowing why he wanted to but he gave Yuko's left cheek a quick kiss and Yuko smiled after he did that and he quickly climbed off the bed and headed straight for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he is out of Yuko's room he sees Nozomi barely trying to stay awake and Naruto said, \"Hey Nozomi\" Nozomi suddenly jolts and looks around her until she looks down and sees Naruto hold up a piece of paper showing her he got it Nozomi then quietly said to him, \"That's great Naruto.\" as she lowered her hand for Naruto to climb on top of it and once he did Nozomi rose to full height and began to carefully and quietly walk back to room 309.</span></div></div>",

But after that, where was he suppossed to look?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling something brushing against his back, the ninja turned to see Nozomi staring at him in concern. \"You ok, little butty?\" Nozomi asked him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Just...never realized just how hard this would be until just now...\" he sighed. He was so preoccupied, he didn't even react to Nozomi's pet name for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, the girl winced and picked Naruto up in a hug. \"Don't worry, and don't you dare give up. I'll help you however I can every step of the way.\" she reassured him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smirked with a relaxed expression. Him? Give up? Ha! Nice joke! Oh Nozomi...she really would have made a grand Konoha kunoichi. On top of being fast, Nozomi had amazing core strength, yet her body was soft and she used her flexability to her advantage. Not only that, but she wasn't afraid to go up against those stronger than herself, she knew what it meant to have something important to drive you, and she didn't ever give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more he thought about it, the more part of him felt how she wasn't born in Konoha to be an example of a cruel, sick cosmic joke to the point of criminal damage. Then again, the ideals that constituted the Will of Fire were universal, you just had to open your heart and embrace those ideals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nozomi! Class!\" Miyata called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi left the window slightly open to let Naruto get some air. \"Be right back.\" She promised before going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Naruto looked down at himself. Seeing as his usual clothes needed a washing, he was clad in an outfit that consisted of a white kitsune noh mask with three ringed eyes that were colored red, a dark blue-grey robe with grey lining and a fur collar, and a tattered grey-blue cape emblazoned with the emblem of a mandala comprised of nine reddish-brown circles of varying sizes atop a larger green-grey circle. Along with that was a fighter's gi that consisted of a sleeveless dark grey uwagi, a long-sleeved black undershirt with a turtleneck, a red sash, black pants, fingerless opera-length black gloves wrapped in studded red-brown leather straps, and red-brown boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi had picked it out and all but forced him into it like a toddler playing dress-up with a doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunatly, it didn't take Naruto long to become bored. Nozomi and the others were now in class, and because they were not Elites, and they had to take classes before they can actually train for Keijo. Geeze, that reminded him of the academy but at least Nozomi spared him the boredom of the teacher's long speeches by letting him stay inside the room. But still he was bored, so Naruto went to the window and decided to watch the Elite Class students train, but even if they were giants to him Naruto could barely see them from here, so wanting to get a closer look, he went out the window and ran through the field to watch the Elite girls train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto finally made it to a good spot to watch the Elite Class train, a thought struck him: one of these girls might have a note on their bodies somewhere like Yuko did. With that idea in mind, Naruto slightly flared his chakra and to his surprise, he could sense most of the girls of the elite class each had a note on their bodies! Suddenly, one of the girls started to complain, \"Ahh! I've got an itch on my neck!\" and Naruto knew who's voice that was. It was Mio's as he stopped flaring his chakra, Mio blinked, confused, \"Huh? the itch is gone...\" Naruto couldn't believe what he just heard and quickly flared his chakra again and Mio reacted and when he stopped her itch also stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then knew what he had to do, tonight he was going to pay Mio a visit, but Naruto knew that since Mio was in the Elite Class, he knew Nozomi and the others couldn't go to her room (though Narut did have a suspition Mio WOULD smuggle Nozomi into her room if Mio could get away with it) and Naruto knew that this was one mission he would have to do alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, he tailed Mio Kusakai to her room after her practical training was over with, making good use of the stealth skills he'd developed as a prankster to keep out of sight. Hey, if he could do things like graffiti the Hokage Monument in the middle of broad daylight and out in the open where anyone could've seen him doing it and not get caught until he was done, or putting itching powder on the robes of the Hokage, the so called strongest shinobi of Konoha who had a near 24/7 guard of highly trained shinobi from the ANBU Black Ops Division, then outrun chunin, jonin and a few ANBU when he was a kid, all while wearing bright orange, then keeping himself from being seen at only a few inches tall and wearing dark colors by a bunch of civilians was easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping into Mio's room and dashing under her bed when the the first ranked examinee and supposedly the strongest student of Setouchi had her back turned to him, Naruto watched as she pulled a out of her nightstand and sat down on her bed, before writing down romanitcal scenarios in it as she vocalized what she was putting down. What desturbed Naruto was just how promptly Nozomi was featured in what Mio was saying and writing, and all of them started slow and built up to stuff too X-rated for an illeagally-established strip club brothel!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shook his head, sheesh! Jiraiya would ABSOLUTELY LOVE meeting Mio Kusakai! It was clear as day that Mio was very carefree and even when she was being taunted by her opponent, Mio only responsed by laughing, or even flirting with them instead. She even considered it her favorite hobby to tease and flirt with each girl around her and talk about dragging them into bed! The Toad would adore her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuttering at the idea, Naruto banished the idea of what would happen if such an unrepentant pervert who wrote smut for a living and someone who was such a tease-happy lesbien actually met...Naruto banged his head on the wall to banish the images that was just not going away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long he'd kept at doing that until he was sure the images were gone, he didn't know but it must have been hours later since Mio had gotten ready for bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mio fell asleep, Naruto used the Tree-walking exercise to climb up Mio's bed. Ok...time to get that note!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto walked by Mio's butt while she was on her right side, he couldn't help but put his hand against her butt cheek,  surprised at how it felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wow, Mio really has some soft skin it's almost like a pillow.' </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had that thought entered his mind than Mio turned and her butt slammed down upon him and he got stuck underneath her and he could swear he heard Mio give a low mumble that sounded like, \"Nozomi...\" with a perverse chuckle escaping her lips.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<i>'Geeze is Nozomi all she thinks about?'</i> Naruto thought with a grunt as he struggled under Mio, her butt squishing and smothering him, and as he did, he had no idea what it was doing to Mio...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- Mio's Dream Scene begin ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMio smiled, enjoying being with Nozomi on a date, as they were sitting on a floating pool seat. Mio uncharacteristically blushed, \"Nozomi, I'm so glade that you wanted to come for a swim, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words died as, before Mio's eyes, Nozomi shrunk down to and inch and a half and she then smiled and quickly ran under Mio's butt and began to struggle under her and Mio was already in a sexual high and she was already gasping from it and suddenly Mio grabbed her butt right where the miniature Nozomi was at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- Mio's Dream Scene end ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto didn't know what Mio was dreaming of and he pretty much didn't want to know, because right now he was now being smothered against Mio's butt and to make it worse, he saw Mio's hand near him and she started to paw and groupe at her butt right where he was, squishing him further!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap! Naruto muttered, feeling himself start to get hard from the contact with Mio's backside!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHY did this have to happen to him when he was a butt guy?!</span></div></div>",

Even if I do collect all of Pervy Sage's notes on the dimensional jump jutsu, there's still no guarantee that I will be sent back to my world and I could just end up someother world that's possibly even worse than this one.</i>', and Naruto could feel himself becoming hard from being in contact with Mio's butt, and it was then he heard something poof on his right shoulder and Naruto's eyes widened at what he saw, upon his right shoulder was a miniature version of Haku who he encountered on his very first mission outside of Konoha, only now he was dressed in a pure white robe, with his sandals he wore in life on his feet and seems to be carrying a solid gold harp and he also had two pure white feathered wings on his back and a shining golden halo above his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haku, is that you?\" Naruto asked in a shocked voice, and the miniature angel nodded while smiling as his first friend in life remembered his name and before he knew it, Naruto heard a second poof on his left side and he turned his head to see what appeared, only this time he wished he didn't as his eyes widened at what he saw, upon his left shoulder was a miniature version of Jiraya and he was in a skin tight red suit leaving his only his feet bare and had two red horns poking out of in his white hair and he also had two small black bat wings on his back and a red tail with a arrowhead point at the end of it and to finish his look off, he carried a long and black pitchfork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the Devil-Jiraya could begin his \"epic\" intro Naruto and Angel-Haku were both screaming while Naruto closed his eyes as tightly as he could, on the fact that his hands were too occupied in keeping Mio's butt from squishing him to death and Angel-Haku was covering his eyes as they both screamed in unison, \"AHHHH! MY EYES, MY EYES, THEY BURN!!!!\" Then Devil-Jiraya just looked insulted and yelled, \"HEY SHUT UP!!! AND THIS WASN'T MY IDEA!!!\" then he was grumbling about stupid blonde brats and stupid angels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Angel-Haku then said, \"Naruto I have been watching over you and I know fully well what you are now going through, but you must not give in to you're urges Naruto; Please Naruto think about what you will be doing and...\" before Angel-Haku could finish Devil-Jiraya interrupted him saying, \"Ah don't listen to that sexy angel on your right shoulder gaki, cause she's only been trying to lead you down the path of all that righteousness crap, Now if you only listen to me, I'm gonna lead you down the path that rules and you can have all the women's asses you could ever want, just like the one your holding right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seeing as...I'm trying...NOT to get...crushed by it...that...argument...really...isn't helping!\" Naruto grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know you still love it though!\" The Devil-Jiraya said while giggling perversely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, don't listen to him! You never listened to Jiraiya before! And I know that you won't start now, and you know it wouldn't be right! If you do this, you'll not only regret it, but you could possibly DIE!\" Angel-Haku pointed out urgently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah the gaki can't die without living a little!\" Devil-Jiraiya chuckled, \"Besides, a healthy sex life is required for a positive lifestyle! Take it from me, kido! You know you want to!\" Devil-Jiraya said with a perverted smile on his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto! Konoha shinobi are respected for their strong will, you know this! You want to be respected, you told me so yourself that's what your dream was about! Prove your will is stronger than the desires of the flesh! I know you can!\" Angel-Haku encouraged as Naruto kept pushing and squirming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Come on, kid! You need to let it go, and just feel how toned and soft that ass is!\" Devil-Jiraiya said, while reclining on Naruto's left shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, if you do this, you'll be crushed to death under her! Is that what you want? To be squished like an insect by a girl who will unknowingly just wash off your corpse down the drain when she takes a bath? If that happens, what will your nindo be worth then?! You still have things you need to do, people who still need you to be there for them, don't you?! Both in this world and your own?! If you die here like this, how can you be there for them?!\" Angel-Haku urged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevil-Jiraya while picking in his ear and flicking some earwax then said, \"Hey Tinkerbell, maybe you need a hot devil stud like me in your existence why don't we get together and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngel-Haku looked disgusted at what he was hearing and yelled in righteous fury, \"I'm a boy you pedophile old freak!!!!\" Shocking Devil-Jiraya into silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then Naruto made his decision...</span></div></div>",

Thank you, Substitution jutsu, Praise the Holy Log!\" he huffed at last, sliding down the wall to sit on the floor. Then he looked at the note. At least he was now a step closer to his goal now. That was something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unfortunately for him, his small moment of triumph was destroyed as the door to Mio's room was shattered to pieces and the still-sleeping, strongest student in Setouchi walked out of it and turned to look in Naruto's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No~Zo~mi~!\" Mio softly sang/muttered in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gawked and thought to himself, <i>'Oh CRAP! What is this chick's deal?! Finding Nozomi great, he understood; but a teenage, lesbian, sex-craving giantess, zombie with a weaponized ass!?'</i> THAT was all kinds of creepy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd why did Mio think...Naruto's eyes widened. He must have Nozomi's scent on him with how much he had and how close he was with her! SHIT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a perverse chuckle escaping her lips, Mio started patting herself between her legs. \"Don't worry, My Little Nozomi...I know JUST where you can stay with me forever...and ever...and ever...and ever...\" the sleeping giant girl said. As she slowly started stalking towards Naruto, steadily picking up speed with each step she took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto bolted as he NEVER bolted before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand Mio quickly gave chase saying, \"Ooooh, Nozomi, I just LOVE it when you play hard-to-get!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was never so afraid of anything in his whole life (except ghosts) but this time he felt TRUE fear, as he was running he could hear Mio gaining on him with her gigantic feet shaking the ground after him and quickly catching up to him in mere seconds as he can already feel Mio's lustful and hot breath against his body and just in front of them was Room 309, and Naruto was putting everything he got in this last stretch and...</span></div></div>",

It was my ever lasting love for you, that made you grow!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing that Nozomi, Sayaka, Non and Kazane put two and two together and looked at Nozomi's little bag and saw that Naruto was inside it and they all figured out what was going on, so Nozomi said, \"Yes Mio, it was indeed you're love for me, that made me grow back to normal and now it's time for you to go back to you're room now, before we all get in trouble.\" as she was now pushing Mio out the door and quickly slammed the door and heard Mio go back to her room and when she was gone Nozomi unzipped her little bag and pulled Naruto out, so can see just how angry she was and Naruto sheepishly chuckled and said timidly, \"H-h-hi Nozomi...\" and Nozomi yelled to him in righteous fury, \"DON'T YOU \"HI NOZOMI\" ME, WHERE THE HELL WERE YOU!?!?!?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto just sighed and decided to just come clean and he explained what happened, while leaving out some things that would get him in even more trouble and when he finished he stared up at Nozomi and looked at Sayaka, Non and Kazane and while they could all understand why Naruto did what he did, but when class was over and they came back and couldn't find him they where worried sick and afraid that maybe someone else found him and kept him for themselves or worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Nozomi hated to do this, she had to punish Naruto, so with that in mind Nozomi said in a voice that left absolutely no room for argument, \"Naruto while I do understand why you did what you did, do you have any idea how worried sick the girls and I where? you could have been killed all by yourself out there so even though you got another note, which we're happy for you, you must still be punished for your reckless actions, so from this moment forward until WE collect all of that pervy sage's notes or until I say otherwise, you will stay with me where ever I go and you will not be out of my sight for even a moment, and that's final!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes widened when she finished and before he could say anything Sayaka said, \"And Nozomi's not the only one who will punish you, Non, Kazane and myself also were all so worried sick about you're safety so for my punishment; you will be wearing embarrassing doll clothes and I'll parade you around the school for one whole month, and you can't say or do anything either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nand then Kazane said, \"And for making me worry so much about you, for my punishment; You will give me, Nozomi, Sayaka and Non's bare-feet massages while at the same time you clean our feet with your tongue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then covered his mouth with his hands as Non said, \" and for my punishment, You will give me, Nozomi, Sayaka and Kazane's butts a massage and if you gets a erection, then you are going to viciously get spanked until you're own butt turns red from the pain and have to start all over again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto paled after Non said that, he knew they would be mad but he NEVER thought they be this mad at him and before he could say anything Nozomi then said, \"And this will all begin tomorrow when we wake up in the morning, so you better go to sleep and you ARE sleeping with me.\" she then suddenly dipped Naruto in-between her breasts feet first until his head was above the jiggling mountains and they all went to sleep...</span></div></div>",

Fortunatly, the sarong had the back open so he could breath with his head poking out of the bottom of the space that exposed Nozomi's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Least I got Creepy out of the way this earliy...\" Naruto muttered. He shuttered, very glad he'd gotten the note from Mio Kusakai already. After explaining that and what happened with her (minus the shoulder angel and shoulder devil parts) to Nozomi and the others, they agreed on that being a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still in trouble, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, he gathering his chakra as he extended it around him into a membrane to act as a form of protection, like he had the day he'd first met Nozomi. He could get hurt otherwise, since this was a mock-race against the teachers, and he did NOT want to die in a keijo match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the layer of energy covered him, Naruto stiffened. What the?! He felt a felt a weak signal of his chakra from the plump woman and flared his chakra a bit further and to his surprise, she had a note on her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto cringed, oh...this was SO not good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi let out a small gasp as a fimilar energy spread through her and the images of a number three, a piece of paper with lines running along it, and then an image of Ms.Ujibe flashed through her head. Then the ribbion-wearing girl let out a strained, akward laugh, an annoyed deadpan expression on her face with one brow twitching as she realized just what happened and what it meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great...\" she muttered to herself. \"Guys...huddle.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls gathered around and where all gawking a second later as Nozomi hissed her message about who they were about to face having one of Jiraiya's note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just gives us another reason to win, then; doesn't it?\" Sayaka said cooly, quickly composing herself. The others all nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto...I don't want you to boost me, focus on shielding youself with your chakra. We are facing a retired pro.\" Nozomi hissed to her little butty, to which he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bell rang Nozomi did three flips towards Nagisa saying, \"I'll go first!\" And was about to hit her with her butt,  Nagisa quickly turned and slammed her butt against Nozomi's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi grit her teeth in shock and frustration, \"I can't budge her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, since Nozomi and the others were so focused on the Race, she failed to notice was the force of the impact of the strike had disloged Naruto and sent him sprawling onto the Land platform and he quickly got to his feet to avoide being stepped on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Note to self: kill the Pervy Sage for this. First thing when I get back; KILL the Pervy Sage...! Naruto muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping away from Nagisa and landing in front of her friends Nozomi said, \"Fine! Let's show her room 309's teamwork!\" As Sayaka, Kazane, Non and Nozomi herself all rushed Nagisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, trying to reach one of the girls, couldn't help but think back to Team Seven's first bell test against Kakashi as he dodged Kazane, who took the lead and began to jump around Nagisa as the teacher just stood in place with a smirk on her plump face and Kazane jumped and quickly brought her butt down, but Nagisa quickly countered it with her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned at the opening and lept onto Nagisa's leg and started to climb, taking advantage of the lack of motion to reach where he sensed the glimmer of his chakra signiture; the five vertebrae between Ujibe's rib cage and pelvis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayaka attempted to launch a butt attack multiple times perpetually at high speed, but to her surprise, Nagisa dodged all the blows, \"You're trying to copy a butt gatling, huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto clung to the hem of the ex-professional Keijo player's suit with one hand, the other covering his mouth as he tried not to hurl from motion sickness. Oh man...his was doing his stomach as few favors as his attempt to ride Gamabunta bare-back had! Thanks a ton, Miyata!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayaka jumped away from her in shock, \"She dodged them all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagisa was then about to attack Sayaka until Naruto heard Non yell, \"Watch out!\" And blocked Naigsa's attack with her soft buns. Naruto took the oppertunity to blitz-climb his way up to the note and flair his chakra, exposing it. Snatching it, Naruto was about to cross Naigsa's body onto Non's when the teacher pulled her butt away and he was stranded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Nozomi was running around the edge of the land and began to do a series of flips around the edges of the land. <i>'If I can gain momentum, maybe...just maybe...it'll make my attack even stronger!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith full momentum Nozomi faced Nagisa, \"Interesting. Bring it---\" but her eyes widened once she saw Nozomi's butt glow a blue aura as Nozomi shouted, \"Take This!\" And attempted to hit Nagisa which she jumped and did a flip in the air dodging the attack causing  Naruto to fall off of her and while no one saw it, he was struck dead-on by Nozomi's attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto screamed as he felt his body be slashed up, a lack of air like a vacuum sucking the breath from his lungs and he blacked out, being sent flying, dropping the note and landing in the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the attack missed it's target a sudden great wind hit Sayaka, Kazane and Non and what happens next made Nozomi blush in shock as the girl's swimsuits were shredded as they all yelled and covered themselves as best as they could, and Nagisa said in a shocked voice as she turned to Nozomi's shocked face, \"No way...that was... A Vacuum Butt Cannon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...happened?\" Nozomi asked, approching her friends, only for a sudden, intense pain to cause her to pitch forward, her face landing in Non's bust<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Nozomi! What has gotten into you?!\" Non cried, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My hips hurt...real bad!\" Nozomi groaned, weeping and gripping her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Medics!\" Nagisa cried and two ran up and quickly took Nozomi away, but not before she put on a pained smile and reassured her friends she was going to be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, Sayaka was surprised to see a small white slip on the Land, picking it up between her thumb and index finger. Looking at it closely. It looked like...one of those notes Naruto needed, But how did...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gasp and her eyes widening, Sayaka looked around, then quickly jumped off the Land and swam to where Naruto was floating lifelessly and scooped him with her hands and then swam back and carried Naruto to the room, Kazane and Non following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis clothes were torn to shreds, his body was riddled in cuts from the vacuum like winds Nozomi created and he was unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the late afternoon, the three girls were all worried and on their way to see Nozomi in the clinic since she'd missed class after the mock-race, but as they passed the gym washroom, they heard Nozomi singing and they all went inside and they all saw her drying her hair with a towel and she saw them and laughed sheepishly, \"Uh, hi guys...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T YOU \"HI GUYS\", US!!!!\" Soon Nozomi was being bombarded with questions like, how could she not tell them that she made a full recovery? How did she recover so fast? Did she know how worried they were?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long apology and answering all their questions (something which strongly reminded Nozomi of how Naruto must've felt last night), Nozomi smiled, \"So, where's Naruto? I bet my little butty misses me.\" she said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayaka and Kazane were silent after she asked that, even Non had a tears in her eyes, Nozomi looked confused and was about to say something until Sayaka just grabbed her wrist, \"Maybe, you should see him for yourself...\" As she Kazane and Non lead Nozomi to their dorm room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a feeling of sick dread, Nozomi folloewed them. When the fourventered room 309 and Nozomi saw Naruto, her eyes widened and she started to tear up, her breath hitched and she felt her heart seemingly stop. She rushed into the room and scooped up the shrunken blond boy, her expression of utter horror and panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nozomi what were you even thinking!? Using a technique like that, you didn't even wait for Naruto to come to us and look what happened to him; Are you even listing to me Nozomi!?\" Sayaka demanded, only to watch as Nozomi still had her back to her, but she could hear Nozomi sniffle and barely heard Nozomi talk, but it wasn't to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto...Come on, Naruto...wake up...come on...this isn't funny anymore Naruto, Please wake up...If this is for me punishing you then I'm sorry, now please wake up, please.....wake...up....NARUTO!!!\" Nozomi cried as she cradled Naruto's body against hers as tears fell from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayaka, Kazane and Non could only watch as Nozomi was crying while cradling Naruto's body while she was trying to wake him up and as Nozomi kept trying, they could see Nozomi was beginning to break down in front of them, but it was as if they no longer existed. It was just Nozomi and Naruto's battered, cut-up, unconcious body that she was aware of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Naruto! please wake up, I lost my mother this way and I don't want to lose you too!!! PLEASE WAKE UP NARUTO, I NEED YOU, PLEASE!!!!\" Nozomi wept frantically.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nozomi still crying held Naruto's unconscious body and kept trying to wake him up, she felt a hand on her shoulder and she saw Sayaka saying, \"After you were taken by the medics, I found the note and that's when I realized that Naruto was in the pool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi then lifted Naruto to her face and nuzzled his body against her cheek and she then said, \"I'm going to bed, I have a lot to think about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSayaka, Kazane and Non nodded and they all went to sleep, as Nozomi laid on her bed, she placed Naruto's body right next to her face and whispered, \"I'm so sorry Naruto, please wake up soon, I need you...\" As Nozomi fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Few Days Later---<br>\r\nFor the benefit of those that have never been rendered unconscious, it is a very strange sensation to say the least. Before you even open your eyes the first thing that comes back to you is the ability to hear. Where before it would be some kind of droning white noise, the noise begins to clear and become more and more coherent and less echoey until it is fully restored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that point your sense of feeling comes back and you try to move. It is only at that point when you try and fail due to the recent rebooting of your motor skills that you become aware that your eyes are fully open and that the reason you could not see was because you were readjusting to the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the fate that met one Naruto Uzumaki upon his reawakening. Then he cringed as memories of the pain struck him while his muscles throbbed and his bones felt stiff from extended inactivity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk...as much of a disaster as his going off alone at night to locate those notes had been with Creepy, it hadn't blown up on him as bad as the route of going after them in the daytime with the others had been! Much less note-hunting during a Keijo match!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what was...? Oh, a hand was laying across him. Popping his neck to loosen up that part of him, he turned his head to see who had him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Nozomi, who was asleep and as she slept he could hear Nozomi mumbling something in her sleep, it sounded something like,\"Mmm...Red...Whirlpools..being...crazy.\" but what really caught Naruto's attention was what Nozomi was wearing. It was some kind of swimsuit? (or at least he THOUGHT it was.) As the item in question was a full-body, unitard-like wetsuit that more resembled a racing suit that had the limbs of its wearer fixated with reinforced rubber on top of being skin-tight, causing it to compress the wearer's entire body as a way to make it be hard to do anything, even move in..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suit covered Nozomi's entire body with the exception of her face, her stomach and partly both her hands and feet and she looked like she was very uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto wobbley stood on the pillow and carefully walked to Nozomi's face and put his hand against her cheek and said, \"Hey, Nozomi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Nozomi felt Naruto's tiny hand touch her cheek, her eyes completely opened and she saw Naruto standing and before he knew it, Nozomi's hands wrapped around his body and was now nuzzling him against her cheek as tears were pouring in happiness as she was saying, \"NARUTO! Oh Naruto thank goodness you're okay! I was so worried about you!!! DON'T EVER SCARE ME THAT AGAIN! I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE SAFE!! DO YOU KNOW HOW AFRAID I WAS FOR YOU?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Nozomi was rubbing Naruto against her cheek, she couldn't help but think back to the time during Naruto's coma, when she met his mother for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- Flashback ---<br>\r\nAs Nozomi slept by Naruto's side, while Naruto's body was unconscious, his mind and chakra was still working, so while Naruto was recovering from taking Nozomi's vacuum butt cannon head-on, Naruto's chakra was still going and it had a bright red light glowing around him until the light reached Nozomi's forehead as she slept, it seemed to be reaching out to Nozomi. While inside Nozomi's dreamscape, Nozomi was having a dream of being the world greatest Keijo player in the world and right in front of her was Naruto in a very nice pair of swimming trunks, at his normal size, facing her on top of a land that was shaped like Nozomi's butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as they were about to begin, a sudden flash of red light appeared and Nozomi then saw a woman who had a slender, but feminine build, fair skin, violet eyes, and the most beautiful red hair she'd ever seen. It reached her waist with shoulder-length strands that framed both sides of her face and a black clip that parted her hair to the left. She also wore a high-collared, sleeveless blouse under a long, loose-fitting dress with a wristband on her left wrist and sandals that covered the instep and ankles, yet left her toes and heels exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman took Naruto's place and began to walk towards Nozomi, who tensed as she got close enough and put both of her hands on the sides of Nozomi's face. At first the red haired woman looked happy to see her as she gently held Nozomi's face in her hands, then before Nozomi knew it, suddenly the lady's face turned demonic and she quickly reverse fliped Nozomi straight into the Land face-first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Nozomi pulled her head out of the floating platform, she galred, \"Hey, What was that for!?\" she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red haired woman shook her head with a smirk, \"Sorry Nozomi, but you did kinda have that coming for what you did to my son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi's eyes widened in shock when the red-haired woman, who not only knew her name, but also what happened to Naruto, said that. \"Y-yo-you're son? Then that means that you're...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead simply nodded without saying anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi's eyes widened and before the red haired woman knew it, Nozomi was already on her hands and knees rapidly bowing before her repeating, \"I'm Sorry.\" A hundred times every ten seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead smiled at the white ribbon-wearing girl, \"Nozomi, I already forgave you for that, it was an accident and I also wanted to say that what you and your friends are doing for my son is a very noble thing; You didn't even have to get involved in it, but you chose to anyway; and I know that once all of Jiraya's notes are gathered, I know Naruto will never forget it. And I know without a shred of doubt that your mother won't forget it either. She's very, very proud of you and so am I for the both of you. Oh and where are my manners, I haven't even introduced myself. My name is Kushina Uzumaki and as you would guess, I'm Naruto's mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi's eyes watered when Kushina mentioned her mother being proud of her and all she's done and had a smile on her face as she said, \"Thank you, Kushina that really means alot.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good then...one last thing, this is important: I WANT LOTS OF GRANDBABIES!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Nozomi cried, utterly shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandbabies of course!\" Kushina said, rolling her eyes. \"You know; cute and cuddly and fun to spoil! With hips like yours, they would probably pop right out, especially with all that Keijo training you've been doing!\" Kushina laughed, delighted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi felt dizzy from the idea. Sure Naruto was a very dear and special friend to her, but THAT? She found herself on the fence about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too soon?\" Kushina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, better make a move before someone else stakes their claim on my boy. I happen to LIKE you, Nozomi.\" Kushina pointed out.\"Be a shame losing you because you too as long as that Stalking Wallflower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi felt a muscle in her shoulder twitch weakly and she caught herself muttering something like 'kill the bitch' at the news her \"little butty\" had a stalker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say...Miss Uzumaki-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" she groaned in displeasure. \"Don't be so formal! It's really annoying, ttebane\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi blinked at the verbal tic at the end, and then sweatdropped at how annoyed she grew at using it. \"I'll\u2026try to keep that in mind then. Would you mind if I just used your first name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I tell Naruto about you and our meeting so he can have a name and face to who his mom is?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina squealed and glomped Nozomi, hugging her tightly, \"Oh! I WANT THAT! Knew there was a reason I already loved you as my daughter, Nozomi!\"<br>\r\n---End Flashback---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU WHAT?!\" Naruto shouted at the top of his lungs. After Nozomi explained everything about Kushina she knew to her little butty, he fainted, looking stunned and positivily delighted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi smiled as she took out a cord, tied Naruto up with it, then tied it around her neck, wearing Naruto as a necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shock wasn't surprising, and she was glad hearing about Kushina made him so happy. It was a good surprise for him to wake up to. Now Naruto just needed to wake up again after fainting like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow to get to work making the Vacuum Butt Cannon her signature move to have the means to help <i>her own</i> family!</span></div></div>",

Then she noticed something, \"Huh, what's going on? That's weird, I feel much lighter than before.\" Nozomi then swung her butt back and forth but it seemed faster now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi smiled as she said to herself, \"Hey, this must be the UTM paying off, All right, I totally got this! Watch out elite class, I'm coming for ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go win this, Nozomi, I know you can!\" Naruto said as he looked up in the direction of her voice, eyes clamped shut and his cheeks red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomibeamed at the confidence her little butty had in her before she blinked. \"Huh? What's with the shut eyes, Naruto? It isn't like you haven't seen my butt before\u2014remember when we first met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded, crossing his legs at the memory as his boner acted up, \"I know...still, don't want to be indecent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it, but you don't need to worry. Now come on, let's go!\" she said, picking him up between her thumb and index finger and bringing him to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto opened his eyes, \"Wait...you're taking me with you? No way am I boosting you with my chakra, Nozomi! You worked hard to get this far! I won't undermine all your efforts like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ribbon girl nodded, \"I know. I just want you close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto went a very rich shade of red at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even have the best spot for you so you'll be safe if I use the Vacuum Butt Cannon this time.\" Nozomi smiled as she brought Naruto to her backside, her butt cheeks spread wide, welcoming him back joyously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gulped, trying to control his boner. \"Uh...Nozomi? Your butt's bigger than I remember.\" he pointed out, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Are you sure you're the best judge of that, little butty?\" Nozomi questioned teasingily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nozomi, what I mean is, due to building muscle from your training to use the Vacuum Butt Cannon, you might become less agile with your attacks. No matter how much power you have, it's useless if you can't go fast enough to hit anything. It's why most ninja from back home focus on speed training.\" Naruto pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi blinked. Huh...good point. She'd need to address that with her instructors after the Race. \"I get it. Guess that just means my little butty is going to be extra comfy and cozy then. In you go!\" she smiled, then inserted him all the way to outside her anus and closed her butt cheeks. Content Naruto would be safe this time; Nozomi proceeded to the pool, filled with new found confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile waiting at the pool, Kotone was sitting while wearing earphones and listening to her I-pod, she sighed while blushing saying, \"That's the stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotone was brought out of her thoughts when the fountain-type land was activated, and then heard an announcement, \"Group four will be competing atop of a fountain-type land, the race will begin in five-minutes, competitors please make your way to the pool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotone then sighed as she took her head phones off saying, \"Guess it's time.\" Then Nozomi walked up to her saying while smiling, \"Hey Fujisaki, Hope you don't mind, they let me draw the land; I'm so excited, I've never been on a fountain one before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Well good for you.\" Was Kotone's only reply as she said that, not really caring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi then bent down next to Kotone asking, \"Do you mind if I ask what you're listening to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi then snatches the headphones from Kotone while she says, \"Give that back!\" In a panicked voice also having a blush on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi then placed the headphones on while saying, \"I just wanna hear what you're into.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi's eyes opened in shock as she heard a guy sounding like he was in love with her, until Kotone took her headphones back and ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all Nozomi said while watching Kotone run away was, \"What the heck, was that?\" While sporting a blush on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having a chat with her friends and Hanabi and learning that Kotone is a thoroughbred it was already time to begin the race, as Kotone was already on the land looking at the clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this lands incredibly slippery, if I'm not careful, I might faaaaAAAAAAAH!!!\" Nozomi said until she slipped on a puddle and slid towards Kotone until she grabbed the top of her swimsuit and almost exposing her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing what she almost did Nozomi quickly backed away while saying, \"AH! NO! I'M SORRY!!!\"  Until she saw Kotone pull her swimsuit back into place and then Nozomi said, \"Wow, guess that's a thoroughbred for ya, you weren't even phased by... Umm, huh what are you looking at?\" Nozomi stumped by seeing Kotone just looking at the clouds with a blush and a dreamy look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Kotone sighed still looking at the clouds until she realized that Nozomi was trying to see what she sees and quickly said, \"Gah! I know what you heard earlier, but it's NOT what you're thinking, I SWEAR! I'm totally NOT into BL, not even a little bit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Was Nozomi's only reply to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The next race will start in ten seconds!\" Said the announcer as the board showed Nozomi, Kotone, Kimura and Mikawa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough the bell rang beginning the match and all the competitors stood but Kotone only had her back facing them and Nozomi said, \"What the hell? Why is she keeping her back turned? It's kinda weirding me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think that this'll be an easy win, don't ya!?\" Kimura said as she attempted to run up to Kotone to knock her off the land only for Kotone to dodge and then shove the girl away with her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? She dodged and still got a hit on me!?\" Kimura yelled in anger after seeing that her attack failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she wasn't even facing this way.\" Nozomi said as she and the other girl looked surprised to see what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She could hear you coming, if you want to sink her, you have to be stealthy!!!\" Mikawa said before she rushed in and swung her butt at Kotone, only for her to duck and grab the girl's swimsuit with her butt and would let her go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She got me!\" Mikawa said right before Kotone viciously slammed her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, she can dodge and attack without even looking.\" Nozomi said in awe until she heard Kotone say, \"I'm dying to know what happens next in weak-knee boy, so I'm going to wrap this up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was very clear that Kotone was done playing as Nozomi and the two girls could swear they heard Kotone's butt hive out a vicious loud roar, then suddenly Kotone quickly zoomed towards Kimura while still having her back at her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's gotten into her!?\" Kimura said as she barley dodged Kotone only for her to break through her defense and unleashed a savage combo on her pushing her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her butt's chasing me around the land!\" Kimura said until she dodged again while Kotone still chased after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cerby fetch.\" Kotone said and suddenly a image of a feral wolf's head appeared around her butt with it's mouth open viciously slamming into Kimura sending her flying off the land and into the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kimura has gone overboard, LOSER!\" the announcer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cerby?\" Nozomi asked, until Mikawa said, \"The rumors are true, you can knock you're opponents off with your back to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotone then patted her left butt cheek saying, \"there's only two left, let's hurry and finish this.\" Then her right butt cheek moved as Nozomi attempted to blindside her, Kotone then lunged as Nozomi quickly pulled back while saying, \"She noticed!\" and slammed her butt against Kotone's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She's reading my moves!' Nozomi thought and she saw Kotone's butt, 'Oh Crap!' Nozomi thought as Kotone three her across the land almost throwing her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The way you responded to my attack just now; you're amazing! It's almost like you're butt has a mind of it's own.\" Nozomi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, why don't you turn around and face us?\" Nozomi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotone however was looking at the clouds again, with a dreamy look on her face blushing while sighing, \"Yes...\" Until she heard Nozomi say in an annoyed voice, \" I expected more from a thoroughbred; You're just flying from the seat of your pants, don't you care abut the race!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I'm being honset, I don't care at all.\" Kotone replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotone then continued, \"I don't enjoy playing Keijo, it's just a job to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is?\" Nozomi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I have to do, is just show up and Cerby will knock my opponents off the land. I don't love it, but if i can make decent money playing, then I might as well.\" Kotone said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What the hell are you going on and on about?\" Mikawa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it, Keijo's not as important to you as much as the rest of us here, your interested in other things, what was it again?\" Nozomi said while trying to figure out what Kotone like to listen to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! I don't know where you got that idea but I'm NOT into BL!!!\" Kotone yelled in denile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, that's it BL.\" Nozomi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotone sighed and said, \"What does it even matter to you anyway? I'm ready to get this race over with, so you'll just leave me alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then bring it on! But I'm tired of looking at your back! You're gonna have to face me, wither you like it or not! You're NEVER gonna forget the day you raced Nozomi Kaminachi, just watch, you'll see.\" Nozomi said.</span></div></div>",

Not as long as you're on the land, anyway.\" Kotone said as she zoomed towards Nozomi, in pursuit of her last opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, you're persistent!\" Nozomi snapped while she attempted to make an attack, however Kotone's Cerberus dodged it and struck her in the face, pushing her towads the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can see which way she's gonna fall, knock her off Cerby!\" Kotone said as she zoomed towards Nozomi to finish her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Sayaka called out to Nozomi, and she quickly dodged Cerberus's lunge just in time to save herself and Nozomi quickly backed away from Kotone as she turned her back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, that was close.\" Nozomi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to pay more attention, if I keep rushing things then I won't be able to read her moves. Wait, why do I even care? It's not like me; I'll just leave everything to Cerby as usual.\" Kotone said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil she realized that she was on the edge of the land, and Nozomi then leaped into the air and slammed her butt against Kotone's while saying, \"I'm gonna push you off!\" As Nozomi and Kotone seemed to be in a stalemate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get her Cerby!\" Kotone said as the beast manifested again and bit into Nozomi's swimsuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got you now! The race is as good as over!\" Kotone said thinking she won, until Nozomi shoved her butt against Kotone's and began shaking her butt against Kotone's making her gasp and blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obedience class is now in session! My Vibe-Ring Hip will tame ya! Did you seriously think you're gonna beat me!?\" Nozomi said as she continued to vibrate her butt. Internally, however, she worried how Naruto was handling her using this technique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin Nozomi's butt, Naruto felt everything. The impacts he could handle...then everything started shaking like an earthquake was happening. \"Nozomi, what the hell?!\" he cried as he was thrown around inside her butt, bouncing helplessly as he was thrown about and moved about within her hot and slimey rubbery rectum, his body dragging against the tough and smooth walls made up of Nozomi's warm flesh and occasionally bouncing against his female friend's anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok...whoever Nozomi's Racing...PLEASE GET HER TO STOP!\" Naruto cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack outside, Naruto's wish was about to be granted. 'What's going on!? She's completely throwing me off my game! This has to stop! I can't take it anymore!' Kotone thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget it! I WON'T LET YOU BEAT ME!!!\" Kotone yelled as she turned to face Nozomi and used her breasts to push her away from herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Kotone and Nozomi seemed to be in another stalemate, until they broke away from each other to the opposite sides of the land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the first time, I ever wanted to fight, I've never wanted to sink someone so badly.\" Kotone said as she faced Nozomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi giggled and said, \"Well, you finally faced me! Let's go.\" she said as they faced each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grab her and throw off the land Cerby.\" Kotone said as she turned around and quickly zoomed towards Nozomi, which she dodged but then Kotone hit Nozomi with her breasts in an uppercut-like move, then used Cerberus in a follow-up combo, she then used her breasts again to slap Nozomi in the face then her butt, then her breasts again in a vicious series of combo attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What an amazing combo! I can't dodge it!' Nozomi could only think to herself as she was being pummeled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil Kotone finally pushed Nozomi towards the land's edge as she was quickly zooming towards her saying, \"I'm done playing games!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap!\" Nozomi said as she jumped over Kotone and spun in the air, \"How'd I miss again!?\" Kotone asked herself as she saw Nozomi barley dodge her attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barley evaded!\" Nozomi said as she landed behind Kotone as she then said, \"Looks like I'll have to start getting creative with my moves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She got away, let's try it again; CERBY!\" Kotone said as she then quickly zoomed towards Nozomi, but Nozomi was putting her gymnastic skills to good use in evading Kotone's attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go!\" Nozomi said as she landed away from Kotone panting for breath. \"I'm still here, but all I'm really doing is running from her attacks.\" Nozomi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, just fall off already! I'm over this lame race!\" Kotone said in frustration turning to face Nozomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not about to go down without a FIGHT!\" Nozomi yelled as she had her butt ready to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got an attack that'll finish you off!\" Kotone said as Cerberus's head appeared to cover her entire body and charged at Nozomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What's it doing!?' Nozomi thought to herself as she tried to stop herself but it was too late, as Kotone's attack hit her and sent her flying above, Kotone then cancelled the attack to see Nozomi fall into the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her hopes for victory were shattered as Nozomi flipped in the air and landed right back on the land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!? How the hell is she still standing!? It makes no sense!\" Kotone asked in shock to see Nozomi still standing on the land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't know if I'll make it, if she hits me with that big attack again I'm done for... What now? I gotta think, there must be something I can do...' Nozomi thought to herself as she was taking deep breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's is it with you!? Why won't you just fall off the land!? JUST GIVE UP!\" Kotone said in clear frustration from having to put up with this race longer than she thought was necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way that's happening! Cause I wanna win. You maybe strong, but I WON'T LET YOU DEFEAT ME!!! I swear I will BEAT YOU!\" Nozomi declared as she then began to do a series of flips building up momentum while spinning and then jumped into the air, \"TAKE THIS!!!\" Nozomi yelled as she used the very same move that had rendered Naruto unconscious and used the vaccum butt cannon at close range, though Kotone dodged it, she still saw the shockwave's power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was insane, where did all that power come from!?\" Kotone asked in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi was taking deep breaths while having one hand on her hip, \"Man she dodged, guess I'll just have to try it again, AND THIS TIME I WON'T MISS YA!\" Nozomi yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well in that case, let's get down to business shall we? IT'S TIME FOR US TO FINISH THIS CERBY!\" Kotone said as her body was again covered by the manifestation of Cerberus's head as it roared at Nozomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi began her series of flips and twists again now quickly getting enough power to use the Vacuum Butt Cannon as Cerberus began to chase after her with it's full power around the land in a circle causing rough waves in the pool around the land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'VE GOT YOU NOW! YOU'RE GOING DOWN!!!\" Nozomi yelled at Kotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'VE HAD ENOUGH, I ENDING THIS!!!\" Kotone yelled in defiance to Nozomi as the power of both finishing moves now made a maelstrom fromantic the sheer power from both moves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FINIS HER!!! VACCUM BUTT CANNON!!!/FULL POWER CERBERUS!!!\" Both Nozomi and,Kotone yelled as they slammed their respective finishers against one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth moves seemed to now be in a power struggle as neither would budge an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil finally Cerberus seemed to give in as Nozomi's Vaccum Butt Cannon dispersed the hell hound and sending Kotone straight into the pool, thus knocking her overboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...way....\" Was all Kotone could say before falling into the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grit his teeth; whatever that last clash had been, he'd felt it from where he was as he'd had to spread his arms and legs apart to stay in place. If he knew fights like he thought, that was the climax. And judging from the lack of getting wet...Nozomi won!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Knew you would come out on top, Nozomi. You're strong, fast, smart, unorthodox, compassionate, motivated, and know what matters and what's worth fighting for; I swear, Kaminashi...practicality a cruel, sick cosmic joke to the point of nothing less than criminal damage that you weren't born in Konoha...would've made one utter HELL of a kunoichi there!\" Naruto smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fujisaki is overboard, LOSER!\" The announcer said as the bell rang signalling the end of the race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Class Change race, group four, Winner Nozomi Kaminachi!\" The announcer said as Nozomi yelled out in triumph, \"HELL YEAH!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi then held out her hand out as Kotone swam back to the land and said with a smile, \"Hey, nice fight Fujisaki, I had fun racing ya, let's do it again sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. I told you, I'm NOT interested in racing.\" Kotone replied as she then swam away from Nozomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi then went to celebrate her promotion with the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was in the middle of the night in room 309, the last night in the room before the girls were moved to the Elite Class dorms after the Class Change Race, and Naruto couldn't sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all the girls were asleep and Naruto was in a sleeping Nozomi's arms, Nozomi has been acting very clingy towards him ever since his recovery and seemed to keep him in her sight. Even during her training she kept him at arm's length. Naruto knew she meant well, but this was getting ridiculous; Nozomi hardly left him alone, he was lucky she even let him go to do his bathroom needs. Speaking of training, he knew the girls didn't mean it ,but they were unknowingly torturing him while they were training all he had to do was just sit on the side lines and look like a lucky charm Nozomi carried around, and it was driving him crazy! Even in his youth, Naruto was known to never sit still for very long. If he did, he got bored and from what konoha knows; an active Naruto is a happy Naruto, and Naruto was NOT happy now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to get out of Nozomi's arms and do some training while he had the chance, so with that in mind Naruto began to struggle his way out of Nozomi's arms as he struggled Nozomi moved her body to the left and hugged Naruto further into her bosom, as if she wanted to absorb him into her body,eventually Naruto finally managed to get free of Nozomi's arms but couldn't celebrate his freedom as Nozomi still asleep somehow felt that Naruto was missing and began to struggle into looking for him as her gigantic hands (to him) searched for him but thanks to his quick thinking he made a shadow clone with more durability and just as he was done Nozomi's hand grabbed the clone and clinched it's body against hers as it silently yelled, \"TRAITOR!!!\" and with that Naruto made a break for it and crawled under the room door and went to find a good place to train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- Later ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto felt so much better now, he finally got to train and to got to stretch out his legs and it was still dark outside so he knew the others was still asleep so he decided to sneak back inside room 309 but there was one problem with that, it was so dark that he couldn't see the room numbers, not to mention the room numbers to him were at least a hundred meters high compared to him. So with that in mind, he just entered the closest room to him. Inside the room it was even darker than the hallway but after awhile he finally found what he thought was Nozomi's bed and he guessed she must have slept on her stomach, because he was walking on top of her butt and as he was almost on the other side, he suddenly felt his foot get caught and saw his foot was somehow stuck in her butt cheeks. He tried to get his foot out but the strangest thing was that he couldn't get free and he was now freaking out, until he heard a voice that did not sound like Nozomi at all, \"Good work, Cerby; now let's see what we just caught.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA growing sound suddenly filled his ears and Naruto found himself facing the transparent form of a yellow-eyed, vicious-looking wolfdog that looked bred especially for hunting composed of flaming purple aura as it manifested on her butt, his leg seemingly caught in it's jaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light suddenly clicked on, momentarily blinding Naruto and he felt a hand close around him and pluck him free of the girl's butt. When he could see again, he was already being brought to the girl's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a beautiful girl with short, messy, purple hair and blue eyes. She had on a pair of headphones, which seemed odd, and midnight blue pajamas with light purple fluffy slippers on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto froze. Not even breathing. With any luck, she would assume he was just a doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even bother. Even if I hadn't caught you going across my butt, I can feel your heartbeat through my hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn...so much for that idea. Please don't let her freak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed, \"Ok, ok...but isn't it polite to give your name before asking someone else's?\" he asked, seeing the girl's eyes widen in awe for a moment. Then she quickly regained her grip on herself; like she said, even if she hadn't caught him going across her butt, she could feel his heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kotone Fujisaki\" she introduced, lowering him onto her bed so he was in front of her face still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto Uzumaki. Sorry for disturbing you.\" Naruto told Kotone and attempted to walk off after apologising, but he was made to stop as a wall of vertical flesh dropped out of nowhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...you're not going anywhere, little pervert. You sneak into my room and going across my butt when I'm sleeping and think you get off that simply? Not a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto went pale. Kotone thought he was...CRAP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...wait. This is all just a misunderstanding. I was just looking for the way out of here!\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotone narrowed her eyes, \"Likely story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious. I mean, look at me! At my size, do you THINK I'd be acting perverse around so many giantesses and getting them pissed at me?! Do I look stupid enough to do that?!\" he yelped. Having seen the damage Righteous Female Fury could bestow upon even perceived perverts at normal human size, the whiskered blond was in no way, shape, or form going to dance in a hornet's nest by antagonizing an etire academy's worth of female giants against him by them assuming he was a pervert when he was only an inch-and-a-half tall compared to them all! That was BEYOND suicidal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, good point.\" Kotone replied after taking a moment of thinking over what Naruto just said. Looking him over, she had to confess that the point Naruto had just said made sense. Maybe he was just acting upon his base instinctive desire for self-preservation, or perhaps he was one of those wonderful (yet regretfully mythical) creatures that were long sought after by many a female known as \"the gentleman\", maybe he was both, or even that his base instinctive desire for self-preservation was teaching him to avoid being perverse around females so that he was <i>becoming</i> a gentleman; (come to think of it, if it really was the last one, Kotone would need to discover how Naruto had shrunk, she'd make a killing off of shrunken males that became gentlemanly towards ladies out of a need to survive), but either way, his argument was irrefutable in that he had every reason to avoid being perverse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sighed, relieved that Kotone had seen his point as something she could rationalize as being something a female would deem fair and justifiable in the manner of his own defense went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why were you going around at night and randomily checking rooms like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Less chance of getting stepped on with everyone in bed like this, and as for the squeezing under the doors...too short to be able to reach the windows. Need to get out of here somehow, right?\" Naruto supplied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotone nodded, no choice huh? That was utterly self-explanatory in and of itself. Still...it was risky if he accidentally ended up in the wrong room, as her accusation towards him had just now demonstrated. It was a good thing for the tiny male that she had been willing to allow him to say anything as opposed to simply dismembering him alive for his supposed criminal actions against women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough. No other option available to you, so you do what you have to. You don't mean any harm.\" the headphone-wearing young woman assessed and summarised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked relieved, \"So can I go now?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet. How did you even get so tiny, and how did you even get here to Setouchi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long and hard to believe story, trust me.\" Naruto told her, \"Also...what was that Cerby thing you did?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotone shrugged, \"Members of the Fujisaki Family are able to manifest energy constructs of mythical creatures using their will and spirit to strengthen themselves as well as act as a type of battle avatar as part of the \"Legendary Creatures Summoning\" ability we preform. I channel Cerby...short for \"Cerberus\", In mythlogy, Cerberus was the legendary guardian of the underworld. A giant, vicious, three-headed Hellhound. His duty was to make sure that the dead could not leave the underworld and to keep the living from entering into the land of the dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gulped at that, nervously rubbing his neck, \"Ahhh...say, Kotone? By that description...which of those two categories would I fall into?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotone stared at him, blinked, then she laughed so hard she rose up from the bed and fell over backwards, clutching her gut with tears in her squeezed-shut eyes as she couldn't help but kick and stomp, making it so Naruto had to avoid the light purple, fluffy meteorites that were Fujisaki's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! That question was hilarious and adorable! You're too much!\" Kotone said once her laughing fit stopped. She smiled at Naruto then she suddenly slammed her breasts on top of him and he was struggling to hold them up and keep them from crushing him into a pulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto sought to avoid being squashed, chakra as red as blood burst out from the boy, surrounding him. The aura was so powerful it actually took on a physical form, wrapping around Naruto like some sort of second skin. It took on the shape of animal, even creating ears and a single tail. Naruto's body had transformed as well. His hands had become claws, the scars on his cheeks had thickened, and he now had fangs while his eyes were red and slitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a strained grunt, he tossed Kotone off him and she gawked at seeing Naruto channeling a \"mythical creature\" power of his own, and shrouding his WHOLE BODY with it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk...Naruto had officially caught her interest! </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Naruto threw Kotone off him, he quickly ran towards the bottom of the door. But Kotone recovered and saw where Naruto was heading towards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no you don't! I'm not done with you yet... Cerby fetch!\" Kotone said, as she quickly turned around as her butt reformed Cerby's head and zoomed towards Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, still in Kyuubi mode, leaped towards the crack at the bottom of the door and just as he thought he was home free he head a loud \"CHOMP!\" as Cerby bit Naruto's tail and Kotone had Cerby throw Naruto on her bed and she pinned him under her boobs, the two mounds covered in the transparent forms of a yellow-eyed, vicious-looking wolfdog that looked bred especially for hunting composed of flaming purple aura, the other two \"heads\" of Kotone's Cerberus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kotone pinned Naruto, she thought she should examine him as she moved her face as close to the shrunken ninja to have a better look at him. Naruto couldn't help but look at her gigantic eyes and he saw his own reflection looking right back at him as Kotone looked him over. As Kotone was looking right at him way to close for comfort, Naruto felt like Kotone was stripping him and raping him with her eyes and he couldn't do a thing about it as he was pinned down by her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the red energy retracted, Kotone watched Naruto's features turn back from dark, yet strangely alluring to roguishly cute. So Naruto was a two in one package for both those type of boys, huh? She licked her lips and nodded, her mind made up. She'd learn about him over dates later, but for now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, My little one, I don\u2019t want you taken away from me so I'll put you somewhere nice and safe, and secret.\" Naruto had no time to protest, as Kotone's hand was already in motion towards the edge of her pants. She pulled them open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto flailed his arms and legs like crazy trying to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! No! This is crazy, you can\u2019t be serious! I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re going to\u2026.to\u2026oh phew\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto relaxed as he saw he was being carried past Kotone\u2019s front side, obviously to be put somewhere safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou nearly gave me a heart attack! Don\u2019t do that again, for a second there I thought you was actually considering putting me in your pu...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grew silent as he saw he wasn\u2019t being carried to safety, but rather around Kotone\u2019s backside, right above her hips where she was holding the elastic of her panties open with her thumb, her giant bare butt clearly visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt then hit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto started flailing even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNoooooo! That\u2019s even worse! I didn\u2019t even think you would do something like that! You can\u2019t be serious about this! You ca-AAAAHHHHHH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto screamed as he was dropped into the opening at the rear of Kotone\u2019s panties. He hit the elastic of the panties face-first and bounced, flipping him around, filling his view with nothing but Kotone\u2019s giant crack. Before he could even respond, Kotone let go of her thumb, snapping the panties back into place and driving the miniature orange-clad ninja straight into her crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMpppft!\u201d Naruto struggled after being shoved into the crack from the giant sudden slingshot-like force of the panties being snapped back into place. He tried to crawl out but \u201cMMMMFFF!\u201d he felt a sudden force slowly shoving him even deeper into the crack, rubbing against his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotone Fujisaki sighed in utter bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Thoroughbred bent over slightly and moaned as she rubbed her hand up and down on her ass from outside, exactly in the spot where her beloved was currently being held captive against her rear, slowly pushing harder and harder against her hips, shoving him deeper and deeper in between her buttocks. Standing back up, she relished the feeling of her tiny soulmate lodged into her backside. Sitting down to give him a good final shove, loving the tingling feeling she experienced. She stood up again and tried kneading her buttocks, causing what had to have felt like giant hard mattresses flattening him in every direction. Wanting to experiment more, the Counter-type Keijo player gave him a pat and started walking around, deliberately waving her hips to get a feel of the boy up her behind with every step. Then finally, she tried running in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto couldn't tell if the smell, the (thankfully not strong enough to hurt) crushing pressure of the titanic ass as Kotone ran, or the dizzying up and down bouncing motions like being trapped in a giant vibrating bucket of Jell-O would cause him to pass out first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling her lover struggling within her butt, Kotone shuddered in delight. It made her think of one of those tapes she listened to, about one of the male character making a promise to come right back to his lover and he went inside a cave for the sake of fighting off a giant beast, only this time, she was the cave, Cerby was the giant beast and Sweetie was her lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMORE! She wanted MORE! NEEDED TO FEEL MORE! She reached for the elastic of her panties and pulled them open with her thumb, her other hand going for her butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to pull himself out, Naruto found out he could barely push back the flesh that held him. \"Damnit....!\" he cursed before he suddely felt what had to be Kotone\u2019s fingers gripping him and positioning him so he was looking deeper into the Keijo player's butt before the digits retracted, stopping at his toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk\u201d the ninja thought \u201cyou had your fun, now time to pull me out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then felt the finger creep up his legs and rest against his hips, he groaned as her finger rubbed against his own buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" Naruto yelped, \"get your finger out of th-WHA?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCut off in mid-thought again, Naruto didn't realize that Kotone was only trying to get a good positioning as she slowly shoved Naruto even higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Naruto was just about to lose his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way!\u201d He thought \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t! She couldn\u2019t! She not going to actually\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the small amount of light that was shining through from Kotone\u2019s hand in her panties he could see her puckered anus appearing in front of his head, an asshole nearly as big as his waist!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Naruto full on screamed. \u201cOH GOD NO! YOU CAN\u2019T DO THIS! THIS ISNT HAPPENING! THIS CAN\u2019T BE REAL!\u201c as his head slowly slid into Kotone\u2019s gaping asshole with a wet, hungry slurp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Kotone was now gasping at the feel of the diminished fox-boy starting to enter her ass. She took care to make sure her Beloved went in slowly, half using her finger to push him in and half using her muscles in her own ass to pull him deeper inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tried to fight back as much as he could but it had no effect, slowly but surely, he was sucked up into the girl\u2019s ass until only his feet were sticking  out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling slightly mischievous, Kotone ran her fingers across her Beloved\u2019s feet, tickling him, wishing she had a quill feather to use instead so she could've gotten a bigger reaction. Naruto bit his lip and tried to hold it, but it was too much, and the tickling sensation caused him to trash his arms and legs, causing even more moans from Kotone as new sensations hit her. After two hours, she stopped tickling and Naruto felt his legs being grabbed, gasping from fear of the worst, but then felt a slight tinge of relief as he was being pulled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was short lived however, as when he was left with up ot his waist remaining in, he was forcefully shoved almost completely back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother pull and another push....in, out, in, out, in, out...faster and faster...Kotone was now pumping Darling in and out of her ass like a sextoy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tried to grab at anything and everything he could to try to pull himself out, but all of his surroundings were far too slippery, not to mention it only seemed to excite Kotone more, leading him to routinely be clenched within the ass while being pumped in and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly in mid-thrust back in, Naruto felt Kotone release his legs while the walls clenched on him far tighter than before from all sides, throughout the fleshy walls a moan was heard, followed by the girl he was trapped within panting, exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was worn out himself...he felt his eyelids grow heavy. After all the struggling he'd done, a nap sure sounded nice...he went limp, his body giving out and he rested.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

WHERE WAS HE?! Damn Naruto's small size! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Nozomi woke up, she was holding Naruto's shadow clone but thought it was really him until she unkowningly squeezed it to hard to poof it out of existance her eyes widened until she figured it out, Naruto must've went training!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing all the training and exercising to get into shape for Keijo had gotten Naruto restless. He had told her it was making him crazy that he couldn't keep up his own ninja training while he was here at Setouchi Keijo Training School! He said he could feel his body protesting to it and his muscles had been burning as the lack of ability to train and push himself to and beyond his limitations made his physical condition deterate and made him a stranger in his own skin because his muscles shrank and he couldn't work them properly! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, he'd snapped and had gone off somewhere on campus to try finding the most stupidly-intense training his reduced size would allow him to do last night. Now he was missing! Crap! It was like playing hide-and-seek with a bug!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecalling Naruto's restlessness and complaints, the girl felt annoyed. She clearly understood why the lack of practical training and being unable to get a proper workout, all while seeing the people around you be dead on their feet and drown in the sweat and elbow grease of their own hard work while you were forced on the sidelines as an observer...it was enough to drive anybody crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShame there wasn't a miniture, male version of the UTM. The full-body, unitard-like wetsuit that more resembled a racing suit had the limbs of its wearer fixated with reinforced rubber on top of being skin-tight, causing it to compress the wearer's entire body as a way to make it be hard to do anything, even move in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi had the suspition Naruto would've actually loved being in one if one was made for men and was in his current size. Having to deal with that would've fixed his problem easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut thoughts like that would have to wait. Where was he?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen in her search she just crashed into Kotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her butt in concern for her Sweetie's safety, Kotone was surprised to see her \"alarm clock\" was who had knocked them both over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nozomi?\" she asked as they both stood. Kotone then rubbed one buttcheek as her Dearest suddenly acted up even worse. \"Shhh...shhh...it's ok. It's ok. Nozomi's a friend. Relax. Sheesh, you're an excitable one.\" she cooed soothingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fujisaki...are you...talking to Cerberus?\" Nozomi asked while still looking around in a panic, fully remembering the battle avatar the fujoshi employed in their Race yesterday for the Class-Change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, Kotone shook her head with a blush and a dreamy smile on her face, and her eyes glazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. My fianc\u00e9, actually.\" She said before going off so she wouldn't be late to the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FIANC\u00c9?!\" Nozomi cried. Shocked. Why would...her eyes widened. Kotone had an interest towards men....and was speaking to her butt as though it were a seperate entity. While that wasn't unusual, given Kotone's Cerberus; she said Cerberus WASN'T who she'd been speaking to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn interest in men, and acting like that. Those things put together had to mean...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" Nozomi screamed, outraged, \"GIVE HIM BACK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotone froze, paling. Crap! Nozomi knew!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bolted, the furious Vaccum Butt Cannon-user tailing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they ran, Kotone was feeling Naruto being tossed around inside her butt like a rag doll, and she was getting flustered but kept running ignoring the growing blush on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the chase continued, Nozomi was like a human homing missile with Kotone as the target, she was not going to let her escape until Naruto was back in her arms (and butt) as she kept Kotone in her sights as she chased after her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When he regained consciousness, to Naruto's shock and delighted relief, he was actually looking at the interior of Kotone's room again! He took a deep breath, the fresh air almost enough to make him weep in joy and he made to move, just spread out his arms and stretch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when he noticed something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt constrained. But...why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was he unable to move his head for some reason and was forced to look stright ahead? And what was that holding the rest of his body?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the vibrations from him, Kotone's eyes widened at how fast he was awake. Then her eyes glazed over as the implications struck her. A rougishly handsome male with neigh-infinite stamina and was a quick recover after only a slight nap to put him back at his full reserves?! Damn...it just kept getting sweeter and hotter...he was practically perfect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait...Kotone blinked, screw \"practically\". He <u><i><b>WAS</b></i></u> perfect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBest of all, he was all hers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here. This outta explain things, Honey.\" Naruto heard Kotone purr, confusing him? Honey?! Why was she calling him that?! And then he felt himself swivvel and he was suddenly facing a full-body mirror, Kotonelooking over her shoulder, a smile on her face as her attention was focused on the resident of Konoha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Naruto saw caused him to start screaming in horror: his face was fraimed by Kotone's buttcheeks! His whole body up to and including his head (with the exception of his face) was stuck in Fujisaki's rear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh...shush...it's ok, Honey. No need to worry. You're safe with me. Relax.\" the girl said as Naruto started trying to thrash his way loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!\" Naruto shouted. \"What is your deal?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're my destined betrothed, we're going to be husband and wife.\" Kotone said simply, her tone was as if reciting fact about the sky being blue. She was utterly calm and deathly serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto froze. SAY WHAT?! Destined betrothed?! Naruto didn't even believe in destiny, and more importantly, he and Kotone had just barely met, they hardly knew one another!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was brought out of his shock as a fingertip covered his face and with a small grunt, Kotone pushed him fully into her butt, the place that would from now on, serve as his mobile home, all the way to where she jirked in surprise as her husband-to-be made contact with her anus. Then she yelped and pulled her finger away at a small, sharp pain similar to a bee sting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd bit her! Bringing her finger to her face, she examined it thoughtfully, seeing her soulmate hadn't even broken her skin with his act of defiance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemed getting Beloved to come to accept his betrothal to her was going to be hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPERFECT! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe beamed at the notion. There was a very thin line between easy and boring, after all. Kotone knew that; she had crossed that line before with, of all things, being a Keijo player. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was taught by her mother, a former Prize Queen, to become a great Keijo player. However, Kotone always won and started to think that Keijo was boring. Thus, she would continue to participate in Keijo in order to maintain her hobby and as long as she could make money, thinking that Keijo was nothing more than a job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after her defeat by Nozomi Kaminashi, she realized (or more like remembered, as the case may be) how exciting being competitive with someone in Keijo actually was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling her lover struggling within her butt, Kotone shuddered in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nNaruto grunted as Kotone's butt pressed in on him continusly in a rythmic fashion as if Kotone was chewing on him with her butt cheeks as if he were a piece of gum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt glad it was rythmic for one reason. Easy to predict. He knew when to crawl and when to stay still. Whenever Kotone's cheeks loosened their grip, he moved forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he neared the crack of the butt he was trapped in, a growing sound suddenly filled his ears and Naruto found himself facing the transparent form of a yellow-eyed, three-headed dog composed of purple aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCerberus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an irony Naruto could understand about this situation. Cerberus was the guardian of the underworld to make sure that the dead could not leave the underworld and to keep the living from entering into the land of the dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tisked at the construct of Kotone's fighting spirit aura before red chakra burst out from the boy, surrounding him before shooting into the air forming a spiral and the chakra seemed to form the head of a kitsune that equaled Cerberus in size. Then the kitsune head lunged forward like a snake and slammed into the Hellhound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they collided, Naruto's surroundings clenched and he realized the horrible mistake he made: giving his captor what she wanted yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nKotone howled. \"Oh...Ohhh...AAAAAHHHHHH....YES! Yes, yes, yes! Gahhhh! I...! THAT'S THE STUFF!\" The girl's breathing picked up as her face flushed and her nipples went hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis sensation....his own \"mythical creature\" energy...the feel of Cerberus colliding with her Beloved's \"kitsune\" power like this! The sheer feel of the energies coliding in a seeming carnal battle for dominance was chaotic bliss. Both beautiful and horrible in the way an atomic explosion was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like a shark swimming in a person's bloodstream! It got her that worked up and excited! On top of that he JUST! WOULDN'T! STOP! STRUGGELING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe combind two sensations, Naruto's struggles and the collision of her Cerberus and Naruto's kitsune, had her heart pounding as fast as an out-of-control train and her blood feeling as lot and thick as lava!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooohh!...you're a lively one, Darling! I adore it! You're absolutly amazing!\" Kotone shouted, feeling her knees buckle as she panted. She'd never felt this excited before! The cherry on top was that Kotone possessed a special sensitivity towards the vibration. She raced in Keijo by moving based on the Land's vibration, making her capable of reading and predicting her opponent's movement through the Land without even looking at them. Since her lower half was very sensitive, her weakness was the vibration itself. Thus she was unable to take any attacks with a vibrating sensation. Still...that same sensitivity was what made his struggling feel so much more divine right now!<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nAfter Kotone's reaction to The Kyuubi's and Cerby's clash, Naruto had an idea, but he wasn't going to like it. He was going to give Kotone what she wanted. Maybe if he did, she'd at least pull him out of here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe now began to stroke a piece of the flesh inside Kotone's butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did that, Naruto's surroundings clenched and vibrated in response and he heard Kotone's moans of pleasure though muffled, and Naruto took that as a sign of his plan working as he them began to rub his body against the muscles and continuously rub them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of pleasuring Kotone, Naruto then dropped his pants and began to rub his manhood against her butt walls, feeling Kotone's butt shake, Naruto then started to lick her butt muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto felt Kotone's butt violently shake and he then hears Kotone's muffled screams of pleasure after he began to punch, kick, scratch, bite, lick and rub his whole body inside her butt. The whole while, Naruto was struggling with himself; out of the T&amp;A-fan department, Naruto was a butt guy...and Kotone had trapped him in her butt with pleasing her being the only way he'd get out! (DOWN! Bad, erection! DOWN!!) If that part of him overroad his rational thought and made him go utterly wild with pleasing Kotone from inside of her butt, he'd be a victim of his own plan. It was suppose to be ether Naruto's plan worked, Kotone passed out and he'd escape, or Naruto's plan would fail and Kotone wanting more...but he could feel his self-control slipping the more he was inside Fujisaki's ass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't how this was suppose to work! It was either good or bad; not a choice between bad and worse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end (no pun intended), Naruto realised too late that he'd doomed himself with this scheme as the results of his plan turned out to be...</span></div></div>",

Keep going my love! Make my knees weak! I want you to make me spill my love nectar just for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then knew he was trapped. And he was now feeling more of his self-control slipping the longer that he was inside Kotone's ass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to think of what to do was very hard for Naruto, as it seemed that every step he made inside her butt, Kotone would react to it by having her butt shake like an earthquake and throw him around like a rag doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Kotone was on her last legs as she looked like she would fall any second from feeling Naruto bouncing around inside her butt, she would swear she cummed at-least three times already and counting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe already couldn't wait to make their marriage official and go on their honymoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto NEEDED to get out of here! But the fact was, Kotone wasn't going to allow that unless SHE yanked him out herself! But odds of that were she'd avoid that, unless he really turned her sensitivity against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But how...?' Naruto thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking on things and trying to figure out how to do that; an idea came to mind, one that made him grimace in disgust and self-loathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so going to need some SERIOUS therapy after this...\" he muttered to himself, then rapped his knuckles against one of Kotone's butt cheeks; feeling grateful that the ninja academy back home taught morse code and that Iruka-sensei had twisted his arm and beaten the lessons on it into his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, his surrounding shook as a message of \"show me\" was sent to him, most likely by Kotone pawing at her buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuddering, Naruto approached the girl's anus. To think that he had to do this! Butt-guy or not, there were just some lines that you do NOT ever cross!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then teasingly ran his fingertips outside of the hole, lightly stroking it, caressing the flesh. Seeing it widen as his actions relaxed the muscles holding it closed. Taking advantage of that, Naruto took a deep breath and let out a long, soft blow of air up Kotone's hole added onto his work with his hands. Wincing, Naruto leaned forward and planted a series of light pecks against Kotone's anus, getting it to open further as he kissed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it was wide enough for his head, the Uzumaki reluctantly stuck his head in and lapped lightly around the edges of the hole with his tongue while doing his caressing and blowing routines along with it, shuddering and grimacing in utter disgust as he did so. This had better work and get Kotone too worked up to where she couldn't stand it and pulled him out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotone was blushing a very <b>DEEP</b> shade of red while she bit her lower lip for a good few seconds, before she suddenly gasped in shock then let out a loud moan of pure bliss as she felt what Naruto was doing to her anus! She was pushed over the edge as she felt Naruto had teasingly ran his fingertips outside of her hole, then she shivered as she felt Naruto blow right into her anus, then she giggled at being tickled by her beloved's light kisses against her anus and finally she nearly screamed out in pure ecstasy as she felt her beloved shove his head inside her anus and began to lick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly grabbed her pillow and began to hit herself with it, trying to calm herself down while rebiting her lower lip, but her neither regions were building up pressure until she couldn't take it anymore, and before she knew it she screamed out loud, not caring if anyone woke up from it, \"I'M CUMMMIIIINNNNNNG!!!!!\" As her love nectar flooded out of her and soaking her panties.</span></div></div>",

As the water was filling the tub she looked at herself in the mirror, well...more specifically, her butt that still had her beloved inside and had a rather fun idea. She then turned the water off when it was at just the right temperature and slowly got in the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotone then began to push her beloved's head out of her anus and use her muscles to gentally and slowly push Naruto out from her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto felt his head being gently pushed out of Kotone's anus until he felt his whole body become wet as he opened his eyes and saw Kotone's entire lower body, especially her nether regions and her pubic hairs swaying underneath the bath water. Realizing he could try getting away, the shrunken ninja quick swam upwards and his head broke the surface of the water, only to lock gazes with his self-proclamed betrothed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotone, seeing her darling floating in the water, had a very \"fun\" idea and thought that she should give her beloved a full tour of her body; after all it, was all his too. And what better place to do that than in the bath. So she grabbed Naruto and began to scrub him across a soap bar and lather him up and then she dragged his body against her feet,  both of her legs, her thighs (though Kotone did skip her womanhood) as she went straight to her stomach. After that, things got more akward as he made it to her breast as Kotone kept trapping him in-between her breasts while smothering him. Then both of her arms and hands, before doing her back, thann her butt (which Kotone payed extra attention to) before lifting him back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now he was being scrubbed her neck and after that, she finished up with lowering Naruto on top of her pubic hairs and then she brought him to her lower lips and held him there for a good few minutes before rubbing Naruto headfirst against her lower lips until they accepted his head and began to suck him inside her until he was fully inside her pussy. Once he was, Kotone moaned as she pumped him in and out for an hour and pulled him out and washed him off, drained the tub, and got out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the bath, Kotone with Naruto in her hand, then grabbed a nearby towl and began to rub her body and Naruto's dry and while she dried herself, she then had a kinky idea as she made sure Naruto was still in the towl and moved the towl towards her pubic hairs and made extra sure Naruto's body was there and once he was, she began to quickly rub the towel and Naruto against her pubic hairs and she was loving every moment of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finished she looked down and smiled at the sight of Naruto spreadeagle tangled in the hair that made up her \"love bush\" and looked like he wasn't going anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto struggled to free himself, Naruto felt his jaw drop as Kotone's hand lowered to fill up his vision, then came an him, lightly squishing him inthe the bush hair before lifting off him for a second before squishing him againsther again, patting him. With each pat, Kotone gasped and shuddered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...they just HAVE to meet you, my love!\" Kotone gasped, face red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who...do you...mean?\" Naruto grunted as she kept patting him into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My family on Butt Island. Privet property owned by my family, we live there. You'll like it. And you can bond with your in-laws that way. My older sister will especially like you!\" Kotone sighed blissfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto paled. ISLAND?! No way...she wouldn't! If he got sent away from Setouchi, he would most likely never see Nozomi again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Wait just one second! Where the HELL did that come from!? Nozomi and him were just friends! But...why did he feel dishonest at thinking of her as only a friend? And why was Nozomi a higher priority than the notes he needed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevermind...he'd figure that out later! For now he had to get Kotone to reconsider doing this to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kotone...wait! If you mail me to that island, wouldn't that mean being away from you?!\" he yelped. Oh...he was going to hate this, but he had to use how enamored with him he was to his advantage, otherwise he'd belong to Kotone for the rest of his life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotone froze. Say WHAT?! Be away from her?! The idea was horrifying! Her butt needed his warmth! Being away from him would be horrible! But...the idea of her beloved locked up tight in a gilded cage in her room, awaiting her arriving there...it was thrilling!

I mean sure she's a beautiful girl and wait, where did 'beautiful girl' come from? What's going on here!?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Naruto was having his internal crisis about why he's been thinking about Nozomi and why he found her to be in the center of his thoughts, Kotone was thinking about what she said about her and Naruto's marriage and their future together...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- Daydream ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotone saw herself walking down the Isle in a pure white wedding dress with her father holding her arm, and passed by her family members and their infront of her was her darling, her soulmate, her love... Naruto standing on a tall stool in his wedding tuxedo of purest of white, the then said their vows and they passionately kissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she saw them alone while seeing herself naked as well as Naruto and her forced himself (literally) inside her womanhood as she gasped and moaned in pure exstacy as Naruto found what he was looking for and began to shove his manhood inside her cervix to impregnate her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she saw herself and Naruto together with their children and they where a mixture of themselves, like one was a girl that had Naruto's blonde hair and had her eyes while another was a boy with his mother's hair and his father's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotone then invisioned that she and Naruto were on their anniversary they looked so happy together, Kotone with her husband sitting in the palm of her hand and were about to kiss until suddenly Naruto dissappeared and she ound herself standing on the Keijo land then suddenly a gigantic shadow covers her and the land as a gigantic figure rose from the water and it was a gigantic sized Nozomi that ominously said her name, \"KOOOTTOONNNEE...\" and Kotone's eyes widened as she saw her beloved in Nozomi's hand, then suddenly the gigantic Nozomi use her vaccum butt cannon at her, then everything went white...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- Daydream End ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kotone snapped out of her daydream, she heard someone knocking on her room door, and she quickly got dressed also loving how Naruto struggled in her pub hairs and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kotone opened the door she was shocked to see a young teenage girl with red hair, She has a bob haircut with a blue ribbon hairband, wearing the Satoshi academy jacket and a shirt with paw prints in pink colors, light blue bike shorts and white sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Kotene's big sister Ai was the one knocking on her door, Ai however she had some bad history with their family as Ai learned that, due to the Fujisaki Family's influence, she was not allowed to build a deep relationship with regular Keijo players. Ai was against that rule, disagreeing with how her family forbids her to build a deep relationship with ordinary players, as they choose to keep their prestige. As a result of this, Ai then abandoned the name Fujisaki, changing her name into \"Ai Shinonome\", and leaving home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi then gave her \"baby\" sister a big hug saying, \"Kotone-chan! How's my little baby sis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotone struggling to breath could only day, \"I'm doing okay, sister... can't breath...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi caught the hidden message and released Kotone but smiled as Kotone took in a deep gasp of air and she asked, \"So guess what Kotone-chan... You're Big sister is now a assistant teacher in good old Satoshi which means we can live in this room together like we were little, isn't this exciting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKotone didn't know how to answer that, she loves her sister but there were times that she was so annoying to her as she always liked to tease her ever since they were little, like when she had a male doll that she was attached to Ai would sometimes say that Kotone has a boyfriend, or say that her Cerberus was such a cutie, wooey, puppy-wuppy, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi then began to look around the room invisoning where to put her bed and stuff until she found Kotone's earphones and tape player and put the earphones on and suddenly she heard two men lovingly speak to eachother and to Ai the lines were so cheesy that she began to laugh in hysterics at how bad it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her laugh fest, Ai took off the earphones and saw that Kotone looked like she had to go to the bathroom but had a blush and a small smile on her face and Ai said, \"Kotone-chan are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing her sister's voice, Kotone flinched and quickly said, \"Oh yes, I'm fine, no worries...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAi somehow knew that Kotone was lying and walked over to her sister and looked Kotone right into her eyes and after a moment, she then...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It has been almost a whole week since the mock race against Nagisa and Naruto been knocked unconscious and over that time, Nozomi and the girls took turns to watch over him whenever they could but between having classes and training they hardly had enough time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was during the time that Nozomi and the girls where in keijo training class that a crimson red chakra began to cover Naruto's body and suddenly his eyes opened, only to have changed from sapphire blue to crimson red and had virtical slit pupils, and his whisker marks have seemed to have thickened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Naruto spoke in a voice that was clearly not his own, but in a voice that was filled with absolute malice and hatred, \"Ah, Now that's more like it. Though because of my damned jailer being unconscious, I can't fully absorb his body and restore my own....Oh well, I suppose beggers can't be choosers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, it was the Kyuubi or as he prefers to be called, Kurama is now in control over Naruto's unconscious body and he watched everything happen through Naruto's senses, and it only had one objective in his mind; Find Jiraya's notes Naruto has collected so far and destroy them; Because without the notes Naruto can't return to the elemental nations and if he can't return to the elemental nations, then all Kurama has to do is just wait it out and then eventually his jailor will just DIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once that happens, there will be NO more sealing, NO more Hokages, but most importantly NO MORE OF THOSE DAMNED UCHIHAS!!! He will be free to destroy what he wants with NO one to ever stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he had to do, was just find those notes and destroy them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, where did my jailor hide them?\" Kurama asked himself, since Naruto was now unconscious he couldn't steal the information from the boy's mind, so Kurama had to find those damn notes the old fashioned way, with his jailors eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with that in mind, Kurama quickly began his mission and searched room 309 from top to bottom, but no matter where he looked, Kurama couldn't find those damned notes and with each failed attempt, his anger and frustration increased until the room itself looked like something out of a natural disaster movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAHHHHHHHH!!!! DAMN YOU GAKI!!!! WHERE ARE THOSE NOTES!!!!!!\" Kurama roared in all his anger at his failed attempts to find and destroy those stupid pieces of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a moment to calm himself down Kurama then had another idea as he said to himself, \"If I can't find and destroy those damned notes, then I'll just move my jailor somewhere far away, where he can't possibly find them at all until he dies, either way I win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with that in mind, Kurama then crawls under the bottom of room 309's door and tries to find a way out of the academy and to get Naruto hopelessly lost somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walks, Kurama was also being extra careful to not be seen, sure he maybe an all powerful being of chakra but while he was in this human prison he did not want to die by these damned gigantic humans, so he stuck to the walls as much as he could, until he happens to hear some of those giants seem to be in a conversation with eachother as he approached the teacher's lounge, Kurama saw Nagisa talking to some of the other teachers and some other giant while seemingly putting things in some kind of package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...this is addressed to Suruga, not Setouchi.\" Nagisa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama blinked. What or where was \"Suruga\"?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSounded like a place those affiliated with Setouchi weren't welcomed. Grinning maliciously, Kurama rubbed the hands of his borrowed body together, then formed an outfit consisting of a carmine-and-black, two-toned, zipped-up jacket that covered \"his\" upper body, a single notched belt, and a pair of matching colored pants with black boots all using energy manipulation to construct it out of raw chakra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding to himself that this was presentable, the fox heard the three teachers talking about something called the East-West War happening against Suruga. Kurama blinked...seems Setouchi and Suruga had a fude similar to the Senju and Uchiha clans did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPERFECT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, Kurama muttered \"Meisaikagure\" and his image distorted for a moment before he disappeared completely. Being a pusdo-child of the founder of chakra-useage, Kurama wasn't restricted to hand sighs to use chakra-based abilities like the invisibility/camouflage jutsu he'd just employed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneaking over to the desk, he started to climb, his claws and strength easily punctured the desk and he climbed up it hand and foot like a ladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once he made it to the top, Kurama rushed right to the package and quickly but carefully dodged Nagisa's plumped fingers just as she closed the lid of the package and gave it to the mail carrier as he apologies for the inconvenience and quickly leaves to deliver the package to it's rightful destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being inside the package for a good long while, Kurama was getting dizzy until he felt the package was now being carried and placed down on the ground and heard some knocking until he heard someone say, \"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Package delivery for...\" The delivery carrier said, as the package was given to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Kurama struggled with whatever he was inside the package with, he felt the package move as the mailman must have gave the package to the person it was for; then he stopped and sat still, feeling the package move and before he knew it, Kurama felt a pull on Naruto's seal and he felt like his conscious was being pulled back in and Kurama refused to go back without a fight <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"No! I will not go back!!! I refuse!!! Damn this accursed seal!!! and Damn that fourth Hokage, Damn Kushina and Damn Naruto, Damn you three to HEEEEELLLLLLL!!!!\" </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the nine-tailed demon fox was fully pulled back into his seal, Naruto slowly opened his eyes and was very confused at his surroundings. Where was he? where was Nozomi? where's Sayaka? where's Non? where's Kazane? where's the Setouchi Keijo Training School? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Naruto could figure things out, he saw one of the walls open up and he was blinded by sudden light before it was blocked by something. When Naruto's vision returned, he saw the gigantic face of a girl with long blonde hair with her bangs parted to the left. Her eyes were crimson, and she had a large red ribbon that she wore tied so the ends stuck up like cartoon rabbit ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked. Who was this?! She wasn't anyone he recognized from Setouchi. Naruto froze as the girl looked at him, frowning. Then picked him up and lifted him out of what he saw was a box. What was odd was her grip: it was completely relaxed, but there was just barely any real grip to it; like she was utterly terrified that she'd break him with the slightest bit of pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Naruto was complaining if she was going to be delicate with him. Still, who was this girl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the girl, Maya, frowned, picking up the small doll. She'd ordered a training dummy by mailorder, and this was it? She looked in the box again. Then blinked. Oh, there was a larger inflatable dummy in the box, too. Maybe the smaller one was for practicing precision moves using a person's nipples? That would make sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the smaller figure down, Maya took out the larger training dummy and set it up. Once it was inflated, she started making it rock backwards and forwards, counterattacking at the last minute with her butt and boobs. She was a 'Counter-type' player, after all. As she kept batting the training dummy, Maya was constantly thinking of how her mother told her that she was expecting her to win and show why their school should be the ONLY Keijo school in Japan and to completely dominate over the Setoushi students they were going to battle against. As she was training that was the only thing she thought of and the stress was getting to her and soon enough she begins to think, 'What if I fail?' the mere thought of failing was too much for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she failed...if Suruga Keijo Training School actually <i>lost</i>...she was terrified that she'd be discarded. If that happened, she'd be alone again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya shivered, rubbing her arms as if there was a sudden chill. She <u><i><b>HATED</b></i></u> those memories! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow she was abandoned by her biological parents, giving Maya a trauma of being reminded her of both her \"papa\" and \"mama\" and was made to live in an orphanage...How she was seen as a troublemaker and shunned because she kept accidentally breaking stuff around her due to possessing a great amount of strength, but not knowing how to control it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only good thing was that around this time, Maya began to manifest her split personality, Kaya. Kaya, as much as Maya hated admitting it, could take the pain where Maya couldn't. She was stronger than Maya was, and only wanted to protect her. The two personalities were more like sisters than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings got better when, one day, a well-known Keijo player, Ayako Sakashiro, had visited the orphanage where she lived to donate some stuff there. When Maya broke a bed, it caught Ayako's attention. Ayako then asked Maya to hit the bed with her butt as hard as possible. Maya did it and broke the bed effortlessly. After that, she was adopted by Ayako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer family...her home...her place to belong and sense of purpose...to say that Maya owed everything to Keijo was an understatement. That was why she couldn't afford to fail! If she did, then things could go back to how they were before, and she didn't want to back to the place where she wasn't needed and was utterly alone again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto watched, the girl's breathing picked up and became irregular, she fell to her knees, she broke into a sweat, her skin paled and grayed, her eyes became lackluster while her pupils dilated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes widened in alarm. She was going into shock!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was about to call for or go find help, she suddenly stopped and relaxed. What was surprising was that as she did so, her hair turned silver and she stood back up. Naruto watched in shock as her butt glowed with internal energy and the now silver-haired girl slammed it into the dummy, bursting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't fail, Maya; I'm here, and failure is out of the question...We'll take down Setouchi, so don't worry. I won't let you loose where you belong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stared, so the girl was named Maya, if how she was addressing herself in the third person was anything to go by. And from what he heard, he was no longer at Setouchi! Ok...where was he?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I know, I know...\"Kaya can't come out without permission\", I heard mom, same as you did. But I'll give myself permission if it means making sure you keep the place you belong, Maya. You know that, and so does everyone else here at Suruga.\" Maya said, apparently talking to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gawked. Split personalities?! And this one called herself \"Kaya\"? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaya then suddenly realized what she just did and scowled \"Aw shit, and we just bought that model too! \"Nearly indestructible\", my ass! Those were just my love taps and it blew up after one tap from me...\" she sighed in aggrivation, \"...Where's that little stress toy? Maybe a few qi-powered juggles should calm me down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, and after seeing \"Kaya\" ultimately destroy her new training dummy, Naruto was terrified at the mere thought of what she would do to a human and was about to attempt to run, but he felt Kaya's footsteps shake the ground until she grabbed him and brought him up to her face and studied him. \"Well, this one does look cute, I hope it's more promising than the dummy it came with.\" Kaya said. With that, she tossed Naruto into the air and positioned her butt just where Naruto was about to fall and soon enough, Naruto was quickly and violently launched back into the air after barely touching the surface of her butt, and this continued for a while, and after at least five times of this, Naruto was in agonizing pain when Kaya's butt hit him again, so he tried to call upon his chakra and enshouded himself in it to at least soften the blows but suddenly Naruto soon found out that whatever this \"qi\" was, it seemed to have an effect with his chakra. He hit Kaya's awaiting butt, and with that his chakra reacted to her qi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two energies mixed, they immediately repelled each other like how two magnets did, and forced them away from each other. With a boom like a cannon firing, Naruto was sent higher into the air, slamming into the celing and falling to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kaya was suddenly pushed forward but she quickly regained her balance, \"Whoa...just what  the hell could've done that?\" She then looked at the small doll that just landed on the floor in shock, \"It couldn't have been the doll, but there's no one else around... Maybe I should take a better look at it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaya then reached for the doll and raised it up to her eyes and begins to examine her toy. Kaya looked at the supposed \"toy\" with a suspicious stare, as if she was daring it to do something, until she had an idea, \"I don't know how and I don't know why, but I think you're hiding something and I'm going to figure out what it is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then began to poke and probe Naruto's body with the tip of her index finger, tracing his body all over and when she touched the figure's crotch she felt something, and as she did this, Naruto was struggling to not respond to Kaya's finger touching his body until her finger stopped right on top of the possible traitor of his whole body...</span></div></div>",

A toy? Ticklish?! But toys couldn't feel anything. And come to think of it, this toy didn't feel like plastic. In fact, it felt like...skin? What was up with this thing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, little cutie...ready for your interrogation?\" Kaya teased before she shoved the strange figure in between her breasts and began kneading them against the toy and couldn't help but release a moan of pleasure. As she did this, Naruto was blushing and as he was still mainly an ass lover, he couldn't help but see what other males loved about breasts as he was being rubbed and moved around in between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of that, Kaya then pulled the figure from her breasts and then placed it in between her butt cheeks and began to massage them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto could feel like he could die happy, if his manhood standing tall was of any indication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling the doll from her butt, Kaya then had an idea as she plucked a hair from her head and began to tickle the toy with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was desperately trying not to laugh as Kaya was tickling him and before he knew it, Kaya's hair hit his underarm and Naruto burst out laughing and before he knew it, he was busted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaping in shock as the \"toy\" laughed at being tickled, Kaya quickly recomposed herself and the silver-haired girl grinned, \"Gotcha...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto seeing that the jig was up, looked up to Kaya as she held Naruto in her hand and Kaya aimed a threatening glare at Naruto's form that quickly killed off his laughter and said, \"You have exactly TEN seconds to tell me everything about who you are, where you came from and why you are so small, or I'm going to \"Break\" you just like I broke the dummy you came with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was panicking as he just saw how she destroyed the dummy he was inside the package with and was sweating bullets and just as he saw Kaya raise her left hand to crush him, Naruto quickly yelled, \"WAIT!!!! I'LL TALK, I'LL TALK!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her threat fully work she stopped and simply told the tiny ninja, \"Then start talking and maybe I'll go easy on you... MAYBE...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...how?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaya thought for a moment, \"Okay shrimp, I got an idea, I'm willing to let you explain yourself, by telling you a bit about myself but once I'm finished I expect you to do the same and depending on what you say will determine of how I deal with you.... and DON'T even think about lying to me or I'll just break you right on the spot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gulped and nodded. Seeing that, the ribbon-wearing girl set him down. Kaya stared at Naruto for a little while and said, \"Alright, shrimp. You're going to shut up and listen to me, and when I'm done, you are going to tell me everything, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto didn't know what was going on here but he just silently nodded and Kaya spoke again, \"Good, now my story all began when Maya was a young girl...It all started from when Maya was young and her biological parents abandoned her, after that, she lived most of her life in an orphanage, then for reasons unknown to her she broke things from toys to furniture and getting into trouble to the point where all her so-called \"friends\" abandoned her when times got tough, then if that in itself wasn't enough, all the other kids began to call Maya a freak because of her powers and even got her into trouble wither she was at the scene of the crime or not, that's when I began to manifest and let's just say, that I made sure I taught those cowards a lesson...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope it hurt!\" Naruto snapped. Kaya stared at that, slightly upset at the interruption, then she noticed that Naruto was scowling, DEEPLY scowling, and his body shook with forcibly suppressed rage. It made Kaya raise a brow, but she smiled thankfully that he supported her actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then one day, our mother arrived, sure she wasn't planning on adopting anyone at first and to just donate some things to the orphanage, but when Maya broke the bed that mother had just given to us, it caught her attention, then she asked Maya to hit the bed again but this time with her butt as hard as possible, which she did and and the bed broke effortlessly. After that mother adopted Maya, and when she found out about me, she accepted me to boot. She even bought us this ribbon that we share.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled at that, then his eyes widened, \"Maya went into shock earlier because she was thinking about that, wasn't she?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaya nodded grimly, \"Yeah...it's why I took over. So...what about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto winced, \"Well, my name is Naruto Uzumaki...I didn't have the best of childhoods. Because of some issues during my birth I lost both her and my dad, and as if being orphaned weren't bad enough, growing up people would either treat me like I didn't exist or like I was some nuisance that they had to deal with because they had no choice. Nobody told me why and whenever I asked the leader of my hometown, one of the only people to give a damn about me, why, he'd just dodge the question, telling me they needed time,\" Naruto said with sorrowful look crossing his face. Just because he had come to terms with his past and the emotions that had been borne of it, didn't make it any less shitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the silver-haired girl could only feel both anger and sadness. Anger that not only was someone as genuinely kind as Naruto having been treated like he didn't and shouldn't exist, but equally angry that no one told him why. To just leave him, a child no less, in the dark like that was cruel. It was for those same reasons that Kaya was saddened, to hear how a child was left alone - no one to care for him, no one to tell him he was loved, no one to tell him that he mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I wasn't abused, psychically at least. Wasn't till I was thirteen that I found out why I was treated so differently. It wasn't for another three years that I found out why no one was allowed to touch me or even try to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did raise some questions. Despite the people no doubt knowing of Naruto's status, he was never harmed physically which was odd. If they so despised his existence what had stopped them from taking out their disgust and aggression on him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I turned sixteen, my godfather told me that my village's leader, the man I saw as a grandfather, had ordered that no one harm me or they would be put to death and he had an almost round the clock guard of our most elite black ops agents to make sure the law was carried out. At first I wondered why I needed so much protecting. My godfather answered that too. My father had been our previous leader. Ironically the people had loved him and he had been poised to become one of our hometown's strongest, but he had died the night I was born, defending our home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaya couldn't help the scoff of disgust that escaped her lips. To love the father, but hate the son for something no one could control was abhorrent. It truly showed how narrow minded some people could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaya was thinking to herself but noticed Naruto slowly attempting to escape from her and her eyes narrowed and before he knew it, Kaya raised her left foot and quickly stomped on his body and asked in a low voice, \"And just where do you think you're going....Na...ru...to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thinking about the past depresses me...wanted to go somewhere to vent...\" the shrunken blond grunted<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding as she got off him, Kaya couldn't help but think that he did look cute, so she picked up Naruto and brought him to her face, and she couldn't help but suddenly kiss him, and kissed him again and again. She just couldn't stop herself, she felt a bond between them and she felt connected to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was just like her and Maya. Sure she didn't learn else like why he was so small and how he got there, but as far as she was concerned, she'd been told the IMPORTANT stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting to grin, Kaya cuddled the Uzumaki against her bosom,  whispering to him as if Naruto were a kitten or a puppy or a favorite stuffed toy. \"There, there...hush...it'll be all right, Naruto. You...me...Maya...we'll never be alone again. After all...we're together.\" She pulled on the front of her panties by only a little bit and she tucked Naruto in, so only his head and shoulders were above the waistband before releasing her grip; the giant, sudden slingshot-like force of the panties being snapped back into place driving the air from Naruto's lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...the three of us are together. And we'll never be apart. I will need to explain to Maya about you, but I can honestly say this much: I'm never letting you go, my lover!\" Kaya smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto paled. Kaya...she...! Lover?! Maya wanted to keep him as her lover?! Just great! A girl with a split personality\u2026 and one of those personalities had just decided she liked him! This was NOT something he needed right now!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Kaya's make-out session with Naruto and pinned him in her panties, she got an idea of what to do next and seeing as there was still daylight, she simply thought to herself, <i>'Perfect.'</i> and looked down to Naruto who was sweating and cooed at him, \"Oh, dear... is my poor little lover too hot? Well I know just what you need to cool off: a nice, good swim in the pool. and what luck, the classes for the pool are over...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was sweating even more after hearing that... and could only think to himself, <i>'Luck? Luck for who?'</i> as Kaya carried him to the locker room to get her swimsuit and give Naruto a personal show of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kaya made it to the locker room, she first placed Naruto into a box so that he wouldn't escape and then opened Maya's locker and pulled out a swimsuit and she then stood right above Naruto so that he could see what she had in store for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...to get out of this.\" Kaya said, gesturing to the school training uniform she wore: a dark navy blue training shit with a white lining and a matching pair of dark navy blue shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaya took a few paces away from him before turning sharply. She walked back towards Naruto, a seductive sway to her hips, and blew her lover a kiss. She began pulling at the waist of her shorts and proceeded to slowly pull down on them. She turned and bent at the waist as she stepped out of them, showing a now-blushing Naruto her perfectly shaped butt, which was barely held in by her panties.<br>\r\nShe kicked her discarded shorts towards the wall and began pulling at her shirt. She turned away from Naruto and slowly began to back towards him while still facing backward. She was standing above the shrunken ninja, with him staring at her beautiful behind. She lowered it toward him slowly before pulling back. She kept dropping it toward him before standing back up before it was in the blond's reach. She turned her head and saw Naruto's outstretched arms, and laughed. Delighted at her lover's reaction, Kaya continued bouncing over Naruto's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Uzumaki was so turned on, he didn't notice that Kaya was inching closer to him every time until her butt knocked him flat. She lowered it a final time and kept contact with Naruto's body. Kaya was careful not to put too much pressure on him though, and lightly rubbed her butt all over Naruto's body. After a bit, Kaya suddenly stood up, leaving Naruto feeling cold. She turned and quickly lifted her shirt over her head, revealing a bra. She knelt in front of Naruto, grinning wickedly and lifted her lover up in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto went utterly red as Kaya brought him to her chest and rubbed him over her bra-covered breasts and down her firm stomach. She held Naruto's body flat, pinning his hands at his sides. Bringing Naruto around to her back, Kaya smirked as she used her lover to slap her butt. It hurt a bit, but Naruto had WAY worse injuries in his shinobi career (such as the Chidori Sasuke had STABBED HIM TWICE IN THE LUNG WITH; thanks for teaching him that, Kakashi!) and didn't have time to think about it, as she was pushing him deeper into her fabric-covered flesh and rubbing him about. Naruto had to confess, other than with Nozomi, he had never been as excited as he currently was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying the show, my love?\" Kaya purred, then brought Naruto around to her butt crack. She rubbed him gently against that spot (yes, she'd felt his boner) and then lowered him between her legs, using Naruto to massage her womanhood through her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of that, Kaya tossed Naruto into Maya's locker and slammed the door shut. \"Gonna stay in there a bit. Lover. No peeking now!\" she teased, leaving Naruto in the dark until she opened the locker, showing she was wearing the swimsuit from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Kaya looked to see Naruto blushing up a storm and couldn't help but giggle to herself as she  lifted Naruto up to her face and said, \"I see you enjoyed my show for you, my love; well, let me tell you it's not over yet...\" and before Naruto could say anything, Kaya then placed Naruto in between her breasts and said to him, \"You better keep your balance my love, I don't want you to fall off or get squished by my girls before we get to the pool.\" Then before Naruto knew it, Kaya started walking to the pool, making sure that her D-cup breasts bounced with each step she made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was trying his hardest to not pass out from how sexy his situation was and to make matters worse, his manhood betrayed him as it was at full attention and threatening to rip through his pants at this point, as he was being juggled by Kaya's bouncing breasts as he was now bouncing on top of them trying to not get squished between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each step she made, Kaya was loving seeing her little lover bouncing on her twins and was enjoying every second of it and was lightly giggling to herself when she saw that Naruto used the momentum of her breasts to get higher only to fall back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Kaya finally made it to the pool itself and like all good things, her fun with Naruto (for the moment at least) was over, but this was where her next form of her fun was going to take place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My love, do you know anything about a creature called the Megalodon?\" Kaya asked Naruto as she continued to bounce him from breast to breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then shook his head while saying, \"No, I haven't heard of anything like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaya then said, \"I wouldn't be surprised that you don't know about it, after all it has been said that it's been extinct for more than over two million years. It was the apex predator of all the seven seas and it was biggest shark to ever swim the seas, it was one hundred foot long and weighed about eighty tons, even able to kill and devour a full grown whale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was now pale as Orochimaru when he heard that and thought of a shark that was big enough to hunt, kill and eat whales...it scared him to think if that thing was still alive and able to eat people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kaya continued saying, \"The word Megalodon means when translated, \"Big Tooth\" and it was known to be the biggest shark in the world, said to have teeth that measured to about six or seven inches long and jaws that were three meters wide, with six rows of forty-six teeth for a total of two hundred and seventy-six, each of them six or seven inches in length and wickedly serrated like steak knives and shaped like a big, broad triangles, and capable of over thirty-five thousand pounds of force.\" Kaya said while loving how Naruto soon became even paler to where Orochimaru would looked sunburnt compared to him right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaya then said, \"Oh, but don't worry it's already extinct, but I've always wondered what would happen if it ever ate a human.\" She grinned when she saw Naruto pale even further and then she said, \"Since humans are small enough to just be inhaled by it underwater, would the Megalodon just chew the human up by all of those teeth or would it just swallow the human whole and alive? and seeing as I'm about the size of a Megalodon compared to you...let's find out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Kaya made it so her girls gave Naruto one BIG bounce that sent him into the pool and she then dove in after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter landing in the pool, Naruto was freezing as he was struggling to swim in the (to him) ocean of pool water, then he heard a very loud splash and he knew that Kaya just went into the pool, and was now swimming, but he couldn't see her, right now she could be anywhere...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil he was suddenly pulled under the water and when he opened his eyes he saw Kaya swimming in place looking at Naruto with a smile on her face and before Naruto knew it, Kaya's hand wrapped around his entire body and she began to clinch her hand around him causing him some pain but Kaya then released him and moved her hand over his body and before Naruto could think it was over Kaya then moved her body into a laying position on her back and positioned Naruto to be right above her crotch and then she suddenly slammed her right hand on top of him and onto her crotch while grinning as she rubbed her tiny lover against her covered crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kaya had another idea and grabbed Naruto and for Naruto he wasn't expecting this, she pulled the bottom part of her swim suit open and moved him inside it until he was near her lower lips and then Kaya trapped Naruto inside of it by letting the elastic snap back into place and began to rub him against her pussy's lips loving the feeling of her tiny lover's body against her womanhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Naruto was struggling to not submit to his inner Jiraya as his manhood instantly stood at full attention from the moment his skin touched Kaya's vaginal lips and to add to his problems, it seemed that her lower lips were attempting to eat him alive as he was struggling inside her swimsuit, then he felt Kaya's body begin to swim around to have Naruto tossing and turning against her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen before Naruto knew what happened, Kaya's hand reached for Naruto and then pulled him out, however she only pulled him out just so she could open the back of her swimsuit and placed Naruto in between her butt cheeks and snapping the elastic back into place and Kaya gave her butt a jiggle to and a few pats and began to swim with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Naruto was now wedged in between Kaya's butt cheeks and was still struggling until he felt Kaya reach the edge of the pool as she seemed to getting out of the pool as he was gasping for air when Kaya got out of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Kaya got out of the pool and stood to full height, still smiling that her lover was alright, she then felt something and then looked to where Naruto was and said, \"Well, looks like Maya's awake now. I'll let her know everything about you my little lover, try not to miss me too much.\" with that Kaya's long silver hair was now changing into blonde hair and the bang on Kaya's right seemed to switch to the left side of her face.</span></div></div>",

Why was she at the pool? And why was this doll stuffed into her swimsuit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to think. Last thing she remembered was training in her room, thinking about the upcoming East-West War...then her past, and...Maya sighed. Oh yeah...she'd gone into shock thinking about her past, <i><b>again</b></i>. Kaya had taken control to give her time to recover. Honestly, her split personality was more like a sister than anything else. Not that was a bad thing, Kaya only wanted to protect her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what had Kaya been up to?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling better?\" An unfamiliar voice asked, getting her attention. She looked around for it's source, but didn't see anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your hand.\" The voice spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the voice, she looked at her hand and saw that cute little doll from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...Hi.\" he said, smiling nervously, \"I'm Naruto Uzumaki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a small scream, she threw the one-inch blonde boy into the pool and before she knew it, Maya was pulled her into their subconscious where Kaya was waiting for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya... Maya... Maya... WILL YOU CALM DOWN ALREADY AND WAIT A MINUTE!!!!\" Kaya yelled at the panicking Maya and getting her attention, then Kaya  walked towards Maya and gave her a hug to calm her down and she then looked down at the quivering blonde and asked in a much gentler tone of voice, \"Feeling better, now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding to show that she had calmed down, Maya then looked up to Kaya, \"Now Maya, I know you might be scared. But Naruto doesn't mean you any harm, in fact, we all have more in common than you think, let me explain...\" Kaya then told her everything she learned about Naruto to Maya, who nodded and listened very closely and when Kaya told her the earlier times of his life, Maya was crying about how horrible and cruel his life was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter telling Maya everything, she then said, \"Now Maya, I think we should agree that Naruto has to stay with us and not be allowed to run away, and right now, I do believe that he is INDEED.... ESCAPING!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya soon shook her head and saw that Naruto was indeed attempting to run away and she couldn't let that happen, so she headed Naruto off and looked at how he had just escaped a collector drain and then took a jump with her butt heading towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he was thrown by Maya and Kaya was talking to Maya, Naruto fell back into the pool and quickly swam back up and quickly applied his chakra to run on the water's surface, but as he ran he didn't notice that he was on the right side of the pool or more like close to the wall of the pool and he was too close to the collector drain and now was trying to escape it, then just as he was about to get sucked in, he used the rising small wave to jump out of the collector drain's grasp and continued to run until a large shadow covered his body from above and the last thing he saw was a giant falling butt heading right towards him and the last thing he heard was a loud splash of pool water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, Naruto woke up, surprised when he saw that he was laying down on a small pillow and covered by a white colored rag as his blanket in the dark until he felt the room was being pulled forward and he soon saw the light of Maya's room fall upon him until his eyes adjusted to see the gigantic face of Maya looking down at him and now with the light he took a better look around where he was and indeed he saw that he was lying on top of a small pillow that fitted inside her dresser drawer and he was covered by a pure white colored rag as his blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up at Maya, it was clear she'd put him in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya winced, \"I'm sorry about the drawer being your new room, but I had to hide you somewhere and the drawer was the first thing that came to mind at the moment, but if you want then maybe we can think of another place for me to hide you in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's fine...but are you ok?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad memories. Things I don't want to remember...\" the ribbon girl replied, getting a nod from Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure this is an ok place for me to keep you?\" she asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shrugged, \"As long as I'm here at Suruga, and until I find a way home, sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way home?!\" Maya said, frowning as she felt a surge of alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You might say...I'm...not from around here...\" As Naruto then started explaining about Jiraya's notes, Maya was thinking of what this meant for her to lose her new friend. She couldn't openly say \"no\" to Naruto, but she wouldn't let Naruto collect the notes, so maybe she can mislead Naruto and find a way to hide the notes somewhere where Naruto can never find them. Naruto would be angry at her for a while, but eventually he would come to understand why she did it right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, she didn't know what was right in this situation. She didn't want Naruto unhappy, but she didn't want to loose him either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was trying to decide what to do...</span></div></div>",

I'll play a game with you... and if you win then I'll help you get back to where you came from, but if you lose... then you have to stay here with me. That's the only deal I'm giving you.\" Maya said with a voice that had no room for arguments as she stared Naruto in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto knew she was serious about this and knew that this was his only chance to actually getting back to (what he assumed she meant) was Setouchi, but he really didn't want to upset Maya, so he nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Naruto nod in acceptance to her challenge, Maya then began to think of the game to play, it took her a moment until she had an idea, \"Alright Naruto, the game we're going to play is an obstacle course over the pool, I can have it all set up in a few minutes and the we'll both have a race--not Keijo, but a regular speed race--to the finish and who ever makes it first wins. And to make this fair for you, if we tied at the finish line, then our times will decide the winner; and since you're so much smaller than me, I'll deduct about five minutes off your final time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this as an interesting idea, Naruto agreed with Maya, who smiled and went to make a phone call to set everything up (sometimes, it payed having the head of a Keijo Training School as a parent, adoptive or not).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- Later ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was later that night and after making sure everyone was fast asleep, Maya and Naruto saw the completed obstacle course and it looked crazy; as it had five small platforms angled downwards towards the pool leading to a rope, and from there, there was a platform that then lead to a couple of hang bars that looked like they could roll on a duo of weird looking bars that looked like snakes that they had to literally throw themselves onto another platform and then they would have to run on top of four rotating blocks on a stick to reach the next platform and that one had lead to them having to jump and use three spinning cycles to get across to what looked like the finish line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Maya finished signing the papers she took Naruto to the starting platform and placed him on the platform, \"Ready? Set... GO!\", Maya said as she and Naruto began the course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maya took the lead thanks to her height compared to Naruto's, the tiny shinobi wasn't going to let this beat him as he ran as fast as his legs could go. When he reached the downward platforms, he used his ninja skills to skillfully and safely cross them while using his chakra to stick onto them for good measure, as he saw Maya making it to the rope, Naruto grabbed her pinkie toe as she climbed and jumped off the toe when Maya made it across with Naruto running after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came the hang-bars and again, Naruto was forced to hitch a ride with Maya not knowing it as she then jumped off the bars and made it across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the rotating blocks on a stick and Maya did have some trouble getting across but she made it, while Naruto used his ninja agility and reflexes to get across easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the hardest part of the course as they both made to the trio spinning cycles, with Naruto climbing on Maya's body, who saw him do this to get to the first cycle and he was trying to get across ahead of her, but Maya began to turn the cycle; nearly throwing the shrunken ninja off the cycle and both Maya and Naruto manged to jump to the second one, this went on for a while until they both made it to the third and final cycle with Maya trying to not only throw Naruto off the cycle and make to the next one, and Naruto fighting to keep his balance; until they both jumped of and the first one to land on the finish line platform was...</span></div></div>",

WHOEVER THAT GIRL IS SHE'S GOING DOOOOWWWWN!!!\"</b> shaking the whole room with the force of an earthquake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nozomi continued to rage against this unknown person that had apparently wronged her, what she and the others couldn't see was the fifth individual with them in the room with them. Shame too, the person would have really calmed down Nozomi. Invisible, intangible, and unheard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, it was the spirit of her late mother, Mitsuki Kaminashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare she?! He wasn't hers to take!

This \"Butt-y\" person Nozomi is talking about is a boy?!\" Mitsuki smiled, suddenly all the more interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nozomi...who are you even mad at, and how are you so sure it involves Naruto?\" The ponytail girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuki shook her head and thought to herself, 'Oh...if it was someone that a maiden truly loved, there was no how or why, if something happened to them, they'd know.' Well, that settled it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate to go for a little bit, Nozomi; but I simply must meet my future son-in-law.\" the spectral mother said with a sad, apologetic smile. Then exited through the dorm and academy walls, the physical matter meant utterly nothing to her, given her state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...Naruto, huh? I Wonder who you are?\" The spirit of Mitsuki Kaminashi said, then went to start her search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuki floated around the whole city in search of this \"Naruto\" person but she didn't know where to start looking for the boy, \"Maybe I should've thought this through, before I went searching for this \"Naruto\" Person.\" Mitsuki said to herself as she tried looking again until she heard a female's voice call out to her, \"...Mitsuki... Follow my voice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked to hear a voice call out to her Mitsuki felt like she could trust this voice and followed after the voice until she found herself in front of a different academy called Suruga Keijo academy and entered the building, the voice that guided her to hear became more clearer as it now said, \"Mitsuki, this way. Naruto is in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhasing through the closed door Mitsuki then saw Naruto helping a blonde haired girl with a pink ribbon on her head attempt to do something and Mitsuki floated closer to Naruto to have a closer look and she was not disappointed as the boy that had her Nozomi's affections looked very handsome and he seemed to have a aura of kindness around him and she then said, \"So, you must be the \"Naruto\" that my Nozomi has her heart set on, hmm...yes, you are just the boy I would be proud to call as my son-in-law.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after the word son-in-law left her lips, she was suddenly ensnared by golden, ethereal chains that came out from the boy's back and before she knew it, the chains quickly retracted back into Naruto's back with him being none the wiser of what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuki gasped as she fell to her hands and knees (such a strange feeling after lacking a physical body for so long) as she found herself within a space that looked to be bathed with warm golden light, as if it were safe from the harshness of reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand entered her field of vision and she took it, getting pulled to her feet to come face to face with a woman who had a slender, but feminine build, fair skin, violet eyes, and beautiful red hair that reached her waist with shoulder-length strands that framed both sides of her face and a black clip that parted her hair to the left. She also wore a high-collared, sleeveless blouse under a long, loose-fitting dress with a wristband on her left wrist and sandals that covered the instep and ankles, yet left her toes and heels exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You made it.\" the woman smiled, and the Kaminashi's eyes widened; recognizing the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your voice...you were who called me, lead me to Naruto...\" Mitsuki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, the redhead nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know about me? We've never met.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nozomi...wonderful girl you have, by the way. Hope you don't mind that I've already accepted her as a daughter.\" the redhead said, somewhat sheepish at the end. \"Oh, where are my manners? I haven't even introduced myself. My name is Kushina Uzumaki and as you would guess, I'm Naruto's mother.\" The redhead said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Mitsuki's jaw dropped, then she beamed. Well...this was unexpected. \"Pleasure to meet you! So...what was with bringing me here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina shrugged, \"Wanted to meet my Sister-in-law to be and see how we could get our kids together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuki laughed, \"I see! Wedding and baby plans!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Still, that other Ribbon Girl you saw him with...she's starting to like my son, too. Gotta prepare for dealing with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNozomi's mother nodded, \"Understandable. Anyone with the eyes for the truth and heart to accept it can easily see Naruto is special. Still, we have plans to make.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKushina nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya, who had found herself smiling, even as she struggled with the  amazing energy-control and usage exercises that Naruto was showing her (that water walking skill he was currently trying to help her learn was going to be REALLY useful for Keijo!) hardly noticed it herself, but her breathing sped up and her chest heaved up and down even when she reached for her head at the splitting pain that suddenly came to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>\"No! I won't let it happen! Naruto belongs to us and no one else!\"</i></u> Maya heard Kaya roar in the back of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, all of this threw off her concentration and she fell into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya!\" Naruto yelped, ready to jump in after her, but she surfaced and swam to the edge to the pool where the tiny Uzumaki was at., resting her arms on the poolside and her head on her arms as she gazed at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Something's got Kaya angry....\" she told the one who wanted to ensure she never lost her place in the sun. She'd be lying if she didn't understand her alter ego's attraction to Naruto, or that she was starting to share those feelings herself. He was going out of his way to help make sure she never ended up loosing everything that mattered to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd not for any other reason than that he wanted to. Maya confessed she was touched by that and she wanted to keep him as much as Kaya did. She didn't want to rush a relationship as much as Kaya did with their \"soulmate\" as her other half called him, but Maya wouldn't deny she could see herself coming to genuinely love Naruto while wanting to have him feel the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was why Kaya feeling Naruto was at risk of being taken away from them left Maya alarmed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything I can do?\" Naruto questioned, making Maya smile and grab him before getting out of the pool and drying off with a towel, Naruto still in her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stay with us. That helps.\" Maya cooed to him, nuzzling him against her cheek fondly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pulling him from her panties, Kaya threw Naruto into the air just above and right behind her head and as he was now falling, he saw Kaya's butt poised to catch him and it did, until the softness of her butt threw him back up into the air with a little help from her qi energy and sent him to the left cheek and did the same thing only to swap with her right cheek and sometimes she sent Naruto high into the air enough for her to move to where he would land and bounce him up again with her right foot, then she switched him with her left foot for about twenty hit, then she moved him up to her knees for about ten hits each then using her qi on her knees to launch him up to her breasts to bounce him on top of them for about twenty hits and then repeated the whole cycle for about the next twenty minutes and Kaya was loving every second of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"497, 498, 499, 500!!!\" Kaya said in a happy tone as she turned around and finally caught Naruto in her hand as he was falling and gave him a long kiss as she then said, \"Thank you my love, as you just helped me destroy my old hacky sac record of 150.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaya then placed Naruto back into the front her panties and slid him inside and snapped the waistband shut and as she did, her body shook in a wave of pleasure at feeling her lover now trapped against her maidenhood, and then she jumped forward like how a kangaroo would and when she landed, she felt more pleasure from feeling Naruto hit her clitoris and loved it so much that she began to jump like an actual kangaroo all around the room for five hours straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would have continued, but a sharp series of knocks at the door drew her attention, and Kaya reluctantly took her attention off of Naruto and pulled her shirt over his head to hide him. Walking over to the door (and enjoying the feel of her lover tucked in the front of her panties so only his head and shoulders were above the waistband as she walked) the silver-haired girl opened it and her eyes widened at the sight of who was on the other side of the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh! Kaya was thankful for the school training uniform she wore, a dark navy blue training shit with a white lining and a matching pair of dark navy blue shorts, seeing as her lover was concealed by her clothes or this would get ugly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding there was a middle-aged woman with chin-length, light brown hair. Ayako Sakashiro; a former Keijo player, an instructor at Suruga Keijo Training School, Suruga's headmaster, and most importantly, Maya's adoptive mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-?! Kaya?! What are you doing out?!\" Ayako said, alarmed to see the silver-haired version of her adoptive daughter at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pressure to maintain Suruga's winning streak and reputation made Maya think about the past. Didn't react to those memories well. So I took over so she could have a break to relax.\" Kaya said, struggling to keep from glaring at the woman. She and Maya owed Ayako for taking them in, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman winced, feeling somewhat guilty. She didn't know Maya was being that strained. Taking a deep breath, Ayako made a note to ease up on Maya and Kaya as far as the woman's aims. She knew Maya worried Ayako only cared for abilities, but this...she shook her head. \"I'm going to need a way to fix this. It isn't her abilities, but how can I get through to her I also care about her as my daughter...?\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaya rose a brow and asked, \"So...what is it, coach?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyako cringed and asked, \"Must both you and Maya have to call me that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaya shrugged then repiled, \"That's up to Maya. She doesn't believe that she fully feels like your daughter yet. So...back to the topic at hand. What do you need Maya for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeeply disturbed by the news Maya felt that way, Ayako swallowed, then put her concerns about that aside. Deal with them later. \"I was looking for you, actually, Kaya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" Kaya said in surprise as she pointed to herself. This was unexpected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you. Here, you'll need this.\" The former Keijo professional said, handing Kaya a small key, \" Hide it on your person after getting your suit on. Suggest a maillot suit. Meet at the pool for a new mock-Race in an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat done, Ayako spun on her heel and left, closing the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling her shirt up and looking at Naruto, Kaya sighed, relieved and said, \"Phew...that was close. If she'd found you...\" the girl shuttered, \"Okay, my love, I need you to listen to me. The coach is going to be present while we have the mock race, and I need you to stay quiet and not move a muscle or she could take you away from me. And I don't even want to think of what she'll do to you once she figures out that you aren't a toy. So please just stay quiet and don't move until I say otherwise, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, still sore from Kaya's playing, groaned and nodded; she beamed at that. Carefully pulling him out, Kaya set her lover on the bed, then pulled out a plane black, one-piece swimsuit and slowly took her clothes off, her actions were slow and sensual, making sure Naruto's eyes were on her the whole while. While Kaya would admit to having preferred if it were a bikini she were putting on display for him, she recognized that a one-piece was going to hide him better while the coverage wouldn't seem conspicuous, given Ayako's order to hide that key she'd been given on herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the key on a thread and wearing it as a makeshift necklace between her breasts, Kaya then stuffed Naruto into the back of her swimsuit and was loving how her lover was moving against her butt and even gave her butt a wiggle to shake Naruto a little and began to walk to her mock race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving, her eyes widened. What in the heck was with the pool?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing all the other students lined up, Kaya took her pace among the rest, they all looked confused, as they were all wearing bikini-style suits as opposed to her maillot. Kaya, feeling the confused stares aimed at her, turned to them and merely rose a brow. That small gesture was all it took and they shrank away from her, cowering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the students were all lined up, Ayako clapped and got their attention and said, \"Listen up, ladies. New Land course Race today. The designer had a bit of inspiration from the story of Theseus and the Minotaur's labyrinth.\" Ayako called out to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLabyrinth? That's what this Land was? After thinking on that and studying how the pool looked, the students admitted they could see it. The labyrinth had large walls, reaching to about ten feet high, and seemed narrow but they were wide enough to have fighters like Tae and Saki turn around without trouble, but they could still fall into the pool if they weren't careful, also the \"floor\" was the platforms from the entrance exams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is an eleven-on-one Race. The rules for the Labyrinth race are simple, one fighter will be the Minotaur and hold the key to the labyrinth's exit on the other-side of the pool hidden on her person, and there are three ways for the Minotaur's opponents to win, one - Is that they can defeat the Minotaur, two - One of them steals the key from the Minotaur and makes it to the labyrinth's exit or the third condition - those except the Minotaur survive until the time limit ends. The Minotaur's condition for victory is that the Minotaur must defeat all of her opponents. Beyond that, standard victory and defeat conditions apply.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And let me guess coach: the reason you wanted me out for this and in a maillot was because I'll be playing the role of the Minotaur.\" Kaya voiced, already walking into the labyrinth as the other girls all paled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's correct, Kaya.\" Ayako said, internally bothered by her adoptive daughter and her alter-ego still referring to her as \"coach\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as Kaya just said, she's the minotaur and you are all against her, so I'll give the rest of you ten minutes to come up with a plan.\" Ayako said to them and left the eleven girls to think up of a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kaya was entering the labyrinth, Naruto, still inside Kaya's swimsuit and still in pain and disoriented from Kaya's playing, heard everything and making sure he's not beaten to unconsciousness again, he quickly set up his chakra shield all over his body and hoped that Kaya's opponents weren't really heavy hitters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he had been in a more attentive state, however, he would have noticed the thirteen energy signatures that reacted to his own, indicating there were some of Jiraiya's notes that Naruto was looking for here at Suruga Academy, just like back at back at Setouchi Keijo Training Academy...</span></div></div>",

We can all take her alone!\" Tae said. All of the others looked at her like she was crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaya, alone? Tae, that's suicide. Any you know it!\" Kei told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...This is because you're the weakest student at Suruga and have no talent for Keijo, isn't it?\" Mai asked flatly, getting the obese girl to growl and stomp off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Did you have to do that? You know Tae only wants to be respected.\" Ayase sighed, aiming a dull glare at Mai, to which the dancer-styled Outfighter shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kaya was walking through the labyrinth, Naruto was slowly but surely began to regain consciousness then when he fully recovered he remembered that Kaya was now in a race and thinking quickly he began to use his chakra to protect himself, and as it activated he suddenly began to feel a pull in his mind until he passed out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto woke up to see that he was in some kind of room and that he was normal sized here and as he looked around, Naruto noticed that he must've been in what looks like a copy of Suruga Academy with the color schemes of bright colors on one side of the room while the other side of the room seemed more to be in a darker tone of blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then saw the girl who he saw go into shock, <i>'Maya was it?'</i> he thought to himself on the brighter side of the room and called out to her, \"Hey Maya!\" until he saw the girl jump in surprise and then she ran away and hid herself almost in a manner that reminded him of Hinata doing, but this wouldn't stop him so this time, he tried to take the \"slow\" approach and said, \"Hey, it's okay, I'm not going to hurt you, I just wanna talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to work better as the girl nervously and slowly moved out of her hiding place to reveal herself and say, \"W-wh-who, who are you? and how did you get here?\" Maya timidly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then replied, \"Well, my name is Naruto Uzumaki, and as to how I got in here, I have no idea... but you seem to be surprised to see me here, and speaking of \"Here\" where is is this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya then said, \"Well this is both mine and Kaya's mindscape and we are currently on my side, and now that I look at you, you remind me of that cute little doll...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sweat dropped, at that and said, \"Yeah.... Well anyway, how are you since Kaya took over? I mean, I heard how you had a very though life up till Ayako adopted you and her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya looked like she wasn't ready to answer that so Naruto then said, \"Well, I don't know if you heard of my story from in here, but if you want I can tell you a bit about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya  opened her mouth to answer but then suddenly, the room began to shake like it was in an earthquake and fade in and out with the sound of static. Before he knew it, Naruto was awakened to feel Kaya's butt squeeze him as she was in a middle of a fight with her opponents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kaya!\" Tae shouted to Kaya from behind making the silver-haired girl turn to face  who called her and she couldn't tell wither to be impressed by this girl for coming to face her alone or find her stupid for thinking that just because she's bigger and fatter than herself she thinks she'll win, but Kaya decided to humor the challenger, \"Well this is a first, no one's ever thought of challenging me face to face before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTae narrowed her eyes at the ribbon wearing, silver headed girl, \"The others say that you're the strongest here, well I'll be the judge of that and to make this more interesting let's raise the stakes a bit.\" This caught Kaya's attention and motioned for the fat girl to go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTae then smirked and said, \"If I win, you have to bow down to me and declare me as the strongest in the academy, but if by some miracle you win, I'll bow down to you and admit that you're the strongest, sound fair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaya nodded in acceptance as they both poised themselves for battle, then at the sound of some unheard signal they rushed at each other and clashed; Tae using her large butt but Kaya ducked and attempted to use her breasts against her hitting the large girl but Tae then backed off and was now attempting to use her weight to her advantage as she took large steps to the floor under Kaya attempting to bounce her off of the land but Kaya kept her balance and ran towards Tae with another attack from her breasts and she hit Tae's breasts pushing her back further and, having enough of this, Tae then jumped into the air and used her signature move, \"Attack on Titan's Butt!\" as she charged forward with her colossal butt attempting to crush Kaya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaya then smirked and focused some qi into her breasts and as Tae's butt made contact with Kaya's breasts, Tae was immediately repelled by Kaya's qi and launched into the walls of the labyrinth crashing through a very good number of them and unknowingly hitting the second group that were aware of the plan knocking them out of the race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too easy...\" Kaya smirked as Tae, Hiakri, Sanae, Nami,  and Midori were announced Sunk. Half done already. Ah well...if the race turned out boring, at least she could enjoy her lover more, and enjoy him sooner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the thought, Kaya's eyes glazed over, her toes curled, her nipples hardened, and her honey started leaking. The silver-haired girl pat where Naruto was pinned by the back of her swimsuit against her butt and even gave her butt a wiggle to shake Naruto a little and used her butt to squeeze him a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaya sighed blissfully; she couldn't wait for the wedding!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grunted at the patting and squeezing, reactivating his chakra shield to give himself protection. But as he did so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...you're back!\" Maya yelped, seeing Naruto suddenly reappear in her and Kaya's shared mindscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked around. \"What the hell...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You disappeared. Now you're back. What was all that?\" The blond ribbon girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can use the energy in my body, too. Call it chakra where I'm from. My guess, since I'm using my energy defensively, and Kaya's using hers....er...yours....gah!\" Naruto cried, rubbing his head as it started to hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean. So you were saying about your chakra and our qi?\" Maya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I think when they collide while being put to opposite uses, they repel one another. But when I use just my chakra when you or Kaya aren't using your qi, it has a bit of a bleed-over that sends me here when I'm making contact with either of you.\" Naruto shrugged, \"best answer that comes to mind, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya nodded, idea made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sighed and reluctantly told her everything about his life. How had had no parents to begin with, how his earliest memories were of that Naruto had no idea why everyone gave him regular beatings, why everyone glared at him; why everyone hated his guts and he was shunned by everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Maya was beginning to feel great respect for him, and there were parts that made her want to cry, some that made want to laugh when he told her his pranks against who mistreated him, but she was enjoying hearing Naruto's life. When he finished, Maya hugged him, tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and Kaya...You're just like us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sighed as he hugged her back. \"So I've heard. Just do me a favor: My past is where I would like to keep it, in the past.\" He muttered. \"We all know that being alone sucks more than we'd like, I've been in that place before, I know what its like, what it dose to people. Here's what I know from having to go through all that: When you've spent your whole life surrounded by the darkness of the human heart, having people that you care about and care about you in turn is like being able to clutch a star in your bare hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya pulled away, nodding and completely understanding exactly what he meant by that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before anymore could happen, something in the mindscape shifted and...</span></div></div>",

I met him after the Exam we met at, we became close friends pretty quick. Turns out, he was looking for something important; trick was, he didn't know what or where it was. We kept in contact, but now, I'm worried something might've happened to him. I Don't know enough, though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what makes it weird?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh boy...how to explain that?! It wasn't like she could say Naruto was only a few inches tall or that he was from another reality full of super-ninjas!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow would Nozomi be able to tell Hanabi the whole story without sounding like she needs to take a vacation at the happy hotel with the men in white coats???</span></div></div>",

Train me for a few years, ha! All I got were remedial lessons while all he ever did was peep! If he actually TRAINED me, none of this would have happened since I never would have tried training myself!\" Naruto shouted, pumping chakra into limbs to go faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamnit! Where was 309?! He needed to find it so he could ditch this crazy teenage, lesbian, sex-craving zombie giantess with a weaponized ass! Even his chakra output wasn't doing much to widen the gap! He didn't know this place's layout and now he was paying for it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nozomi~!\" Mio panted in her sleep-running after him. Geeze, this chick was CREEPY! It was ALMOST as bad an obsession as Sakura had over Sasuke! Naruto was SO glad he didn't have to deal with the issue of some creepy, obsessive stalker being after him like this back home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking a sharp turn, Naruto slid and almost slammed into the wall, but recovered quickly and propelled himself by launching off the wall he'd almost collided with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing a near-by door, Naruto charged a Giant Rasengan that he grew until it was as big as a normal-sized softball would be to him at his current height and slammed it into the base of the door, burrowing through it and making a hole big enough for him to go through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they say; any port in a storm! And he NEEDED to get away from Mio if he was going to have time to figure out what to do!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the room through his hole in it, the ninja quickly bolted under a piece of furniture and leaned against it, sighing. As Naruto hid under a piece of furniture he heard the earthquake-like vibrations caused by Mio's bare feet as she walked/stomped by, now sniffing the air while still giggling as creepily as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this went on Naruto was trying to calm his poor frightened heart and began to think, <i>'Okay, I think I must be in the teacher's lounge as there's no way that a class room is this furnished: So all I have to do is maybe pass the principal's office and look for the emergency exit and hopefully room 309 is there cause I do remember that there was an emergency exit right by room 309.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind Naruto stood up and slowly walked towards the only opening to his hiding spot and poked his head out to see if Mio was anywhere close by until something fell right next to him and made a splashing sound and he saw that it was..... love nectar?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Mio's gigantic hand attempted to snatch him up but Naruto quickly retreated back into his hiding place but then he quickly realized that Mio must've already knew where he was hiding and was just waiting for him to show up and before Naruto knew it, he heard Mio mutter in her sleep again, \"I finally caught you now, My Little Nozomi~! There is only one way for you to go to now!\" as Mio spread her lower lips wide open, Naruto flinched to see how wet Mio had become during this chase and that's when Naruto suddenly heard a voice, \"Ain't got no choice now, do ya gaki?\" as Devil-Jiraya poofed on top of Naruto's left shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Naruto could even say anything to the Devil-Jiraya, Mio quickly snatched him up and just as fast begins to tear Naruto's clothes off, still sleeping and thinking Naruto was Nozomi, and when she was done Mio shoved Naruto up her pussy and quickly orgasmed but kept her prey in and began to push Naruto inside ignoring his screams until his feet fully disappeared inside her womanhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now my teeny, tiny Nozomi...you don't need to worry. I'll take GOOD care of you in there! Now let's go back to the pool and skinny dip...\" she drooled in her sleep with a perverse chuckle escaping her lips as Mio started patting herself between her legs and walked back to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, for his part, whimpered as Mio's wet folds surrounded him. Being tossed around as Mio walked with a sway to her hips. The reason he didn't struggle was that he didn't want to risk doing anything that might accidentally get Mio pregnet, but unless he got out. Who knew what would happen?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe should have just stayed in Room 309 earlier and waited for Nozomi!</span></div></div>",

Thinking of a plan, only one idea truly came to mind, use what little chakra he has and transform into nozomi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis idea was his best chance to survive, the only problem being was that he had no idea what side effect could happen. The transformation could last for a minute or could be permanent.

He was lying on his back alone in a dark room, most likely a cell of some sort. He had tried to move, but that quickly proved to be impossible. It felt as if he had been glued directly to the cold stone floor, sprawled out like a cross with his arms raised at his sides at ninety degrees and any attempt of molding chakra turned out to be completely useless. It was as if something sucked it right out of his body before he even had the time to make any use of it, just like the time he had his first run in with the shark-like Akatsuki member Hoshigake Kisame and his chakra eating sword Samehada. The icing of the cake was that he was now completely unarmed, leaving him with only his pants, sandals, headband and the necklace that had been given to him by Tsunade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto cursed at his own helplessness. He had no idea where he was, how long he had been out and how far he was from home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a massive stone door was opened and the darkness instantly gave way for the intruding light. Naruto closed his eyes tightly shut, taking his time to make his eyes adjust themselves to the light and then hesitantly opened one to see who had opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how are we doing, Naruto? I hope my men weren't too rough on you,\" came the voice of a lone figure standing in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Orochimaru!\"snarled Naruto with all the venom he could muster, \"What do you want with me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, my dear boy, have become a great obstacle in my plans of achieving absolute dominance over the world. As you are very well aware of, Akatsuki, the organisation of which I was once a member, are hunting down all the Jinchuriki in order to gain the Bijuu that are sealed inside of them. You are the only one left and it's only a matter of time before they get their hands on you. Now that is just something I cannot allow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess. You are doing this out of the goodness of your heart?\" spat Naruto sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrochimaru merely chuckled at that remark before replying with his thin lips formed into a snake like smile, devoid of any warmth. \"Of course not. I am merely looking out for my own interests. I know very well what my former associates are planning, but without you they would be completely incapable of going through with the final phase of their plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not afraid of Akatsuki!\" roared the restrained Konoha shinobi in anger. \"I'll take them all on if I have to! Release me now or so help me I will...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will do what?\" laughed the snake master at the boy's futile attempts at intimidating him. \"Take a look around yourself. I haven't left anything to chance and you're completely at my mercy,\" he stated as he made a gesture with his hand, urging Naruto to turn his head as best as he could to take in the cell of which he had been imprisoned in for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a large circular room completely made out of shining black stone, but what really caught the blonde's attention was the fact that nearly every centimeter of the cell's walls, roof and floor was covered in highly complex arrays of seals. He was lying in the absolute center of the room and it seemed like all of the seals, no matter where they where, interacted with each other to form chains that in the end formed complex patterns all around his body. During his years of training under Jiraiya, the greatest Seal Master Naruto had ever met, he had learned quite alot of this mystical art, but it didn't take a genius to figure out that this was the cause of his unmovable body and his inability to mold chakra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you going to do with me? Kill me?\" asked the Uzumaki once he had fully understood just how bad his odds were. He hadn't given up yet, far from it, and secretly tried to come up with a plan that would help him escape from this situation, preferably one that would allow him to take down the villainous shinobi in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tempting, but decided that a different course of action would be far more interesting,\" replied Orochimaru as he approached his captive with arms neatly folded behind his back, a twisted smile playing on his lips. \"You are truly a most intriguing specimen my dear boy and I am certain that, if I let you be, you will grow to become a serious threat to my goals in the future. The safest thing to do would probably be to slay you right now that you are completely at my mercy. However, if I would be able to come up with a way to control that delicious power you possess, you would become quite a remarkable asset to my cause.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do your worst Orochimaru, I'll never give in!\" replied the young shinobi heatedly, small traces of red appearing in his cerulean eyes for a split second before the surrounding seals absorbed the demonic chakra that had leaked from the seal that covered his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, I am currently incapable of doing so,\" continued Orochimaru, paying no heed to his prisoner's outburst and instead started to go through an unusually long and complex series of hand seals, finally ending with the ox seal. \"Therefore I have decided to simply keep you away until I have found the means necessary to tame you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what are you doing?\" asked Naruto as he desperately tried to break free, but his body didn't even budge an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than answer, the former Konoha ninja slammed his right palm down onto the smooth, jet black stone floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next second, as if a switch had been turned, all of the seals lit up in a blinding light. Naruto barely had any time to ponder upon this however as excruciating pain suddenly surged through his entire body, forcing him to roar out in agony. The last thing he saw before finally losing consciousness, was a pair of golden snake eyes that seemed to bore their way into his very soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, after what seemed like an eternity, Naruto finally began to wake up but when he placed his hand on his head, he then saw that he was free to move around, but then when he looked around himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was this?</span></div></div>",

Naruto remembered being hit in the face by a particularly fierce Leaf Hurricane kick, which sent him flying out of the clearing, and his home dimension entirely, by sending him through a randomly opened hole in the dimensional fabric between worlds.

The teenage ninja mustered up as much strength as he could to remove himself from his predicament, but found that the weight on either side of him was beyond his power to move. Each desperate attempt to free himself from his prison only resulted in him getting pressed further into it, until he was so engulfed by it that it formed a seal around his body, and blocked all air from him. His fighting soon slowed, until he could barely manage to wiggle slightly, and then his eyes closed as he blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark hair done up in a complex, yet beautiful braided hairstyle, ending in two ear-like tufts of hair coming off the side of her head, and something akin to a short ponytail at the rear, Renka Ma finished her preparation for her day. Ever since she had come to Japan to hunt down her miscreant of a father, who had bailed on his responsibilities to his family and organization in China to come to the island nation she had spent every day trying to figure out how to bring him home. She had even taken to working for a relative in Japan so she could have a place to stay for her time there, and every moment she wasn't doing schoolwork, was spent working in the man's restaurant as a waitress. Now, she finally had a day off, and she intended to enjoy it. That was, until something plopped right into her exposed cleavage out of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenka silently gasped as she felt something fall into the window on the front of her Chinese dress and slid quickly between her two generously sized breasts. She squeezed her arms together trying to stop whatever it was from going any further, and quickly slipped her free hand into her giant cleavage. Her fingers reached for it, but as they drew closer it slid further down, almost tauntingly. Whether it was a bug, or something else, she needed to get it out of her top.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Renka's hand slipped deeper into the valley of her chest in search of the foreign thing that had fallen. Her fingers feeling for any sign of the unknown invader in an attempt to quickly dislodge it from her body. Whatever it was, every time her reaching fingers tried to get to it, it would slip a little, just out of reach until it had almost come out the other side. Her hand snapped forward, and closed around the mysterious object before it could descended lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's fingers closed around something warm and somewhat squishy, which she quickly pulled free from her cleavage. She was about ready to toss whatever it was across the room for being weird, that was until she got a good look at the offending thing. It looked almost human, from the clothes to the highly detailed hair that looked like was weaved strand by strand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this someone's doll?\" Renka thought out loud as it dangled from her thumb and forefinger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had nicely tanned skin, marks on the cheeks that resembled three whisker marks on each, and bright yellow hair that was spiky and stuck up in all directions like the spines of a sea urchin. It had on a slim, form fitting orange tracksuit outfit with black on the upper shoulders area and the color extending from around the neck and shoulders, down the front and sleeves, as well as around the waist, a white swirl on the left side, a red swirl crest on the back, orange pants, the feet were covered by black sandals that covered the instep and ankles, yet left the toes and heels exposed and the pouches at it's waist and thigh were black. So was the headband it had on around it's forehead with a metal plate and swirled arrow symbol of some sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe proceeded to poke it with her other hand, examining it with mild curiosity. Where did it come from, and how had it gotten in her breasts in the first place. A quick look over to her window did show that it was open, so maybe someone managed to throw it through the gap, and it bounced off her ceiling and landed where it did by luck. She gave it one more prodding and saw the doll move slightly by itself. \"Wow, it even moves. The toys in Japan are pretty hi-tech.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenka place the orange and blonde doll on her dresser, propping it up against the wall, before she left the room for the time being to start her shift at Gekirin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, Naruto's eyes fluttered open and he held his head. Man, just how hard did Lee hit him? He was so dizzy from the roundhouse to the head that everything looked gigantic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he shook his head and his eyes widened. \"WHAT THE HECK?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything WAS gigantic! What was more, he could swear this was someone's bedroom! Where the hell was he?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, he spotted what looked like a family photo of a man, wife, and three kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the kids was girl that looked roughly his age. She had short dark blue hair done up in some strange cat ear like braids with bells tied to them. Her eyes were a light green and slightly silted. The girl's outfit really got his attention as it borderlined on appropriate. It looked like something Tenten would wear: a simple pink Chinese cheongsam with yellow outlines. The skirt however was extremely short, barely reaching her thighs, giving off a good view of her developed legs. The dress itself hugged against her body. This was made more distracting by the opening near the collar showing off some of her cleavage. Lastly she had a pair of simple purple Chinese shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl in the photo was cute, he'd confess that much, but he wondered where in the heck he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he caught the aroma of various scents of cooked meals coming from somewhere and his stomach growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok...no idea where I am, everything is huge, and I'm by myself...\" the Uzumaki said to himself. He could either get out of this room and try finding someone, go get some food and try learning where he was, or rest. At least those seemed the best options he could come up with at the moment....</span></div></div>",

He didn't know where it was, or why everything looked like it was scaled for someone closer in size to Gamabunta than a human, but he was going to do everything he could to find out the answers. First thing he needed to do was get to higher ground to get a better layout of his surroundings, so he began to climb up the an adjacent piece of enormous furniture, the tallest thing he could reach from where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe climb was arduous, as he had to move slowly due to still being out of breath from almost being smothered, and there was several hurdles on the nearly smooth surface of polished wood. If not for his rigorous conditioning under the tutelage of Jiraiya, he would not have had to strength to scale the sheer side of the obstacle. His fingers grabbed tightly to anything they could to ensure he would not plummet to an splattered end on the floor below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like forever, an out of breath Naruto managed to hoist himself over the edge and roll onto the flat surface at the top. He took a few moments to gather himself before looking over the edge and taking in his surroundings. First thing he verified was that he was indeed inside someone's bedroom, and that everything was scaled for a person many times his own size. Second thing he noticed was the door just to the right of his vantage point. Next step was to see if there was any way out of the room, and hopefully find someone who could explain what was going on and where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rope from his pouch, and kunai to for a makeshift anchor, and Naruto was propelling down the side of what he now saw was a giant wardrobe. The way down was much faster than his accent, and he was on the floor in minutes. A quick survey and he saw that this was not the way out he had hoped, as the gap under the door was blocked by a rug that slipped just under it. His arms slumped in dejection as he realized he would need to keep looking to find a way out, but first he needed to get off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ninja sprinted over to the bed, and used the dangling sheets to climb swiftly up to the top, and not a second too soon, as thunderous footfalls boomed, each one drawing closer to the door. Naruto had just flopped down on the bedspread when the door swung open, and a giant who looked like the girl he had seen in the photo marched through the threshold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess set down some bags beside the door and made her way over to the bed on which he lay. Her eyes were quick to catch sight of him and she did a double take, as she looked back to where he awoke before locking back on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could of sworn I left you on the dresser,\" her cute but loud voice spoke as her hand descended to grab him. This was now a decision of whether or not he should talk to her, as it seemed she seemed to think he was a toy or something. Her body leaned forward, giving him a direct look down her dress and at the lovely emerald eyes that gazed at him. His time was running out, it was now or never.</span></div></div>",

He had caught the sight of daylight, but was immediately swallowed by blackness soon after he emerged. The darkness was soon accompanied by an intense heat and softness that threatened to engulf him forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was about to lose consciousness, his prison opened up, light shined in, and something huge grabbed him by the waist and lifted him free of the tight surroundings. Naruto was rendered momentarily blind at the sudden change in brightness, but when his eyes adjusted, he gasped at what had freed him from what had trapped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer senses, honed from decades of training, responded to the sudden intrusion of her space immediately.

When the small, moving thing impacted her tit flesh, her hand moved to apprehend it quick as a flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers clasped something warm, and somewhat squishy, an odd sensation, but was even more odd was that it was moving in her grip. She pulled the invader free of her cleavage, and held it aloft in front of her eyes to get a good look, and to her shock between her fingers was a tiny person.

Her hair became pink and stood out at the sides as if to form angelic wings while the back went vertical rising on the currents of her power. A vertical halo of golden light with a single separate point of light similar to the crown she had worn as a priestess formed above her head. Pink lines and symbols flowed across her form. Finally a tattered pale blue shawl seemed to dance about her and blue bangles encircled her wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised her hand up and looked at it as she thought to herself, 'So many priestesses before me, I can even hear the voices of those who died before their time.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How far it all stretches back,' she mused as pink energy formed square seals below her feet that spread out away from her withing the black void that was Moryo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I see your true power is held in that bell of yours,\" growled out the voice of Moryo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So\u2026 this is the end?\" she quietly muttered. Her eyes shining with unshead tears she said, \"Naruto, can you hear me? From this day on\u2026 it's up to all of you to protect this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a resigned smile she then stated, \"Finally I know my destiny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memory of his speech at the lake came back to her, \"It's not useless, I'll protect you. I swear on my Nindo. I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a terrible liar Naruto,\" she said with a quiet sob letting the tears fall. Raising her arms she began to focus her power. 'You and I, we will disappear together,' she thought as Moryo began to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she heard her bell ring and was pulled back into her mortal form with a look of shock and a grunt. \"Shion snap out of it!\" screamed Naruto's voice as she was yanked free of Moryo's embrace by him and a chain of his clones that launched them into the air. \"Open your eyes and breathe!\" he continued getting the sudden gasp and widening of her violet eyes he was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you see? Can you hear? What is your heart telling you?\" he questioned her rapidly as they came face to face. \"Do you want to die like this or what?\" he continued shouting as his cerulean eyes looked into her violet ones. Getting a strangled sob from her he finally asked, \"Do you want to just fade away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I\u2026\" she hesitantly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't hear you!\" he sarcastically responded. \"Say it Shion! Say it in your own words! Come on let me hear it!\" he screamed out tilting his head back as if to roar it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want,\" she quietly began before shouting back at him in the same manner, \"To Live!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then!\" he gladly responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell started constantly ringing as it floated between their hands. He spoke haltingly as energy began to coalesce around the bell saying, \"Me\u2026 and all my comrades\u2026 we don't bow down for anybody!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt began to shine brightly as he turned his angry face to her to say, \"You don't like the hand fate has dealt you, fight for a better one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back at the energy ball and called out, \"Keep it coming. More!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grunted gently and the ball of light began to expand rapidly. \"Everything your feeling just let it out,\" he encouraged as it grew to massive size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoryo's physical form began to burst free of the confines of the rock he had been buried within. \"Too slow,\" Naruto stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they reached the apogee of their flight Naruto held the massive sphere of energy above their heads. \"You want it? Here have a taste of the Naruto to Shion no Cho Chakura Rasengan!\" he yelled as they plummeted and he turned them to go head and Rasengan first into the demon causing Moryo to wail in pain as they came down upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promised you didn't I? I said we were going to change your destiny and that's just what we're going to do.\" Naruto again shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShion closed her eyes and hugged him tighter saying quietly, \"I'm with you mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoryo seemed to explode into a column of light causing the earth to shake. The pathways and ceiling of the sealing chamber began to collapse into the magma below. Realizing their danger Shion reached to draw upon her power bound within the bell to attempt to once again go back in time and change their fate. She intended to go back just a few moments to the creation of the Rasengan and put a little less power into it in hopes that it wouldn't destabilize the cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe power began to flow into her but suddenly spiked and she realized she was also drawing in the massive amounts of Naruto's chakra that surrounded and infused the bell. She could feel him as if they had become one being. She felt how similarly hard his life had been and could sense another malevolent entity sealed away within him his anger drawing upon its power feeding it into the bell and her as well. Then the massive influx of energy triggered the intended jutsu and the pair were ripped away into the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyame was now training on how to sense the shards of the Shikon Jewel to convince Koga to keep his promise to marry her, she was currently having a hard time sensing anything different than her traditional method with her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she wouldn't give up, as she sat still and attempted to start again, until she suddenly heard something nearby and then she sniffed out a couple of strange scents they were small scents, but they were close by to her and seeing as taking a break wouldn't hurt, Ayame then stood up and called her two wolves to follow her, but to keep quiet as she headed towards the two small scents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, both Naruto and Shion were very confused as they both seemed to have been shrunken to being two inches tall and have been sent to a strange place while having no communication with either the Konoha or Suna shinobi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they both felt the ground quake underneath them and Naruto had caught Shion as she was about to fall on her face until what they saw next caused them to look in fear as they saw a gigantic girl around their age who had a fair skin tone, red hair in pigtails and has green eyes. She was also wearing an iris flower in her hair and had a band that goes across her forehead like Naruto's ninja headband. Her clothing consists of white wolf fur draped over her shoulders, a necklace, white fur skirt, her feet were mostly bare except for the insteps, she also wore arm guards, and red and blue armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if that wasn't enough to send the two shrunken blondes into a state of fear then the two gigantic white wolves that came with the giant girl did just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Naruto and Shion's point of view the giant girl seemed to be looking for something while sniffing the air and this made Naruto wonder as he held Shion close to himself, '<i>I wonder if she's related to Kiba and the Inuzuka clan... judging by the way she looks and dressed it could be...</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know something is here in the clearing but it seems so small...\" The giantess said to her wolves until she was about to unknowingly step on them with her foot, \"<b>PLEASE DON'T CRUSH US!!!</b>\" Shion screamed in fear as she hugged Naruto as he hugged her and closed their eyes, fortunately for them, Shion's scream reached the giantess' ears as she moved her foot back and looked in the grass and saw them.</span></div></div>",

You're both too small to be considered humans, and even smaller than a newborn demon, but I'm giving you both this chance to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up to the giant girl and her two wolves, both Naruto and Shion were willing to tell her everything. From who they were and where they were both from, to the whole reason as to how they got to this place, and how the very mission Naruto and Shion had been doing was to prevent a demon who was created from the darkness inside the hearts of others from destroying their world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing all this, Ayame was shocked and yet she fully seemed to understand their plight. She winced at the description of M\u014dry\u014d...oh boy...Blackheart, huh? A type of demon born from the darkness inside the hearts of people...she thought (or rather, she had hoped) those types were just fictional! Always had to nip problems like those in the bud pre-haste!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok... I get it. You're here now and so small as a side effect of things.\" the wolf demoness said, to which the tiny duo of ninja and priestess nodded. Ayame smiled down at them, \"Well...

Demon tribe?! As in Actual Demons!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the two humans about to have a panic attack,\"Relax... I get it, you both have reasons to be worried about demons, but did any other demons help this M\u014dry\u014d creep?\" Ayame sighed, unable to fault them their demon paranoia. It relieved her when they relaxed a bit. Before she started thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese two strangely-dressed humans may have been small, but they were strong. Saving the world DID require that, after all. Maybe they could help her in her training so she could figure out how to see and sense the shards of the Shikon Jewel to convince Koga to keep his promise to marry her? Would be a boon... Or maybe her grandpa would know of a way to help these two get back to normal size and send them back to where they came from? She could take them with her to see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Ayame had fully decided to....</span></div></div>",

Like many areas of the country, hot water naturally flows from the earth and pools in the valley; the water is rich with iron, causing it to turn red. Because of the water's temperature and because of the valley's geography, foul-smelling steam is always thick in the valley. This makes it quite inhospitable to live in, with no native animals and only minimal plant life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the steam was so thick that Naruto couldn't even see his own hand in front of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, he had heard of rumors about a clan that was expelled from the Land of Lightning, how they were forced to settle in the Valley of Hell. When the people of Yugakure checked up on the clan a few months later, they somehow mistook the valley's red water for blood and assumed some calamity had befallen the poor clan; rather than investigate or even offer help, they officially declared that the valley is strictly off-limits and, over time, everyone had forgotten where it was even located.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking of this, Naruto couldn't help but feel sad for this mysterious clan... he may not know the full story between this clan and the Land of Lightning, but it sounded completely unfair to him in his book, but... as much as he hated to say it... \"What's done is done... and you can't change the past... You just learn from it and move on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling uncomfortable with that line of thinking, Naruto kept walking through the valley for a while until he heard something, and followed the sound until he found a large group of people fighting, seeing this, Naruto then ran to the people, \"Hey, break it up! What's going on here!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when Naruto got close enough, the people then suddenly pounced upon him like a pride of lions on a wildebeest and had the blonde Uzumaki pinned down on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now, this is unusual...nobody comes here these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Personally, I hate having to do this...nobody comes here because they get attacked...\" one of the others muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it, you want the Chinoike clan dying out?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I just find it goes against my morals to resort to ambushing travelers like this, is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, but survival against morality is always an ugly crossroads.\" Another said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen one of the people around him, members of this 'Chinoike Clan', Naruto guessed, saw his headband and hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Konoha?! That Uchiha-worshiping cesspool?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others around him all muttered darkly in agreement and glared down at Naruto, who was more confused than ever. What did the Uchiha have to do with any of this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chinoike all started debating on what to do with him, most ideas on how to get rid of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, I've got an idea.\" one said, then stepped up to Naruto and pulled out a single pill that had a blue and red checker design and was ovular in shape, then shoved it into Naruto's mouth and forced him to swallow it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the pill landed into his stomach, Naruto suddenly began to feel dizzy and tired as his whole world was now spinning until he felt himself for some reason getting smaller and smaller until he finally passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he got too small, the Chinoike member picked Naruto up with a pair of tweezers and then placed him into the middle of a syringe needle and used a water style bubble jutsu around the liquid to allow him to breath as he slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do with him now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...people have forgotten what our clan's power can do...How about a guided tour of our abilities?\" The one that forced the pill down Naruto's throat said, their eyes suddenly changing so that they suddenly had blood red sclera, with a black pupil with a purple horizontal bar in the middle of the pupil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other clan members all grinned wickedly at that. At the mercy of the Ketsury\u016bgan's ability to manipulate blood? That would be interesting for that Uchiha-worshiper to deal with!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it!\" One of them said and they came forward. It was a ten-year-old looking girl that had short, neck-length, spiky light-blonde hair; two thick strands reaching onto her rosy cheeks, she also had violet eyes with small brows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing up, she took the syringe and looked at it. \"In a way, I feel kinda sorry for you.\" she said, then put the needle in her arm and pushed the plunger down all the way, her eyes changing to the Ketsury\u016bgan as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- Later ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was slowly waking up and shook his head. Looking around, he was instantly confused when he saw he wasn't in the Valley of Hell anymore. But where was he now? Nothing looked familiar at all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, Naruto saw a large column of dirt heading towards him, \"What's that? A dust storm?\" When he took a closer look, Naruto gasped to see a large group of pale colored men in white suits all stampeding towards him and for some reason, Naruto felt a immense and extremely powerful bloodlust coming off the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GERM!!!!!!!!!!! THERE'S THE GERM!!!! I'M GOING TO SO FREAKING KILL IT!!!!! YOU'RE DEAD GERM! DO YOU HEAR ME?!!!!! DEAD!!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHH!!!!!\" Naruto screamed as he saw the large group of weird and insane, knife-using, pale people rushing towards him, making Naruto run for his life, \"This is nuts! It's basically my whole childhood all over again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU WON'T GET AWAY YOU FILTHY GERM!!!! YOU'RE DEAD!!!!\" some of the insane pale people said as they chased him with demented blood crazed and murderous looks in their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot really paying attention to where he was going, Naruto soon crashed into somebody while making a sharp turn in hopes to escape this psycho mob and when he opened his eyes he saw that he crashed into...</span></div></div>",

She also wore a short-sleeved red jacket over a black shirt, white gloves, denim short shorts with a red belt, and red sneakers with black socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I'm sorry!\" the Uzumaki said, helping her up and noticing a package box laying next to them. So she was a courier, then. That explained the look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly hearing a sound like a stamped drawing nearer, the ninja remembered why he'd been running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great, those pasty knife psychos again!\" He cursed. Still holding the girl's hand, he bolted. But by the time he realized he was taking her along with him, he figured it was for the best anyways. No telling what those slice-happy nutcases would do to a bystander, and Naruto was in no mood to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Wait! I need to go and deliver that!\" The redhead wailed, trying to go back for that package she'd dropped when they crashed into one another, yet was unable to break his grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm sorry. But do you want those crazies to kill you?!\" Naruto shouted over his shoulder to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her pale and rapidly shake her head in the negative was all the answer he needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're a courier, right? Which way is the best one out of here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh....\" the redhead looked suddenly sheepish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You gotta be kidding me...\" Naruto said faintly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TIME TO DIE!!!!!!\" A shout came from behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are...!\" the redhead said, then turned to look at him and started trying to pull away, \"What do you intend to to this place?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I <i><b>look</b></i> like I wanna cause trouble?! I don't even know where I am!\" Naruto told her, panicked. Rounding a corner, he skid to a stop, blood draining from his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDead end!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly before he turned to the girl, he squeezed her hands, \"Please! I need your help! Gotta get me out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...how?!\" she sputtered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto put his hands together in a handsign, \"Transform!\" And suddenly, in a plume of smoke, Naruto was gone and in his place was a simple box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gawked, amazed at what Naruto did before carefully picking him up and proceeded to take the Uzumaki to a safe place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the girl, who looked far more lost than ever and was carrying Naruto while he was in his box transformation, left the guys in white behind, she went over to a bench and sat down, when she set Naruto next to her, he resumed his natural body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...ummm....\" Naruto trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" she said, then pointed to her cap, \"I'm AE3803.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked, huh? An identification number? He was expecting a name. Then he recalled the time he had decided to ghostwrite a manuscript for Jiraiya and had a courier ninja deliver it. Those guys addressed themselves by identification numbers, too. Must've been a courier thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thanks for helping save my life. I swear...where is this place? Never seen anything like it...\" Naruto told her, looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAE3803 blinked. Huh? He didn't know he was in...? Oh, this guy must have been like the Cedar Pollen Allergens: harmless, but in trouble just because he was somewhere he didn't mean to be. She felt a flash of pity, poor guy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, I'm....\" Naruto stopped and his eyes widened as he grabbed his throat as he fell to his knees, his head suddenly spinning as he started gasping, unable to breath. What was going on?! Why couldn't he breath all of a sudden?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAE3803 quickly realized that her new friend was suffocating and she began running around screaming, \"WHAT AM I GOING TO DO!?\", three times until she had an idea as but she hesitated as she reached for the one of the O2 tanks she was supposed to deliver. The cell she was suppose to deliver it to needed it, but her new friend needed it more. She didn't know what to do! But whatever she decided, she had to do it fast!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been weeks since his last mission had ended, and Naruto was beginning to lose his mind from boredom.  It was like the demand for his awesome ninja skills had suddenly dried up, and he was left killing time around town, mostly at his favorite ramen stand.  Now, though, he was bored as hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his desperation to find something to occupy his time, the hyperactive ninja came across a rumor of a shrine at the very outskirts of the village.  Here say of odd occurrences, and a strange presence that could not be explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, desperate for any form of activity that would get him out of his apartment,  Naruto left for the shrine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour of trudging along the outskirts of the village, the young shinobi found the slightly decrepit shrine.  It was obvious at first glance that no one had lived there for years.  The wood building was showing signs of serious decay, with patches of the roof missing and sapling trees growing out of the sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through the decrepit grounds, Naruto kept his eyes open for the supposed apparition.  The blond ninja left nothing unexplored, even overturning rocks in his hunt for the subject of the rumors.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each passing minute, the ninja became increasingly frustrated.  Had he just wasted his day looking for something that doesn't exist?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a rip off!\" Naruto bellowed, throwing his arms up in frustration.  In a fit of mixed rage, boredom, and frustration, Naruto lashed out with his foot, sending a loose rock careening into the broken down building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis ears were immediately met with an echoing crash from within the structure.  Soon after, the hairs on the back of his neck stood on end and the ninja was filled with a great dread.  A harsh whirlwind started up, swirling leaves and dust about in a foreboding cyclone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the wall of wind a silhouette appeared, large and imposing, from which came a thundering voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What unimaginable fool dares to defile my home?!\" The voice roared in fury.  Naruto could practically feel the moment when the being's attention fell on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...yeah, sorry about that, \" Naruto apologized, laughing nervously.  An act which the entity took exception to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You laugh at the destruction of my home?  Have you no shame human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was never said that Naruto was among the smartest ninja in Konoha.   By anyone.  Ever.  So, it wouldn't surprise anyone in the village to hear that the blond ninja managed to piss off a rather volatile spirit with almost no effort on his part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it was an accident! I didn't even know you lived here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the apparition was angry before, Naruto's blunt response had made it absolutely furious.  Without saying a word, the spirit summoned its power, creating a swirling vortex of energy around the gapping blond idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shall suffer for your arrogance, mortal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud pop, Naruto disappeared from his world, and ended up...</span></div></div>",

He tiredly, hesitantly started to open his eyes. Once that was done, he raised his head and rubbed it to relieve it of the pounding he felt before Looking up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And as soon as he did so, Naruto felt his jaw drop.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe was looking up at a girl whose entire presence screamed of unchallengeable authority and nobility. Her entire body was dressed in something that could be best described as a battle uniform that somewhat resembled Samurai armor and her dark hair was tied back with a red piece of metal, obviously made to look like a burning flame that reminded Naruto of a crown, only allowing two locks to frame her aristocratic face and her amber eyes seemed cold as ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was most shocking, however, was her sheer size! 554 feet, 7 11\u204432 inches, from the look of things!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was like some living monument!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, Naruto had to stifle a gasp. He was in her lap! Standing on her thighs as she sat down in what looked like a throne designed to look like a pillar of flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was this?! WHO was this?! What had happened to him?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaarrraaaghh! What happened to me?! I don't understand this at all!\" Naruto cried, holding his head. Apparently, he was louder than he realized, because he was suddenly cast in a shadow and looked up and paled as he saw he had been spotted and made to run, but a feminine hand closed around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl whose lap he had been plucked from's full, red lips tugged into a smirk as she raised him to her face and examined him, turning him around tilting him forward and backwards like he was new toy she had received. She regarded Naruto like he was an especially interesting science specimen\u2014one she couldn't wait to dissect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well now...what do I have here?\" she asked. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nNaruto raised an eyebrow. Whoever this girl was, she wasn't speaking the language that people did in Konoha and the rest of the Elemental Nations, but somehow, he knew the language as if he had been speaking it his whole life. That spirit that dumped him here must have done something to him to make that the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked at him expectantly. Then suddenly frowned before her hand suddenly grew unnaturally warm and Naruto yelped as if he'd been burned. He looked up at the girl. How had she done that?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that for?!\" he demanded, which probably wasn't smart, but he didn't like what had happened to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't keep me waiting then.\" the girl said simply, as if explaining how one and one was two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well excuse me, But you're...well...you're a lot to take in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does that mean?\" she said narrowing her eyes as they blazed threateningly. Her grip tightened and Naruto cried out as she started to crush him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're impressive.\"  Naruto gasped out, which was pretty true, finding himself in her lap was pretty mind-blowing for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl instantly loosened her grasp and Naruto greedily sucked in air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now...that's perfectly understandable.\" the giantess said with a tone of smug satisfaction, \"So I'm impressive and it left you shocked and gaping.\" she nodded as if this made perfect sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheesh...Naruto thought someone had an ego issue as  the girl looked him over again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who or what are you?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Naruto. Naruto Uzumaki. Shinobi of Konoha and future Hokage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl blinked at that declaration, not having the slightest idea what a shinobi or a Hokage could possibly be, but decided to not ask anything about it at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...to answer who Iam, I am Princess Azula, daughter of Fire Lord Ozai, and l plan to one day rule the grand and glorious Fire Nation as it's queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA princess, huh? Well...that explained the ego.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what the heck was a \"Fire Nation\", some kind of spin off on the Land of Fire? And what was a \"Fire Lord?\" Naruto raised an eyebrow at the names. \"You wouldn't happen to have a map, would you?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, to the question, Azula turned him towards one wall where one hung up in a frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond shinobi looked over the map for a brief second, but what he saw caused his eyes to nearly bulge out of their sockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring his travels with Jiraiya, Naruto had often gotten stuck with the task of reading the map. It wasn't that the Toad Sage couldn't do it himself, on the contrary, he could practically find his way in the world as if it had been his own pocket, but he'd thought it would do his young apprentice good to learn how to properly orientate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been tedious and just overall boring. But if there was one thing the blonde had managed to learn, then that was how the world looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the map that he was currently holding in his hand didn't look remotely like anyone he had ever seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked at the map for a couple of more seconds before letting out a sigh of exasperation. \"Alright. I just know I'm going to regret asking this, but what exactly does this map show? Because if it's a map of the world, then where the hell are all the Shinobi Nations?!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? You're not making any sense,\" frowned Azula.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not making any sense? You're the one who isn't making any sense! You're talking about nations, lords of fire, and and now you expect me to believe that the world consists of just four nations?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look all I know is some spirit or something dumped me here.\" Naruto complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula looked at him. Well...that explained a lot. Who knew what spirits could do? So one had shrunk him, transported him here, and (apparently) taken his memory, far as she figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, whatever...do you know where you're from at least?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto raised an eyebrow, she was talking to him like he had amnesia, \"I'm from Konoha. The village hidden in the leaves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right... And that would be where, exactly?\" The name didn't say her anything, but she was interested. Somewhere new to concur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked at her oddly for a second, blinking a couple of times. \"In the Land of Fire, of course,\" he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula looked at him a few times, blinked a little, then scowled. Lier! She didn't know of any place called that in the Fire Nation! But before she could call him out on it, she stopped...he'd said it was a <i>hidden </i> village. Of course she'd never have heard of it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...no need to worry about any trouble you'll have getting home any longer.\" she said absently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that Naruto brightened. Why not? Did this mean that she'd help him?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't?\" he asked.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Of course you don't, after all...\" she suddenly tightened her grip, squeezing him again. \"You. Are. Mine!\"</span></div></div>",

His terror level jumped when the sadistic princess started off towards an unknown destination with him in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula couldn't help laughing to herself a little as her mind filled with ideas concerning what she could do with her newest possession.  She couldn't wait to break in her little plaything.  However, one particular idea stood out in her mind, and that was showing her friends.  After all, a toy was most fun when you could show it off to others.  Finding a servant, the Fire Nation princess sent them to summon her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai and Ty Lee arrived at the same time.  They both knew how much their mutual friend held punctuality in high regard, and the things she would do if someone was tardy in responding to her summons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think Azula wants?\" Ty Lee asked her dispassionate friend while doing a handstand.  The nimble girl had a habit of doing acrobatics when bored.  To her left, a girl her age leaned against a wall, balancing a throwing knife on her index finger with an almost disinterested look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't care,\" the black-haired girl said monotonously, \"I only came so she wouldn't throw lightning at me later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hope it's something good, I can't believe how boring it's been around here lately,\" Ty Lee said in exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two didn't have to wait long for answers, as their royal friend appeared with an amused smirk on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So nice to see you again girls.  I'm so glad you could get here so quickly.  Follow me, I have something good to show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two followed their friend into her private quarters, where they were quickly left alone by the the princess' servants.  After she was sure they were completely alone, Azula brought forth something she had hidden on her person, beckoning Ty Lee and Mai to get a closer look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found this little guy snooping around my room,\" she said as her friends got a close look at her find.  \"I just had to keep him.  Can you imagine all the fun we could have with him?  I've decided to make him my little toy, and make him serve my every need.  You'll help me break him in, won't you?\"</span></div></div>",

Little by little, his fighting weakened, as his lungs struggled to draw in breath.  As Naruto fought his captor, the princess condescendingly pet the top of his head with her finger, ruffling his hair just to irk him all the more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now,\" Azula mocked playfully, \"the sooner you stop fighting it, the easier it will be for you.  Just resign yourself to being mine forever, and I'll make sure you are well looked after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, Naruto took offense to the very suggestion, and struggled all the more.  It didn't take long for Azula to get tired of his little resistance, and just put him in his place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you refuse to listen to reason, I guess that I'll have to teach you the hard way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTightening her grip even more, the Fire Nation princess drove all the air from tiny ninja's lungs, and prevented him from taking another breath until he finally passed out.  Releasing her grip, she let the miniscule frame of her new slave rest in the palm of her hand, unconscious, but once again breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mmm...how best to get you accustomed to your new role in life...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto came to, only to see the large, molten gold eyes of the firebending girl who had him at her mercy.

A sinister look in her eyes, Azula flipped him over, and proceeded to mark him as her's forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing down her paint brush, Azula traced her finger along the new addition to Naruto's back, admiring her handiwork, now permanently marked onto the small shinobi.  Emblazoned onto the blond ninja's flesh was the flame symbol of the Fire Nation.  Thanks to the ink she used, no matter how much he tried to wash it off, he would never be rid of her symbol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There,\" she said, a twisted joy present in her voice, \"now everyone can tell that you are mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait for you to wake up, because I have so much planned for you.\"</span></div></div>",

At first, he ignored the merchants, except for the occasional curious glance at the interesting trinket or shiny object.  He was just about to move on to get some food, when someone called his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You there!\" one of the more shifty looking merchants said, pointing right at Naruto, \"You look like you have the making of an extraordinary shinobi.  I could tell the moment I laid my eyes on you that you had the makings of something great, and I have just the thing to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto turned his head towards the noisy man, his eye squinting in annoyance.  He was about to dismiss the suspicious man, when the merchant shoved something in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This scroll,\" he said, continuing his sales pitch, \"comes from the archive of one of the most accomplished shinobi to ever live.  It is a technique on par with the infamous jutsu of your Fourth Hokage.  A marvelous space-time jutsu which will make you unstoppable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, some people are easily suckered in by a smooth sales pitch and mild flattery, and Naruto was just such a person.  The teenage ninja left the market that day with a lighter wallet, and a scroll containing an unverified technique, heading straight for a secluded area to try it out for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the field he chose to train, Naruto sat with his legs crossed, looking purposefully at the supposed jutsu.  It wasn't long before he had the hand signs memorized, and was ready for a trial run.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupposedly, the technique was supposed to move him seamlessly from one place to another.  His fingers blurred as he sped through the hand seals, and with a surge of chakra, fell unconscious before fading out of existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA distant rumble shook the sleeping blond, causing him to shift in his sleep, trying to get comfortable again.  Just as he found the best position, he was jerked again by yet another miniscule quake.  This time, it was enough to jar a slight bit of consciousness out of the boy, who moaned pitifully, and tried to return to the dreaming world.  It was not meant to be, however, as an even bigger tremor finally brought him to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear that someone has it out for me,\" Naruto groaned as he sat up, folding his arms over his chest in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was never a good thing when you woke up and had no idea where you are.  Therefore, Naruto decided that getting a look around the area would be a wise thing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScanning his surroundings, it was immediately clear that something was very wrong.  All around him were things like a bed, table, and dresser, but scaled for a person hundreds of feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on here?\" he cried in panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his state of alarm, Naruto failed to notice that the tremors that had woken him had returned, and were getting bigger.  It was only when he heard the loud sound of an opening door that he saw what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the massive doorway stood a colossal young woman, wearing clothes of varying shades of blue and white.  Her body had well toned muscle, and dark tan skin.  Compared to her, the blond ninja was relatively a couple inches tall.  Each step she took shook Naruto even more, and she was getting closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to end up squashed beneath the foot of this admittedly beautiful titan, the Konoha shinobi would rather risk going through the open door, and made a mad dash for it.</span></div></div>",

And I'm not tiny, you're just huge!\" Naruto yelled back in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, mister, just what were you doing in this 'huge' girl's room?\" Korra asked, staring him down with accusing eyes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> As soon as he saw where he had landed, Naruto knew he had to get away from this giantess as soon as possible. He realised if he didn't get off, there was no telling what would happen. Thoughts of him getting squashed, eaten, or breathed in drifted into his head. Suddenly, the object he was standing on started to shift. He looked to the rest of the giant's face and noticed she was starting to wake up. When she started to open her eyes, he noticed how green they were. It wouldn't be wrong to say they were like emeralds shining in the light.While they were opening, she slowly started to rise up to get out of bed. Naruto quickly realised this and used his used his chakra to stay on her nose as she started to get up. As she yawned, the sound was like a tailed beast's roar, to his perspective. Finally, she started to move her body to stand and get ready for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n When she reached her full height, Naruto realised just how small he was compared to the rest of the world he was in. The bed he had landed on looked as big as an entire country to him. The woman he was on was even more so. To her, he was truelly the size of an incredibly small bug to her. As Naruto let the thoughts sink in, the emerald eyed goddess finally started to walk. As soon as she started, Naruto felt a small force try to push him against the nose he now clung to. The loud booms in the distance reminded him that this was still a living being who could easily snuff his life out with a small movement. He quickly held on even more so he wouldn't fall of and end up as a small stain on the floor. While there, he decided to check his surroundings to try to figure out where he was heading. \"Okay. It looks like she is in a long hallway. That means she is either heading to a restroom or is heading into the kitchen to get food. Either of those won't end well for me if I fall off. Hopefully I'll be able to get her attention before anything happens to me.\" Naruto said to himself. Finally, she reached her destination. \"Okay. Looks like she went to the bathroom. Hopefully I'll get here attention soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n To Starfire, the day started out kind of odd. First she woke up in the middle of her dream after feeling something hit her forehead. She figured at first it was Beast Boy just pulling a prank on her to wake her up. She looked around, but couldn't see anything that would point to Beast Boy playing a prank on her. Next, she felt as if someone else was in the room with her. Again, she looked around trying to see if anyone was in the room with her. There was no one else in there with her, as far as she could tell, but the feeling still wouldn't leave her. Putting it into the back of her mind, she got up to begin her day. As she left her room and went to the bathroom to brush her teeth, she still couldn't shake the feeling that someone was near her. When she reached the bathroom, she quickly went to the mirror to get ready. As she stood there, she finally noticed a tiny speck on the tip of her nose. \"Huh? What is this tiny thing on my nose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n To Naruto, it happened suddenly. As she was looking in the mirror, she suddenly said, \"HUH? WHAT IS THIS TINY THING ON MY NOSE?\" To Naruto, this could be a chance to get discovered and hopefully saved. He started jumping up and down, waving his arms, and yelling as loud as he could to get her attention. \"HEY! I'M DOWN HERE! PLEASE HELP ME! I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED BUT SOMETHING CAUSED ME TO SHRINK AND END UP HERE! PLEASE, HELP!\" shouted Naruto, hoping to be heard. Suddenly, two fingers appeared out of nowhere to grab him. Taking this as a good sign, Naruto gladly let himself be grabbed and brought up to her eyes. \"HMM. WHAT ARE YOU? MAYBE SOME KIND OF BUG? YOU'RE ORANGE SO MAYBE YOU ARE AN EARTH BUG.\" Starfire said to herself. \"HOW DID YOU GET HERE, THOUGH?\" To Naruto, when he heard bug, he tried his hardest to be heard. \"I'M NOT A BUG! I AM A HUMAN BEING THAT ENDED UP SHRUNKEN IN YOUR ROOM!\" To most people, his screams wouldn't even reach their ears, but Starfire was not an earthling, but a Tameranian princess.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"WAIT, WHAT? YOU SAY YOU ARE A HUMAN? HOW DID YOU GET SO SMALL THEN? AND HOW DID YOU GET INTO THE TOWER?\" Starfire asked him. Glad to be heard by this titanic beauty, Naruto was glad to explain how he got her and ended up shrunken. \"SO IT WAS YOU WHO WOKE ME UP EARLIER THEN. THAT EXPLAINS THE FEELING THAT SOMEONE WAS WATCHING ME AS WELL. I'M GLAD TO KNOW THAT IT WAS JUST YOU AND NOT AN ENEMY.\" Starfire said to him. \"THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR, BUT COULD YOU PLEASE HELP ME!? I NEED TO GO BACK TO MY WORLD AND SHOW MY FRIENDS I'M OKAY!\" Starfire was actually troubled with this. While she could possibly get home, she could also keep him as a pet to keep her company. While she has been here for a while, she also gets lonely sometimes. Sure she had the rest of the titans with her, but there are still times when she is lonely or sad and needs someone to talk to, and he was the perfect size to keep with her at all times. Slowly, she made up her mind. She decided to...</span></div></div>",

I WILL TREAT YOU WITH AS MUCH CARE AND ATTENTION, THAT YOU WILL LOVE TO BE MINE. WHY, MAYBE WE CAN BE SOMETHING MORE AFTER ALL THIS. FOR NOW, THOUGH, I HAVE TO FIND A PLACE TO HIDE YOU FROM MY TEAM MATES.\" When Naruto heard this, he was not only upset, but extremely worried. \"How will I escape this crazy person!?!\" thought Naruto. \"Not only will she not help me get home,  but now she wants me as her pet!? What the heck is up with this world!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Naruto quickly tried to talk her out of this.\"WAIT! YOU CAN'T DO THIS! I'M A HUMAN BEING, NOT SOME ANIMAL YOU CAN KEEP WITH YOU. I JUST WANT TO GET HOME TO MY FRIENDS AND LOVED ONES. DOESN'T THAT MATTER TO YOU!?\" shouted Naruto to Starfire. \"NONSENSE. FOR ONE, HUMANS DON'T REALLY COME IN YOUR SIZE. SECOND, THIS WILL BE YOUR NEW HOME AND I WILL BE YOUR LOVED ONE. EVENTUALLY, I WILL ALSO SHOW YOU TO MY FRIENDS RAVEN AND JINX. THEY COULD BE YOUR LOVED ONES TOO.\" Starfire replied to him. \"Well, that didn't work. Time for plan B.\" Thought Naruto. \"OKAY, BUT WHAT ABOUT FOOD, WATER AND SHELTER!? WHILE I'M STILL SMALL, I STILL NEED THESE TO SURVIVE. HOW CAN I GET THESE THINGS IF I'M YOUR PET!?\" \"EASY.\" replied Starfire. \"THE FOOD AND WATER I CAN BRING TO YOU AND FEED YOU EVERY DAY. THE SHELTER PART IS THAT YOU WILL USUALLY BE WITH ME. EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT, I CAN EASILY GO AND BUY A CAGE OR BOX FOR YOU TO STAY IN.\" \"There went plan B. Let's try C.\" \"WHAT ABOUT MY LIFE!? I CAN'T LIVE IT IF I'M STUCK IN SOME CAGE OR POCKET. WHAT ABOUT SUNLIGHT, OR THE WIND!? THOSE ARE IMPORTANT TOO!\" \"I HAVE ALREADY THOUGHT OF THAT, NARUTO. AFTER AWHILE, WHEN YOU DECIDE TO STAY WITH ME, I WILL GLADLY LET YOU OUT. I WILL EVEN PLAY WITH YOU MYSELF. NOW PLEASE, BE QUIET. IM TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO PUT YOU IN.\" And with that she put him onto the sink and ended the discussion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh great. Now how am I supposed to escape?\" thought Naruto. As if the gods were answering his prayers,  Starfire decided to turn away and look for something to place him in. \"Perfect,\" thought Naruto. \"Now maybe I can escape.\" He slowly began to walk his way down to the floor as quietly as he could. When he made it down, he looked at Starfire to make sure she wasn't looking. Seeing that she wasn't, he quickly made his way to the door. \"If I can get passed that door, I might be able to find someone who will help me. I'm sorry Starfire, but I can't be your pet. I have people waiting for me.\" Half way to the door, he heard Starfire say in the distance, \"I'm sorry Naruto but I can't seem to find anything here. We might have to go back to my room and find something there. Naruto? Naruto? Why won't you ans-\" she stopped mid sentence after seeing Naruto was gone. \"NARUTO!!\" she said angrily. \"Where are you Naruto!? I know your still here.\" Hearing this, Naruto quickly turned it up to high gear and ran as fast as he could. \"Come on legs. Almost there.\" Sadly it was not Kent to be as Starfire quickly saw where he was.\" Naruto! You better stop and get back here, or you will be in much trouble!.\" she said angrily. He didn't stop, however, and was quickly caught in Starfire's giant hand. Lifting him up, Naruto could see the anger in her eyes. \" NARUTO, I TOLD YOU THAT YOU WOULD BE MY PET AND YOU WILL. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MAY BE SCARED, BUT THERE IS NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF. I WILL TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOU FROM NOW ON. NOW, THAT SAID, I CANNOT LET THIS GO UNPUNISHED, SO WE WILL DISCUSS THIS WHEN WE GET BACK TO MY ROOM.\" she said angrily to him. Before he could make another attempt to escape, she quickly curled her fingers around him to make sure he can't flee. And with that done, she started to walk back to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Great.\" nNaruto thought to himself. \" Not only am I trapped in her hand, but now she's angry at me for trying to escape. How could this get any worse?\" He then felt as she started to walk, bring the hand he was in up and down like some kind of demented joy ride. \"Should have kept my mouth shut.\" he thought sickly. Soon, they reached her room, but Starfire still wouldn't release the grip she had on her new pet. She then started to look all around her room for a place to keep Naruto that wouldn't let him get away again. She soon found a small box under her bed that had high sides. \"That would be perfect for him. Hopefully he will learn not to try and escape again. Huh? What is that?\" As she bent down to retrieve the box, she also noticed and old boot she used to wear beside it. \"Huh. I forgot about this thing. Why did I not wear it again? It looks to be in working order. Bringing it to her nose, she realised why she quit wearing it. \"Oh X'Hal. Now I remember. This thing stinks worse than friend Beast Boy after playing stink ball with friend Cyborg.\" This soon gave her an idea. \"Hmm. I hate to do this to my new pet, but he must be punished. This should hopefully get him to understand not to run away again, but it could also harm him as well.\" With that done, she got ready to show Naruto his new home for the foreseeable future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n When Starfire's hand opened up, the first thing Naruto thought was \"Bright!\" Soon after adjusting to the light, he noticed Starfire was holding him in front of a box and a thigh high boot. As if reading his mind, she told him,\"AS YOU CAN SEE PET NARUTO, INFRONT OF YOU ARE TWO THINGS. BOTH OF THESE WILL BE YOUR NEW HOME. WHILE THE BOX IS FOR WHEN YOU ARE A GOOD PET, THE BOOT IS FOR WHEN YOU ARE BEING BAD. I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO NEVER HAVE TO GO INTO THE BOOT, BECAUSE OF THE ODOR, BUT IF IT WILL TEACH YOU NOT TO DISOBEY ME, THEN I WILL GLADLY USE IT.\" Naruto was frightened. When he saw them in front of him, he didn't know what to think. Now that he knows what they are for, he decides to quickly obey her for now. What she says next terrifies him. \"NOW THEN, IT IS TIME FOR YOUR PUNISHMENT TO BEGIN. SINCE THIS WAS YOUR FIRST TIME, I WILL...\"</span></div></div>",

AFTERWARDS, WE WILL GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER A LITTLE BIT MORE AND MAYBE EVEN PLAY TOGETHER. JUST REMEMBER, THIS IS YOUR PUNISHMENT FOR TRYING TO LEAVE ME. YOU COULD HAVE JUST AS EASILY HAVE BEEN SQUASHED IF I DIDN'T NOTICE YOU TRYING TO ESCAPE.\" told Starfire to Naruto. Naruto, didn't hear anything she said then. The only thoughts in his mind were that he was going to have to spend half an hour in an old smelly boot this titanic woman once wore. All because he wanted to try to get home. He feared just how bad the boot would be to him, especially at his size. It also looked to big for him to try to climb out of. This meant he had to try to talk Starfire out of putting him in there, or else he was going to basically suffocate from the fumes that were surely in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"PLEASE STARFIRE! DON'T PUT ME IN THAT BOOT!\" pleaded Naruto. \"I PROMISE I WON'T TRY TO RUN AWAY AGAIN! JUST PLEASE DON'T PUT ME IN THERE!\" Starfire thought this over, but decided to ignore him. He had to learn that his place was with her, and if this was going to help him learn this fact, then so be it. \"I'M SORRY NARUTO, BUT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY FOR YOU TO LEARN WHERE YOUR PLACE IS. I SAID I WOULD LET YOU OUT IN THIRTY MINUTES, AND I WILL. YOU WILL JUST HAVE TO ACCEPT YOUR PUNISHMENT. HOPEFULLY AFTER THIS, YOU WON'T TRY TO RUN AWAY.\" To her, this really was the best she could come up with. And in her mind, it was for his own good. He seriously could have been hurt if he hadn't been found. The thought of her pet being eaten by animals, crushed under a random person's foot, or badly hurt by anything else scared her. She seemed to instantly bond with him at first sight and it pained her to imagine what would have happened if she hadn't found him first. \"Hopefully after this, we can start to bond with each other.\" thought Starfire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then started to move her hand over the opening of her boot. To Naruto, the smell that rose from it was bad enough. \"If this is what it smells like from a distance,\" thought Naruto, \"than this punishment is going to be horrible.\" Starfire, seeming the fearful expression on his face, tried to calm him down. \"It's okay, Naruto\" Starfire whispered to him in a calming voice. \"I promise that when the thirty minutes are up, if I am not trying to stop a villain, I will come and get you out of this boot for your punishment. Afterwards, we can start to bond like an owner and pet should.\" To Naruto, this actually served to calm him down. The words she said to him showed that she had no malice to him, but cared for him, and that she didn't want him to get hurt. \"Wow,\" thought Naruto. \"She really does care for me. Maybe after this, I will be able to explain the full situation to her and she'll let me go.\" Naruto thought it over, and would accept the punishment, only because of the chance to talk this over with her. \"OKAY!\" shouted Naruto. \"I WILL ACCEPT THIS PUNISHMENT!\" Starfire was overjoyed with what she heard him shout. \"Maybe this means he is finally accepting now. How glorious!\" she thought. \u201dOKAY NARUTO. GET READY.\" She positions him to were when she let go, he would slide down to the end of her boot. And finally, she released him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n To Naruto, the fall wasn't all that bad. Sure, it was scary at first, but the slide down wasn't all that bad. When he landed, he looked up to see Starfire's face looking down at him. \"OKAY NARUTO, BE GOOD. I'LL BE BACK IN THIRTY MINUTES. DON'T TRY TO ESCAPE AGAIN.\" and with that, she left. Naruto looked around at his temporary home and saw how it was. The smell was horrible. It was like someone left a dumpster outside in the summer sun for a week. \"Oh god!.\" thought Naruto. \"The smell in here is worse then the dumpster outside my apartment back in Konoha.\" He then noticed how spongey the floor was. \"Huh. I owned why it is do spongey?\" Reaching down, Naruto pushed down on the floor and what happened next disgusted him. Out if the insole came an inch of foot sweat that soaked into the insole. \"Okay, that's it.\" Naruto said. \"I am thoroughly disgusted. It wasn't the end of his observations. He decided to check the end of the boot and saw five imprints. Holy cow! I can fit into these and have some room to spare.\" he said. He then realised just what these were. Good lord! Those are her toe imprints. If that's my size compared to her toe, I could have seriously died if I didn't find her.\" After ten minutes, Naruto finally decided to take a quick nap. \"Okay, where can I rest for a minute?\" Naruto asked to himself. He quickly decided to speed on the heel imprint. \"Well, it's better than the toes. The smell is ten times as bad.\" Naruto quickly fell asleep and woke up ten minutes later. As the minutes dragged on, the smell kept getting to him. \"God, I hope this punishment ends soon. This smell is really starting to get to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Eventually the thirty minute mark came and there was no Starfire yet. \"Okay, it's been thirty minutes. She should be here by now. Maybe she just lost track of time or something. I hope she gets back here soon. I'm getting a little bit hungry.\" The time came and gone, and Starfire was no where in sight. Fifteen more minutes pass by and Naruto starts to get worried. \"Where is she? She said she would get me out after thirty minutes. It's been longer than thirty minutes and she still hasn't showed.\" Naruto didn't know this, but something had happened that led to Starfire having to go away for a while. All the while, the stench was getting to Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Was it...</span></div></div>",

It appears that Lobo has appeared near our moon. They aren't sure just what he is going to do to it, but knowing Lobo, it isn't going to be good. While they would usually go and stop him themselves, they are in the middle of a diplomatic mission and can't send anyone else, so they decided to call us to stop him.\" Robin explained. \"Wait, Lobo's the guy with the interstellar motorcycle, right?\" asked Cyborg. \"Yes.\" replied Robin. \"The guy that is known for blowing up his own home planet?\" asked Beast Boy. \" Yes.\" replied Robin. \"The man who can usually go toe to toe with Superman?\" Cyborg and Beast Boy asked together. \"For the third time, YES!\" shouted Robin at the end. \"This means that the main hitters will be Starfire and Raven. Thankfully, the league sent us some specially made suits that we can use to fight in space. We will leave immediately.\" With that said, the team started to get ready . \"Uh oh.\" thought Starfire. \"Hopefully this will not take to long. I still have to take out pet Naruto from his punishment.\" They soon left, not knowing what will happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It has been a couple of hours since Starfire and the rest of the titans left to stop Lobo. To Naruto, this was starting to annoy him. \"Where is she?\" he thought. \"She said  she will let me out after thirty minutes and it's has been over a couple of hours. Something must have happened, otherwise she would have let me out by now. Seriously, this smell is starting to get to me.\" Eventually he decided to wait it out and hope Starfire came back soon. \"Okay, this is getting boring.\" Naruto thought. \"I'll go see what Kurama thinks.\" Entering his mindscape, Naruto soon found himself facing his partner and friend Kurama, the Kyuubi no Kitsune and strongest of the tailed beasts. \"Hey Kurama! What the heck is going on? All of a sudden, I ended up in this weird place and for some reason, I'm shrunk to two inches. What gives?\" asked Naruto to Kurama. \"I DON'T KNOW, BRAT. I'M IN THE DARK JUST AS MUCH AS YOU. ALL I KNOW IS THAT WE ARE IN A STRANGE WORLD AND THAT THE BEINGS HERE ARE INCREDIBLY BIGGER. ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU CAN STILL USE YOUR CHAKRA TO DEFEND YOURSELF. THAT, AND I SAW THAT YOU MET A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN ALREADY. SO HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE A PET?\" Kurama teased with a smirk on his face. \"Oh shut up, you fur ball! You'll see, we'll get out of this soon and back home. Believe it!\" With that said, Naruto vanished back to reality. \"I hope so kit. Then again, this place wouldn't be so bad. You already have someone that cares for you here. Maybe you can make a better life here. I just wonder what that familiar energy was that I felt when we landed here. I don't know why, but it feels like it is weaker for some reason. Oh well. Hopefully we will figure this out. And with that, the great Kyuubi went back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Back with Starfire, she and the others have finally confronted Lobo, who had decided to blow up the moon to see if what he heard about it being made of cheese was true. \"Come on, brats. You know you can't stop the main man from blowing this giant cheese ball to kingdom come. Just give up, and I might share some of this cheese with you.\" said Lobo. \"For the last time, Lobo. This moon isn't made of cheese. It's just a ball of packed together dust and other stuff that the Earth needs. Without it, the tides of the Earth will go haywire. Not to mention all of the debris that would plummet down to the Earth.\" Robin replied back. \"I don't care. What the main man wants, the main man gets. And the main man wants a taste of this Moon cheese!\" \"Fine, have it your way.\" Robin said.\"Titans, go!\" That was the signal for Starfire and Raven to start attacking as the rest supported them from a distance. Starfire quickly dodged Lobo's hook and punched him away from the moon. Raven quickly tried to restrain him, but failed as he broke free and brought out his gun. \"Nice try, but you'll have to try harder to beat me!\" Lobo said, taking shots at the titans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Back on Earth, Naruto was quickly starting to get hungry and tired waiting for Starfire to release him. \"I hope she is okay.\" thought Naruto. She should have been back by now.\" He quickly started to get hungry. \"God, I'm so hungry. There isn't anything else to eat, though.\" \"Not exactly, kit.\" \"Huh, Kurama? What do you mean?\" \"Well, I reckon there may be something to eat, but you won't like it.\" \"I don't care. I'm just so hungry, I can eat about anything.\" \"Well Naruto, if you're so sure. Go to the toe imprints. There should be something to eat there.\" \"What do you mean, Kurama? Why would there be food over their?\" \"Just go over there, kit. Just remember, you may not like it.\" Naruto quickly want over and found some sort of black stuff near the imprints. \"I guess this is what he was talking about. Oh well. He said it was edible\" Naruto quickly to took a bite out of it and quickly spit it out. \"What the hell was that stuff!?\" thought Naruto. \"It tasted like old moldy cheese.\" Seeing no their alternative, he quickly ate it as quick as he could so he wouldn't taste it. \"Bleh! That was disgusting. At least whatever that was filled me up. I guess I'll go to sleep now.\" Not bowing he just at Starfire's old toejam, Naruto quickly fell asleep and had one strange dream. \"Huh? Where am I?\" thought Naruto. He looked around and saw he was on  a red desert. \"What the heck!? Why am I naked!?\" This was true. For some reason, he was also naked. He suddenly heard a rumble in the distance. \"Huh? What was that?\" Looking around, he quickly saw what was rumbling. There was Starfire, just as naked as he was and just as huge as she was now. \"Be quiet, Husband Naruto. The others and I are trying to rest. This may be our wedding night but we need some sleep, too.\" she whispered to him. \"HUSBAND!? WEDDING NIGHT!? OTHERS!? WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON!?\" he thought. \"Yes, Naruto. We really need to sleep.\" said a voice he didn't recognize. \"We have plenty to do tomorrow after all.\" He looked around, trying to find the owner of this voice and quickly saw her. She was just a little bit shorted than Starfire and that was all he could see of her. He looked and saw other bodies in the bed with them, all of them female and just as big, \"Just go to sleep, husband.\" he heard Starfire sayand was the last thing he remembers is her lips puckered a small amount coming at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Morning finally came for Naruto and quickly woke up. \"Dang, that was a weird dream last night. As if that could ever happen. I'm just a pet to her. Not to mention the others. Hopefully Starfire will be back soon.\" And with that, he waited. An hour passed before he heard something. Jolting up, he quickly looked up to see if it was Starfire, but quickly fell as the boot turned over. He eventually landed in a hand he recognized and looked up into eyes he recognized immediately. \"STARFIRE!\" shouted Naruto, happy to see his friend. \"Hello pet Naruto! I missed you so much! I'm sorry I didn't let you out earlier, but something happened that stopped me from getting you. You must be so hungry, so I brought you a piece of pizza as an apology for being in there so long.\" whispered Starfire to Naruto. \"I hope you at least had a pleasant night?\" \"IT WAS OKAY STARFIRE! I DID SOME THINKING AND I REALLY SHOULDN'T HAVE RAN AWAY FROM YOU! I REALLY AM SORRY FOR IT!\" shouted Naruto. Starfire was glad to hear this. \"Maybe he won't have to go into the boot again.\" she thought. After eating, Starfire quickly decided what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to...</span></div></div>",

He was in my old boot for a while yesterday and probably needs some sunlight and air. Maybe we can bond with each other after awhile and enjoy each others company. Oh how glorious!\" Starfire thought to herself. Quickly picking Naruto up, she left for the door. While she was walking, Starfire, excited over going outside and bonding with her pet, didn't see her friend Raven,who was reading and walking at the same time, and bumped into each other. \"Oops. Sorry friend Raven. Are you okay?\" asked Starfire. \"Yeah, I'm okay. You seem excited. Is there any reason for that?\" asked Raven. \"No reason. It just feels like such a beautiful day outside and I decided to enjoy it.\" replied Starfire, who slowly hid  her hands behind her back. \"I'm sorry friend Raven, but I must go now. I'll talk to you later. Bye.\" With that said, Starfire quickly walked towards the exit and away from her friend. \"Hmm...\" thought Raven to herself. \"Why is she in such a hurry? She usually isn't like that. Maybe it has something to do with that energy I felt yesterday morning. I'll keep an eye on her to see if she is okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Naruto didn't know what was happening right now. He had just finished eating this piece of triangle Starfire called a pizza and was suddenly grabbed by her and carried somewhere. \"I wonder where she is taking me. I hope she isn't going to put me into an even smellier place or give me to some strange scientist to dissect.\" thought Naruto fearfully. \"Calm down gaki. I highly doubt she is doing either of those things to you.\" said Kurama. \"She is probably just going to take you outside fore some fresh air. You where trapped in a stinky old boot for awhile, remember? Besides, she doesn't seem to be the type of person who would just hand you over.\" \"I guess you're right, Kurama. Still, I wonder what she is going to do.\" Suddenly, Naruto's carrier shook and jostled him. \"Huh? What happened?\" Naruto decided to try and listen to what was happening outside. \"Oh. She just bumped into this Raven girl. I hope she is okay. Huh, I guess you were right Kurama. She was taking me outside.\" He soon felt her walk away from Raven and was left to himself. Kurama, however, was discussing something to himself. \"So the girl is the source of that energy I felt when we entered this place. I still don't know why it feels so familiar, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Finally reaching the exit, Starfire walked outside and went over to a place where Naruto and she could have some privacy. Opening her hand, she saw that Naruto was just relaxing. \"OKAY NARUTO. WE'RE HERE.\" said Starfire. \"WHAT'S HAPPENING!? WHY DID YOU TAKE ME OUTSIDE!?\" asked/shouted Naruto \"WELL, PET NARUTO. I FIGURED YOU WOULD NEED SOME FRESH AIR AFTER BEING IN MY BOOT FOR SO LONG YESTERDAY. I ALSO FIGURED THAT WE COULD ALSO BOND WHILE WE ARE OUT HERE.\" stated Starfire. \"OKAY, BUT WHAT ARE WE GOING TO BOND OVER!?\" \"WELL, I FIGURED WE COULD TALK ABOUT WERE WE USED TO LIVE AND OTHER STUFF.\" Starfire answered. \"Hmm. What do you think Kurama? Should we tell her?\" asked Naruto. \"I don't see why not. It won't hurt to tell her and maybe you'll get her trust and not be her pet.\" \"Okay Kurama. If you say so.\" Looking up to Starfire, Naruto explained where he was from. \"I AM FROM KONOHAGAKURE.! IT IS ONE OF THE FIVE MAJOR VILLAGES FROM THE WORLD I AM FROM AND IS SURROUNDED BY FORESTS! IT ALSO HAS A MONUMENT TO OUR PAST LEADERS !\" shouted Naruto to Starfire. \"OH REALLY? AND HAT DID YOU DO?\" asked Starfire. \"I WAS A SHINOBI FOR MY VILLAGE!\" shouted Naruto \"WHAT IS A SHINOBI?\" asked Starfire. \"BASICALLY, WE WERE MERCENARIES FOR HIRE! WE WOULD DO ALL SORTS OF JOBS FROM PAINTING FENCES TO ASSASSINATING ENEMIES OF OUR VILLAGE! WE WOULD THEN GET PAID FOR DOING SAID MISSION , WHICH DEPENDED ON HOW IT WAS RANKED FROM D TO S!\" \"THAT SOUNDS SORT OF LIKE MY PEOPLE. WHILE WE ARE FIERCE WARRIORS, WE ARE ALSO PEACEFUL. WE HARDLY EVER WENT TO WAR AND INSTEAD CHANNELED OUR ENERGY TO BETTER OUR SOCIETY. DID YOUR PEOPLE FIND PEACE?\" asked Starfire to Naruto. \"YEAH, BUT ONLY RECENTLY. WE USED TO ALWAYS BE AT WAR WITH EACH OTHER UNTIL THE FOURTH SHINOBI WAR.\" Naruto and Starfire spent the whole day with each other basically bonding and asking each other questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Fianlly , six o clock came and they decided to go inside. Starfire carried Naruto to his box and saw how empty it was. \"HOLD ON NARUTO AND I WHILE FIND SOMETHING FOR YOU TO SLEEP ON.\" Starfire quickly left to find an unused sponge Naruto could sleep on until she made him a better bed. \"Huh, this wasn't that bad a day.\" thought Naruto. \"It was actually kind of fun. Much more fun than back at the village.\" Naruto sat down and waited for starfire to get back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That was so much fun!\" thought Starfire. \"Pet/friend Naruto is a great person. I can't believe that he helped win the war he was in. He truly is a powerful warrior and a great friend. I'm lucky I found him.\" Starfire was in the kitchen looking for a sponge when Raven walked in. \"Oh hello friend Raven. How have you been this fine day?\" asked Starfire. \"Pretty good. I finished the book I was reading earlier. Where were you this whole time?\" returned Raven. \"Oh, just flying around. Nothing major. Do you remember where the sponges are?\" \"Bottom drawer behind the spare dish soap. Why do you need it?\" \"Oh just for something fun. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Good evening friend Raven.\" Walking off, Starfire headed back to her room, not noticing Raven following her. Seeing Starfire go in, Raven decides to eavesdrop behind Starfire's door. \"Here you go pet/friend Naruto. It isn't much, it will work until I make you a better one.\" \"Thank you Starfire!\" \"Huh? Who was that second voice? Is it this Naruto person? And why can I barely hear him?\" Hearing enough Raven quickly goes into Starfire's room to see what is going on. \"Okay, where is he?\" asked Raven. \"Where's who?\" replied Starfire. \"You know who, Starfire. The person you were talking to. Naruto. Where is he?\" \"Fine ,here he is.\" replied Starfire. She brought a box Raven didn't notice over to her and brought it to her face. \"I'm going to introduce you to one of my friends now pet/friend Naruto. She won't hurt you.\" Starfire said into the box. She brought the box over to Raven, who quickly looked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n What did she see?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> When Raven looked into the box Starfire was holding, she was expecting to see alot of things. What she didn't expect to see was a tiny person dressed in an orange jumpsuit. Sure, she could see a bug or a tiny animal, but this? This took the cake. \"Starfire, why is there a tiny person in this box?\" asked Raven. \"Well, friend Raven, this tiny person is Naruto, my new friend and pet. Before we had to go after Lobo, I woke up and found him on my nose. At first, I didn't even know he was there until I went and looked into the mirror. After I saw him, we talked about how he got here and what he was doing in the tower. Eventually I decided to make him my pet.\" explained Starfire to Raven. After hearing this, Raven thought back to earlier that same day. \"Wait a second,\" thought Raven to herself. \"He must be the source of that energy I felt earlier, or atleast had something to do with it. I better figure out if he is going to be a problem to us later on.\" \"Hey Starfire, Is it alright if I talk to him in private?\" Raven asked outloud. \"Sure friend Raven. Just be careful with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n While they were having a conversation above him, Naruto was contemplating what to say to this new giant that Starfire was talking to. \"Okay, so is that Raven person Starfire talked to earlier. Huh, she seems pretty nice, to be honest. Hopefully she is nice.\" At the same time, Kurama was feeling a sense of deja vu. \"Okay, this energy coming from the girl is incredibly familiar. Why do I feel like I know it?\" asked Kurama to himself. Deciding that this was important, Kurama brings Naruto into the mindscape. \"HEY GAKI, LISTEN UP. I DON'TKNOW WHY, BUT THE ENERGY COMING FROM THE GIRL IS FAMILIAR TO ME. IF YOU CAN, TRY TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT IT.\" \"Sure, if you think its important.\"replied Naruto. Naruto leaves the confines of his mindscape and finds himself back in the box that will be his home for the foreseeable future. Just as he starts to think of how to find out more about this Raven's energy, he hears the end of the two giants conversation. \"Perfect,\" he thought to himself. \"Hopefully I can get the information I need from this talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Starfire leans over the box and carefully whispers to Naruto, \"Okay Naruto, I'm gonna leave you and Raven alone for a couple of minutes. She just wants to have a talk with you. Please try to get along with each other. If I hear anything bad from either you or Raven, I will punish the person who said it. That means you will go back to the boot. So be on your best behavior.\" Seeing she warned Naruto enough, she carefully gives the box to Raven, telling her something similar, just without the boot part. She then goes out into the hallway to give her friends the privacy they want. Inside, Naruto and  Raven start to have their conversation. \"NOW BEFORE WE BEGIN, I'M GONNA DO A SPELL THAT WILL MAKE IT SEEM LIKE WE ARE TALKING REGULARLY WITH EACH OTHER, SO DON'T BE AFRAID. AZERATH METRION ZINTHOS!\" When Raven finishes her chant, a weird black light surrounded both their ears and mouths. Deciding to test it, Naruto asks her in  reguler voice, \"Can you hear me?\" \"Perfectly.\" Raven replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Okay, now how did you get here?\" asked Raven. \"I don't know,\" replied Naruto. \"I was just training when this portal opens up under me. Next thing I know, I'm tiny and landing on Starfire's bed.\" Raven could tell he was telling the truth and decided to ask him some more questions. \"Okay, next question. What is this energy I'm sensing from you? It feels like an ocean, even at your current size.\" \"That is probably my chakra. It is a combination of physical and spiritual energies that your body naturally makes. At least, that's how it works in my world.\" Naruto says to Raven. \"As for the size, I'm not really okay saying why. No offence, but I did just meet you people. I have to keep some secrets.\"  This continued with Raven asking all sorts of questions, such as the uses of chakra, how to learn how to use it, and others. After this round of questions from Raven, Naruto decided to ask some questions of his own about this world, such as technology and inhabitants. Finally satisfied, Raven decides to bring back Starfire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before Raven brings Starfire back inside, she asks Starfire if she can we the same spell on her as she did Naruto, to make speaking with him easier. Seeing no problem with it, she quickly agrees. Starfire quickly heads over to Naruto's box to check on him. Seeing he was ok,Starfire asks what they were talking about. Raven explains the whole conversation to Starfire, with Naruto adding his own piece to it. By the time they were done talking, the moon was already in the sky with the stars quickly joining it. \"Oh look at the time friends, we must be getting to bed soon.\" says Starfire. \"Alright,\" says Raven. \"But I want to talk more to Naruto tomorrow.\" \"Sure,\" replies Naruto. \"All three of us can make a day of it.\" Their plan for tomorrow in place, Raven leaves the room and heads towards hers. Naruto and Starfire quickly head to bed. Just before Starfire leaves, she tells him one last thing. \"Good night friend/pet Naruto. I love you.\" Leaving Naruto with those parting words, Starfire heads to her own bed, excited what tomorrow will bring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n What happens next?</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ll just send the package wherever it needs to go from the comfort of my own lab.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the Professor was talking, Fry and his robot buddy moved towards the control panel, where the delivery boy began, at Bender\u2019s goading, to input random numbers into the computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Fry, get that portal open!\u201d Bender cheered \u201cThe New New York Bank isn\u2019t going to rob itself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking on with loud gasps of horror, as Fry\u2019s meddling caused the machine to spark and sputter as it powered on, opening the portal with the sound of static.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFry, you idiot!  Get away from there!  If you enter random coordinates, you don\u2019t know where the portal will open of what will come through the other side!\u201d the Professor warned, but it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened so suddenly, Naruto had no chance to react.  As he was walking down the street towards his apartment, a large hole opened beneath his feet and sent him plummeting to parts unknown to anyone in his world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I swear, if I ever find out who did this, I\u2019m going to kick their testicles into their throat,\u2019 Naruto thought grimly before proceeding to let out a loud curse as he fell down the seemingly infinite expanse of the tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Professor Farnsworth worked frantically at the controls, the rest of the Planet Express crew could only watch as the portal reached maturity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s too late now, the portal has opened at its destination, and it has pulled in something.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you tell what it is, Professor?\u201d Amy asked from behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJudging by these read outs, Fry has accessed an alternate universe.  So for all we know, he could have pulled in a giant ape monster that breaths fire, and has knives for fingers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a small *poit* an unconscious Naruto flew out of the machine and landed on Leela\u2019s left breast, causing everyone to look at him, while silencing all those assembled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr a tiny man.  Whatever,\u201d the Professor finished.  \u201cAmy, Leela, you look after him until he wakes up.  The rest of you, follow me to the electronics store so I can replace the parts that were destroyed by Fry\u2019s idiocy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Amy and Leela were left alone with the tiny ninja, neither very happy about having to babysit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do we both have to watch him?  I mean, spleesh, I have more important stuff to do today,\u201d Amy complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see your point,\u201d Leela said, holding the tiny man in the palm of her hand, \u201cit\u2019s not like it takes more than one person to look after this little guy, and I don\u2019t really want to do it either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a momentary pause in their conversation, before Amy spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRock, paper, scissors for it?\u201d the Martian girl asked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The first thing he noticed was the warm, soft surface he was atop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Okay.  Rock, paper scissors on three</b>,\" a booming voice said from above, allowing for the ninja to fully grasp his predicament.  In the sky above him two gigantic hands came speeding down, both stopped midair in closed fists.  Following the appendage down a giant forearm, up to a colossal shoulder, until he saw the faces of two women, hundreds of times his size.  One of them wore a pink sweat suit, and had black hair which was cut short and parted down the middle.  The other, to his surprise, had one giant eye in the middle of her face, as well as long purple hair, which was pulled back into a ponytail, and a white tank top which showed off the largest cleavage Naruto had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Again!</b>\" the loud voice said once more, echoing in Naruto's relatively small ears.  By now, the blond had realized that what he thought was a bed of some kind, was actually the palm of the massive cyclops woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON??!!!\" the ninja screamed in panic, catching the attention of the two giantesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Oh, look who's awake,</b>\" said the purple-haired cyclops, leaning in close to get a good look at the tiny man in the palm of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Really?  Let me see,</b>\" the one with the bobbed hair said eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you people?!  Where the hell am I?!!!\" Naruto demanded, barely keeping control of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>I guess we do sort of owe you an introduction,</b>\" said the giant cyclops, \"<b>Well, my name is Turanga Leela, but you can call me Leela</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>And I'm Amy Wong</b>\" the sweatsuit wearing cutie said sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>As to where, you are in the Planet Express building on Earth</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked in confusion.  Why did the think it was necessary to tell him that he was still on Earth?  Where else could he be, the moon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, never heard of Planet Express before.  Nevermind.  WHY AM I SO DAMN SMALL?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>I don't know, you just came out of the portal like that,</b>\" the one now identified as Leela  stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DON'T KNOW?!  I WANT SOME ANSWERS!  NOW START TALKING, DAMMIT!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeela's eye narrowed angrily, as she began to lose patience with this little punk.  How dare he treat her like that, when his life was quite literally in the palm of her hand.  Unconsciously, her hand became a fist, holding their tiny visitor tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Listen you little brat!  I was going to explain everything I knew about how you got here, but not if you use that attitude with me!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Spleesh Leela, go easy on the little guy.

She tensed the index finger of her other hand against her thumb, and released it in the form of a flick to the forehead of the belligerent ninja.  Naruto's head snapped backwards from the hit.  The small blond screamed bloody murder from the pain, it was even worse than being hit by Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let that be a lesson to you,\" Leela said firmly as she wagged the finger she struck him with in his face.  Her giant, even relative to his her size, eye was narrowed and fixed on him, as if daring Naruto to defy her warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto still reeled from the heavy hit he had taken, just barely able to understand what the massive cyclops had said.  However, he understood the implications of her warning.  If he wanted to get anywhere, especially back to his home, he would have to play along with the colossal women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you've learned to be polite, Let's see what we can actually figure out about you,\" Leela said as she her arm, which bore, as Naruto noticed for the first time, a high tech armband.  She placed him in the other woman's palm and held the device over him while she pressed a button.  It made a noise like an idling car while she moved it over him.  Nervous chills ran through the tiny blond's body, not knowing what exactly was going to happen when she finished whatever she was doing.  Finally, with a ding, she finished, and looked intently at her armband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...according to this thing I wear on my wrist, his body structure is near identical to a human's, only scaled down,\" Leela informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one called Amy leaned in to watch over Leela's should and get a look at the display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It also says he isn't poisonous,\" Amy added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you want to know if I'm poisonous?\" Naruto asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No reason, just getting all the information we can, otherwise the Professor will get mad at us,\" Amy explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it really matters right now, though.  It's already the end of the day, and the idiots aren't back yet.  We might as well go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy silently nodded in agreement, not wanting to spend anymore time at her employer's than necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, but one of us still needs to take care of this guy, otherwise who knows what could happen.

It didn't take long for him to discover the big size difference between him and the place he found himself, he figured he couldn't be more than a couple inches tall by his estimation, but now he had to figure out how to get back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the giant door creaking open caught his attention, and he saw a giant person emerge from behind it.</span></div></div>",

Created in the hopes of exploring different dimensions, such as the one which Nightcrawler traveled through during his teleports, it was the mechanically inclined mutant's new pride and joy, and he could not wait to test it.  With a quick call to Professor Xavier, who in turn brought his students along in case something went wrong, the stage was set for the technological genius to premier his newest masterpiece.  Making his way to the controls, Forge began the start up procedure, checked and rechecked the settings, and made sure he failsafes were in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright everyone, get ready, I'm going to open a test gate in five seconds.  Five...four...three...two...one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flick of a switch, the air around the gate crackled with electricity, and the room hummed with energy.  With a loud roar, followed by what sounded like static, a slowly swirling vortex appeared in thin air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a hand on his stomach and a content smile, Naruto Uzumaki walked down the street leading to his apartment after a big dinner at his favorite ramen joint.  Celebrating another job well done, the young pupil of the Toad Sage was ready for a good night's sleep following his well deserved meal.  It was already dark out, and with no one else outside, he walked the path alone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a block away from his home, he dug into his pocket for his keys.  With an overenthusiastic yank, he pulled them free, only to have his beloved wallet slip free along with them, and land on the street, spilling its contents.  Groaning in annoyance, Naruto knelt down to pick every single bill and coin left over from his night of eating.  It was then then, as he was trying pick up his change, that a massive hole appeared beneath his feet, giving him no time, or ground on which to jump.  No one witnessed the ground below him open up and swallow him, before closing without a trace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gifted youngsters of Xavier's school waited eagerly for something to happen, as the tear in space time swirled before them.  Their muscles were tensed in anticipation, each ready to use their powers if the need should arise.  Only, it didn't.  The only thing that came through the portal that they saw was bits of dust and dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, maybe there's nothing on the other side to see,\" said Kitty Pryde (AKA Shadowcat) in her valley girl manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, there has to be something on the other side,\" Forge argued, \"all the readouts are right, and the portal is open on both ends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you just opened it in the middle of nowhere, and there's nothing to see,\" Rogue offered, moving her white bangs out of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah man!  I was sure that something would come through.  Now I've got to recalculate everything and try again.  That's going to take days!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright Forge.  I'm sure you'll figure it out,\" Jean reassured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jean is right Forge,\" the professor said, \"this is only the first test, and it ended with nothing bad happening.  I'm sure, given time, you will figure it out.  For now though, I think it best to power it down, and take a break.  We can start again tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod, the technical genius started the shut down sequence, never noticing a small object coming through the portal as it closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree falling through the swirling nothingness almost caused Naruto to vomit up his dinner.  He was only in the portal for less than a minute, but the nauseating feeling in his stomach made it seem like ten, until he was finally ejected from it and flung across a giant space, landing on something soft and silky.</span></div></div>",

His momentum was halted by the ensnaring strands, and came to a stop at halfway down a high ponytail.  Disoriented, the ninja could only hang there and swing like a pendulum as his unknowing ride left with the other super powered teenagers.  The strain of the journey finally overtook the blond ninja and he had no choice but to sleep as he dangled like a fruit from a vine, buried beneath the giant girl's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the tiny shinobi hung unnoticed from her ponytail, Kitty Pryde, aka Shadowcat, made her way to the dormitory section of Xavier mansion.  She made a straight line for her room, when she was stopped by Nightcrawler and Spyke, who asked her to join them for a movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to, but, like, I've got to finish my homework.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's Friday...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but if I finish it now, I've got the rest of the weekend for whatever,\" she said before waving them off and kept going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty returned to her room to find that her roommate, Rogue, was absent.  Happy for the solitude, the young mutant woman flopped down on her bed, pulled out her text books and began to study.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto came to an hour after his emergence, still tied in thick, brown hair.  He tried to gain a feel for his surroundings, only to find what he saw to be unbelievable.  He was in a cavernous room that was large enough to hold his entire village, and that the thing he from which he hung was the pulled back hair of some sort of giant.  He would have lost it right there if it hadn't been for one thing, he had no idea what would happen to him if he was discovered, so quietly getting to cover was his priority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto was climbing down, Kitty was busy with a particularly difficult problem in her homework.  Frustration built up as she tried to wrap her head around it, and she finally released it in a roar and shake of her head which whipped her ponytail back and forth.  With a violent flip of her hair, Kitty dislodged her concealed passenger.  Naruto's body arched through the air, the tiny ninja screamed as he fell until he landed roughly on the mutant girl's textbook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...?!\" Kitty said in surprise, her eyes locked squarely on him.</span></div></div>",

After the incursion of a parallel world's version of the Justice League, they had spent a significant portion of their funding on a device that would allow them to detect inter-world travel and if all went well, even facilitate it. A group of scientists, each near the top of their respective fields, had worked tirelessly all for this test that would prove whether or not their theories were correct. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stood behind a wall of thick concrete reinforced with steel, their only eyes being various high definition cameras that had been set at different angles surrounding the intended dimensional gateway. The tall, arching structure was laced with wires, and tubes all around the base, in the center was a swirling mass that, properly manipulated, would puncture a hole in the fabric of space and open into another world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Final checks have been completed, proceed to activation,\" stated one of a multitude of technicians from behind their workstation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flip of the switch, the magnificent machine hummed to life, the mass began to expand until it reached the outer edges of the gate, becoming a vortex of energy as it tried to bore into another plane of existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Levels are holding steady, formation of gateway is underway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vortex intensified in speed, spiraling into itself as it drilled into the fabric of reality.

He scrambled to his feet, adrenaline bypassing his body\u2019s need for oxygen as he stood up to get a look at his landing point. A place he soon found out was the butt of a giant humanoid, with the athletic, curvy form of a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer size of this being made him smaller than a doll to her. He tried to escape from the valley between her ass cheeks, but only managed to alert the giantess to his presence. He tried to summon some chakra to escape, but found it unexpectedly absent, one more thing to investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?! What\u2019s touchin\u2019 my ass?\u201d came the voice of the woman. A thumb and forefinger came and plucked him free of the plump rear. As he was moved he saw the full figure of the giantess, who wore some rather odd clothing, similar to clowns he had seen at festivals when he was training with Jiraiya. He was then deposited on a hard, wooden surface, once more knocking the wind out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat on Earth are you?\u201d said the weirdly dressed giant, her gloved hand reaching down once more to the tiny ninja who was too exhausted from his unexpected trip through realities to dodge. The massive fingers gripped him tight and lifted him up to the big blue eyes which stared at him with wonder and almost manic glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!

Hopes which would be absolutely destroyed soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my, you\u2019re alive?!\u201d the excitable woman said as her lips split into an almost sinister smile. \u201c\u2019I\u2019ve been lookin\u2019 for a boy toy ever since I split up with Mistah J, but I never thought it would be so literal.

Gathered in the Hokage\u2019s building, in the now rebuilt Hidden Leaf Village, Naruto stood in front of the fifth Hokage, Tsunade. His close friend Sakura Haruno by his side. He looked at her for help, which she only replied with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaruto, we have told you several times.\u201d She said, the pink haired girl not liking the conversation. \u201cWe are sending you away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are far too much a target Naruto.\u201d The Hokage said, leaning her way in. Her chest on display. \u201cToo many tailed beasts have been taking so far, and we can\u2019t risk the Akatsuki getting the rest. While we do have faith Killer Bee, and your strength has been increased, I feel like this would be the best course of action. To send you away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut i\u2019ve gotten so much stronger!\u201d He said to her. \u201cI can handle myself. I beat Pain and defended the village.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have,\u201d Tsunade finished. \u201cWhich is why I don\u2019t want that power taken by the Akatsuki. This isn\u2019t permanent, it\u2019s only until this threat has been taking care of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what? I\u2019m suppose to just walk the beach, until I get told to come back.\u201d He said, obviously a bit upset at the moment. The Hidden Leaf was his home, and this was his fight. He spent all this time trying to get everyone to accept him, to welcome him in the village, and now he is being told to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaruto, I know you don\u2019t like it but it\u2019s for the best. When seeing a chance at destruction, you have to understand that I will try to avoid it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t respond to that, but was angry about it. His eyes distant, as Sakura moved to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaruto, I know this is gonna be hard, but it\u2019s for the village. Please...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she decided to hug Naruto. Something he was not expecting, as he rarely got hugged by her. He of course reacted back, giving her a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodbye Naruto, for now at least.\u201d She said in her ear, when suddenly, she moved her hands around behind his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could not see it, but after some hand signs, , she shouted. \u201cGrand Teleportation Jutsu!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she yelled this, Naruto felt his body tingle, and he gets covered in a white light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sakura pulled away, she took a look at the light, until finally seeing the light go away, and so was Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone.\u201d She said before accepting it. Sasuke left the village, and she would have never thought Naruto would do the same, and she would of never thought she was the one who would do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light finally died down, Naruto jumped back in a panic. No longer with Sakura and Tsunade, but instead he was somewhere else. It wasn\u2019t even day anymore, as the moon was above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a spin, he looked around figuring they sent him away. It was quite a hard thing to truly accept it, but eventually he did. Moving on, as it was one of the things he could do best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around and spinning, he tried to figure out where he was. Not really place he knew. Like mentioned before, it was night time. Building around Naruto, as he was in what seemed to be a alley. Looking around so many times, until he noticed something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese buildings... were giant. Massive even, as it towered over him. He was more like a doll where he was rather than anything else! The buildings seemed too big for him, towering like mountains while truly they were only two floors. So he was sent away to a distant land, with loud sounds, and a large environment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to figure this place out. Luckily he can still feel his chakra run through his body, so with that he started to run! Running through as he planned to look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was here, and as much as it upsets him he needs to face this. Running around to the corner, he peered through the street when suddenly a giant shoe slammed in front of him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreaking out, and jumping back it was the last thing he was really expecting! A look at the shoe, he was able to see who was wearing that shoe. A giant man, someone who towered over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was more than huge, he was giant! The giant man in a business suit walked past as Naruto was left stunned. He was more of a toy by comparison. He was in a land of giants!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping to think, Naruto didn\u2019t leave the alley, instead thought about what he was going to do. Get a giant\u2019s attention obviously. Naruto does have this way of getting people on his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he was going to get one of their attention and hopefully, things go well from that point on. Peeking around the corner, he was amazed as he looked to the giant city. It was all stone, towering over him and even in the distance. Some being so big it is beyond measure. The giants who walked past, dressed in clothes he had never seen before. Not to mention, on occasion when looking at the bright lit up sky above him. He would occasionally see giant metal flying ships going through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was so different from his home, to the point where he could barely understand it. Regardless, Naruto was gonna try to find someone to get the attention of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he wasn\u2019t the one to find someone, someone found him. A large foot step cracking down near him, making him jump back away. A bit afraid as he looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm, was that a bug?\u201d The voice questioned, as he say the giant girl look down at him! A girl looked down at him, and he was found. Guess Naruto was going to go with this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant girl being ____________</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Naruto looked up, the sight he saw was someone he did not expect. A weird woman to match this weird place he found himself in. From head to toe, there was a dark blue tone throughout her entire body. Not only her outfit, which had big blue boots, and a one piece of blue. However it was her skin, which was admittedly a lighter shade of blue, but still blue. Her hair, which looked like it was the same as her clothes, and her eyes were even blue. He was stunned at what she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever considering he talked to a giant toad before, he didn\u2019t remain shocked for long. Which was good, cause a giant boot appeared above him and he saw what was happening. He was about to get stepped on! It was just a sudden movement from Inque, but to him it was a lot more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping and moving around, dodging his way and escaping. She didn\u2019t press down with enough power, and chances are she probably wouldn\u2019t even kill the small ninja, however he still escaped it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Naruto yelled as the foot placed. \u201cWatch where you are stepping, I almost got flattened!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInque paused, her eyes moving back to the bug. She was going to step on it and literally move on, but it would seem something more was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Naruto know, he was not in front of an average woman, but instead the villain and thief Inque! Known throughout the world as one of the most dangerous things alive. She was currently in her normal disguise, a similar look to what she was like before the accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Naruto was unlucky enough to meet her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Inque, she looked down to Naruto and wasn\u2019t that shocked in the end. She has heard that in Gotham City, some teenagers have gone and gotten spliced. A process that involved mixing someone\u2019s DNA with that of an animal to become a hybrid. Guess there was a group of even stupider teenagers that had a similar progress to become literally dust under her feet. That was the common sense answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down to him, before she had to do something. Turning around and facing him and the alley, Naruto was a little bit more intimidated by the woman. Which grew even more as she lifted her giant boot, letting him see her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was actually trying to step on him now! He could figure the last one was an accident, but this clearly wasn\u2019t!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What are you doing?\u201d He questioned as she smiled a bit of a wicked smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLets just say, i\u2019m giving you a lesson on genetic modification, and the dangers of it!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she brought him boot down. This would of worked on anyone else, but not Naruto.<br>\r\n\u2028With a launch of his chakra in his feet. He flipped his way backwards and dodged the boot. Sliding as he looked up to her, while Inque was quite surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Don\u2019t try to step on me!\u201d Naruto barked, not liking it as she frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuite a rude tone, for someone so much bigger!\u201d This time she stepped with her other foot, only for Naruto to dodge again. This happened two more times, each step getting more and more aggressive. Who was this guy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Naruto, he found himself having trouble dodging more and more, as he finally had to pull something else out. She wasn\u2019t going to listen to reason, and Naruto needed a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his jump back on the final step, he created his favourite hand sign. \u201cShadow Clone Jutsu!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Inque\u2019s utter surprise, there was a small smoke screen by her feet, when suddenly this little blonde teenager has multiplied. Before there was only one, but it would turn out now there was more. About six or seven of them, all scattered around into the alley. Her eyes shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay can we just talk! So you can stop stepping on me!\u201d one of them said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProblem was, it was Inque. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Clearly, you are not normal. More to you than I expected, so let\u2019s get you up!\u201d She said reaching down for them. All of the clones dodged out of the way, except for one who ran up her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clone was quick, much quicker than Inque thought. So when it got to her arm, she slapped it with her hand. Killing the bug clone as it went into smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA neat little trick. Disposable clones. let\u2019s find out which one of you is the real one!\u201d She said, a bit sadistic as she steps on all of them. One by one, the clones went and poofed, until finally she found the last one and stepped on it, finding it much like the others. Disposable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCause the true Naruto, was clinging to the wall, his move charging. Clearly, this woman was too sadistic, so Naruto was planning on ending her quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a charged Rasengan in his hand, he let his chakra go and fall from the wall. No longer sticking as he flew towards the admittedly beautiful face of Inque.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe only saw him at the last second, unable to do anything as he flew right to her with a swing of his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRasengan!!\u201d He yelled, hitting her hard as she actually got sent back, almost tripping over. Naruto bounced off his attack, moving and falling onto his feet. His Chakra taking the blunt of the landing as he looked up to her. He knew his damage wouldn\u2019t do much, but this was simply to threaten her to leave. It wasn\u2019t his strongest attack.<br>\r\n\u2028As for Inque, she can\u2019t believe it. It actually hurt her. She didn\u2019t know how but it did! He was going to pay. Turning to him, Naruto was shocked, she had a dent in her head! Did it break through her skull?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, something more wicked. As her body moved and contorted. He freaked as the body in front of him changed. From a beautiful blue woman, to a dangerous blob. One that seemed edged and sharp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one bright eye looking down at him. \u201cYou are going to pay for that one!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So this has taken a surprising turn for Naruto. Not only did this giant blue woman try to kill him, after hitting and admittedly holdback Rasengan, she morphed and turned into a creature he never seen before. Her body seemed more like liquid than a body at this point, making her very concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill this was not good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoor little boy, you have no idea what you are in store for.\u201d She said, a voice emanating from her body, even though she didn\u2019t have a mouth. Before Naruto could even think to quip back, she sprung a extended hand to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped back at his top speed, leaping away from the splash. He was not going to get away though, as her splash became solid and a small reach extended for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got grabbed and wrapped around as she brought her arm back. Bringing him up to her face, or whatever her head was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, let me get a good look at you.\u201d She said as Naruto struggled out. Something that Inque just had to taunt about. \u201cDon\u2019t bother you are too weak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto did bother, as he got an arm free and tossed a kunai at her head. It hit her, but seemed to just fly right through, almost like she wasn\u2019t solid at all. While Inque had to admit, given that size it was a powerful throw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo point, i\u2019ve got you.\u201d She said feeling confident, until Naruto smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWrong, you\u2019ve got a clone!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly his body disappeared in smoke as she realised it was true. The being looked around, looking for Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly, he was behind her. Transforming back to his body, he knew that Kunai trick would work. Now he was behind. Quickly charging another attack, he fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRasenshuriken!!\u201d He shouted, tossing it at her. As she saw another attack coming. This one not holding back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got hit, and fell down from the powerful blast. Naruto falling down himself looking at the beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn it, that attack would beat most, yet she looks like all it did was piss her off.\u201d he said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCause, yeah it pissed her off. Whatever these attacks weren\u2019t they were hurting her! Hurting her good! She turned around angry seeing the small orange bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her body disposed into more of a liquid as she rushed to Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a panic he got to turning and tried running away from the tsunami that was Inque.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t really have a way to escape this, so he got ready. \u201cShadow Clone Jutsu!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spawned one more, and jumped on his shoulder, leaping off the other Naruto as he disappeared. Into the air and going to the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo you don\u2019t! I\u2019m not holding back now!\u201d She yelled finally reaching him. Her grip grabbing Naruto as he felt it wrap around his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got grabbed and swung down, bringing him to the ground as he hit with a powerful hit. Hitting hard onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body held him down as she brought her other hand around. It started to move and become a weapon, a powerful mullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me end you little boy!\u201d She yelled, bringing it down as he didn\u2019t really have a way out of this one. He was stuck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot out though, as he moved for another jutsu. For her, she slammed it down and hit him hard. However, as she raised it up she saw nothing but a small piece of food wrapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What? Where did he go?\u201d She questioned, looking around like crazy. He was out of sight, he somehow escaped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasted no time as her body started sticking out like pillars. Grabbing everything and lifting it out. Her head swinging around like crazy as she was looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with the ninja in bright orange, he was able to spot. \u201cThere you are!\u201d She screamed, leaping to him like a monster!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto could do nothing as she collided with him, hitting him hard and pulling him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInque with a satisfied resolve pulled him back. He was trying to hide, what a pathetic being. She pulled him back and stood to her full height. Her fingers swinging around Naruto as it held his four limps out. Almost like a machine she encased in his hands, making sure no more of those little attacks happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, you have been caught.\u201d She said finally as she pulled him up. Suddenly her body head shifted around and shook around, until finally she was back to what she looked. \u201cTell me who you are, right now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhh! Ahh!\u201d He yelled fighting around unable to get out. He couldn\u2019t grab any of his ninja tools, he couldn\u2019t do any hand signs. He wasn\u2019t even a clone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got him, and he hated it. She tightened the grip around his body, making him more uncomfortable as she held nothing back from this. Threatening to break her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said tell me! Tell me who you are?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m Naruto Uzamaki.\u201d He said to her, sending her a glare. One that she was not a real fan of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInque. Now, what was that technique you were doing? Creating energy blasts, cloning yourself, somehow substituting yourself. Explain now!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more Inque knew, the better. Hence is why she was getting so aggressive about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy chakra? Wait do you not know what chakra is? Wait, what are you? You don\u2019t seem like a human?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tightened her grip even more and more aggressive. \u201cAnswer my damn question!\u201d She yelled, not holding anything back. He would of, but suddenly she caught something at the corner of her eye. It was a rat, but that rose the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t do this here, not with the bat around. Well, Naruto Uzamaki.\u201d She said to you, being aggressive about it. \u201cIt would seem you are coming with me.\u201d She said as she gave a smirk. Suddenly, her fingers encased his mouth and nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe struggled, but he could do nothing as he gets knocked out. Going unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does Inque go with him?</span></div></div>",

White walls, white floors, white clothes...it was all so eerily dead! The least they could do was add some different colors to some rooms, so it didn't make you feel like you're quarantined from the rest of the world. And then there were the needles, And don't even get him started on the smell! It's either that of sickness or sterilization. Ugh!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as he was concerned, the word \"hospital\" stood for \"Horrible Obnoxiously Smelling Place Insistently Trapping All Locals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet here he was. Sitting on a doctor's table, waiting and waiting. At least he wasn't wearing one of those stupid paper-thin gown-shirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill...there was quite a few places he'd rather be right now. Like at the home of his recently-acquired girlfriend, Tenten, for example. He and Tenten have secretly been together before he left the village three years ago, and when he came back they both decided that they would reveal their relationship to the others, and when they did everyone was surprised and sadly one Hinata Hyuga was heartbroken but thanks to Tenten's quick thinking she and Naruto explained everything and fully apologized to her and still wanted to be friends and Tenten even told her, that if anything Kami-sama forbid happens to her, Tenten could trust Hinata to take good care of Naruto for her and Hinata accepted. From then on they have been going steady and after this he was hoping they would kick their relationship to the next level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo yeah...Naruto was NOT enjoying himself right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the door opened and his mood really took a nosedive at WHO was playing his nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura Haruno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever little did Naruto know, was that Sakura wasn't here to perform a simple check up on Naruto she was here to get rid of him for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was extremely jealous of Naruto and Tenten's relationship as she swore to her self before team seven was a official team, that she and Sasuke would become the very first couple of the rookie twelve, and not to mention that Tenten would NEVER shut-up about how Naruto was a wonderful boyfriend and how he always treated her like a goddess and the list went on and on with no end in sight! Ugh! It drove her crazy!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was all about to change right here and right now, but she had to play it smart and make sure Naruto doesn't know anything until it's too late, so she smiled at him and said, \"Okay Naruto, Don't get too excited, I'm just here to do your check-up and we'll be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd from there Sakura went on with the usual medical check-up procedures, Checking Naruto's pulse, heart-beats, breathing, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were just about finished Sakura decided to kick her plan into action and said, \"Alright Naruto looks like you have a clean bill of health, but before I let you go there is one more thing I want you to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto raised an eyebrow after Sakura said that and asked in a curious voice, \"Okay Sakura, what do you want me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura smiled and simply said, \"Follow me, what I want you to do for me is in the microbiology room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto raised an eyebrow after Sakura said that but he just shrugged and followed his teammate, 'she knows what she's doing, right?' Naruto thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they entered in the room, Sakura then pointed at a microscope slide in the middle of the room on the floor and said, \"Now Naruto, I want you to stand right on top that microscope slide, and don't worry about breaking it, as the slide is reinforced to withstand your full weight, Hell even Choji can stand on it and not make it crack on the glass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto still looked unsure but decided to obey Sakura's command and did what she said and was surprised that she was right, as the moment he placed his foot on the glass it didn't even crack under his full body weight and then Sakura walked up to Naruto and held out a bluish-white pill and said, \"Now Naruto I want you to take this pill right now, it's a special allergy medication pill and after you take this pill you'll never have to worry about getting allergies for the rest of you're life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto said, \"But Sakura I don't have any allergies to begin with, at least as far as I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura getting slightly irritated said in a threatening voice, \"Naruto you either swallow this pill or you'll take it through an anal injection with a VERY LONG AND SHARP NEEDLE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather not having a very long and sharp needle up his ass, Naruto quickly snatches the pill out of Sakura's hand and she give him a plastic cup of water and told Naruto to not move from the microscope slide when he takes it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto still confused about why Sakura wants Naruto to stay on the microscope slide again just shrugs his shoulders and takes the pill and drinks all the water, and the second the pill landed in his stomach he suddenly felt dizzy as he could see Sakura grinning a victorious smirk as the room was spinning around him and he then felt very sleepy and before he knew it he passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Naruto swallowed the pill, the pill's effects immediately kicked in, as he was already less than one inch in height and still shrinking, the odd thing she thought of was why didn't Naruto shrink out of his clothes but then shrugged her shoulders as it didn't matter anyway, he was already the size of a white blood cell and that's all that mattered to her as she picked up the slide and looked in the microscope and saw that Naruto was fast asleep completely unaware that the pill Sakura gave him wasn't an allergy immunity pill but is was really an untested drug that apparently knocks out the subject and rapidly shrinks them down to the size of a white blood cell was the effect of the drug, Sakura smiled when she saw Naruto was still asleep and began her next phase of her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sakura exited out of the microbiology room with Naruto still asleep and inside the microscope slide she then proceeded into the pill/vitamin storage room and grabbed the nearest plastic pill case near her, already about to be shipped out, so she had to act fast as she took a pill and broke it in half and emptied it out and quickly slid Naruto into the pill by slightly tilting the microscope slide and once Naruto was inside the pill she fixed the pill put it back in the case and resealed the box and placed the box back where it was, just in time when someone came in said hello to Sakura and he took the cases of medicine to be shipped out over sea and as she watched the man leave the hospital with all the medicine Sakura only said to herself with a smile, \"Good riddance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto was asleep he didn't know what was going on outside his pill prison as he was soon shipped out of the elemental nations by boat that sailed non-stop until it reached america and once the boat got there Naruto's package was then sent to sent to a grocery store where someone's mother came and picked it up and when she get home she calls someone and when they meet, the mother says to take the pill, while inside the pill Naruto is now waking up to see he is about to be swallowed by...</span></div></div>",

She hoped it helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes widened as soon as he woke up only to see that he was inside a clear pill and about to be swallowed by a titanic girl! She put his pill inside of her mouth, it was dark. but he felt movement from her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the mouth slightly opened as a tidal wave of water (to him anyway) came pouring in and pushed the pill further down until she swallowed the pill!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto couldn't see anything but knew he was going to be in trouble as he knew what happens to food, it was digested!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the pill that Naruto was sealed inside landed in the stomach on top of what he assumed to be the teenaged girl's breakfast and immediately the stomach acid kicked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while, but eventually the acid started to melt the plastic pill, giving Naruto a chance to escape. But he was still trapped as he now could see thay he was standing on the melting island of pancake and knew he couldn't make it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto was giving in to the dispair of knowing that he was going to be part of some girl's complete breakfast, he looked at the other things she ate and at least this girl ate healthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then thought he was seeing things as he could swear he saw a ship-like object heading his way and before he knew it, strange creatures came to shore on the pancake. Naruto knew he had to hide so he hid behind a drop of whipped cream that was eaten with the pancake, and poked his head out just enough to see what the creatures were up to, and boy, if he had to say, were they all seriously UUUUUGGLY!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously these things all look like they came out of someone's nightmares, and before he could think more on their ugliness one of the creatures spoke, \"Okay, so boss do you think we should dump the poison here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes widened after the creature said that for two reasons, one - he could clearly understand the creature word for word and two - even if this girl did swallow him, she didn't even know he was inside that pill, but he was NOT going to let these horror movie rejects poison this girl, not if he could help it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Naruto could jump into action he suddenly heard sirens and the creatures looked to see that another boat like object coming at them at full speed, immune to the stomach acid, and Naruto saw humanoid in appearance and different colors like pink, green, and blue, all of them female,  as the other ship-object landed on the dissolving pancake island and began to attack the creatures and one of the creatures was heading towards Naruto, trying to make an escape, but Naruto tripped the creature with his foot and took hold of the now struggling creature and gave a whistle and said, \"I suppose this guy is the leader?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female beings nodded and a pair hauled the boss away while another turned to Naruto, frowning at him in puzzlment, then before he knew it, strange handcuff like... things were wrapped around his wrists and were no on the boat being taken to what he could only guess was a...City!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok...what's going on here?!\" Naruto said. One of ladies frowned at him as if he were an idiot at that while forcing him into the back of some kind of vehicle along with the Uglies from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was at a hospital, then the pill I was in got swallowed. Forgive me if I'm new around here.\" Naruto pointed out, seeing her look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lady-thing blinked, relaxing slightly at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the City of our patron, Christine Kolchuck. Call it the City of Christine, or just Christine for short.\" she told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked. So...the girl that swallowed him was named Christine? As the vehicle pulled up to what was obviously a police station of some sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he and the Uglies were ordered out, Naruto had to wonder what was going on back home in Konoha...</span></div></div>",

After recovering from their shock Tenten and Hinata pissed off beyond belief and they were about  to kill the pink haired bitch, but that's when Tsunade came up with a perfect idea, At first she seemed to agree with Sakura and her plan but silently mouthed to the other girls, \"Play along, for now.\" The girl all nodded and stayed quiet but for Tenten and Hinata they both gave Tsunade a reluctant nod of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade then escorted Sakura with Tenten and Hinata following them to the torture and investigation building where Sakura still drunk continued to babble about stupid things now, Tsunade has Sakura sitting on a chair as Tenten and Hinata strap her in and when that was done Tsunade then knocked her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Sakura groaned as she woke up and soon realized that she was strapped into a chair and in a very dark room and the only light in the room was directly above her head and then she saw Tsunade stand in front of her and said, \"Alright Sakura, I'm going to get straight to the point and ask you one question and I want you're honest answer, other wise, well look to your left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura did as told and what she saw made her eyes widen in shock and in fear, what she saw was Sasuke Uchiha, three years ago he abandoned Konoha to join forces with Orochimaru the snake summoner sanin but was now back in the village, in a specially-made, miniature guillotine, but it wasn't a normal one. Sasuke was strapped to a giant steel box frame on rollers, with chained shackles coming out of the corners. In the middle of a bottom beam was a rod on a pivot, that traveled up the middle of the frame and ended in a large studded dildo. Sasuke having to sit ON the dildo, with his \"bits\" in the lunette as he's strapped into that, awaiting for genital nullification by getting his penis and scrotum severed using the guillotine blade and about to be forced to live the remainder of his life as a eunuch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura then asked Tsunade, \"Why are you doing this to Sasuke-kun!? He is innocent Lady Tsunade, let him go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So was Naruto-kun, but did you care NO! All you cared for was destroying our relationship, so lady Tsunade is simply returning the favor.\" said Tenten as she and Hinata came to view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura then glared at the weapon mistress and the hyuga and snarled, \"So what!? Personally I did you a favor Tenten, I got rid of the biggest mistake you made in your entire life, if anything you should be thanking me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto-kun did absolutely nothing to you to deserve what you did to him Sakura.\" Hinata said with her voice filled with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura just said, \"Oh PLEASE, Hinata you would have done the exact same thing to Naruto, the only difference between us is that you would keep him only to yourself, you're just angry that you couldn't think of this plan sooner and I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata shook her head, refusing to let what Sakura just said get to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade then yelled, \"ENOUGH!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade then said to Sakura, \"Sakura Haruno, You will tell us what became of Naruto Uzumaki right now or your beloved Sasuke pays the price for your actions!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura then said in a voice of someone calling their opponent's bluff, \"And just how do I know that's really Sasuke-kun up there and not some kage bunshin? or some kind of genjutsu or something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade told Tenten to go ontop of the platform where Sasuke was and then she took out a kunai and looked at Tsunade, who nodded her head and Tenten then slashed Sasuke on his left cheek making him scream out-loud and that was all the proof for Sakura to start talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Sakura fully confessed Tsunade still went through their punishments as Sasuke's by getting his penis and scrotum severed using the guillotine blade and about to be forced to live the remainder of his life as a eunuch. Sakura screamed at that as she wanted to have Sasuke's children, but now that was lost to her forever, but what she nor anyone else present knew was that just before she had Sasuke strapped on the guillotine, Tsunade had the hospital staff milk Sasuke for sperm and put all the sperm samples in storage to preserve the sharingan. And for Sakura's punishment, she let Tenten and Hinata give Sakura a taste of her own medicine, literally, as they force feed her the very same pill that she tricked Naruto into swallowing and stuffed her into a pill and gave it to Akamaru saying it would cure his gas problem, by shoving the pill through the dog's butt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Tsunade then summons the remaining members of the rookie twelve and their senseis and orders them look for Naruto after explaining everything, and they are all given special vision goggles based on the hyuga clan's byakugan created by the research and development department, the goggles can zoom in on the microscopic level depending on how much chakra is put into them, and soon enough the rookies and senseis leave the village to find Naruto or at-least find clues on where he could be.</span></div></div>",

The cells had informed him that they knew he'd helped, but seeing as ensuring Christine's health and life was their job, they couldn't afford to take chances since they had no idea what he even was yet. At least they were polite and up front about it...and it wasn't like Naruto couldn't understand their reasons either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was just so damn BORED right now! He felt restless! All he wanted was finding a way out and to go home! He couldn't even shut his eyes without seeing the image of Tenten's smile, and it hurt thinking he'd never see her again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paced, feeling restless. He never did well at staying still, he always had too much energy, and trying to figure out things and why this had happened to him just left him stressed out. Shame Tenten wasn't around...being on a team with Guy and Lee, she knew how to deal with over-energetic people and calm Naruto down when he felt like this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heaved a sigh, he wished it wasn't so painful thinking about his girlfriend. But he missed her! Not only that, but what really annoyed Naruto was when the cells stopped to take a good look at him as they tried guessing what he was. Made him feel like he was on display at a zoo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, one opened the door to his confines. \"This way, please.\" the cell told him.</span></div></div>",

How exciting! Well, let me be the first to say to you, \"Welcome to Christine!\" I'm Mayor Conscious Santorini.\" as she shook his hand, Naruto couldn't help but be glad to at least meet someone who is so friendly to others as he introduced himself, \"Thank you for the welcome Ms.Santorini, and I'm Naruto Uzumaki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the introduction Mayor Santorini asked Naruto some questions like who and what he is, what were the symptoms of his pill were made to handle, if he'd be willing to further aid in Christine's health beyond those symptoms, and for a demonstration of his skills to see how he could put him to use for the good of Christine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto answered most of the questions as honestly as he could, but about the pill he came in, he had no idea what the symptoms that thing was for, but he'd be very willing to help in anyway he can as that was his nindo, his ninja way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Naruto answered her questions mayor Santorini said that because Naruto didn't the symptoms of the pill he came in were for, he would have to be observed as well as helping out all over Christine for a week, with Cilia Tyson and Drixene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto fully understood and accepted those terms and just as he did two more figures entered the room and one was another female humanoid cell who was a periwinkle color wearing a orange blouse and matching dark blue jacket and pants and the second figure had a green and yellow color scheme with a green and yellow pill for a head and has blonde hair in the shape of a beehive and wearing glasses, and her body was like a suit of armor and one of her arms is some kind of cannon, and the strangest thing of all was that she was somehow floating by spraying bubbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mayor introduced them to Naruto as Cilia Tyson and Drixene respectfully and told them that Naruto was going to be working with them for the next week and the timing couldn't be better as the mayor just received a report that said there was...</span></div></div>",

And a mouth like a badly put-together bear trap. And it was covered in spines like a clump of pollen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ragweed\u2014 can even survive through the winter and play havoc with immune systems year-round.\" Naruto shook his head. While he wasn't a medic, he enjoyed gardening and had a skill in botany. It had started when he'd heard plants were good to talk to if you were lonely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mayor, Cilia Tyson and Drixene all looked at Naruto, who shrugged.  \"Able to tell at a glance...he's good.\"  Drixene said, opening her chest like a cabinate and showing dozens of fist-sized pill capsules before taking one and placing it in her arm cannon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go.Next stop, the nose.\" Cilia, Drixene and Naruto left the mayor's office, they all jumped in a cell like car and Cilia hit the gas while Drixene turned the siren on as other cell cars moved out of the way, while driving, Naruto looked around and he couldn't help but be amazed, everywhere he looked there were building and homes for these cells and they treated this girl who swallowed him like some medication pill, worshiped her like some goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Naruto knew it he was shaken out of his thoughts by Cilia hitting the brakes as they reached the destination, Christine's nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cilia, Drixene and Naruto entered the nose, Naruto couldn't help but again be amazed at the sight of this, This girl's nose, no her entire body as a whole was like it's own world inside of her and she probably doesn't even know it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was soon snapped out of his thoughts as he felt his toes sink into something and he looked down and he's right foot was caught in mucus, 'Well better than stepping in dog shit.' Naruto thought to himself as he pulled his foot free, he had to remember he couldn't get distracted or he would end up dead. As Cilia, Drixene and he began to climb up the mucus dam ladder to the top of the dam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the only sound of Christine's breathing through her nose, the microscopic heroes soon found a shocking discovery as they were looking at a monstrous footprint way too big for Naruto or Cilia to fill in, realizing that their target was close, they prepared themselves, Cilia set her blaster to stun but had the dial very close to kill if necessary, Drixene armed her...well, arm with a grenade shaped pill and Naruto mentally prepared himself for this fight, no telling what a Ragweed allergen could do to him at this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were all behind the mucus dam wall and they could hear someone or something eating, and Cilia took the front and looked at Naruto and silently counted down from three with her fingers until she got to one and when they were about to attack, the eating noises suddenly stopped and they all held their breaths as they soon heard giant sized (to them anyway.) stomping. Cilia faced away from the source of the noise and pulled out a mirror to see what was coming and she the very same monster from the security cameras and whispered to both Naruto and Drixene, \"I'll hold it off while you two attack it from behind.\" as she threw a spare blaster to Naruto who gave her a confused look as she said, \"You working with us, you gotta fight like us.\" as she then ran out in-front of the allergen and whistled and saying, \"Hey you tall, dirty, and yellow when was the last time you looked into a mirror? Before you broke it by looking at it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe allergen roared in rage at the insult and began to  try and crush Cilia with it's foot as she jumped out of the way, but the monster soon felt it's back in pain as Drixene and Naruto were blasting at it from behind until it the felt it front being blasted by Cilia, This may have been Naruto's first time using a gun in a battle, but with such a big target how can he miss?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe allergen roared in pain as it swiped at the two , only for them to dodge as Cilia jumped on it's back and climbed, shooting point-blank all along the way.

Wouldn't do for such a cute pet to look like they're dirty and neglected,after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...p-p-pet?!\" Naruto sputtered, \"I'm not a pet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you are now. Specifically, you MY pet, Whiskers. You're such an adorable, interesting little thing that I just knew I simply had to have you! Not to mention my job is actually quite lonely, and as the only one of your kind in all of Christine, it'd be lonely for you. So I'll solve both our problems at once by becoming your owner!\" As she finished speaking, Conscious Santorini dunked his head under the liquid and held it there as Naruto felt a scrub brush being used on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the way we wash our pets, wash our pets, wash our pets, this is the way we wash our pets, before we lovey-dovey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto didn't know how this could be happening to him, he was just saved Christine from having an allergy attack from that Ragweed monster and now he was being cleaned and was now this pink humanoid cell's pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to get away from her, even if she is trying to be kind to him, he was not a pet, he well NOT be a pet, nor will he EVER be anyone's pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- Later that night ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nighttime in the city of Christine and every cell was fast asleep as Christine sleep, except Christine's police cells who were out patrolling and Naruto who was in a sleeping Mayor Conscious Santorini's embrace with her arms wrapped around his right arm, After Naruto's bath she tried to give him a make over but Naruto's blonde spiky hair refused to be tamed and he wouldn't let her powder him up and when he saw the dress she picked out for him, he screamed bloody murder and flat out yelled, \"I'D RATHER WALK AROUND ALL OF CHRISTINE NAKED, BEFORE I PUT THAT THING ON!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo here he was in bed with the Mayor of all Christine, wearing a collar showing that he's the Mayor's pet and a baby-blue colored skin-tight suit that left his head, hands and feet bare and it very much reminded him of the Bushy Brow duo, Might Guy and Rock Lee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving that thought, Naruto could only think of how the others were doing with him gone and wondering if their looking for him; When Naruto was certain that the Mayor was asleep, he then carefully slipped his right arm through her's and the Mayor clung on to his arm for a moment or two, then he finally got his arm free and slowly and carefully crawled out of the bed and slowly and quietly made it towards the front door and slowly closed the door and turning to leave, after a while of aimlessly wondering around the city of Christine he then saw light covering him and he suddenly put two and two together, \"Oh great, the police cells.\" Naruto groaned as they were already pulled to up to his left and a light purple cell lowered the window and said to Naruto, \"Hey there handsome, what are you doing out this late at night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Naruto could say anything a green colored cell interrupted him and said, \"Wait look at what's  around his neck, it's a collar! And it shows that he belongs to the Mayor as her pet!!!\" Both cells looked at the collar and both had wide eyes and the purple cell then said, \"Sorry handsome, but we have to take you back to your owner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'SHIT!!!' Naruto could only think as he Ran right through the both them as if the devil was hot on his heels ignoring the screams of, \"HALT!\", \"SIT!\", \"STAY!\", \"HEEL!\", \"FREEZE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto continued running the purple cell looked over to her partner and said, \"You call for back-up, I'm gonna go let the Mayor know that her pet escaped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green female cell nodded and began call for back-up as told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto didn't know where he was going but as of right now he didn't care, he just had to keep running until he found a safe place to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was running Naruto could hear the police sirens and search lights on him as he ran until he sees a building and quickly picks up the pace and he's halfway there and Naruto hears the sirens getting louder and closer and Naruto runs with everything he had until...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as Naruto was about to duck into a nearby building, he suddenly felt a sting with a poke and before he knew it Naruto was passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother tranqulizer?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Naruto awoke, he was wet again like after his bath, and he was strapped down to a table, mayor Conscious Santorini glaring down at him. \"Naughty pet!\" The pink humanoid cell frowned at his as she stood in a bathrobe, her arms crossed. \"Trying to run from me. Guess a punishment is in order. It's fru-fru time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gulped. She tried to give him a make over before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Whiskers...to start with your make over, let's go with a nice...poodle puff.\" As the Mayor sat on top of Naruto's waist, she had a comb in her hand and began to brush, but just like before, the hair was as stubborn as the one it was attached to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I was being nice, but now I'm angry.\" she said as she finally and forcefully got the brush into Naruto's hair and began to forcefully brush Naruto's hair, she could clearly hear Naruto whimper as he never had to comb his hair before and it was going to be clear from this moment forward, he never will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a female cell and the mayor of a girl, Conscious Santorini knew how to deal with hair, and as such, knew how to give Whiskers the look she was aiming for. Depending on your hair's natural oiliness, curliness, and other factors, you'll need to tweak the basic \"poofing\" process slightly to make sure it works right for you. While the essential process should be the same, pay attention to the way your own hair behaves and tweak the process accordingly.<br>\r\nIf you have very thin hair, you'll probably need to use a considerable amount of hairspray or other product to get your hair to stay up. If your hair is a lot thicker, you should use less product and tease your hair more.<br>\r\nIf you have oily hair, most people will need to wash more frequently 4-5 times per week, to make it more poofy. Some people, however, tend to get a little more body the less frequently hair is washed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClean your hair using shampoo. You want your hair to be nice and clean when you attempt to poof it up. Massage a pea-sized amount of shampoo into your scalp and hair follicles, then rinse thoroughly with lukewarm water.<br>\r\nGet to know your own body and wash your hair as frequently as it needs it. In general, you want to wash slightly less. 3-4 times per week should be enough for most people.<br>\r\nAvoid washing in excessively hot water, which can dry your hair out and leave it stringy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApply conditioner. Hair conditioner is used to leave your hair feeling smooth, and it can also help to give your hair some body, without tangling it up. If you want to emphasize your hair's natural body, use hair conditioner every time you wash it.<br>\r\nRinse out conditioner thoroughly, running water through a couple of times to make sure it's all gone. If you don't, excess conditioner can make your hair feel greasy and lank after you wash it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently comb through your hair. Tangles might make your hair look a little bigger, but not in a good way. When your hair is still wet, run a comb through it a couple times. Make sure all of the knots, tangles, and snarls are carefully combed through before proceeding to the poofing process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlow dry your hair halfway. You can also then put your hair in a bun. Letting you hair dry out in a bun can be one of the best ways of adding a little body naturally, just by letting it dry. Use a hair dryer to get your hair dry enough to work with, then put it up in a tight bun on top of your head. When your hair is dry, remove it. You should have some curl and some body to work with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack-comb or tease the hair in the middle of your head. The most reliable way of giving your hair body and poofiness is to back-comb, or \"tease\" your hair out. To do this, you want to comb up a portion of hair from the middle of the top of your head, and hold it up straight. Take your comb and pull it through down toward your scalp, the reverse of how you'd normally comb when your hair lays flat.<br>\r\nIf your hair isn't long enough to back-comb, you can still tease it. Use a comb, pick, or a brush and use short, frequent combing strokes through the hair to tease it out.<br>\r\nDon't do this with all you hair, just the hair in the direction you want to make look poofy. If you want more body on the sides, tease out the hair on the sides of your head. If you want more body on the top, tease out the hair on top and leave the front and sides alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeep teasing until you have some poof. How long it takes to get your hair poofy will depend on your style of hair. Keep working until it starts to get some body and some frizz. At first, it may look quite frizzy and unsightly, but you can learn to style the hair to maintain this body without looking all ratty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLift your hair with your hands and apply hairspray. Now, your hair should be a little poofier, and you can get it to stay in place using a strong-holding hairspray. Use your comb to bring your hair up, or just grab it with your hands. Hold it out from your head as much as possible and hit it with some spray.<br>\r\nAgain, use less spray if you have especially thick hair. You won't need to use much and it might just weigh your hair down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLay your hair back over the poofy area, if desired. To make your hairstyle poofy, comb your bangs, sides, or other hairs you left straight over the poofy area, and style your hair normally. If you poofed up in the middle, comb your bangs back over the top of your head, so those hairs will rest over the teased-out hair, obscuring them, but emphasizing the bounce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This wouldn't be happening if you'd stayed like a good pet, Whiskers. I've even picked out this lovely dress and all the make up and nail polish to use on you.\" Mayor Santorini told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...I've never been anyone's pet before! How am I suppossed to know if I do anything wrong, then?!\" Naruto yelped as Conscious got off him and grabbed a lime-green nail polish and undid the top before approching his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mayor paused at that. So her new pet needed obedience school training? Why didn't he say so? She hummed plesently at the thoucht as she placed the nailpolish brush to his cuticle and stroked down and away from it, noticing Whiskers wince as she did his nails. It made her giggle he was overreacting like this. After doing his hands and they dried, Conscious took out a makeup kit and powdered his face pure white, adding two lage dots of pink to his cheecks to give him a blush. After that, the pink cell joyfully held Naruto's head still and did his eyes and applied lipstick to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding in satisfaction, Mayor Conscious Santorini beamed as she raised the table her pet was strapped to and rolled a full-body mirror in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at himself, Naruto started to scream as he saw he was already wearing a frilly, poofy, sparkling purple dress like something a storybook princess would be expected to wear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put you in it when you were still asleep! Oh, Whiskers! You're georgus!\" Conscious cooed and laughed. She adored her new pet! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Whiskers, its time for you to come with mommey! After all, we have places to be!\" The pink cell winked at him as Naruto stopped screaming, but still looked horrified at the state he was in.</span></div></div>",

Naruto after freaking out over being made to go out in public the way he is, the car stops and Naruto then notices the name of the place they parked in front of and wonders why is there is a place called \"Hectorland\" in Christine, Naruto turned to face Mayor Conscious and asked, \"So, who's this \"Hector guy anyway? Christine's boyfriend?\" embaressing the mayor while she was putting on some fresh lipstick which got smeared all over her face from hearing the question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Mayor Conscious just reapplied the lipstick and yanked Naruto's leash and ignoring his question they went into to the park, Naruto is DEEPLY horrified by seeing all the visitors and employees are female cells, and Conscious then drags Naruto in by the leash, getting EVERYONE'S attention. After that, she drags him through every ride and attraction in Hectorland, and when/if anyone asks, Conscious introduces Naruto as her pet, Whiskers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen anyone askes why he's dressed up like that, she says he was being very \"naughty\". This of course gets the rumor mill going about Naruto and before long, he gets treated like an attraction himself as the Mayor takes him around and the other cells follow them as they want to see and find out about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was feeling more and more humiliated as the day progressed as the Mayor made him ride the tunnel of love with her the past 29 times and now going 30 cause that's where they are now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ride progresseses, Naruto knew from his time with Ino, that girls were known to be gossip tellers and with what the cells saw him dressed in, he knew they'd never let him live it down, as he already knew they must be spreading the rumors about him being some kind of devient or something as he is thinking this, and all he could now was to just grin and swallow the fact like a very bitter pill, 'Huh, funny considering that's what got into this miss in  the first place.' Naruto thought to himself; that soon, all of Christine will know about him and he'll be too embaressed to try going anywhere without the mayor at his side since nobody (heh, no body) will do or say anything about him with Conscious around so he HAS to stay with her around the clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the Tunnel of love ride ended and both Naruto and Conscious got off interpretive getting late and then...</span></div></div>",

Naruto was grossed out about the idea of swimming in someone's nose until he heard Cilia say as joke, \"Hey, don't knock it till you try it; It's very relaxing.\" and before they left, Cilia then said that since he was still new around here they would have a police cell watching over him to make sure he didn't do anything suspicious and left. Once they were gone, Naruto did think that having a bit of time off would do him some good and think things out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Naruto tried to wash off the mucus he covered himself in by accident in the showers, used the time off to do some thinking. Mainly how even though he was stuck inside of Christine, he still wanted to go back to Konoha but didn't know how to do that. As much as that bothered him, he ultimately decided to not worry about that for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got out of the showers in his boxers while leaving his clothes to dry, he saw something going on in an alley and decided to investigate, but not before waving over one of the police cells that Cilia sent there to keep an eye on him and she followed him because she thought that either Naruto was making a run for it or he was on to something as no one in their right mind would be running in their boxers in the middle of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto followed the strange figure futher down the alleyway, he knew that the police cell was right behind him and he knew he would need her help, especally since he left the blaster Cilia gave him in his pants, and his jutsu were too dangerous to risk trying within Christine. Before he knew it, the strange figure went inside a what looked to be a storage building and Naruto waited for the police cell to arrive and when she did, Naruto apologized for seemingly running off but told his reason why and asked for a spare blaster. She understood and gave him her spare blaster and called for backup before they both entered the building and made sure that they both weren't discovered as they hid behind some crates as they both looked and saw the figure that got both of Naruto and the police cell's attention. The figure turned Naruto and the Police cell's eyes widened as the figure turned out to be a very tall and strong female humanoid clad in blood red, with a long blood red coa<br>\r\nt. She had jet-black skin, long purple hair in a messy ponytail, slanted green eyes, yellow fangs, and a roughly heart shaped face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was really alarming, however, was that the individual had clawed fingers, with a particularly long, sharp claw on her right index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around and looked over a bulletin board of some kind before she tsked. \"Doesn't look like he's here either...\" the individual said, then pulled out what looked like a locket and opened it, looking at what was inside it a moment before closing it and clenching her fist. Her body shook and with a yell, she slashed the board with her long claw, it glowing an ominous purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn you, Jones! It was a job, I get it; but he was my brother!\" she snarled, then took a deep breath, \"Ok...ok...relax, Virally, relax. Save it for when you get your hands on Jones for buring alive and disintegrating Thrax.\" she said to herself as she composed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and the police cell both looked at one another with grim expressions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the arrival time for that backup?\" the microscopic ninja asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About ten to twenty minutes, I'm afraid.\" The police cell said with a bit of dread in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Naruto said, as he looked at the virus trying to think of what to do against her.</span></div></div>",

Ugh...what did he do to deserve this hell?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy was, in Naruto's opinion, a complete nightmare; and her mom Phoebe was only somewhat more bearable, at least the older woman treated him a tiny bit better and fed him, checked him over to see if he's okay,  things like that. But even then, the mother of the brat had a habbit of using him for her self-pleasures....Naruto shuddered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally finishing, he collapsed, exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never said you could rest, Slave!\" Mandy snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, if Naruto were his normal size and/or had access to his full chakra!

Her skin tone was tanned, and she was wearing a light green shirt with a pink skirt, and tan boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her wrist was a watch with a part sticking up like an antenna tipped with a small heart and two other antennas sticking from it horizontally as they stopped spinning. Once they had, all three antenna retracted into the wristwatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes widened. A buzzsaw?! Oh...who cares!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe angel of salvation blinked, confused. \"Weird...could've sworn I heard someone pounding and shouting like they were trapped in here...\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THANK YOU!!!!\" Naruto cried, about ready to weep in happiness. Finally, he was free from Mandy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's savior then looked at where his voice came from and her eyes widened at the sight of him and she said, \"Oh My Gosh! What happend to you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story, but I promise to explain everything I know just please tell me you can get me away from Mandy!\" Naruto said in a desperate voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's savior nodded and held out her hand and Naruto quickly climb up her hand and the girl pulled him closer to herself and said, \"By the way, I never got you're name, my name is Alexandra, but my friends call me Alex.\" The newly named Alex said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Naruto Uzumaki and as of right now I'm in you're debt Alex-Chan.\" Naruto replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex blushed at what Naruto said, but shook it off as she focused on the task at hand, and that was getting Naruto to see her friends Sam and Clover to see if they can get Naruto some help and to hear his side of the story.</span></div></div>",

AND WHERE IS MY PET!? WHOEVER DID THIS IS DEAD! YOU HEAR ME? <b>DEAD!!!!!!!!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking, then realizing Mandy had just yelled out for everyone to hear that she'd smuggled a pet (what, or rather, who it was, Alex could guess) into school and it was more than likely a teacher had heard, Alex grinned. Not a bad cherry on top if Mandy got herself into trouble as she and Naruto giggled as they then heard Mandy try to explain as she was now getting taken to the principal's office by a passing teacher who refused to hear excuses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while and making sure Naruto wasn't seen by the other students Alex made it to the Cafeteria where she saw her friends/partners Sam and Clover talking to eachother with their lunch trays in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh Sammy, I swear I was going to bust my gut from hearing that Mandy had gotten a week's worth of detention for bringing a pet to school and that they were going to call her mom about this, Aah... Hearing Mandy suffer makes the world a little brighter.\", Clover said as she sipped some of her drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys look! Your not going to believe this look what I saved from Mandy!\", Alex said to Sam and Clover when she sat down with her friends in the lunch room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then pulled Naruto out of her pockets and showed him to them, and when Alex opened her hands and reveled Naruto to her friends however, Alex noticed that Naruto seemed to be laying still in the palm of her hand as if he was making himself look like a toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute Alex... another toy for your collection? Seriously don't you have enough of these tiny toys already?\", Clover said as she looked at the \"Toy\" in her friend's hand as Sam kinda had the same thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Sorry guys, he must still be scared to introduce himself, Hey Naruto, it's okay these are my friends Samantha, but you can call her Sam, and Clover. You can trust them and your safe now, I promise.\", Alex said to the toy and just as Sam and Clover thought Alex may have lost it, until the \"Toy\" suddenly looked towards them and began to sit up like an actual person, \"Okay Alex-chan, I trust you.\" Then Naruto then turned to face Sam and Clover,\"Hi there, I'm Naruto Uzumaki and if Alex-chan says I can trust you two, then I'll believe her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the so-called \"Toy\" come to life after Alex said it was safe to and showed that he was a REAL human, both Sam and Clover gasped at the sight of the shrunken blonde shinobi, Meanwhile, Naruto was looking at the two gigantic friends of Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam is a beautiful and slim girl with fair skin, long red hair and emerald green eyes. She is shown to have a widow's peak. she was dressed in an outfit that was a blue shirt with a large white collar that covered half her body and white shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClover is a tall, athletic, slender, beautiful and attractive girl with white skin, blonde hair, bright blue eyes, Her hairstyle is a fluffy, personalized bob cut which comes out over the left side of her face and flips when her shakes horizontally. Clover was dressed in a red colored skirt and light purple colored jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Alex how did you score that tiny cutie in the palm of your hand!? And can I keep him? Maybe we can share him, Okay look, I'll keep him on Mondays to Sundays and you can have him on days that end with an \"I\", Clover said as she was attempting to scam Naruto off Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam then gave Clover a  look, \"Clover, there are no days of the week that end with an \"I\". So stop trying to scam Alex...you sound just like Mandy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being told that Clover then pouted but decided to drop it, as Sam tells Alex that later she wants to study Naruto and see if she can help him get him back to his normal size and then, Naruto began to explain everything that happened to him and how he ended up in this world and then got himself in Mandy's clutches and how he was forced to basically become Mandy and her mom's personal slave and they had him do everything they commanded him to do up to when Mandy stuffed him inside her locker until Alex saved him and when he was finished all three girls where shocked and disgusted to hear his story and they were also angry to hear all of the things Mandy and her mom made him do against his will, \"Guys we gotta keep him with us, we're the only \"Good people\" he actually knows since he got here.\" Alex said knowing that Naruto needed their help more than ever if they could find him a way back to his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I second that Alex, and Anyone who hates Mandy as much as we do, is a friend of mine.\", Clover said agreeing that keeping Naruto as far away from Mandy's hands the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam also nodded in agreement as nobody deserved to be Mandy's slave, and with that, Naruto was officially now under Sam, Alex and Clover's protection and just before they could decide on what to do now....</span></div></div>",

Reeling back, Naruto fell right on his behind and watched as the crack seemed to spread over the surface of the rock like a cracking eggshell.<i> 'Oh man, THAT can't be a good sign!'</i> Naruto thought in a panic. Before his imagination could get out of hand, the shards of the meteor fell apart, revealing a reddish glow that lite up the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all common sense telling him he should LEAVE NOW, Naruto couldn't help but feel drawn to the light. Getting up from the ground, the young Uzumaki walked over and peered into the broken meteor. Inside the crumbled rock lay a beautiful red gemstone. Despite being from space, the precious mineral was perfectly cut into a rounded shape like it just came out of a jewelry store. Naruto, in a daze, reached out his hand towards the gem. Suddenly, the light vanished from the box and Naruto blinked the daze out of his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man\u2026must have blacked out there for a second,\" Naruto mumbled while shaking his head to clear the cobwebs. Looking back at the now empty meteor, he wondered aloud, \"Did\u2026did I just imagine there being a jewel in that thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as those words left his mouth, he collapsed to his knees, clutching his chest in pain. \"Holy shit! That hurts like a mother! What in the world-?!\" he all but screamed out as he ripped at his shirt and jacket to get it off in the hopes he'd be able to alleviate the searing heat that seemed to be originating from his chest before spreading to his body through his chakra network.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally removing the clothing, Naruto stared with wide eyes at his now glowing chest. Or more specifically, the glowing red gemstone embedded in his chest! \"W-what in the-?!\" he was cut off as another spasm of pain rocked his entire body. It felt like acid was being dumped into his chakra network as whatever energy the gemstone was giving off used the pathways to spread throughout his entire body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAARRRRGGGGHHHH!\" he howled in pain as he went from a kneeling position to down on his hands and knees, his eyes shut from the agony his body was experiencing. If he'd kept his eyes open, Naruto would have witnessed his body undergo a startling transformation! On the skin surrounding the embedded gemstone, veins started to rise up and pulse angrily as they spread across Naruto's body. White fur then started to spring up on the boy's person and even his blonde hair turned snowy white before growing out into a long mane. Naruto's nails broke apart as razor sharp, inch long nails grew out of his fingertips, as well as his toes. Naruto's feet seemed to lengthen with a sickening crack of bone, warping until the former blonde's legs now looked more like those of a canine species. His tailbone then lengthened before becoming covered in the same fur now covering his body, becoming a sweeping lupine tail. Naruto's muscles seemed to bulge out, and while not becoming bodybuilder sized, they were more defined like an Olympic gymnast. Finally, Naruto's head changed. Real whiskers sprouted out of his birthmarks as his ears stretched to the top of his head and became pointed. With another crack, the boy's face lengthened as his teeth became pointed fangs, forming a muzzle complete with black nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transformed ninja lay there for a minute or two, panting, before he rose up on his new legs and let out a long howl to the rising moon. As he howled, the boy's clothes which had been either ripped or discarded during the change, glowed with a strange light that emanated from the jewel still visibly fused into Naruto's chest (despite the fur). When the glow faded, Naruto's lupine form was wearing a new outfit. He now wore what almost looked to be a mix of a green tunic with matching shorts and golden armor. His arms and dog shaped legs now had golden gauntlets on them, and his tunic had matching shoulder guards. The werewolf like boy wore two belts, one around his waist that had another red gem for the buckle while the other was strapped across his torso like a bandolier with golden spikes jutting out from it. On his back rested a quiver full of golden-colored arrows, while at his hip was a jewel-hilted golden sword in its sheath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the man-wolf stopped howling, he looked around with red eyes at his surroundings. He gave a growl like a wild animal looking for prey. But Naruto didn't even move a step before he brought a clawed hand to his head with a sharp whine. For an entire minute, Naruto thrashed his head around like there was a war waging inside his skull, and it wouldn't be that far from the truth. Suddenly, Naruto gave another howl but this one was much shorter and sounded almost human in some regards. When he finally opened his eyes, they were still red in color but lacked the feral nature they displayed earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blinked and let out a groan, <b>\"Ugh, my head-!\"</b> he then let out a cough as he went to massage his throat. <b>\"Man, what's up with my voice? It sounds like I'm gargling gravel!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he rubbed his furry throat with his clawed hand, Naruto mused, <b>\"Something feels\u2026different. Why does it feel like I'm wearing a fur scarf and hey! I'm not shrunk any...more...?\"</b> He trailed off as he observed his hand, his <i>furry, clawed hand, </i>and with widening eyes, quickly looked over as much of his body as he could, observing all the changes that had occurred and even went to feel his now lupine face. Naruto, placing his arms to his sides, stood completely still and quiet for several moments and then\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto froze. What the...? He could hear normally, but when he tried to talk, him mouth didn't move like it should when he spoke, yet he could hear his own voice, and it was more like he was hearing vibrations inside his skull, not the regular sounds. It was as if his mind was vibrating like a strummed cord and projecting what he wanted to say directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how was that...? His eyes widened, <b>\"Telepathy? I can use telepathy?! What the HECK is going on?!\" </b>He demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the woman that had broken into the plane turned around and instantly went pale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow in the HELL--?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA 6'6\", red-eyed arctic werewolf, it's body was covered in dense white fur, it's fingers and toes ended in sharp claws, and was wearing an armor of scale mail and green boots like an adventurer from the midevil ages!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmor...broadsword... dagger...a short bow and arrows. Sheesh, this monster looked like it belonged in a Renaissance festival. But a sworld-weilding, white werewolf in boots and armor, carrying a bow and arrows, and uses telepathy to talk? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere had it come from?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the creature look at itself  in...was that scock and confusion?....Geraldine quickly got over her shock and quickly pulled out a spray bottle and aimed it in Naruto's direction and sprayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, hearing the spray, looked in her general direction, until he breathed in the spray which carried nanoscopic probes that function like spors and took control of whoever or apparently whatever breathes them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Naruto suddenly stopped moving and stood still at attention and  at seeing her probes already at work, Geraldine Husk smirked \"Oh yes...I don't know where you came from, and you're not what I came to get, but  I do know that I can certainly put you to use. How about...as my new pet....why, I even have a few chew toys just waiting for you!\" The woman cooed wickedly, running her hands through the thick, soft fur of the werewolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKissing her \"new per\" on the nose, she turned and beckoned it as she exited through the hole in the mail plain she'd made, getting abord her personal ship, the beastial midevil warrior following her, obedient as a well-trained puppy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe might not have gotten that meteorite she was planning to use, but this was a better prize. WHOOP wouldn't know what hit them!</span></div></div>",

Wouldn't you agree, Poochie Poo?\" As she looked at the mind controlled Uzumaki werewolf with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- Later ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the plane landed, it was already morning and as the sun's morning rays touched the Uzumaki werewolf, he began to shrink and transform back to his original form and Geraldine's eyes widened at this phenomenon until she was now looking at a two inch tall boy with blond hair, lightly tanned skin, electric blue eyes, whisker marks on both his cheeks and his clothes were gone as Geraldine now had a blush on her face as she saw her \"Poochie Poo\" become a shrunken naked boy, and she thought that he must transform into a werewolf only at night and he was a shrunken boy during the day. She couldn't help but grin at this discovery as she thought of what to use him for in this form and snatched up the naked Uzumaki as she held him in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw that Naruto was still under her control as she saw the lifeless stare in his eyes and she thought to herself with a grin, 'perfect.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then took Naruto to her lair and took him to her room and began to strip out of her clothing and said in a commanding voice, \"When it's daytime, you will respond to \"Slave\"; but when it's night, you will respond to \"Pocchie Poo\", understand?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, under the effects of the nanoscopic probes, nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeraldine smiled, \"Good, now come and make your mistress feel good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spread her legs open and watched Naruto still under her probes' power walk towards her now wet vagina and began to kiss, hump, and play with her ciltoris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeraldine moaned in pleasure as she felt Naruto's manhood rub against her lower lips for entry and soon she opened her lower lips for him to slide inside her vagina and he began to hump and pound her insides and she felt every movement and wave of pleasure through her sexual high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto continued to pound inside her vagina, Geraldine began to massage her breasts and she even started to suckle on her left breast and played with her ciltoris with her right hand, but neither could make her feel like what Naruto was making her feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued, Geraldine was feeling herself close to orgasming and soon yelled, \"I'M CUMMING!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Geraldine's vagina, Naruto was soon washed out of her vagina by her cum as it made a very large puddle on the bed, as Geraldine was gasping for air she looked at Naruto and the puddle of cum he made her release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened as she looked at the clock and saw that he made her cum in under five minutes and she saw Naruto's penis still up at attention and looking ready for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was gonna love this until night fall as she then grabbed Naruto and began to use him for sexual needs more.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n--- Later, Close to sunset ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Geraldine finally came out of her room, her hair was all over the place and she looked like she ran for five hundred miles but at the same time, felt great and she looked at the shrunken, naked Uzumaki looking just mildly winded as she still saw his manhood still ready for more and thought to herself, 'Goodthing he's still under my control, or I'd be calling HIM master.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then saw the sunset and looked at Naruto and saw that he was already transforming again and set him down. Once his transformation was complete, she proceeded with her plan to lure out those three spies, especially Clover to meet her \"Poochie Poo\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, she and \"Poochie Poo\" in her personal jet made it to Beverly Hills High School and told her pet, \"Now Poochie Poo, I want you to go inside that school and do as much damage as you can to get WHOOP to send in your chew toys Sam, Alex and more importantly, Clover!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon had Naruto break in the school and from there he went to town, destroying everything in his way especially the locker's that belonged to Sam, Alex, Clover but for some reason Geraldine couldn't understand was that he completely destroyed a locker that belonged to someone named Mandy... Oh well, just more reason for WHOOP to send in those three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a quarter to dawn and Geraldine called back \"Poochie Poo\" and had her jet quickly leave before the sun fully rised.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n --- With Sam, Alex and Clover, Following Morning ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sam, Alex and Clover made their way to school, they were talking about possible boyfriends, fashions, etc, that is until they were surprised to see a huge crowd in front of Beverly Hills Highschool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing their way to the front, the girls gasped as they saw just why there was a huge crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school building looked like a tornado made entirely of blades slashed it up with a sword!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't just vandalism, this was more than that. There were body-sized holes smashed through the school walls!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe track yard, looked like someone or something, ran through it, attempting to mow the lawn a little too close to the ground with a buzzsaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing inside, the students all stared in a type of horrified awe at everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school and gym's insides were slashed and ripped apart like a hyper little kid shredded through his Christmas presents while on a sugar rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathrooms were all flooded, as the funnels had been severed clean off from the pipes and spewed like indoor water fountains. Stalls were ripped from their hinges. Sinks were smashed to pieces, and the mirrors were shattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the classrooms, the desks, the boards, the teacher's desks, the walls, the doors were all slashed and practicality destroyed, but not as destroyed as Mandy's locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all of the lockers were mostly dented, with slash marks going through them and were basically crushed, Mandy's was another story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe locker looked like a scene from a monster horror movie; not only had it been ripped completely from the wall and crushed into a twisted, misshapen mass, but long slash marks riddled the locker, pictures of Mandy where shredded into unrecognizable ribbons, teeth marks that could fit a human's head were on the locker door, Mandy's books were torn to confetti and her spare credit cards were ripped into one centimeter pieces and those were hard plastic! The nail polishes she had were shattered and spilt, and the compacts were smashed with the powders all over and the rest of her cosmetics were all destroyed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention from the smell, whoever had done this had obviously pissed all over the locker and it's contents!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok...so somebody was pissed at Mandy and broke in to ransack her stuff, but ended up destroying everything until they found her locker...\" Clover mused, of two minds about this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, the faculty gathered all the students and had them sent home while the building was going to need repairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the announcement, most of the students began to celebrate their vacation, except for Mandy who was now in tears, seeing that everything within her locker was destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that don't I like to see Mandy in tears, or having this sudden vacation, but there's something fishy going on here.\" Sam said to her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally, I only wish that whoever trashed Mandy's locker brought me along!\" Clover said, wishing she got a few wacks at Mandy's locker. Sam and Alex stared at that remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I think we should talk to Jerry, maybe he knows what just happen-!\" Alex was saying until the three girls got sucked into one of the trashed lockers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sliding down a tube, the girls fell upon a very soft cushion and looked up to see a middle-aged, very serious British gentleman, wearing a suit that is defined as informal attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello spies.\" The aged man said in a British accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jerry.\" Sam said before continuing, \"Something caused our school to look like a giant cat's scratching post and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know, and that is why I brought you three here, as if what did this to you're school in just one night, then imagine what could happen to larger building with people inside it.\" The now named Jerry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls didn't need to imagine that and all three fully agreed that who or whatever is behind this must be stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here are you're gadets you may need for this mission the Electromagnetic Field Disperser Walkman, the Shield Umbrella, Perfume Atomizer Stun Spray and of course you're compowder. Be careful spies, this could be a very dangerous misson.\" Jerry said with a bit of worry for the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Jer, we'll be careful.\" Sam said as they left to find this potential threat to the world and put a stop to it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> Long before the Diamond Authority found and tried to colonize the Planet Earth, they discovered an ancient planet with ruins that were there from a time before the Gems were capable of flight. When they first explored the planet, they could tell that the planet was too old for their plans and soon left, but not before finding something strange from the ruins. This odd, pink, star-shaped object was unraveged by time unlike the ruins around it. Not knowing what to do with it, the gems that were sent to this planet took it with them to show their leaders just what they had found. The Diamonds didn't know what to do with it until one of their own decided to keep it and later gift it to another of their own. Pink Diamond was the one who first kept this strange object before deciding to give it to Blue Diamond as a way to remember her by. Blue kept the thing unsure of what to do with it, but was still a kind momento from Pink Diamond. Eventually, the events of the rebellion of the Crystal Gems came and gone, but Blue Diamond kept the strange thing now as a memory of Pink Diamond. It wasn't until one strange day that the object did something remarkable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It is near the start of the series that we see Blue Diamond still mourning the loss of her fellow Diamond, the object beside her as always when she mourned. As she mourned, a smaller blue lifeform came into the room. \"I'm sorry for the interruption, My Diamond, but Yellow Diamond said she needed to meet with you over something important. What shall I tell her?\" Asked the blue Pearl. Blue diamond tried to clear her eyes as she replied, \"Tell her I'll be there in a moment. Let me dry my eyes first.\" The Diamond quickly dries her tears and follows the Pearl out, leaving behind the object. After a few minutes of sitting there, the box suddenly started glowing. As it glowed the top part seemed to fade away, leaving a white star shape open. It stayed open before something started to rise out of it. It wasn't until whatever it was was completely out did the object return to the way it was before, leaving the small being with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was an average day in Konohagakure for our blonde hero. It has been peaceful ever since the end of the Fourth Great war, and Naruto was enjoying every second of it. Sure there were still bandit attacks, but it was a lot better than being at constant cold war. Naruto was truly enjoying the peace from this. \"What a great day. The sun is shining, a nice breeze, and only one or two clouds in sight. I think I'll go and train today. Never know when something will happen.\" said the blonde Uzumaki, unaware of what was about to happen. He soon started training and was taking a break to regain his energy when something happened. He was sitting down when a star started to shine and grow from under him. It quickly grew to the point of being able to contain him, but Naruto tried to escape. Tried being the word as when he tried to run, he felt himself slam into some sort of barrier. \"Huh? What the hell?!\" shouted Naruto as he realized he was trapped. It was then that he felt himself start to sink into the glowing star. He tried to fight it, but eventually he was soon completely gone from where he was. The star soon shrank into oblivion, leaving nothing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As Naruto fell, he saw odd visions of gem stones and odd sights of women summoning weapons of of white light. These images soon overwhelmed Naruto, knocking him out. He soon came back into focus as he tried to make sense of where he was. \"What was that light?\" he asked himself groggily. Shaking his head to give himself a bit of focus, he looked around to see a humongous room. Looking up, he saw odd bubbles that looked to have gem stones inside of them. Finally, he noticed the big star shaped object behind him. \"Now I remember!\" Naruto exclaimed. Unsure of what to do, he quickly uses the shadow clone jutsu, telling the clones to grab the thing and carry it behind a pillar. It wasn't soon after they were half way when a giant door opened in the distance. What entered shocked the ninja. \"Holy crap, that woman is huge!\" he mentally exclaimed. Following her was another woman, but much smaller, yet still giant to Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As the taller beings walked over to where he originally was, he overheard the conversation they were having. \"Why does Yellow Diamond try to get me to shatter these gems every time she is here?\" the taller blue lifeform asks. \"I'm unsure, my Diamond. She said that they just bring bad memories.\" replied the shorter of the two. Unsure of what to do, Naruto and his clones just kept quiet and listened to the conversation. It wasn't until something was said that Naruto began to worry. \"At least I still have that odd object Pink Diamond gave me. Huh? Where is it?\" the taller being said. \"Uh oh.\" Naruto said as he realized what she was talking about. He quickly dispelled his clones and hid, eaving the object behind. The shorter being quickly started to look around for it and found it where Naruto left it. \"I found it, my Diamond. It somehow got behind this pillar.\" the shorter being reported. \"Thank you Pearl.\" the being said to the Pearl? \"Huh. Wonder why they keep calling themselves precious stones. Oh well. Now I have to escape.\" Naruto quickly figured out the best way would to leave with the so called Pearl. He had to wait a few minutes before he heard her say she will wait outside for her call. \"Okay, here's my chance.\" Naruto said as he quietly followed the Pearl to the door, keeping a safe distance. The door keeps getting closer until he was finally out. \"Awesome. Now to figure out where I am.\" Naruto said, forgetting about the being he followed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n What happens next?</span></div></div>",

He looks human, but he is also six inches tall. What an odd being.' thought the Pearl. While Naruto wasn't looking, Blue Pearl quickly turned around and grabbed him. \"So you are the being that moved my Diamond's item. I don't know what you are or how you got here, but for know I'll take you to my Diamond for judgement.\" Blue Pearl said as she brought him to her face. Naruto fit almost perfectly in her hand as Blue Pearl brought him to her master. \"My Diamond, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I believe I found the culprit who moved your item.\" the Pearl said. \"Really? Where are they?\" asked Blue Diamond, only seeing her Pearl. \"Right here.\" she said has she raised her hand. Looking closely, Blue Diamond quickly noticed just what she was holding. \"A human? How did he escape? And how did he get so small?\" she asked. \" I'm unsure, my Diamond. I found him escaping from this room and I quickly captured him and brought him here.\" the Pearl replied. Picking him up between her thumb and forefinger, she quickly brought him up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now then little one, can you explain just how you got here and why you are so small?\" Blue Diamond asked politely. Naruto, already seeing the size difference decided to be mature and polite for once. \"I'm not sure ma'am. I was just training when suddenly a star started to shine under me and sucked my up. Next thing I know, I'm here and beside whatever the star shaped object is. As for being small, I just thought you were just huge.\" Naruto replied. \"Hmm. An odd story, but I guess we can check the surveillance footage from when I was gone. As for your size, I assume you must be about six earth inches. No bigger than my pupil.\" said the Diamond. \"Pearl. Can you go and check the footage while\u2026?\" \"Naruto.\" \"\u2026Naruto and I chat?\" Blue Diamond asked. \"Of course, my Diamond.\" Said the Pearl before she left the room. \"Now then, you said you were training? What exactly where you training for?\" Blue Diamond asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, I really just trying to keep my skill from getting rusty. Mainly tai and ninjutsu. I was going to practice sage mode, but then the star thing happened and here I am.\" Naruto quickly explained. \"My. That sounds interesting. Would you be willing to show me?\" Blue Diamond asked, curious to see what he was talking about. She was also happy about having her mind taken off from Pink Diamond. She quickly sets down and places him in front of her before watching go through katas. \"Impressive. But what is ninjutsu?\" Blue Diamond asked. Naruto quickly explains the concept of ninjustu, which also led to him explaining chakra. \"I see. The humans I know of have never shown the capacity for that. Care to demonstrate?\" Blue Diamond asked. Complying with her, Naruto quickly show off the shadow clone jutsu and henge jutsu before Blue Diamond interrupts. \"While those are both impressive, I was curious about this Rasengan and Rasenshuriken you talked about.\" \"I can show you the Rasengan, but not the Rasenshuriken. It's kinda dangerous to use. While the Rasengan can be used to stun, the Rasenshuriken is used to shred at a cellular level. It really is dangerous.\" Naruto explained. Walking over to a pillar, Naruto quickly charged up a Rasengan, to Blue Diamond's shock, and uses it on a pillar and leaving a massive dent in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"My word. That is impressive. It just might be able to shatter someone.\" Blue Diamond said. \"Shatter?\" Naruto asks. Seeing as they still had time, Blue Diamond quickly explained Gem and Homeworld structure and society to him. \"Wow. So your body is really just light with mass?\" Naruto asked. \"Indeed. Now, what about sage mode? I'm curious to see it.\" Blue Diamond said. Naruto does something surprising to her and sits down. When he does, she feels some kind of pull from her form. 'Huh? What is this feeling?' she thinks. With Naruto, as soon as he enters sage mode, he notices many masses of nature chakra, including two massive ones. One that is walking away from here and another in front of him. He quickly stand up and opens his eyes, showing the effects of sage mode. \"I see you changed your eyes, but what else can you do?\" Blue Diamond asked, ignoring the strange feeling she felt. Naruto just smiles as he walks over to her and with one hand lifts her body up! \"This form enhances my strength, sensing abilities, and a few other surprises. But I can only hold it for so long before having to recharge.\" Naruto explains while placing her back down. While she wasn't as heavy as a mountain, she still had some weight to her. \"It also allows me to use Frog Kata.\" He said before standing twenty feet away from a pillar. He then throws a punch, to Blue Diamond's curiosity then shock, when she sees an imprint of a fist on the pillar about three inches in. \"That was Frog Kata, which basically extends my fighting range.\" Naruto explained. \"Incredible.\" Blue Diamond murmers with wonder in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Suddenly the door opens up and Blue Pearl walked in. \"I am sorry for taking so long, my Diamond. It appears that his story was true.\" \"It is okay, my Pearl. Our new friend here was just showing what he can do.\" Blue Diamond said, before explaining what the two did while they waited. If Blue Pearl was shocked, she hid it well. \"That explains the other gem we felt for a few minutes. I can only assume that the natural energy he calls nature chakra is what we use to make our bodies. It is worth looking into. For now, my Diamond, I believe we must get back to Homeworld. You have a meeting with a Jasper, Peridot, and others.\" Blue Pearl informed her Diamond. \"If we must. Naruto, how would you feel about coming with us?\" Blue Diamond asked, hoping he would say yes. He was interesting and she kinda wanted to know more about his world and him in general. Naruto thought it over and decided to go with her. \"Sure. Maybe we can find a way to get me back to my world.\" \"Of course. Pearl, can you carry him?\" Blue Diamond asked. \"Of course, my Diamond.\" Blue Pearl replied before picking up the ninja in her hands and following her Diamond. \"By the way, Naruto. When we get back, I have a meeting to go to with some gems, as well as my fellow Diamond, Yellow. Would you rather go with me, or stay with my Pearl?\" Blue Diamond asked. Naruto thought it over, but was still unsure. \"I'm sorry, I can't really decide. Would it be okay if we wait until we get there before answering?\" Naruto asked. \"Of course.\" Blue Diamond replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio eventually reached Blue Diamond's ship, with Naruto in awe over where he was. The trio quickly get in and get ready to return to Homeworld. The trip was pleasant for Naruto as he was held in Blue Pearl's hands. It took a few hours, but they eventually reached their destination and Naruto had made his decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n What was Naruto's decision?</span></div></div>",

Didn't we, like, destroy that last time we were here?\" Amethyst asked, completely bored by the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to make sure it still is. I doubt Homeworld will give up repairing the warp even if Peridot defected. We have to make sure no one else tries without our knowledge.\" Garnet left no room for debate from her teammates. This was too important to for them to neglect, especially after all they had experienced during the war with Homeworld.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio inspected every inch of the hub, and found nothing different from the last time they were there, but their leader wanted them to scour the place for any signs of activity before they could leave. A fact that was quick to grate on the nerves of the easily bored Amethyst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! This is stupid!\" the gem whined as she leaned against the main hub pad. \"Everything's the same as last time! Can't we call it a day, Garnet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet. Just keep your eyes peeled and I'll let you know when we're done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaahhh!\" Amethyst cried, and brought an angry fist down on top of the warp pad. In a manner similar to someone kicking a TV to get it to work, the gem's frustrated strike caused a temporary spark of activation. The platform flashed brightly as it powered up, however, since there was no chosen location, it transported from a random point in space, much to the dismay of its passenger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMMIT!\" Naruto cried as he shot through nothingness towards an unknown destination. His lungs used every bit of oxygen in them to curse his crappy luck, and the expletives didn't stop until he landed face first into his destination, onto a hard, stone floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do, Amethyst?!\" demanded Pearl as she summoned her weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just hit the darn thing!

Of course, they were wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto cussed five more times before he stood back onto his feet and immediately spat out six more. He didn't know what had happened to him, but he was damn sure he was taller than a person's ankle a few minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA handful of minutes had passed, and with seemingly nothing happening Garnet decided to ere on the side of caution and had one of them take a close look at the warp pad.</span></div></div>",

In the center of the room stood a titanium doorframe lined with panels, wires and a display, its purpose a top secret of the CIA.

He needed a shower and a fresh change of clothes after this craziness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least your father wasn\u2019t here for this craziness, it will take me almost a week to clean this mess.\u201d Francine said, grateful that her husband was on a lengthy mission for the CIA and wouldn\u2019t be back anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever, I\u2019m just glad Roger didn\u2019t destroy the universe because he wanted new episodes of a stupid tv show.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it may have seemed to them that the device was a failure, something small, about the size of three inches, had been flung into their world by the explosion, and had embedded itself into the ceiling.

Got anything for a birthday gift?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man smiled, \"I see you forgot Ino's birthday huh Naruto? Well, lucky for you, I have just the very thing you need, for this gift Ino will love for that I can most guarantee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man rhymed as he then pulled out a box with various animals on it and when he opened it, inside the box was a very beautiful golden necklace with a golden amulet that looked like a lion's mouth trying to bite down on a pure sapphire stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is perfect! Ino-chan will definitely love this amulet!\", Naruto said as he paid the shopkeeper and as he was about to pick it up out of the box, suddenly the amulet seemed to glow in a blue aura and then in a bright blue flash of light blinding the old man for a moment, when the old man's eyes recovered to his shock and horror, Naruto was suddenly gone and the sapphire amulet somehow turned black...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- Flashback end ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's how Naruto ended up here, wherever here was... alone, with NO access to either his or the Kyuubi's chakra what-so-ever, and shrunken to being two inches tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when Naruto was about to think that things couldn't get any worse, Naruto suddenly felt the ground begin to shake in a series of thunderous Earthquakes after another that bounced Naruto around like a ragdoll until Naruto soon saw a gigantic shadow cover him from the sun's ray and once the Earthquakes stopped and Naruto saw what was causing them, his skin colored paled to the point where Orochimaru's would be burnt black in comparison, his jaw suddenly dropped straight to the ground, his eyes widened to the point they looked like they would burst right out of their sockets, as he saw a single lioness standing in front of him that seemed be as big as the entire planet from his point of view and maybe even bigger and then he heard someone call the lioness...</span></div></div>",

Are you alright?\", However Naruto never got a reply as the old man suddenly glared at Naruto with eyes filled with outrage and then he suddenly aimed his fingers at the blonde Uzumaki and Naruto saw that the old man's nails were purist black and then they suddenly became jagged and broken and then suddenly blood red electricity shot at Naruto causing him agonizing amounts of pain as he felt his body begin to shrink to the point where he now stood two inches tall and that wasn't the end of it, as Naruto began to feel his body being sent somewhere but he didn't know where as he then passed out from all the pain his body was feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen with Naruto, apparently shrunken to the point of disappearing from existence the wizard then mumbled about getting a new manicure and suddenly teleported away from the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a groan, Naruto found himself laying on his back still feeling some mild discomfort from what happened last night as he was getting up on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Naruto fully stood up, he then saw that he was somewhere dark and yet somehow very warm and the ground looked like it was a fair color, like someone's skin, and soft and squishy to stand on. Looking around, he saw he was standing among what looked like a endless field of enormous wheat-colored trees of some sort. Looking up, he then saw the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was he? And why did he feel so strange?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding he needed a look around, Naruto turned to one on the strange trees and put his hands together to focus his cha...Huh?! His eyes widened. His chakra...heck, even the fox's chakra....HE COULDN'T FEEL ANY OF IT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he remembered what happened last night the old wizard man! He had something to do with this, but how? All Naruto ever did was apologize for bumping into the old man, and then he attacked him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Naruto ever found his way back to the village and he sees that old man again... he's going to do much more than just \"Bump\" into him again... but that would have to wait for a while, as Naruto needed some kind of plain to figure out where he was and how to get back to Konoha, first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, Naruto then began to climb one of the strange gigantic trees with his bare hands, seeing as he couldn't access his chakra, he had to climb up trees the old fashioned way, as he climbed, Naruto was at least hoping that wherever he was now, it was at least a peaceful place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, he has been wrong before... After what felt like an eternity, Naruto had reached the top of the \"tree\"...only to find himself looking at the back of the head of an utterly gigantic animal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when he realized this wasn't even a tree at all, no this was REALLY a single hair of this animal's fur! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAns from what he saw of the area they were in, this animal must have been as miserable as he was when he was a child if not more so, as he saw the area around the animal was nothing but a barren wasteland, and it wasn't the only one either as he saw other animals and they all looked like cats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut these cats looked much bigger than the ones he's saw back in Konoha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Naruto felt his surrounding shake and rumble as he then saw a gigantic sized black claw heading towards him and Naruto like any other sensible person did what came naturally, he ran for his life, but compared to the gigantic claw, he made little to no progress... somehow the claw missed him, but it kept trying to scratch him though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the giant feline kept trying to scratch him, Naruto was frantically dodging the claw as much as possible, suddenly Naruto had tripped and fallen and then he felt his jumpsuit get caught by the claw and was now being lifted up to meet who was scratching at him.</span></div></div>",

Toot, Foxxy and Clara all boarded Foxxy's van and tore off down the street, plowing through several fences in their hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeam 1 sat pondering their own conundrum, and several things were tried. Captain Hero attempted to punch the water out of the boot, only to be hit by splash-back and scream like a frightened child. Spanky made his attempt, only for it to end with failure, and Wooldoor catching fire...somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an intense montage of activity, and Team 2 had finally managed to finish constructing their design after many hours of mind numbing calculations and physical labor.

The three girls, and one animal-monster thing, gasped as unidentifiable objects began to leap from the whole in reality. One such thing was a fireball that flew towards Toot, who quickly used Ling-Ling as a shield, sending the battle monster flying off towards the horizon from the impact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir panic didn't last long, however, as the portal began to fizzle out, and the machine began to smoke.

Whoever it was. they certainly shared her taste in colors, wearing an orange jumpsuit with some black here and their. They also had a head of spiky blond hair that was kept out of their eyes with a metal and fabric headband. An inquisitive finger prodded the limp figure up and down, feeling the minuscule muscles beneath the clothing, as well as a tiny bulge at the crotch, signifying the masculinity of the tiny person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't much that was hidden in the Drawn Together house, and it was well known by the housemates that Foxxy had a penchant for domination, as Captain Hero could attest.

Her first instinct was to pull a magnifying glass from between her breasts and hold it to her eye, taking in as much as she could of the tiny curiosity. The next thing to come to mind was to get a good look at the little ninja's junk, focusing her vision right on the slight bulge concealed by his orange pants. She quickly discarded the glass tool to free her hand, a chocolate brown finger coming to goose the package contained by the clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, not bad, little guy,\" Foxxy hummed appreciatively as her finger withdrew from his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto groaned and shifted in the giant palm, his legs twitching like a sleeping dogs. Foxxy pulled away and observed from above for a bit. It had seemed as if he was coming around for a moment, but the tiny guy settled back to stillness and the musician moved back in, her finger at the ready once more.</span></div></div>",

Ever since she had heard Harry\u2019s tale Voldemort\u2019s return, she had taken to studying with an urgent fervor, now that one of the most powerful dark lords of all time had come back. She wanted every spell she could get her hands on at her disposal, and was well into magics that were far beyond the abilities of an average 5th year student. It was one of these spells that set the events that followed into motion, whether or not she was aware of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the many things she was looking into was spells for summoning. After seeing Harry use the accio charm in the Triwizard Tournament, she could not deny the usefulness of such an ability. For the last hour and a half, Hermione had researched every charm similar, conjuring especially, and now it was time to practice what she had learned. With a quick series of wand flicks, and a muttered incantation, the young witch cast her spell. Unfortunately, the normally quick-witted magical made one small mistake, and forgot to specify what exactly she was trying to conjure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto had been gorging himself on his third bowl of ramen when it happened. At first he thought he had just eaten to fast, as it felt like something yanked him by his navel, but this theory was quickly debunked when a swirling vortex opened up beneath him, and he was pulled off his chair and into the hole. No one saw him vanish, as the cook had been busy prepping ingredients, and he was the only customer at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust above Hermione, a magical hole between worlds opened, and a tiny Naruto Uzumaki flew out.

For some reason it had drained his chakra and left him on the border of passing out. He could only rest for now, unable to summon the strength to move from his spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione felt something fall down the front of her uniform's top, uncertain as to what it could be as she was the only person in the library. She did a quick check to make sure that no one was there with her, and when she was sure that she was alone, Hermione dipped her hand into the front of her blouse.
