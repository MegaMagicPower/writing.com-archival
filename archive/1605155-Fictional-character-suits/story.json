School had just ended a couple of days before you had moved in. You had started exploring a forest on your family's new property, when you happened to see a hidden door blended almost perfectly into a huge tree stump to which it was attached to, and would be easy to miss. You went to the door and opened it, expecting it to be some kind of club house, it was pretty dark inside of it, so you went to get a flashlight, then came back to the stump and turned the flashlight on. You saw a set of stairs leading down, so you went down them to see what was at the bottom. When you entered though, you noticed a brief glow, which surrounded you. When you got to the bottom, you found a light switch, which you then turned on. A bunch of lights turned on, and you saw that you were in some kind of warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...\" You said in shock. You looked around and saw a note. \"What's this?\" You wondered, then began to read it, finding out about the wherehouse. \"Wow...\" Was all you could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat isle do you look at first?</span></div></div>",

You used to watch DBZ growing up so you decide it might be fun to try her out. You take her off the rack and are suprised at how life-like the suit was, even down to how she styled her hair. You then look for an opening in the back and then proceed to put your legs in. Surprisingly the suit stretches so your legs fit inside. Next you stick you arms and torso in and finally you stick your head in and zip it up. The moment you fully zip the skinsuit up you feel the skinsuit tighten and shrink your body to fit inside, Next you feel your chest inflate making C-Cup breasts. Next you feel a sucking feeling from your crotch as you watch as your penis gets sucked in transforming into a vagina finalizing your transformation. Worried about what just happened you reach for your back only to find your zipper was still there. Relieved, you then turn around to put some clothes on when a big machine catches your eye. You walk up to it and read the big label on it (Body Maker: make the skinsuit you wear your new body). Curious you step inside only for a door to close behind you. Then you feel a tingling sensation on your back, you then proceed to reach for your back only to discover that the zipper has disappeared. Next you feel your skin tingle as the skinsuit merges with your skin. After that the door opens and you walk out. As you where walking away you hear a \"Ding!\" followed by a \"Plop\" sound. You turn around to discover a hatch had plopped out a skin suit version of your old body. \"I think I'll just leave that there for now.\" You say as you walk away back to where you found the Chichi skinsuit . \"Well I better get dressed, I don't want to be bare naked forever.\" You say. You then proceed to put on a pair of pink panties and bra, a purple qipao dress with a yellow sash, a orange sweater you tie around your neck, some red hoop braclets and earings, and a pair of pink and red boots. After you slip those on you notice a mirror next to you that seemingly came out of nowhere and quickly blush at the sight of how beautiful you are. \"Hmm I wonder what I should do now?\" you say with Chichi's voice (what dub voice is up to you.)</span></div></div>",

(<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/172/tsunade43kbjm6.jpg/\" target=\"_blank\">http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/172...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, it wasn't for the perverted thrill of having the voluptuous body of the fifth Hokage all to himself, her ample bosom would only play a small part in the role. He was more interested in having a little revenge on someone who had really rubbed him the wrong way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts briefly returned to a fight he had just a few days ago with his older sister...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"ARGH!\" Anthony shrieked at finding the charred remains of his favorite manga books shoved in at the top of the garbage can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah, his obnoxious seventeen year old sister walked into the kitchen where Anthony stood horrified at the sight of his precious treasures completely destroyed. Even though she was blasted her pink iPod at maximum volume she still yelled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it down before I tell mom Anthony!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care!\" Anthony yelled back. \"Where is mom!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" She couldn't hear him over her headphones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where! Is! Mom!\" He mouthed to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, out or something. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony grabbed a handful of the black scarps of paper and held it up in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah just rolled her eyes. \"Oh, don't tell me you're crying over me burning that stuff are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did WHAT!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me, Charlie was coming over and I didn't want him to get the wrong impression about me. So I had to get rid of those books.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie was Sarah's new boyfriend. He was a like-able enough guy, much different and more fair than Sarah. However, he was also one of the top students in their high school, was captain of the basketball team, and probably would be the valedictorian for graduation this year with the Seniors. In other words, he was a keeper in the eyes of Sarah and she would do anything at all possible to impress him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remains of his books flaked through the cracks of his fingers. Probably over two hundred dollars worth of good manga gone in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't you have just moved them!? Or even told me to move them!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, lighten up. They're just books. They're pretty cheap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No they aren't! You better pay me back for each and every one of them or I'll tell mom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, tell her. And I'll let her know who the one was that dented the car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony could only growl threateningly. That dent was also Sarah's fault, but she'd probably find someway to plead with their father to place the blame entirely on him. He just slumped his shoulders in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later, brat.\" She sneered, getting the last word.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony normally wasn't the violent type, but in one fell swoop Sarah had obliterated almost his entire manga collection. A collection that he had spent hours working for and months saving his allowance for. This was just too personal and too painful to ignore, he wanted to get revenge on Sarah in the worst way. But if he tried anything funny, she'd no doubt go crying to their parents and he'd end up in even bigger trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, if he got revenge on her pretending to be someone else...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony took the adult Tsunade suit off the rack and ran his fingers along the surface trying to find the zipper. You see, Sarah was absolutely crazy for her new boyfriend Charlie. So crazy in fact that she dyed her hair blond and stuffed her bras just because she heard a rumor that those were the 'aspects' of a girl Charlie went for. She'd also brutally make fun of any girl that Charlie looked at differently just so they got the hint that they were not to go anywhere near him. Anthony didn't know if Charlie noticed these things or not, but what he did know was Charlie had a terrible reputation of never staying too long with one girl before moving onto the next. In fact, Sarah had to be his seventh girlfriend this semester alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the odds were in his favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony's plan was simple, as he went over it in his head while he began stripping his clothes. Using the powers of the Tsunade suit, he'd start hanging around the places Sarah usually hung out with Charlie while pretending to be sick so he wouldn't be missed. Heck, he could probably even ask Mia to help him out, her opinions on their big sister weren't too varied. While as Tsunade, he would start to move in closer to Charlie and begin openly flirting with him. With Tsunade's body and a flirty personally to the mix, it was doubtful that Charlie would be able to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if Charlie didn't fall for him, he'd give Sarah such a headache that eventually he could consider himself even with her. And if Charlie did fall for him, Anthony would just make sure he forgot all about Sarah and then just dump him. 'Tsunade' would disappear and everyone would forget the whole thing ever happened. Everyone except Sarah, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony let out an evil chuckle as he stepped inside the suit, the material was a strange mix of elastic and softness. Almost like it really was just some really stretchy skin and it really did look like a deflated Tsunade. It took a few minutes of fiddling around, but eventually he wiggled his toes into their proper place of the suit. It didn't take much more effort to fit both of his feet entirely in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when he began to wonder how the suit was going to work. After all, he was a tall guy being over six feet and Tsunade was about 5'2. This might be trouble as the more her worked the suit up his body, the tighter and harder to put on it became. It was when the suit was up to his waist that he had to take a moment to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on...Just the arms and the mask...\" He muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the arms on was like trying to run forward with a giant rubber band tied to you and a pole behind you. Everything was skintight and uncomfortable but after a few grunts and hard pulls he succeeded in getting the suit on up to his neck. All that remained was the mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing two fistfuls of the blond hair, Anthony pulled with all his might the mask over her head. It took just a few seconds to align the eye sockets with his own eyes, but at last everything was all set. Except none of the changes were occurring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I got to zip it up for it to work...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached around the back for the metal zipper at the base of his spine. It was like magic, the moment he grabbed it and pulled up was the moment his world began to change. Everything got larger as he started to shrink in height. His big arms and legs that filled the suit slowly began to thin out, his fingers and toes became more dainty and female-like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the fat that had been spread over his body was condensing itself to key points on his new changing form. His thighs and legs ballooned out, but the biggest growth was in the form of his chest which slowly expanding out to the size of two large melons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony could feel his face reshaping itself, making subtle changes in bone structure to perfectly match Tsunade's. There was also a dryness in his throat which he assumed was his vocal chords shifting to give him a young woman's voice. He closed his eyes as he felt a twisting in his crotch area which were the changes in his reproductive system to match that of a fully functional female one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen everything set in place. There was no longer a boy named Anthony standing in the warehouse, but a beautiful young woman who was looking at a nearby mirroring admiring herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the note was true and the first test run was complete. Anthony thought the next best thing to do was...</span></div></div>",

You slide your legs in, and you automatically feel your legs adjusting to fit the suit's legs, You continue, pulling it up to your crotch, and you feel a smooth vagina instead of your penis. Ignoring the weird feeling, you pull the suit up to your chest, feeling your hips, ass, and chest change to become a beautiful hourglass figure. You then put your arms in, and you feel them become slender and feminine. You then put your head into the head area of the suit. Finally, you zip up the zipper, which in turn disappears.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was much to dislike about Akane in your mind. She was at times inconsiderate and thick as a brick. Granted, some of her violent outbursts were justified by Ranma's stubbornness, but she just rubbed you the wrong way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was to your surprise, you were drawn to the Akane suit over the other girls from the show. She wasn't the prettiest, nor was she the cutest. Perhaps it's her strength, or her rarely seen soft side. May be as a character you found her a bit humorous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why do I want to be her?\" you say to yourself. 'May be I don't care if I mess around with her life, when I visit the Ranma universe,' you surmised. It sounded reasonable enough to you, but you suspected something more subconscious. You turned your attention to the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite what Ranma said, Akane possessed moderately sized assets. The deflated suit hinted of female curves, but the overall shape suggested well-toned muscles, and a slightly masculine physique. No wonder Akane was sensitive about her femininity. Yet even without her naughty parts, she definitely looked feminine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to the side you see an identical Akane suit, but with long-hair. Turning your attention back to the short-haired one, you admitted short suited her best. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must be crazy. Of all the suits, she has to be the first I wear...\" you shrugged as you quickly deposited all you clothes on a vacant shelf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe synthetic flesh felt cold to the touch, but so lifelike in texture. You turned the suit over to the back, noting the entrance that ran from the base of the neck to the buttocks. Your feet slip in with little effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiggling your toes, you marvel at how the smaller girl's frame stretched over your's. Bringing the hips into place, you slipped your manhood into an internal sheath connected to Akane's womanhood. 'at least I can go to the bathroom in this thing,' you thought with some relief, as getting out of this suit you figure would take some effort. You continue on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the arms, and with your newly encased arms you pushed her mounds into your bare chest, savoring the moment as they clung to you to become your new front. All the while you noticed you were shrinking a tiny bit with each tug and pull.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally came the Akane's head as you dove yours face into the sagging neck hole. After some minor struggle, you aligned the eyeholes, mouth, nostrils, and ears as best you can. Then pinching close the seam in the back a sudden pressure overtakes you. It was not painful, but certainly uncomfortable. A pleasantly hot sensation erupts throughout your body, and as it subsides you feel the slight coolness of the warehouse, and suddenly felt naked again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are now several heads shorter now. Approaching a mirror a few yards away, you feel the coolness of the concrete on your new feet as you walk. Gazing at the reflection in awe was Akane, who mirrored your every expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need clothes,\" you said in the tomboy's voice. You expected a change in voice, but confirmation of this change left Akane's face with a pleasantly surprised look. A rather cute expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst came the panties. Then tapping into Akane's knowledge allowed you to attach the bra with no difficulty. There were many clothes, but you decided on the classic Furinkan High school uniform, the autumn one with long white sleeves, and an apron like blue-ish top and matching long skirt with a bow at the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back to the mirror, you struck several Akane-like poses. Your favorite was an expression of pure rage, but that ridiculous over-the-top look all dissolved in a hearty fit of girlish laughter.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Boy Akane can be cute if she laughed some more,\" you noted with a chuckle. Exploring Akane's persona you noted her obvious insecurities and aspirations. Like all people she had her flaws, staring into her soul confirmed what you've known all along. She desperately loves Ranma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see what's in store,\" as you secured yourself in the dimensional transport machine and set the destination. It would take you to Ranma's world midway through the series. Brightness filled the interior, and consumed you. For a moment you saw streams plasma and streaky bits of matter that danced around you as everything descended into darkness. You opened your eyes...</span></div></div>",

The serene blue disturbed only by the airborne body of Ranma as it sailed to the apex before vanishing in a twinkle. Within seconds you take note of your new body and its surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huff...huff...huff...huff...\" you're trying hard to catch your breath. It must have taken a great deal of your energy to propel him that far. That and your body is obviously PO'ed and tense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the weight of a heavy mallet in your small hands. Surprisingly it was really easy hold, no doubt due to your new brute strength. Akane could be good home run hitter if she only had the hand-eye coordination, or even cared about baseball. Dropping the mallet, you let it fade off into hammer-space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking note of your tense body you begin to relax the muscles. The gnashing of your teeth stopped once you realize you were grinding involuntarily. Annoyed narrowed eyes opened wider into a more neutral expression. Your taunt face soften somewhat. Closing your eyes and taking a deep breath, you opened them once again, now your normal calm self. The process took a few seconds, as you now focused on your environment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is an unusually balmy afternoon and you relished the refreshing breeze on your slightly sweaty face, taking care to hold down your skirt so your panties are not exposed. It was not all that hard since the skirt is realistically long, unlike some uniforms in other series. Still it is a strong enough breeze to warrant the act. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'After all..there are some real perverts in this world. I need to protect my...her feminine dignity' you say to yourself. Sure it was not really your body, but you felt Akane deserved at least that muich respect. All the sensations of the artificial skin felt so real, it might as well be your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing your leather school bag on the ground you pick it up. Judging by the sun and the bag it was a little after school had ended. May be the two of you were walking home, or may be somewhere else. You are about to search Akane\u2019s memories when you felt a cool chill down your spine. So into the moment you almost failed to detect the strong hostile auras behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No doubt it's them. Now what to do?\" you say knowing full well who 'them' are without looking. The negative energy was there all along, and you feel reluctant to turn around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might as well get this over with,\" you take one more deep breath, before doing an about face into the glares of Shampoo, Ukyou, Kodachi, and...some other angry girl. 'May be a new character of the day?' you thought. Whatever the case they obviously saw what you did to Ranma and they want your blood. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You waste no time shedding your clothes, but took care laying them on an empty shelf. Now as naked as the suit you hold in your hands, you turn the floppy skin over to reveal a seam along the suit's spine. One by one you plunge your feet down the suit's leg holes and wiggled your body into position. To your surprise the little toes slipped into position on the first try. You give them a nice wiggle as you continue on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing the suit up to the waist you blush as you insert your manhood into a sleeve behind Kodachi's part. It felt tight but not too uncomfortable. Then comes the suit's arms which you pull over yours like long gloves. Again, like your feet all your fingers line up with the suit's digits on the first try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing your newly covered arms, you press the loose skin onto your abdomen, and did the same to the breasts, taking them to your chest. Now secure the deflated breasts now look fuller as you give them a nice squeeze with your finely manicured hands. No sensation or warmth, but they feel real enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you widen the neck opening and briskly tugged the psycho chick's face over your own. Unlike your hands and feet it takes some considerable time to align all the facial features. Walking up to a nearby mirror, you stare aghast at your reflection. A distorted figure with wrinkles all over the body is a pretty disturbing image. It looks like the suit is ready to split apart from the strain of your larger frame. Then you remember the seam was still open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some difficulty your pull the flesh colored zipper to the nape of your neck. In an instant you an intense, but comfortable heat consume your whole body. Then comes a strong constant pressure as you hear cracking and popping sounds. In the mirror you see your body receding in some areas and filling up in other parts. As the pressure goes to your face, you're force to close your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tension suddenly subsides as the cool room temperature of the warehouse hits your new body. Feeling beads of sweat on your forehead, you wipe them away before opening your eyes to an exact likeness of Kodachi in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you expected such a transformation, nothing could prepare you to be an anime character for the first time. The black haired girl in the mirror copies every surprise and wide eyed look on your face. She... no...You look really cute befuddled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping back to attention you walk back to the Kodachi section looking for clothes. Forgoing the lacy black lingerie, you put on a one piece green leotard with black trim. Normally you hate tight fitting clothes let alone spandex, but the feeling of it on your new skin now feels just right as you stretched it over your nude body. For being very form-fitting you note how the elastic fabric oddly conceals contours your naughty bits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your attention to the outer clothing you would wear. Kodachi\u2019s wardrobe is extensive, including some you never seen in the series, but you\u2019re partial to two outfits. There was her beautiful black kimono and her school uniform. After some debate you on impulse picked the school uniform. After all you can change clothes in the Ranma-verse later if you feel like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe St. Hebereke School for Girls uniform is a classic sailor fuku design. You note the long green-brown skirt that extends down to the knees as you slip it on. Then you don the white blouse top with short sleeves and a matching green-brown sailor collar. Taking a red ribbon from the shelf you loop it under your collar and tie it effortlessly, tapping into Kodachi\u2019s memories to find the right knotting. Finally you put on the white socks and tan shoes. You roll up one of the many streamer ribbons, and placed it in your skirt pocket. In the other pocket you stuff a compressed bag of black rose petals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow complete, you skip merrily down the length of the warehouse to the nearest dimensional machine. You note the gracefulness of your new body, and decide to test out your new-found athletic ability. On a whim you make a running jump up to the top of one of the costume shelves, and did a back-flip over to the next shelve landing with one hand. Tapping into Kodachi\u2019s muscle memory and skills is amazing. You go through a full series of gymnastic tricks en-route to the machine without breaking sweat. Using your streamer like a whip, you wrap the ribbon along a roof rafter and swung the remaining distance to the machines. You land gently on the floor before disengaging the ribbon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time enter the pod like device, after setting the series, time frame, and location you push the execute button. An intense bright light engulfs your body and a pleasantly warm sensation occurs. Darkness grows as a rush of refreshing air pounds your body, and you find yourself floating in space among streaming bright bits of matter. Everything faded to black before you involuntarily shut your eyes. You then notice the ambient sounds of nature, the smell of fresh air, and a gentle breeze on your skin. You\u2019ve made it to the Ranma universe, but what now? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly you open your eyes to find yourself\u2026</span></div></div>",

Dawn. Oh, you like Dawn alright! Ever since she appeared in the first episode of the newest Pok\u00e9mon series, you pretty much fell in love with her even though she's an anime character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to go for it, and you zip open the back of the Dawn suit after taking off your clothes. You think it is pretty small, but as soon as you step into her right leg, you find it can stretch almost indefinitely. You stick your left leg into hers and you pull her waist up to yours. After that, you stick your hands into her arms, and you then use your hands to pull her head and hair over yours. You stand upright, and your suit automatically seals itself and compresses itself, thereby shaping your body just like hers. After it is complete and you get dressed in her clothes, you find a machine that read 'Enter character's world' and 'Freeze time' next to two buttons. Do you want to go try out the Pok\u00e9mon world as Dawn, or would you like to stay here and explore your new body?</span></div></div>",

After a few more minutes of searching and searching you finally give up on your quest to put on the suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bet it doesn't work anyway...\" You say, kinda disheartened. Throwing the suit back at the rack, something crazy happens. Before the suit reaches the hook, it stops mid air and begins hovering the way a Latias would. It turns to face you, showing you the blank holes where bright blue eyes should be. The Pokemon hovers in the air for a moments as you stare at it, sweat falling down your face. This is completely freaky. The suit flies at you head first and collides with your chest. It isn't very painful but it brings a tingling sensation that radiates through your body. You look down just in time to see the last of the suit enter your body. As the suit vanishs you are thrown backwards with a heavy force. Flying back through the rows and rows of shelves you eventually hit ground and black out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck....\" Looking around you, you don't see rows of shelves anymore, you see a lush green forest like area. It is a beautiful place, one that seems all to familiar. Taking a quick step forward, you feel a rush of wind above you. Looking up you see the Latias suit heading straight towards you. You can't move! Latias pulls out of her dive at the last second, spins through the air and hovers in front of you. She puts one of her red hands out towards you as if she wants to hold your hand. Taking a chance you put one of your miraculously now movable arms out, to touch hers. As your hands connect, you feel a pulling drawing you into th suit, then you suddenly wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel cold, hard flooring beneath you. You are still in the warehouse, and you seem lighter. You can't feel your legs and your arms feel stronger. Putting 2 and 2 together you get 4, and man it is one heck of a 4. You are.... a.... girl.... a Pokemon.... a Latias? You can't talk but you can still think and you have one heck of a mind... you are a Psychic Dragon... You don't know what to think at this point. You have everything going on for you right now. You don't know what to do first, everything is so intense... but you can't very well do anything from your spot on the ground, so the first thing to do is to learn how to levitate... or is it?</span></div></div>",

You didn't want to catch a cold after all. Once that was done, you decided to look around. There were rows and rows of costumers, ranging from any kind of fiction you could think of. Turning a nearby light on, it really showed how much was really there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are all these here?\" You asked yourself, to no answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, you kept walking down, seeing if anything caught your eye. There were many costumes from famous anime and video games and such, so you had a wide range to look at. However, you accidentally slipped on a small rock, hitting your head hard on one rack, causing something to fall on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing your head, you looked at what fell on you. You looked up to see that the Pokemon section was above you, so you looked at what fell. It was a black blouse with a red skirt combo, and a pink hat that looked very familiar. Your eyes widened once your brain came to the right solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Serena's outfit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena was a new character to the series, and quite popular right off the bat. It actually revitalized a bit of your old interest for the series as a whole, but that was beside the point. What were you to do now? You had this costume, but what exactly were you to do? Try it on? You looked back up to where the clothes feel on you, seeing a body costume with Serena's hair on top. Your mind entertained the idea of putting it on, but wouldn't that be weird? Still, there was no one here, so you could do it without shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing with that option, you stripped your clothes off, bringing the body suit to you. You tried inserting your legs in, which oddly seemed to fit, despite how Serena was much younger than you were. Still, you took that as a sign and kept going, putting your hands through the arm sleeves. Putting your head inside and adjusting it, you reached down for the zipper, zipping it up as much as you could. Soon, it was down, and you had never felt more bizarre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I....AGH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, it felt like the suit came to life or something, as if crawling on your skin. The suit started suppressing on you, almost like a second skin. It especially pushed against your chest and groin, making them feel really tight. It started as discomfort, but soon grew into slight pain, causing you to fall to the ground, panting as you slowly felt them fade away. However, as they did, you saw light brown hair fly into your face, causing you to comb it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened?\" You immediately clasped your hands over your mouth, hearing the familiar voice of Haven Paschall instead of your own. You slowly forced yourself up, seeing what seemed to be small breasts on your chest. You blushed immediately when you saw them, as you pretty much knew what was between your legs by now. Even without the wind, it was pretty cold, so you immediately went over and grabbed her clothing. After getting on the panties and bra as best you could, on went the black blouse and red skirt. Following that were Serena's stockings and shoes, topped with her pink hat. Seeing a nearby mirror, you felt around you, and saw how real it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, I'm actually her.\" </span></div></div>",

You began to wonder if you should just get out of this costume and leave, maybe come back in the morning. Then again, your parents would like to know where you were going, so that probably won't work. What were you to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, seeing yourself in this body was a bit appealing. Not that you were a pervert or anything, but Serena was really cute. She was a quick favorite of yours from the show after all. The fact that there was a costume such as this still felt so unreal to you, yet it wasn't really bad. However, that still left you at the question of what you should do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to look around a bit more, maybe even find a better costume if you came across it. However, you didn't seem to be in the mood for changing even as you looked. Eventually, as you turned a corner, something caught your eye. It appeared to be some kind of machine, with a containment unit and some keypad in the front. As much as your sci-fi instincts were telling you to stay away, your curiosity was stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" You walked right over, looking at the computer in front. You knew some things about computers, but not so much about code and the like. There was an option there, saying \"Transfer?\" with a \"Yes/No\" option. What did this thing do? Well, since you had come this far, you might as well check all of it out. You pressed down on the \"Yes\" option, with several lines of code appearing with a message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Confirmed. Please step inside.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile obviously a computer voice, you looked around to see what it was talking about. Suddenly, you saw the containment unit open, just like in the movies. You shielded your eyes from the bright light, looking inside to see what it was. However, the very second your whole body entered, the door slammed shut, shocking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?! Hey, let me out!\" You banged your hands against the door, but nothing happened. You soon heard the voice again, apparently counting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"4......3......2.......1......Begin.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou braced for impact as best you could, but all you saw was light as you blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Morning*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea how long you were out, or really what just happened. Were you just in an underground warehouse, or did you just dream that up? Whatever it was, you suddenly felt warm sunlight falling on you, with something soft beneath you. However, as comfortable as it was, you suddenly felt pecking against your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fletchling!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, go away!\" You just waved your right arm, trying to get whatever it was away from you. However, that little voice soon made you stop. What did it just say? Your eyes slowly opened, soon seeing a red and black bird perched above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fletchling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What the heck?!\" Seeing the bird pokemon suddenly made you scramble a bit, causing you to see where you were. What you were in seemed to be like a girl's room, with pink coloring in many places. You slowly looked down, seeing a pair of pink pajamas. Getting a burst of speed, you ran over to a mirror on the other side of the room, seeing a honey-haired girl in her pajamas staring back at you. Still panicking, you rushed over to the window, seeing a world that looked straight out of an anime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh my gosh. Is this really happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving already used the pinching method to confirm it, you were truly inside the world of Pokemon. And as Serena to add on to that. This was all too surreal to you, and even now it was hard to believe. Hearing a little roar outside, you looked out the window, seeing a Rhyhorn right outside of a makeshift doghouse. A groaned look crossed your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, there's that too.\" Sighing, you figured that there was no getting around it. Problem was, you had no idea what Serena's routine was. Well, better start somewhere, so you decided on a shower. Trying as best as you could to be modest about it and maintain some sense of a normal morning, you grabbed the same clothes you knew Serena wore and went into her bathroom. Closing your eyes for some time, you tried taking a shower. It got a bit easier after a while, but it still felt weird as you washed yourself with Serena's shampoo. The hair was by far the hardest to handle. Guess there was something to everything your sister and step-sisters kept saying about hair. No more teasing them about that anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were done, you dried yourself off as best you could and got the clothes on. After getting on everything except the shoes, you tentatively went downstairs, familiarizing yourself with the house as you walked, until you heard a voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're finally up I see.\" It was Serena's mother, Grace, a famous Rhyhorn racer herself. To be honest, you weren't quite sure about it yourself. As someone who knew next to nothing about riding, you were more likely to break something. Anyway, Grace never seemed to notice anything wrong as you ate some breakfast with her. As you did, you began to wonder what day it was. Did Ash already make it to Kalos? Assuming you were really in the Pokemon world, than that had to happen soon. In fact, given how late Serena joined in the anime, what reason was there to wait this time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....mom?\" Boy did that just sound weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...gee how do I put this....I want to go on a journey.\" Wow, that was blunt. You mentally wanted to slap yourself for saying that. However, to your relief, Grace reacted much like in the anime, being very understanding of the whole thing. Where all parents in this world okay with kids (not even teenagers) going out by themselves? Anime logic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou seemed to be just running on adrenaline right now, hoping to get things in order. You packed whatever you thought would help, familiarizing yourself rather quickly. You happened to come across Serena's hats, picking out the pink one she normally wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was the saying? Pick out the opposite of what mom picks?\" You laughed a bit at the logic these girls used. Anyway, that aside, things went smoothly as you tried to act in character, saying good bye to Grace and Rhyhorn as you began riding out on Serena's bike. As least that you knew you could do that well. By the time the sun way high in the sky, you were riding off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, if my guess is correct, Lumiose City is the way to go. Hopefully that won't take too long.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, it was on.</span></div></div>",

Though to get there.....\" Getting all the Lumiose City from Vaniville Town wasn't exactly short. It involved traveling through Routes 1-4 as well as through Aquacorde Town, Santalune Forest, and then Santalune City. That was a long ride. Thank good for bikes, a thought that made you smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, since your destination was decided, you were riding again, seeing a flock of Fletching fly above you. The wide plains and mountains lined the distance, filling your face with awe. Despite how animated the world was (and it certainly did), there was this odd sense of realism, like it didn't feel fake at all. To be honest, this was a world you could get used to. Still, being a girl was going to take getting used to as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, that last thought brought a small blush to your cheeks. Part of what made Serena popular was the obvious shipping with Ash. Though, you actually liked it too, and the opportunity was now staring at you right in the face. However, you still thought like yourself. You were a boy coming into this world, so how could you pull off actually being a girl, including....seeing boys like that. It was a thought that made your head start to hurt. You weren't even sure if there was a way out of this world. You certainly hadn't seen any kind of notice that you could. If you were stuck as Serena, then you had to live her life as best you could. Perhaps some natural feelings would come to you as time went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, those were thoughts for later. You hadn't even met Ash yet, so thinking about how to handle romance was a little off for you. For now, you should just take the world in, seeing the sights. You had a ways to go after all. Along the way, Pokemon of all types jumped around, surprising you as you saw them in a new way for the first time. Still, it wasn't worth stopping for them. You didn't have a Pokemon or any Pokeballs for that matter, so it was a moot point. Putting that aside, you just continued on your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you stopped in Aquacode Town for some lunch, as you apparently had a good amount of money in your backpack. You certainly hoped that you could get some money like in the games, because you would need it. After you had a nice sandwich and drink to get yourself going again, you were off, heading into the Santalune Forest. You hadn't seen many forests back in your world, so seeing a Pokemon version had a very unique feel to it. Like in the game, you actually saw a Pikachu or two hopping around, but you still had nothing to catch one. You made a mental note to come back here for one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou actually met some people along the way, especially some trainers who wanted to show off some new Pokemon they caught. You didn't know the feeling yet, but you tried to be happy for them, explaining that you were on your way to getting your own Pokemon. The winding paths of the forest took quite a bit of time, and it was already near dark by the time you got out, nearing Santalune City. Luckily, as in the anime, Pokemon Centers had lodging, and Nurse Joy (seeing her for the first time) was happy to lend a room. That night, you slept comfortably in your pajamas, lightly laughing to yourself at how you somehow fit your pajamas, some clothes, and even folding up your bike to put in the backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Video game logic. These backpacks are like little voids.\" You laughed a bit before heading to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****The Next Day*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to wonder if Serena's body was just made for sleeping or something, because you woke up later than you normally do. Still, with a day's worth of experience, getting ready was no problem and you were able to get a nice breakfast. After thanking Nurse Joy for the hospitality, you got the bike out again and were off. You just hoped that you weren't already missing Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoute 4 was a straight shot to Lumiose City, but you saw the city for miles before you arrived, seeing the grand tower in the center of the city. You had never been to France in your world, so seeing the tower was truly amazing. However, sightseeing would have to wait. In the anime, Ash arrived by airplane, so you needed to find it. Luckily, as you entered the gate into Lumiose, there were maps everywhere, including to the airport. Seeing where it was, you mounted the bike again and were off. It amazed you how much mileage you were getting out of this thing in just a couple days. Dodging around some people, the airport was in sight, obviously a lot different than real world airports. However, something came to mind? How would you know if Ash already arrived? What if he was here and long gone? You sighed at the reality that this might have been just a wild goose chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Kalos region! Ash Ketchum is finally here!!\"</span></div></div>",

You and your sisters used to watch Pokemon growing up so you decide it might be fun to try her out. You take her off the rack and are suprised at how life-like the suit was, even down to how she styled her hair. You then look for an opening in the back and then proceed to put your legs in. Surprisingly the suit stretches so your legs fit inside. Next you stick you arms and torso in and finally you stick your head in and zip it up. The moment you fully zip the skinsuit up you feel the skinsuit tighten your body to fit inside, Next you feel your chest inflate making C-Cup breasts. Next you feel a sucking feeling fron your crotch as you watch as your penis gets sucked in transforming into a vagina finalizing your transformation. Worried about what just happened you reach for your back only to find your zipper was still there. Relieved, you then turn around to put some clothes on when a big machine catches your eye. You walk up to it and read the big label on it (Body Maker: make the skinsuit you wear your new body). Curious you step inside only for a door to close behind you. Then you feel a tingling sensation on your back, you then proceed to reach for your back only to discover that the zipper has disappeared. Next you feel your skin tingle as the skinsuit merges with your skin. After that the door opens and you walk out. As you where walking away you hear a \"Ding!\" followed by a \"Plop\" sound. You turn around to discover a hatch had plopped out a skin suit version of your old body. \"I think I'll just leave that there for now.\" You say as you walk away back to where you found the Jessie skinsuit . \"Well I better get dressed I don't want to be bare naked.\" You say. You then proceed to put on white pair of panties and bra with a red R on each cup. You then slip into her white miniskirt which was surprisingly tighter than you expected, next you put on her black midriff shirt and her white midriff shirt with a red R on the front, and finally you slip into her black opera length gloves and her black thigh high boots with a slight heel. After all that you attach her green earings and ponder what to do next.</span></div></div>",

A section of female suits from your favorite anime, Gurren Lagann! The one that attracts your attention is the Yoko costume from before the appearance of the anti-spirals and the temporary death of Lord Genome. The suit looks so soft and fleshy, and hanging next to it is the iconic flame bikini, booty shorts, and tight thigh-high socks that Yoko wears during that point in the show. The idea of being able to wear her skin is too good to pass up. You've always been a cosplayer, and have wondered what it would be like try female cosplaying, but you never have done it due to the weirdness of an obvious guy in tight clothing, plus, Yoko has to be the hottest red headed anime character out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab the suit and costume and quickly take off the clothes you are wearing. You find a seam along the back and begin to slip into the skin suit. You place your right and left legs in first and note how it feels like putting on a skin tight wetsuit. You then slide the suit up your waist as you fit your butt into the suit's. Next you slide your arms into their places and wiggle your fingers into the suit's fingers. The feeling is like putting on a long, tight glove. You pull the chest of the suit up to yours, and you notice that the seam is zipping itself up as you put more and more of the suit on. Last comes the head, you pull it on over your own like a mask, and align the face so that you can see out of the eye holes and the mouth overlaps your own. Suddenly it feels like the suit compresses and becomes tight upon your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOOOooooOOoo....\" You murmur noting your Yoko-like voice. The feeling soon subsides, and you feel as if this skin is now your own. You can feel your sense of touch, sight, and taste through the skin, eye holes, and mouth perfectly. You then turn to a mirror on your right and see a perfectly naked, but spot-on Yoko looking back at you. You look your body up and down as you strike a sexy pose for the mirror. It's all there... you look exactly like Yoko, as if she had come right out of the TV. You giggle in your new voice, and turn around to check the seam which is now only a slight crease along your spine. You turn back around and reach one hand up to your breast. As you caress it gently you note the softness of it as well as the sensation in your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMMmhhhmmm...\" You grin with Yoko's sexy face. \"This is just too perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you put on Yoko's clothes or stay naked and explore?</span></div></div>",

You giggle a little as you smoosh them together with your biceps and lean forward into the mirror. You then slip on her tight booty shorts and zip up the fly but leave the button undone. The white belt keeps in place as you clip it on. You then slip into her long pink socks, which feel silky soft on your long, hairless legs. You then zip up the boots, which hang loose around your ankles. You tie her white and red stripped scarf around your neck, and then finally, you finish by putting on her arm-length, leather gloves. When you're finally finished you look in the mirror and see a fully clothed Yoko starring back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then strike some sexy poses in her body. You bend forward and put your hands on your knees as you wink and giggle at the mirror. Your new cleavage hangs out gloriously. You then turn around and bend over and put your hands on your ass, feeling it's perfect shape and jiggle. You look at yourself in the mirror and flash another sexy wink. You then face forward and stand up straight. You lower your head and stick a finger on your lips in a sexy pouty way. You can't help but feel aroused wearing this suit and seeing Yoko's reflection performing every pose you've ever wanted to see her in. You then get the idea to go and grab your camera from home so you can save some photos of these poses for yourself and the Internet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you go and get the camera or stay in the warehouse?</span></div></div>",

Being a sexy anime girl is just too much fun!\" You say with Yoko's voice as you giggle again. \"My voice is so sexy too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get to James's house, and you see him watching TV through the lower story window. You walk up to the window and see him watching Gurren Lagann, primarily the hot spring episode. He's watching the part with Yoko and Kittan's sisters in the water over and over. You also notice he's starting to unzip his fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you ring the doorbell and mess with your friend or get back to the warehouse?</span></div></div>",

You hear what sounds like a muffled \"shit\" followed by a \"I'm coming!\" James opens the door and sees you as Yoko standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh inwardly at the sight of James' bug eyes and gaping mouth. You control yourself, after all you need to sufficiently trick James here. You then flash a shy, blushing, Yoko face at him and say \"I've noticed how much you find me attractive, James.\" James just stands there trying to form his mouth into words. \"How would like to play with the real me?\" You then flash the pouty pose from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this a dream?\" James finally manages to blubber out. He's like butter in your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me show how real I am James...\" You coo in Yoko's voice. You then take a step forward and plant a warm, wet kiss on James.

His arms reach down and grab your ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've always dreamed that something like this would happen.\" He goes in for another kiss, but this time you buckle as you start blurting out in laughter and break from his embrace leaving him with only air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep dreaming buddy, Yoko would never go for you even if she was real.\" You say while laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What's going on here!\" James says as anger slightly creeps into his voice and his blushing face looks embarassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me Anthony, man!

You have to admit, this is getting you rather turned on, too...Your eyes locked on the mirror, as the knowledge that *you're* absolutely in control here - Able to make Yoko do *all* kinds of nasty things - blossoms in your mind!

It's salty...musky...animal, somehow - But it's not all bad, as your full, pouty lips wrap around James' shaft. Your eyes squeeze shut, as you *suck* - The long, luscious slurrrrrppp echoing in your mind, as your tongue slides over the obscene member...the fullness of it quite taking your breath away! Your cheeks dimple...Drool trickling down onto your chin, as you go to work! Given that you're not a professional cocksucker, you can't avoid the scrape of your teeth - But your tongue's sliding all over the increasingly slippery member in a sloppy improvised blowjob, James' grunts of effort like music to your ears!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, you feel his pudgy fingers resting on the back of your head... \"<i>Suck ittttttt</i>~\" James groans, his fingers digging into your glossy red hair - And he pushes *down*, hard~!

Somehow, you manage to steal breaths around the shaft powering through layers of cartilage...It feels like it's stuck, as you suck and lick and moan for dear life! Each time he twitches, his cock slips a little deeper...Until his hairy balls are slapping up against your chin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooohhhhh *fuck* - I'm cumming, I'm cumming *so hard*...\" you hear a faraway voice groan - And then his balls draw up, your eyes widening in alarm...His hips rocking as he starts to fuck your mouth in earnest, to give Yoko the throat-pounding of her life! Thankfully, after years of kung-fu grip, his stamina isn't what it should be...Which is why it's only a moment before you feel the fat head...*flare* out, somehow...as long, ragged pulses of gooey spunk flood your mouth! Clutched to his crotch as you are, you can only *swallow*...The hot tide running down your spasming throat, into Yoko's flat belly! You barely taste it...But then there's another juicy squeak as his cock draws out, still dribbling and oozing cum - Until you're panting for air, your lips parted...James's cock (Now steaming with cum and your spit) hovering before you! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck, you're *so* hot,\" he breathes... \"Yoko, I <i>have</i> to fuck you now - Just let me do it once, dude!\"</span></div></div>",

James then takes off his clothes, finds the Nia suit's seam, which he opens, and then begins slipping into it. As he slips his lower half into the suit and aligns his waist, you notice the suit stretching, but not breaking, with his height. James then slides his arms and hands into place and pulls the chest to his own. \"The size still doesn't look right, in fact it looks a little stretched.\" James says, his head sticking out the back of the neck seam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to put the head on too, and get the face aligned.\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope this works.\" James says, lifting the formless Nia head up. He pulls the head on over his own and aligns the face. Suddenly he begins shrinking, and his body begins to take on a more Nia-like feminine shape. \"Whoa! This feels weird.\" James says, his voice becoming higher pitched with each word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the suit working.\" You say, reassuring him. When the shrinking has finished you are looking at a picture-perfect young, nude Nia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it work?\" James asks with Nia's voice. He surprised himself at first with the voice, but then smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile back saying \"Look for yourself.\" Gesturing to the mirror behind James. James turns around and checks out his new Nia self in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool!\" He chirps with Nia's voice. He giggles and tests the voice further as he gropes her budding bussom. \"I'm Princess Nia. I'm super cute and no one can resist me.\" James giggles again with Nia's voice. He then puts on her short dress, red heels, and jewelery, so that he looks just like her from the show. \"What now 'Yoko'?\" James asks smiling with Nia's cute face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you take some pictures, or do something else?</span></div></div>",

His arms pushing through her arms and giving them filling. He then pulls the torso up to his chest, and Hinata's breasts come into full size and view. \"Look at how big these things are!\" James says, his head sticking out of Hinata's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...

You leave the warehouse for the first time in days, although to the outside world, it has only been a few minutes since you had frozen time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing your enhanced abilities that come from being 1/4 dog demon, you quickly manage to get to Randy's house and ring the doorbell. The door opens and you see Randy on the other side, you prepare to explain what is going on, but he speaks before you can say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, who are you, and would you like to come in?\u201d He asks, blushing. You swear you almost see hearts in his eyes. You blink in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, you\u2019re not going to question that a girl who is part dog demon is at your door?\u201d You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, not really.\u201d He replies nonchalantly. He moves to the side and lets you in. \u201cSo, what\u2019s your name?\u201d He asks as you walk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Tsukiyomi.\u201d You reply. You look at him and he blushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Randy, nice to meet you.\u201d He replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I know who you are.\u201d You tell him. Now he looks a confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know me?\u201d He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFollow me and I\u2019ll show you.\u201d You reply, to which he nods. The two of you begin walking, and although you can go much faster, he wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with you, so it is pointless. You catch him glancing at you at times, but as soon as you look at him, he turns his head away with a blush. You soon enter the woods where the warehouse is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, my new friend Anthony lives on this land; do you think we should go get him?\u201d Randy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, by the time we get to where we\u2019re going he\u2019ll already be there.\u201d You reply, not telling him everything. You get to the entrance of the warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are we here? There\u2019s nothing here but a...\u201d He begins before you make the entrance appear. \u201c...never mind.\u201d The two of you enter and go down the stairs to find yourselves in the main part of the warehouse, with all of the suits surrounding you. \u201cWhat is this place?\u201d He asks with confusion while looking around, going down the isles. \u201cAnd where\u2019s Anthony, you said he\u2019d be here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd here I am.\u201d You reply, having stepped out of the suit, put your own clothes back on, and folded up the Tsukiyomi suit with and her clothes while he was looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnthony!\u201d Randy exclaims in surprise. He then looks around. \u201cWhere\u2019s Tsukiyomi?\u201d He asks. You then explain everything, while changing things back so that nobody thinks you were born Tsukiyomi. \u201cSo she never even existed...\u201d Randy says in a depressed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, but how would you like to become Tsukiyomi?\u201d You ask. His eyes light up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d love to!\u201d He exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go then.\u201d You reply as you hand him the Tsukiyomi suit and clothes, then you walk away so he can get undressed and into the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, you can turn around now!\u201d You hear Tsukiyomi\u2019s voice call out a few moments later. You turn around and see her looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you like being Tsukiyomi?\u201d You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt feels great! I wish I could stay her forever!\u201d Randy replies as she turns to the mirror to admire herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I can help with that.\u201d You reply. She looks at you questioningly, and you explain about the machine that can implant a suit as the actual body. Her eyes sparkle as they grow wide like in an anime, which makes sense since her parents are anime characters. You have her stand in front of the machine and set it to implant the suit. A few seconds later, you see a suit of Randy\u2019s original body appear. She goes to the suit and looks at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it really worked?\u201d She asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, just check for the opening if you need to see for yourself.\u201d You reply. She searches for the opening, trying to make it appear, but it isn\u2019t there. At this time, you have made it so that everyone, with the exception of Randy and yourself, thinks that Randy has always been Tsukiyomi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next</span></div></div>",

You knew that Randy would take the real Sango's place, but decided against telling him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking fast you replied, \"Um... The real Sango left on a personal matter after our group took a break hunting the shards. She still has her own business to do, and Inuyasha wants to get going,\" you explain while adjusting the machine's settings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can manage this trip without her, but I really enjoy the company of another girl. So it was too my luck the bone eater's well sent me to this warehouse, where I met Anthony. Hearing of your love of wolves, I thought you'd rather be Ayame.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSango blushed at the mention. \"You're right Kagome, I do like Ayame and perhaps I'll suit up as her later, but Sango edges her out. Best of all Sango is a martial artist, one of the few in the show,\" proclaimed 'Sango' with an air of bride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh course. Anthony told me you're a kick-boxer. Now just lie back, when I close the machine just push this button, and you'll be transported to our world. Oh, and some guidelines for you. If you die over there the suit will return you here safe and sound. So don't worry in a fight, have fun. Also, if you want to return back here, just visualize the warehouse and desire to be sent back and it shall be. You go first, and I'll follow, but remember no discussing this suit stuff over there, even with me. See you in your new life.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya!\" Sango/Randy said as you sealed him up. A Moment later he activated it and was gone. You laugh to yourself as set your plan into action. You're surprised Randy believed your story, normally he's a sharp sensible guy. Then again may be it was the incredible-ness of the situation that influenced him. Randy is likely talking to the real Kagome now, while you are still at the warehouse. You hope to get your other friends and family involved the mix, especially since many of them like anime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back to the Inuyasha section you quickly undress and shed the Kagome skin. Replacing it in it's capsule shelf, you hit a sterilize button as the shelf sealed shut and proceeded to clean the suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then turn your attention to the other girl suits. After much debate you decided on Kagura, the wind sorceress, and reluctant minion of Naraku. This suiting was much faster as you have more experience. This suit was a little closer to your height than Kagome's. Legs into legs, arms into arms as you thrust your dark brown hair and face into the suit's head. With a feel good stretches, and a resounding snap the mask portion was aligned to your features. Closing the seam along the burnt spider marking on the back, you felt the pressure and heat as before. As suit's resistance stop you re-open your eyes, walking to the mirror and staring back at you Kagura in all her glory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delightful...\" you say devilishly, noting your now naturally sultry voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back to the costume's shelf, you start to dress. As always, you turn to Kagura's memory, as her kimono ensemble consisted of several complex inner layers followed by the her trademark broad maroon striped outer robe, with thin circle designs. Tying the yellow sash, you then slip a a short sword into it on the left side of your waist. The finishing touches included the jade beaded earrings, and the all-important feathers in your hair. Last, but not least you grab the suit's fan.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTapping the folded fan against your forehead, you wonder what to do next. May be having friendly fight with Sango/Randy would fun, plus you always wanted to fly around. Then again, your sisters Mia and Anna were at home, may be they can join the two of you. Unlike Sarah, your other sisters love anime and video games. Both sympathize with the real Kagura from the show, and Anna in particular has a thing for the stoic Sesshomaru. While not an avid fan of the show Mia did enjoy it from time to time. In your mind you can imagine her as Shippo. However, knowing her athletic competitive side she may make an interesting Koga or Inuyasha. Possibilities are endless, but you don't wish to dwell any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You couldn\u2019t believe this discovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you got a good look around, you noticed all sorts of costumes hanging up in each rows. They had to be costumes. Why else would there be naked humans with lots of optional clothes. This had to be some cosplayer\u2019s secret storage. That person was probably rich and decided it was more exotic to have a hidden underground bunker. The more you looked around, the more suits you recognized. Some of the obvious ones stood out the most to an anime lover like yourself; Naruto, Pok\u00e9mon, Dragonball Z, etc. As you walked through the rows and looked around, you couldn\u2019t help notice the naked female costumes. They were incredibly detailed for mere costumes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally stopped when you came across one of your favorite series. To Aru Majutsu no Index and Kagaku no Railgun. That series always had a lot of girls, and, from the number of them hanging up, they might all be here. Your younger sister was in the middle of watching the Railgun anime back home, so that\u2019s probably why you stopped in front of the science side girls. You looked around and then felt the very lifelike skins of Mikoto, Kuroko, Uiharu, and Saten. However, one suit with certain larger proportions caught your eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShokuhou Misaki, Mikoto\u2019s rival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis suit was much more top heavy than the other girls around her age and her long blonde hair was a dead ringer. However, she could have been confused with other girls if her school uniform and spider web gloves and stockings weren\u2019t right next to her. Unable to resist, you reach up, unhook the costume, and examine it closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way it should fit, as she was a good number of inches shorter than you, but no one was around and the costume felt like it could stretch a bit. Quickly throwing off your clothes so they wouldn\u2019t get trapped under the costume, you opened the back and stuck a leg down the opening. You expect it to be tight and you could see the outline of your leg from the outside. What happened next you didn\u2019t expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leg you had in the costume began to shrink until it was roughly the size that a young girl should have. You almost fell over and leaned up against the shelves to steady yourself. You couldn\u2019t believe what was happening. Somehow the costume was turning you into the girl. Excitement over took you and you quickly shoved your other leg in, damn the consequences. The same thing happened and you were able to steady yourself upright, even if you were a little shorter already. Taking a deep breath, you began to pull the costume up and even slid your arms in. Soon, everything except your head was inside. The costume head hung down in front of you. The long blonde hair covering most of your naked front half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you felt the changes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour chest felt heavy, the tightness around your groin disappeared, and your arms and back shrunk. Taking a deep breath, you reached your now slender arms and pulled the costumes head over your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a second to get the eyeholes lined up, but once you did your scalp felt itchy for a second and then nothing. You couldn\u2019t even tell you were wearing anything. It felt like you were naked. Looking down at your now sexy, feminine body, you definitely were. Unable to resist, you reached up and used your new small slender hands to grope your large boobs. Pleasure flooded through your body and you knew they were real. Looking around, you saw a mirror accessory nearby and grabbed it. The reflection staring back at you was undoubtable Shokuhou. The gold colored eyes with stars in them were a dead giveaway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit!\u201d You cried out in her voice. The costume turned you into a perfect replica of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour voice did sound like the English dub, but that was just a small thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You also took a moment to reach down and feel the space between your legs.  A shiver ran down your spine as your fingers graved a smooth spot and you quickly removed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not yet.</i> You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking you really didn\u2019t want to stand here all day naked, you grabbed her school uniform from a hanger next to where you grabbed the skinsuit. Putting on her white lacy underwear was a challenge. The panties weren\u2019t. It was the bra. As a guy, you never had to put them on and it wasn\u2019t like you had experience doing it with other girls you knew. However, as you cursed under your breath while trying to get the straps connected on your back, you suddenly felt something like instinct guide you and allow you to easily snap the connectors in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked in surprise. Somehow, you could feel memories of Shokuhou in your head, from all her classes at Tokiwadai, to the time spent with other members of the cast and her clique. A smile formed on your lips as you accessed a memory in the girls\u2019 locker room. All those super attractive rich girls undressing in front of you.  How you would like to see that in first person. Shivering a little because of lack of clothes, you continued to get dressed. The next thing part of the attire was the dark skirt that was extremely short. That was easy enough to put on. Next, a white colored undershirt followed by Tokiwadai\u2019s tan vest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a little bit of extra time slowly pulling on Shokuhou\u2019s white spider web designed shoulder length gloves and stockings.  The material was incredible smooth and sent shivers down your spine as they dragged along your sensitive skin. Lastly, you put on her shoes and grabbed her purse. The purse was heavier than it looked, as it was full of remotes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Of course.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShokuhou Misaki was a level 5, mental manipulator. She was the most powerful mind controller in Academy City. She used the remotes as a channeling device of some kind to help focus her powers. You actually weren\u2019t sure if you could use her powers, even if your memories told you that you could. However, the only person nearby was yourself. If you wanted to test it, you would have to do it to yourself or leave the bunker. Speaking of leaving, you might not want to leave with the suit on, in case people recognize you. Taking a suit or two in a bag would probably be better. Of course, the warehouse was huge and there was a lot more to explore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you could find out more about this bunker?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as you really wanted to explore Shokuhou\u2019s body, you were more curious about this warehouse. Walking down the rows of costumes was almost an adventure in itself. Countless different anime, cartoons, video games, and book characters were present. Whoever designed this place went all out. The exploration took a little longer than normal, as you were getting use to your new body. You were top heavy without anything between your legs. Eventually, you reach the back of the warehouse and that\u2019s when you know you discovered the jackpot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne corner had a bed, dressers, and a small kitchen set up. Seems like someone could live here if they wanted. Judging by the dust, it hadn\u2019t been used in a long time. The other corner had rows of machines. One machine resembled a pod, another looked like a scanner. There was a large terminal and chair that looked promising, so you took a chance, sat down, and tried to log in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, there was no password.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way! This can\u2019t be real\u2026 but the suit actually works\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words escaped your lips as you started reading files. Apparently, the creator of this warehouse was into a lot more than making these skinsuits. The first panel you opened actually explained you could use the abilities of the character you were dressed as. You could also access memories, which you learned already, and personality so you could act like them. It was probably a good thing you didn\u2019t randomly try something on yourself. The second file showed that using the pod would allow you to transport yourself into the series of the character you were. That meant you could be Shokuhou in Academy City surrounded by girls. That appealed to you greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were also rules. Sadly, you couldn\u2019t wear a suit over another suit. It wouldn\u2019t stick. That meant you couldn\u2019t wear like four suits and swap around. You would have to carry the extras. Second, you had to be the opposite gender of the suit. You couldn\u2019t wear a male suit. However, the scanner would allow you to turn your body into a suit and have your current costume become your real body. That both scared and excited you. You could be anyone you wanted permanently. In their world or yours. There were also files about creating male suits, but that would require wearing a female suit and getting pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was even an option about alternating reality using the console. It would make everyone in your world believe you were always that person, yet without powers. If you were a more evil person, you could probably take over the world with Shokuhou\u2019s mind control. As you weren\u2019t like that, the most you could see is having some fun, maybe be a little mean, but no one would get hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were three main options that appealed to you. The first was going into the anime as Shokuhou and mess around a bit to get the hang of trying things out. The second was to alter reality to make everyone thing you have always had this form and have some fun that way. Lastly, you could also switch costumes before trying out the machine. Maybe there was a character in the Index or Railgun series you would want to try out first.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rather than mess around in the real world, you figured it would be more fun to actually enter the anime world for To Aru Majutsu no Index and Kagaku no Railgun. At least for a bit. It seemed like it would be easy to return. Looking over what to do, the console was pretty user friendly. You decided not to alter your age or interfere with the actual story. As much as you wanted to have fun with all of Shokuhou\u2019s mental abilities, you still liked the series and wanted to keep the main line in check. It would be something like an alternate universe you see in fanfictions so much. Taking a deep breath, you set the device and climbed into the pod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a minute you panicked, before light began to flood through your eyelids. Your eyes snap open and you find yourself sitting at a table in your room. A textbook is open in front of you among with a fresh cup of hot tea. Looking around, you were definitely not in the warehouse. The room was much more feminine. The bed had gold and white silk sheets and you recognized the decorative wallpaper of Tokiwadai Middle School. A desk sat in the corner, with everything on top neatly organized. You hopped to your feet, boobs bouncing, and looked around in amazement. You were by the window and glanced outside. Girls were walking in and out of the dorm\u2019s grounds. Some you recognized, some you did not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock on the door caused you to turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome in.\u201d You say, letting Shokuhou\u2019s personality and memories guide you. This skill would make blending in a lot easier. The door opened and a girl stepped in. She was beautiful with a slender body frame, but unfortunately had a small bust size. Her long platinum blonde hair was in ringlet curls and her eyes of the same color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/i3oAoR1TS1VnrMEK9\" target=\"_blank\">https://images.app.goo.gl/i3oAoR1TS1VnrM...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer name was Hokaze Junko. You didn\u2019t even need Shokuhou\u2019s memories to recognize her. She was a side character but recently got her own spinoff. She was equivalent to being second in command of Shokuhou\u2019s clique. Very devoted to her and would always go out of her way to assist Shokuhou. She was also very kind, if not a bit na\u00efve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to bother you, Queen.\u201d Hokaze said and bowed before closing the door behind her. Queen was another title Shokuhou was called besides Mental Out. \u201cI wanted to inform you personally about the tea party you wished to have this afternoon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh?\u201d It wasn\u2019t like you really cared about stuff like tea parties, but Shokuhou did and liked to keep up appearance. \u201cAnd how did that go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe had to change the venue due to a conflict,\u201d Hokaze continued, sounding apologetic. \u201cBut the new accommodation is ranked quite highly and they are famous for deserts.\u201d You felt Shokuhou\u2019s personality jump at this. She was always a huge fan of sweets. \u201cPlease watch how many you eat,\u201d she pleaded and you raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou need to watch your perfect figure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled kindly at her, which made her blush, but you were quickly thinking about what to do. Shokuhou would normally go somewhere she wanted to and send members of her clique on errands for her. If you wanted to experience your new life here, that would be the way to go. The next idea would be to practice your mind controlling abilities. Maybe do something\u2026 devious while it\u2019s just the two of you. Perhaps something or someone catches your eye out the window?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Hokaze chatted mildly about some possible options for today\u2019s schedule, you merely nodded and made a few non-committal responses while glancing outside. Girl talk wasn\u2019t really your thing. You were a teenage boy and there were other things you were interested in. A hot girl in front of you was one thing, but you were now surrounded by them. As your gaze traveled out the window, two girls caught your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/mKpDLGR97WExBif86\" target=\"_blank\">https://images.app.goo.gl/mKpDLGR97WExBi...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened slightly as you saw two of the most popular characters of the To Aru Majutsu no Index and Kagaku no Railgun universe. The girl with short brown hair was Misaka Mikoto, the main female lead of Index and the main character of Railgun. She was a powerful electromaster and the rank 3, level 5, so she technically was higher than Shokuhou. Mental abilities didn\u2019t work on her, as her passive electric field prevented mental signals from reaching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl with tawny colored hair in pigtails was Shirai Kuroko, a level 4 teleporter and Mikoto\u2019s roommate. She was a year younger, but there were special circumstances. They appeared to be arguing. It was impossible to hear from the second story window at this distance, but you had an idea. Mikoto may be immune to your powers, but Kuroko was not. You reached into your purse and pulled out a remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Hokaze asked, noticing your action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Crap.</i> You forgot about her for a moment. <i>Well, might as well do this first.</i> You pointed the remote at her and let Shokuhou\u2019s memories guide you. Hokaze stood up straight and froze. Stars appeared in her eyes, an indication she was under your control. Your eyes widened and a devious grin appeared on your face. <i>It works! This is awesome! Man, the guys back home are going to be so jealous. They would kill to be able to control girls. Maybe I\u2019ll show them the bunker one day\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering what you were going to do, you turned your attention back to Shirai and Mikoto. You targeted Shirai with your remote. It wasn\u2019t going to be mind control this time, but mind reading. You watched them arguing, while healing their voices in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t I come?\u201d Shirai asked, almost pleadingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know why.\u201d Mikoto rolled her eyes. \u201cListen, you know I have to do this monthly testing and I have to go alone. They don\u2019t let non related people into this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.\u201d Shirai kicked the ground. Level 5s were valuable research espers to the city. All espers were technically, but level 5s were the strongest and there were only seven of them total. Technology was developed based on information derived from their abilities and how they worked. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure if you asked, they wouldn\u2019t mind letting me at least wait there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know they won\u2019t,\u201d Mikoto replied. \u201cThey would just tell you to leave. Our Dorm Manager already knows I\u2019m going to be late tonight.\u201d Her gaze softened. \u201cLike always, I\u2019ll tell you all about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPromise?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPromise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey hugged and Mikoto headed off while Shirai watched after her until she was out of sight. Once Mikoto was gone, Shirai entered the dorm grounds. She said hi to a few people, but didn\u2019t really search anyone out. You rubbed your chin and thought about what to do.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It didn\u2019t take very long for you to hear a knocking on your door. With Hokaze still frozen, you stood up and opened it. Shirai was standing in front of you, stars in her eyes too. You stepped back and let her in. Locking the door behind you, you watched Shirai walk forward and stand next to Hokaze and freeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so cool.\u201d You muttered, enjoying the sweet sound of Shokuhou\u2019s voice. \u201cI\u2019ve seen Shokuhou use this in the anime, but seeing it up close is completely different. You two, step back into the middle of the room.\u201d The last line was an order as you clicked a remote. In unison, Shirai and Hokaze marched until they were side by side in the middle of the room, unobstructed. \u201cThey will really do anything? Drop down and give me twenty pushups!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn cue, both girls fell to their hands and feet and began performing. Shirai finished first and stood back up straight. She was part of the student law enforcement organization Judgment, so she was probably a little physically fitter than Hokaze. Once she was done, you walked around the two of them, examining them closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you hear me?\u201d You ask, waving your hand in front of their faces without using your powers. Neither of them blinked. They just stood straight ahead. \u201cGuess not.\u201d Unable to resist, you reached out a hand toward each one of them and felt their chests. Shirai didn\u2019t really have any, but you felt a slight bump and Hokaze\u2019s were small, but they were there. You flinched, but neither of them reacted at all. \u201cThis mind control power is amazing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slapped both of their butts and nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh. How about you two pose for me like mannequins?\u201d You suggest, wanting to see what happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHokaze spread her legs out, put a hand behind her head, and a hand on her hip. Shirai leaned forward, put a finger in her mouth seductively, and the other behind her. You never specified which pose they had to do. They just chose one reflecting their personality. With so much power at your fingertips, what would you do now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Seriously, what kind of teenage boy wouldn\u2019t give in to this temptation?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down on the bed and one hand began to make its way between your legs. It couldn\u2019t be helped. If you were in your body, there was no doubt you would be furiously masturbating. You still felt aroused, just in a different way. Rather than having external genitals, the heat and pleasure was coming from within your new slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, ladies.\u201d You suggest and click the remote. \u201cHow about you take off your shirts?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls began to take off their uniforms and throw them on the ground, before doing the same to their white undershirt. Shirai had a light pink bra, which really didn\u2019t make much sense to you. She didn\u2019t have anything to really support. Hokaze had a lilac bra and her small breasts were a little more prominent. At the sight, your hand reached down under your skirt and rubbed the outside of your panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou always wondered if Shokuhou ever did erotic stuff with her clique. Searching her memories, you found she teased them a bit sometimes and many of the girls were easily flustered, but none of them were really attracted to other girls. With your mind control, you could change that if you wanted to, but there was no reason to do so. If you wanted them to like you, you just make them worship you even more than they did already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left Shirai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take much to notice she was indeed into girls. More specifically, Mikoto. Shirai would keep trying to get her to love her back, but so far has never worked. You smiled as you looked at her blank face, standing before you shirtless. Suddenly, you had an idea. Knowing your schedule for the day was important if you wanted to keep up appearances, but as your hand kept rubbing your slit through your panties, you really need relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHokaze.\u201d You take a deep breath and click the remote. \u201cAs long as you are in this room, nothing that happens is considered strange. You will follow all my orders without question and anything anyone else does here is completely normal.\u201d You hoped that would work and then turned your attention to Shirai. \u201cShirai, you are to imagine I\u2019m Misaka and no one else is in the room. If I talk to anyone else, you won\u2019t register it at all. I have just given you permission to relieve me, but you can only use your tongue. So get to work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart beat quickly at your words, but you really wanted to try it. This world couldn\u2019t be real, so having a little erotic pleasure wouldn\u2019t hurt? Right? You finally released the freeze command on both girls and prepared for what would happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, my Queen-\u2026\u201d Hokaze started to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnee-sama!\u201d Kuroko interrupted and you flinched, hoping the people in the rooms next to yours were out. You didn\u2019t expect her to be that loud. \u201cAt last you understand my love!\u201d Before you could react, Kuroko dove between your legs and pulled your white panties down to your ankles before tossing them off into the distance. Taking only a brief moment to sniff and sigh like she was in heaven, she buried her mouth into your slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAH!\u201d You gasped, as Kuroko\u2019s tongue worked its way into your vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two are so close.\u201d Hokaze commented, smiling and putting a hand on her cheek. She didn\u2019t register being shirtless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 like to\u2026 keep contact\u2026 with Misaka\u2019s\u2026ah\u2026 friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to talk as Kuroko worked her tongue in ways you didn\u2019t expect. You imagined her licking and feeling waves of pleasure, but she was darting her tongue in and out, hitting all the right places. Sharp shocks were coursing through you as Kuroko ignored Hokaze and worked your clit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo the\u2026 itinerary for today?\u201d You asked, trying to hold back the buildup you were beginning to feel between your legs. If you were stiff yourself in your old body, you would have cum already. A gasp escaped your lips before she answered as Kuroko found an extra sensitive spot. Noticing this, Kuroko focused there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst, we need to stop and pick up some new summer outfits,\u201d Hokaze stated. \u201cWe just learned the new designs were out. Several members of your clique will be joining is. Afterwards, before our weekly brainstorming session to focus on the upcoming school events, we will have a short break for tea. Then finally, we have reservations at your favorite restaurant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were only half listening as Kuroko finally broke you. Any control you had over your nether region was lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAHHH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt yourself cum into Kuroko\u2019 waiting mouth. Once you finished, you started breathing heavily and fall back on the bed as Kuroko finally separated from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow was it?\u201d She asked. \u201cDid you enjoy it, Onee-sama?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Go ahead.\u201d As she began to put her shirt back on, you walked up and ran your hand along her butt. She shivered, but continued to get dressed. You smiled and turned to Shirai. \u201cShirai, time to return to normal, but you have the desire to hang out with my clique today while waiting for Misaka. After you get dressed, of course.\u201d You clicked a remote and Shirai suddenly popped back to life, shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for inviting me, Shokuhou-san.\u201d Kuroko said. She quickly threw on her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was my pleasure.\u201d You respond, letting Shokuhou\u2019s manners accentuate your words. You might have to get used to it. \u201cWell, let us not keep the others waiting. That would be quite rude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left the dorm with both girls. On the way down, you noticed a few other girls whispering about how Shirai was with you, but most people didn\u2019t care. She couldn\u2019t hang out with Misaka every minute of the day, no matter how much she wanted to. As they made their way downtown, taking the bus because Shokuhou was not a physically active girl, they arrived at the mall. It was one of those super expensive malls that only celebrities would go to. You would never step foot into one of these in your entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese girls were all quite wealthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, you see several other girls in Tokiwadai uniforms and you head over to meet them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You, Hokaze, Shirai and the others girls of Shokuhou\u2019s clique entered the mall. It was your first time in such an environment, but luckily you could relax mentally and let Shokuhou\u2019s personality take over. It seems she had done research and already knew which stores to visit. You were used to normal malls, not high class ones. When your group entered, you were met by an attractive saleswoman who spent the entire time with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t usually a big fan of shopping and trying on clothes, but by letting Shokuhou\u2019s personality take over a little, it was more fun, not counting the fact you had a female body and all the clothes were high class outfits a guy would never be able to wear. The clothes were also manually configured to meet you exact specifications, rather than trying to find one with the right measurements. The girls kept complimenting you and you guessed even if you wore a trash bag, they would think it\u2019s the greatest thing in the world if it was on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left without any bags of clothes. These stores would adjust the clothes based on their measurements and ship them straight to your dorm, rather than force you to take them through the dirty city. The girls seemed happy and were chatting among themselves and to you about school, friends, rumors, etc. You all boarded the bus and took your seats, still talking. Naturally, the bus you entered was one of the elite ones that cost more. Normal students would avoid these. The windows were darkened from one side so people outside wouldn\u2019t gawk at you and allow privacy. Besides you\u2019re group, there were only a handful of other students up front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, about five minutes later the bus made a stop and around five brutish looking guys got on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like we got lucky today,\u201d one of them said to the others. \u201cLook at those babes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDare you to ask one out,\u201d other said, elbowing one guy next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCause you\u2019re too scared?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of your group ignored them, but Shirai watched them with her eyes narrowed. She was too used to guys trying to flirt with Mikoto that she wasn\u2019t as na\u00efve as the other girls. She knew where this was heading. However, reading Shokuhou\u2019s memories, things could get ugly if they addressed you without respect. Hokaze specifically was very protective against strangers forcing themselves toward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tapped your leg and thought about what to do. Naturally, using your powers to force the guys to leave your group alone was the easiest way out. If you didn\u2019t want to do anything, you could just let events play out. Still, while they were a little more thuggish looking, you couldn\u2019t always judge people based on their appearance. You know how tough it is for guys to ask out girls. Their talk could just be bravado and you remember the few times you asked out girls and got rejected. It hurt. Maybe you could help them a little in the private bus?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You smiled at this, understanding it completely. However, while none of them were part of a gang, there were always ones that tended to lead a group and someone who always followed. The outcome was obvious, even if you could only see the thoughts going through their minds. The follower was going to get pressured into coming back and asking a girl out or something similar. He would get rejected and then the others would laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou actually felt sorry for him because you understood the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes twinkling as an amusing thought cross your mind, you made the rest of the bus obvious to what you were going to do except for the boys\u2019 group and your group. That was a lot easier than controlling everyone at once. Shokuhou was skilled in doing so, but you were still somewhat new to this. Best to limit the number of people. You then set up a few triggers in the minds of your companion and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t have to wait long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d The youngest member of that group was kind of thin and definitely the shortest of them. He was standing in front of the girls and was looking extremely nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we help you?\u201d Hokaze asked, her head tilting to the side ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just\u2026 err\u2026\u201d His eyes darted back and you noticed his friends were watching but laughing all the same at his predicament. The smile on your face grew as you knew what was about to happen. \u201cAre any of you single and like to go out with me?\u201d His ears were turning bright red and that poor kid looked like he was about to pass out right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silence passed as his words sunk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Hokaze grabbed his hand and pulled him into her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you just so brave,\u201d Hokaze cooed. \u201cI love courageous gentlemen like you. Isn\u2019t he quite a catch, girls?\u201d She addressed the rest of the group, who quickly agreed and surrounded the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t even have to read to boys mind to know what was happening. He was completely in shock that the girls were all over him for simply asking a question. Not only that, his head was in the chest of one of them. There was no reason for him to try to move, even if he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for his friends, they had quickly stopped laughing. You made a quick order to them not to get involved and just sit back and watch the kid they pushed into doing something embarrassing excel at his task. He was sure to be hailed as a hero, if you let them remember everything. Instead, you turn to Shirai, who was the only girl not fawning over the boy. You decided to keep her by your side. You simply adjusted her views on socially acceptable norms on the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was quite brave to approach us all.\u201d You comment to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHis friends pushed him into it,\u201d Shirai replied. \u201cIt\u2019s just lucky your clique likes people like him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucky\u2026 yes.\u201d You lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat back as the bus ride continued, only having to use your ability on new people entering the bus. Bored, you pushed Shirai to give you a foot message and she quickly became all too happy to do so. So now, while you did your good deed of helping a boy gain confidence, you could relax while being pampered. This was your first foot message ever and you were surprised how nice it felt. All that was left while you relaxed was to decide what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the bus stopped, you could modified everyone to forget what happened except for the boys. All they would remember was the kid managed to make friends with a bunch of cute girls. That should raise his social standing and you could move on to this \u2018weekly brainstorming session.\u2019 This was really just a chance for your clique to share information. You could maybe push this bus situation further. After all, this world had to be some kind of virtually reality, right? It wouldn\u2019t have any lasting effects. You entered a pod and all that. Maybe it was time these spoiled rich girls had a little one on one with the boys. They would just forget it all at the end while you had some real life adult entertainment. You could also decide to do something else once you got off the bus. The girls would follow your decision.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The only thing you allowed the guys to remember is after you all parted ways is that they would remember that one kid managed to flirt with a group of attractive girls. They wouldn\u2019t even remember which school they were from. That was sure to get him some points among his peers and hopefully help him with confidence. You smiled to yourself, glad of your good deed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the bus neared your stop, you had Shirai stop massaging your feet and sit back down. Your group eventually got off and entered the school grounds. They had reserved a large classroom for your group this weekend and you saw it was already full of girls. Dozens of them, including the group that traveled with you, were there. You began to realize just how big Shokuhou\u2019s clique really was. Once you arrived, and finished getting adored, you sat down and everyone formed a semi-circle around you. It was only then that Hokaze stood up and addressed the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the first time in months we were all able to gather.\u201d She looked around. \u201cI hope everyone has been doing well in both their studies and their assignments. Shall we start off with the minutes of our last meeting for those who were unable to attend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is boring,\u201d Shirai muttered, only a few minutes in. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to head out, Shokuhou.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t wrong. You felt your attention wane too. The girls were mostly talking about school and future activities of their group, including a few field trips along with more shopping trips. The amount of clothes girls would buy astounded you sometimes. You suppose you could just withdraw into your mind and let Shokuhou\u2019s personality take over. It would at least feel entertaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, an idea suddenly occurred to you. Shokuhou wasn\u2019t in charge anymore, you were. You could change the direction of what her clique did. Remembering your feelings back on the bus, maybe you could take over the school\u2026 and maybe more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you did have some fun. You could head back to your world to do something else. Maybe try a new suit.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You didn\u2019t need any distractions or for someone to leave. Thinking about how to go about this, you started changing their minds. Shirai was next to you, but you had special plans for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you did was make them even more loyal and devoted to you. You could do just about anything to them and they would accept it. If you walked up to one of them and slapped them, they would think they deserved it and work harder to please you. The next objective was changing the goal of this clique. For now, they were extending their influence, but it wasn\u2019t to rule. You modified everyone\u2019s desires to have Shokuhou rule everyone and everything, even if mental manipulation was involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you turned to Shirai and modified her mind. First, you changed her devotion from Mikoto to you. Shirai was, in all tense and purposes, in love with you. However, she was also loyal and now an amazing actor. Her job was to get near Mikoto and discover a way to prevent her from stopping your mind manipulation ability. You ran a hand across her cheek and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone shook their heads as their consciousness returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026 so now that the previous meeting minutes are out of the way,\u201d Hokaze continued. \u201cLet us continue our discussion on how to deal with Misaka-san. As you all know, she\u2019s currently the only individual in Tokiwadai capable of resisting the Queen\u2019s ability.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven when sleeping, she still emits electromagnetic waves,\u201d Shirai explained. \u201cTrying to implant commands while she\u2019s unconscious will not work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about devices that could disrupt her AIM field and prevent her ability?\u201d One girl with black pigtails asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe range would be minimal,\u201d Hokaze answered. \u201cPlus, it wouldn\u2019t negate her powers completely.\u201d She tapped the desk in front of her with a finger. \u201cWhile she\u2019s the only one in Tokiwadai, there are other people who have abilities that can prevent the Queen from bestowing her wisdom upon them. We need to come up with a plan that would work on the majority of resisters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are rumors of different drugs that suppress abilities,\u201d Shirai said. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking into them as part of Judgment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think it will make Misaka-san susceptible to the Queen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirai shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo with that.\u201d You nodded at her. \u201cWe must try all possible leads. Good job in taking the initiative.\u201d You reached over and patted her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, Queen!\u201d Shirai gasped excitedly and some of the other girls looked jealous. \u201cYou know I\u2019ll do anything for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.\u201d You smiled at her. \u201cAnd you have one of the hardest jobs. Convincing Misaka-san that you\u2019re her ally. You have done well.\u201d Shirai swooned under your praise and the others began to compare and suggest ideas, giving you time to decide your next course of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was as good as time as ever to head back to the real world for a bit. It would give you time to think about how to progress your adventure here. Think of it like a save point in a game before a difficult decision. Of course, you could continue in this reality to see how your devious plan comes together. Then you always have the option to scrap this route and do something else.

Everything up to now has worked, so why should you doubt it now? The reality change should have affected his home, so the only thing he packed up was the purse with his remotes. As you reached the door leading outside, you took a deep breath and stepped through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the position of the sun, it hadn\u2019t been very long since you entered.

Sarah, Anthony\u2019s 17 year old stepsister stepped out. She was pretty attractive and her hair was dyed a light pink. She changed it constantly depending what was considered in.  \u201cMom and dad called saying they wouldn\u2019t be home until after midnight. So we have to make supper ourselves. We decided it was your turn, Misaki.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Misaki?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was Shokuhou\u2019s first name you realized. In America, people tended to referred to each other by first names, rather than last names like in Japan.

How was it decided?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMajority rules,\u201d Sarah replied, smirking and flipping her hair back. \u201cDon\u2019t be a baby. Mom left a lasagna in the fridge and all you have to do is put it in the oven.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you at least start preheating it?\u201d You asked exasperatedly. It really wasn\u2019t a big deal. Being from a big family, the older kids usually cooked when their mom and dad was busy or tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops?\u201d Sarah shrugged. \u201cI had no idea when you would get back\u2026 from whatever you were doing.

I bet you\u2019re tired. How about I make it and you go and rest?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like the sound of that.\u201d You nodded at her. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to make extra vegetables. Zoey and Andy have been hiding theirs and they really need them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d She turned and headed to the kitchen while you headed up stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I love Shokuhou\u2019s power.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reached the top, a familiar face greeted you a moment before embracing you in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMisaki!\u201d Zoey cried, embracing him in a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, squirt.\u201d You reply affectionately. It seemed like your 10 year old step sister still admired you. She was in a cute pink shirt with a white skirt. Her hair was still in pigtails. \u201cWhat have you been up to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrying to beat Andy at video games.\u201d She huffed. \u201cHe keeps winning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, he has played them longer than you.\u201d You glanced into Andy\u2019s room as saw your 13 year old brother sitting at his computer playing a game like usual. \u201cYou\u2019ll beat him one day. I believe in you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the support. You\u2019re the best big sister ever!\u201d Zoey told him and hugged him tightly again, her head pressing right into his breasts. You then pushed her toward her room as you headed to yours. On the way, you passed your twin sister, well formally twin sister, Mia. Her hair was dyed purple like her favorite Fire Emblem character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy do you sisters like to dye their hair so much?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFind anything cool out in the woods?\u201d She asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026 maybe?\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure if he wanted to share the bunker with anyone until he thought about his next course of action. \u201cThere\u2019s a couple\u2026 caves nearby I want to see if they actually go anywhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe careful.\u201d Mia warned. \u201cDon\u2019t get lost or break your leg.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d You promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last room you passed before reaching yours was your 15 year old step sister Anna. She had just joined the swim team and was probably resting from weekend practice. She was lying in her bead reading with headphones on. You decided it was best to just leave her be and reached your room. Technically, you had other members of your family, but they were living with your mother or at college. You currently lived with your dad and stepmom. You reached your room, stepped inside, and gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnything relating to you being a boy was gone. The decoration was now a lot more girly, focusing on pink and white. Your bed had silk sheets and there were no pictures of rock bands, just boybands. Your clothes were neatly folded in your dresser, which considered of mostly skirts and female shirts. Your closet was organized and several dressed hung up, while countless pairs of shoes littered the bottom. You did have a game console and a computer here, but you had a feeling the games would be a lot different than what you were used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit on the bed and ponder what to do next. It was Sunday evening so there was only a little bit of time left before school.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your uniform was a little hot and walking back had made you sweaty. You undressed slowly and eventually were only in your white lacy underwear, along with the white gloves and stockings. Smiling to yourself, you grabbed your boobs and bounced them a couple times looking at your reflection. The door to your room was locked, so you decided you could stay in just your underwear for a bit. If anyone saw you, it only took a quick change to their mind to make them forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spent a while going through all your belongings in greater detail. The few books you had were replaced by romance novels, though your anime collection was mostly untouched. Your computer\u2019s browsing history had a lot of anime sites, but everything else was different. You noticed a lot more clothing store websites saved in your favorites.  Most of your games had changed too, though it was mostly just getting rid of the first person shooters for role playing games. Nothing big, just different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a couple anime figures and posters from a few conventions you went to. They had remained the same. While this world made you more girly, it seems a lot of your interests stayed the same. You found some pictures and started browsing them. You recognized them as your friends at the convention and you were there, just as Shokuhou. You laughed seeing an extremely hot girl like her surrounded by a bunch of what people would call nerds and geeks while acting like them. There was also a picture of a couple years ago when you scored the winning goal in a soccer game. This time, it was you as Shokuhou on a girls\u2019 team. You chuckled seeing how flat chested she was at that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching for the next desk drawer, you froze when you glimpsed the content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright pink sparkly dildo laid in plain sight. You closed the door immediately and felt your face grow warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess girls do have those.\u201d You muttered, realizing you were of age. Deciding you wanted to take your mind off that, you continued to go through what toys remained. You were glad that, while you liked pink, your hobbies weren\u2019t completely girly. You still had the drone you only flew like twice before storing it away. \u201cHeh. I guess I\u2019m the same in every reality.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSupper\u2019s ready!\u201d Sarah\u2019s voice range out from the kitchen.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few moments later, you found yourself at the dinner table with Sarah, Anna, Andy, Zoey, and Mia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Sarah started serving the lasagna to everyone, you took your seat and watched everyone closely, highly amused. You were only in your underwear, which consisted of just your white bra and panties. According to everyone else, this was completely natural, because you tweaked their minds a bit to accept it. You also made it so they wouldn\u2019t notice the remote you brought with you. It\u2019s not like you hated your family, the opposite really. Sure, Sarah was kind of mean sometimes, but you loved them. It was just the power of mind control was too much to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cBe grateful I was nice enough to make supper,\u201d Sarah told you before sitting down and grabbing a napkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d You replied, smiling to yourself. You watched eagerly as Sarah reached forward and grabbed her piece of lasagna with her hand, rather than using her fork and knife. You made it so that she didn\u2019t use utensils. Knowing Sarah was usually a very clean eater, it was hilarious to watch her bite into her, getting sauce all over her face. \u201cYou started to dig in and your eyes swiveled around to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, like, Emily was all like, you should be a cheerleader, and I was like, I know right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person talking was your former twin sister Mia. You tweaked her to talk like one of those stereotypical ditzy cheerleaders. What was funny about that was Mia hated cheerleaders. Capitalizing on this, you made her think she was friends with all the cheerleaders too and was going to join them. The person she was talking to was Anna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoof!\u201d Anna replied. Normally when she talked, she always seemed to giggle. What you did was have her talk as if she was a dog. Each woof or bark was a much lower pitch than her normal tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure you want a rematch?\u201d Andy asked Zoey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll win this time.\u201d She huffed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoey was still normal and there were no noticeable changes. You had something else in mind for her. As for Andy, every time you looked at him you almost burst out laughing. Before you came down for dinner, you made him think he didn\u2019t wear boy clothes and instead preferred girls\u2019 clothes. He had ditched his jeans and t-shirt for one of Mia\u2019s outfits. He was now wearing a red dress with just straps over the shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain everyone thought it was normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner was finished, Mia went over and grabbed a tub of ice cream for desert. Sarah didn\u2019t have one, as she was on a diet to be popular, but everyone else wanted some. However, Zoey got something else. Knowing she loved sugar and, being ten years old, could get hyper, you decided she should get something else. While she believed she got ice cream, it was actually a large bowl of broccoli. You laughed to yourself as you enjoyed the sweet treat while she spooned up green vegetables and acting like they were the best food in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that supper was done, what did you do now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was time to do something you wanted to do since obtaining this body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to leave your family like this, you quickly reverted everyone back to normal and Andy would change back to his regular clothes before anyone would notice. Then you made a slight adjustment to their situational awareness. None of them would notice or react to any sounds coming from your room nor would they have the desire to come in. Mom and dad wouldn\u2019t be back until much later, so you had plenty of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you entered your room, you still shut the door behind you. Even if the rest of your family wouldn\u2019t react, it would be awkward for you to see someone walk by. There was a perk you were going to take advantage of though. You sat down at your computer and opened the internet, while using your free hand to pull the sparkling pink dildo out of the drawer.  If you were going to do this you were going to do this right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed when you selected your favorite porn site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes browsing through the listings, you finally selected one and hit play. Normally, if you were watching porn, you waited until it was late and used headphones. Now, you could blare it through your speakers and no one in the house would take note. As the boring intro started, you stripped off your bra and panties and sat down in your chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hand slowly moved along your clit and you could feel the pleasure. You purposely kept the pace at a minimum to prevent getting off to fast. As the girl on the screen began to get pounded, you slowly stuck a finger inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA noise escaped your lips as a shock ran through your body. You immediately stopped, caught your breath, and began to move your finger in and out. As you continued, you could feel it getting wetter and wetter. You glanced down at the dildo and an idea came to you. On porn, a lot of times a girl licked it first before sticking it in, so maybe you should to? As the porn continued, you kept moving your finger in and out of your vagina while licking the plastic dildo. Finally, as the porn was building up, you gathered your nerves and lowered the device between your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could resist the feelings as you pushed it in. In retrospect, you probably should have slowly inserted it, but you were way too excited. You sat there, feet propped on your desk, with a large plastic toy stuck deep between your legs. It felt much fuller, as the hard plastic was pushing against your insides. You gritted your teeth and decided to keep going since you went so far already. Your hand grasping the base of the dildo began to move out and you sucked in air as waves of pleasure rippled through your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was unlike masturbating as a guy. Sure, it was a little easier grasping a dick, but a vagina was inside your body. It felt like the pleasure could spread out faster and easier. Maybe it was just because it was new. You began to pump the dildo in and out, starting off slow and slowly gathering speed. You were taking in quick shallow breaths as pleasure ripped through your body. A pressure was building up within you and were beginning to feel yourself titter on the verge of releasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept up the stimulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026.cumming!\u201d You finally gasped, pulling the dildo out with a squashing sound. Some liquid shot out on your floor and desk. You sat their unmoving, recovering from your first true orgasm as a female. You had to get used to it though. There were countless suits in that bunker for you to try. \u201cTomorrow\u2019s Monday right and I'm meeting my friends at the pool. Sweet, it's going to be fun now if everyone considers me a girl.\u201d You sat up and looked at the glistening pink plastic in his hand. \u201cRight, unpacking. Shit. Guess I should get cleaned up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes fell onto your desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn. That needs cleaned up to.\u201d You grinned. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t have to be me.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Mia noticed you and her mouth fell open. It seems walking into the nude was still frowned upon and you only conditioned them to ignore you when you were in your room. Smiling, you click the remote and affected everyone inside the house. They all immediately came up to the landing and stood in line, their expression vacant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, while I shower, I want you all to clean up my room. Not only the stains on my desk, but straighten up everything. Mom wanted me to do it and I forgot.\u201d You clicked the remote again and your four sisters and brother marched into your room. \u201cMan, this is addicting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill laughing, you entered the bathroom and turned on the water. When it finally reached perfect temperature, you got in and let the water flow over your body. Deciding to take your shower now, you made sure to clean yourself thoroughly. If you lathered your breasts and ass a little longer than needed, who was going to stop you? Taking an extra-long time like your sisters usually did, it was a while before you got out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, haircare is a pain. Maybe I should swap to someone with shorter hair until I need Shokuhou\u2019s power.\u201d Mind control was amazing, but too easy to abuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while to dry your hair and finally left the bathroom. You looked inside to see your room neat and organized, though not perfect. Your siblings were still working. It was amazing how fast they could clean if they didn\u2019t talk or get distracted. You decided it was good enough to show your parents that you cleaned up your room. Deciding to help them out a little and as a kind of thanks, you used your powers again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. I want each of you to do the same to everyone\u2019s room. Make sure our parents are happy then go about your day like usual.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone left and you entered your room. Rummaging through, you pulled out a pair of light pink panties and a matching nightgown. It wasn\u2019t like you were going anywhere so you might as well dress for bed. After that, you grabbed your swimsuit and towel for the pool trip tomorrow and then started surfing the internet.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was only a 15 min bike ride from your house, so you had a lot of time. Sometimes you wished you could drive. Stretching out, you changed clothes to a simple t-shirt and a skirt. The shirt was tight enough to highlight your sexy body. It felt kind of good to show off. You weren\u2019t ugly before the suit, but far from handsome. Average at the best. Now you were a smoking hot girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, you found your mom making breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, mom.\u201d You greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning, Misaki.\u201d Diana was technically your step mom, but it was just easier to call her mom. You were the only one of your original family to call her that so far and you can tell she deeply appreciated it. \u201cEggs and bacon or are you just going to have some fruit today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe a couple pieces of bacon.\u201d You replied.

I would prefer someone accompanying you if you decide to go too far. Can you at least promise me that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing. I already kind of now where I plan to go.

Getting a bag with water and your remotes, you headed out before most of your house was awake. Walking the familiar route to the bunker, you found it without problems and walked inside. Now you had a choice to make. You had some time to kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could try out the virtual reality option if you wanted. Continue your little adventure as Shokuhou taking over the city. You could also try a new costume. Shokuhou was one of your favorite Magical Index/ Railgun girls, but you could try others. Also, who said you had to stay as an Index character? There were countless other options to choose from.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You had some so you could think about your decision, but not all day. Scanning through the outfits, you debated with yourself. Naturally, going to the pool meant that you should avoid any of the characters with electrical abilities. Mikoto was the main female lead, but you couldn\u2019t guarantee you could control her random sparking if you got embarrassed. People could get hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after going through countless suits, seriously this series had a lot, you narrowed it down to three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was Index Librorum Prohibitorum, aka Index. She was the silver haired nun who lead the main male character into the world of magic. She had a huge appetite and a perfect memory. She memorized over 100,000 magical books, though she couldn\u2019t really use magic herself. One of your friends, James, recently got into the series and likes her.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/au7w6QrEd3YP8p8Q6\" target=\"_blank\">https://images.app.goo.gl/au7w6QrEd3YP8p...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next costume was what appeared to be a little girl with pink hair, Tsukuyomi Komoe. Appearances are deceiving, as she was actually around forty years old. For some reason, she didn\u2019t really age outwardly. She likes to drink and smoke a lot though and is the homeroom teacher for the main male character. It would be interesting to walk around and have everyone see you as a little girl but know you\u2019re an adult. Shoot, maybe you could even drive. She didn\u2019t have any powers though.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/EDVvuVBz5e72NRzCA\" target=\"_blank\">https://images.app.goo.gl/EDVvuVBz5e72NR...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour last choice was the complete opposite of Tsukuyomi. This girl was a high schooler and Shirai\u2019s boss at Judgment. Her name was Komori Mii. She had short black hair and glasses, though the machine manual mentioned some defects would be ignored, so you probably didn\u2019t have to wear them unless you wanted to. The biggest different was she had a huge rack. Shokuhou had a large one, but these were in a league of their own. Her esper ability was clairvoyance, which let her have x-ray vision.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/DF57r9Udh9Kg9HYL6\" target=\"_blank\">https://images.app.goo.gl/DF57r9Udh9Kg9H...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuestion now was which one you would select.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hanging your clothes up near the bed, you reached behind your head and felt for the opening. Magically, you found it. When you showered you didn\u2019t notice it at all. Maybe it only appeared when you wanted to take the suit off to prevent other people from discovering you. Gripping the opening with both hands, you stretch out the malleable material and pull Shokuhou\u2019s head over your own. Taking a deep breath, you looked into a mirror. You looked weird. Your head with a girl\u2019s body. Shame you couldn\u2019t hide the head flap and mess of blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally getting the suit off, you spread it out at the foot of the bed. She was one of your favorite characters so you wanted to make sure she was readily available. You examined the flat suit for a moment. With no one in it, it only barely resembled Shokuhou. Turning around, ignoring the fact you were naked, no one was here after all, you began walking down the aisles. You only had a couple hours, so you decided to stick with anime right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat anime do you want to get a suit from?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s Naruto\u2019s sexy jutsu costume.\u201d You muttered. \u201cOf course. There are no male suits unless I make one. Why would I want to do that?

You experienced the strange sensation again of your dick merging into your body to be replaced by a vagina. Your arms were next and they shriveled up a bit until you saw the smooth hairless skin tighten up. Your chest suddenly grew heavy as the torso merged with yours. Hinata had huge breasts but always wore lose clothes to hide them. They were covered by her head flap and hair as you haven\u2019t finished putting her on. You took a deep breath and pulled her head over yours. It took a second to straighten it and then you could breathe normally. Heading back to the living quarters, you examined yourself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight lavender eyes stared back at you without pupils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s really cute.\u201d You reached up a hand and slide it against the side of your face before looking down. \u201cAnd her jugs are huge!\u201d You put your hands under them and bounced them up and down. \u201cBrianna is going to be so jealous so I should be careful. She\u2019s not very big and it bothers her.\u201d You stretched. \u201cThis is a ninja body for you, it\u2019s really limber.\u201d You looked around. \u201cI guess I should get dressed. These boobs are going to be a burden without a bra.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed a black bra and panty set and put them on. Once you clasped the bra in place and moved the cups until your boobs were settled in, you felt your sense of balance improve. Your eyes fell onto the loose fitting, lavender and cream hooded-jacket with lavender cuffs and navy blue pants. Deciding it was going to be way too hot in that, as summer had started, you rummaged around the clothing until you found something better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you settled with a purple tank top with thin straps that showed off your ample chest and some tight black bike shorts. It made sense as not only were you biking to the pool, they made your ass look amazing. You were wearing a lot more revealing clothes then Hinata would ever wear normally.

The last thing you needed was people to be expecting you to look like Shokuhou and instead see Hinata walking around. Now everyone would believe you always looked like her as a teenager. The last thing you grabbed was your water bottle and a new purse. The one you had before was left with the Shokuhou outfit and held her remotes. You had to take one though as your bike shorts had no pockets and as a girl you could carry stuff this way. You left the bunker and reentered the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm.\u201d Your eyes fell on the large trees. \u201cWell, I am a ninja and I have access to all her skills.\u201d You calmed your thoughts and pulled the experience from Hinata\u2019s mind. Smiling to yourself, you started to channel chakra, a form of life energy that all individuals produce in the Naruto universe that allowed them to perform all sorts of jutsus. You focused it toward your feet and ran at the nearest tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour foot hit the trunk and you continued straight up the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is amazing!\u201d You called out in Hinata\u2019s voice, standing near the top of the tree.  She was normally so reserved, but you were much more confident. Branches could only support so much weight after all. Taking a minute to enjoy the view, you jumped to another tree. A few birds flew off, squawking angrily. \u201cSorry!\u201d You jumped from tree to tree until landing on the rocky ground near the small river. Normally you would either get wet or find a way around it, but now you didn\u2019t have to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply walked across it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older Hinata knew how to harness chakra to walk on water, so now you did too. It was a cool experience and you stopped in the middle of the river to watch some fish swim under you. When you reached the other side, you charged forward at full speed, arms trailing behind you in the typical Naruto-run fashion. The speed at which you could move was pretty astonishing. In minutes, you reached the edge of your yard and you slowed down to a walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you grab your stuff normally?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You reached your window, opened it, and slid inside. This gave you a chance to look around. The color scheme changed from a light pink girly theme to one with more purple and blues, but most things didn\u2019t seem to change too much. Out of curiosity, you checked the drawer with the pink dildo and found a dark purple one instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving to the closet, you started rummaging through your clothes until you found your swimsuits. Before you had a chance to decide which one to bring with you, the door to your room began to open. Instincts took over and your body moved without much conscious thought. A quick side stepped hid you behind the opening door and you heard someone step inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought I heard Anthony?\u201d Zoey, your youngest sister, asked.

You could decide which swimsuit you wanted to wear. However, you glanced back to the door and thought about Zoey.

Hinata!\u201d A voice called out the second you walked into the rec center. \u201cOver here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to see your friend Brianna. She was 16 with long white hair, dark skin and bright green eyes. Normally she wore a red, white, and blue jacket with a Puerto Rican flag on the backside, but it was getting warm out. Since she loved video games, she was wearing a red Mario Party shirt with black jean shorts. From the look of it, she had just arrived and had been talking to a buy sitting down on a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy\u2019s name was James. He was also 16 and a friend of yours. A little on the short side, he had Short strawberry-blonde hair and blue eyes. Kind of shy, but loved video games too. Sports were also something he liked to watch, even if he didn\u2019t play. James didn\u2019t talk much to people he didn\u2019t know, being shy, but you could get him to open up once he got to know you. He was currently playing his Nintendo 3DS. You remembered he just got Pok\u00e9mon Sun last night and you wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he didn\u2019t sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, guys!\u201d You greeted enthusiastically, walking over. \u201cWaiting long?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just got here,\u201d Brianna replied and gave you a high five. \u201cJames has been here playing that game for two hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-two hours?\u201d You coughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s lying!\u201d He denied and put the game away as Brianna. \u201cI got here at most ten minutes before she did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t wait to see us in swimsuits.\u201d Brianna mocked whispered to you in a tone loud enough for him to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-that\u2019s not it!\u201d James protested, his face turning red in embarrassment. He had wanted a girlfriend for a while, but it was hard to even talk to random girls, let alone ask them out. \u201cMy mom was going grocery shopping and dropped me off early. It was either that or walk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just kidding.\u201d Brianna reassured him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get a girl someday,\u201d You promise. \u201cFor now, let\u2019s go have some summer fun.\u201d You glanced around. \u201cOr we could start off playing some ping pong or something in the game room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWant me to crush you both again?\u201d Brianna asked with a smirk. \u201cDidn\u2019t you learn your lesson last time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been training in secret.\u201d You reply.

Think we can beat her? You got the closest last time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d James replied and kicked his gym bag. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever.

Nude girls as far as the eye could see all around you. You followed Brianna into the secret garden and immediately looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince summer just started, the pool was pretty popular. With schools out, a lot of students were there, at least the ones without their own private ones.  The little girls who parents brought them you ignored. You weren\u2019t a pedophile like that. The older women you ignored too. Mainly, your eyes focused on the girls around your age up through college. Different size chests were everywhere. Some of the bolder girls were topless and talking to each other. You quickly followed Brianna to avoid drawing suspicion to your actions, but you made sure to keep watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how\u2019s the new house been?\u201d Brianna asked, pulling off her shirt and beginning to unhook her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s big,\u201d You admit. \u201cBut with so many siblings, it still feels cramped.\u201d You imitated her action and stripped off your shirt and then unclasped your black bra. You could have sworn your boobs practically spilled out. Brianna was eyeing them with a slight frown. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWish I had breasts as nice as yours.\u201d She sighed, as she began to put the top of her bright yellow two piece. She placed one hand over them. She wasn\u2019t completely flat, but they were definitely on the smaller side. Maybe around a B. \u201cNo matter how much milk I drink, they never grow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWish I could give you some,\u201d You replied, pulling out your two piece. When you grabbed the swimsuit, you didn\u2019t really pay attention to the design. Now you saw it was a bright blue tie-dye pattern.  \u201cI can feel all the guys staring at me.\u201d As you said this, your eyes traveled onto a blonde girl who just got out of the shower with huge boobs out in the open. They even dwarfed yours. \u201cPlus running and swimming is an added chore.\u201d<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/99AoG4ZM6TMvWL4T8\" target=\"_blank\">https://images.app.goo.gl/99AoG4ZM6TMvWL...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Grass is always greener?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPretty much.\u201d Brianna was attractive you had to admit, as you pulled on your lower half after dropping your panties.

Kevin liked to pick on your group of friends a lot because of your love for anime and video games. Three of his gang members were with him and they were all laughing at James.

You could transform into a guy easily enough with a basic jutsu and no one would be able to tell the difference. It was just your absence would be noted. Hinata wasn\u2019t good at the clone jutsu like Naruto was, so it wasn\u2019t like you could be in multiple places at once. Brianna was sure to notice your absence. The best bet was to pretend to use the bathroom first and then sneak over. Before you had a chance to try though, you saw someone finally step up and help James out while Kevin and his gang left. Your eyes returned to normal and you decided to wait it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCannonball!\u201d Brianna called out, jumping in. She wasn\u2019t a big girl, so the splash wasn\u2019t that big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPssh.\u201d You told her when she resurfaced. It was probably better to act normally for now \u201cYou call that a cannonball? I\u2019ll show you one.\u201d You made your way around the pool and ran out onto the diving board. As you jumped, you tucked your arms and legs in. A large splash occurred before the cold water shocked you. It took a moment to orient yourself before swimming back up to the surface. Your head broke through and you inhaled the sweet air. Long wet hair clung to your scalp and the rest was spread out in the water. \u201cDid I win?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTie.\u201d Brianna informed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBull.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope, definitely a tie.\u201d Her smirk told you otherwise, but you let it go. \u201cJames!\u201d She suddenly called out. You turned around to see him, although a slightly dejected look on his face. \u201cWhat kept you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t get the lockers to work,\u201d James replied and you frowned. You knew this was a lie, but Brianna took him at his words. She began to swim around, while James slowly lowered himself in the pool. You took the opportunity to swim over to him and held onto the side of the pool to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat really happened?\u201d You asked. While you knew, he had to be the one to tell you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing.\u201d James mumbled, though his hand tightened on the side of the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d You punched him light in the shoulder. \u201cBrianna may have missed it, but we\u2019ve known each other forever. What happened that kept you up?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames sighed but gave in reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKevin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKevin?\u201d You tried to pretend to be surprised. \u201cFrom school? That asshole?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d James nodded. \u201cHe and his friends saw me in the locker room and tried to stuff me in one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUntil they realized you weren\u2019t ten anymore and wouldn\u2019t fit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. So they took my DS instead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gritted your teeth in anger. No wonder James was so upset. In your current form, you could beat the crap out of Kevin and his friends. While he supposedly took Karate, he only said so and you never actually saw him, a ninja would easily overpower him. You could walk up to him and get your friends DS back. Now, the problem is Kevin\u2019s family influence could make life difficult for you. Another option was taking advantage of being an attractive girl. While Kevin didn\u2019t like you as a boy, he surely wouldn\u2019t turn you down in front of his friends or risk being mocked. You might have to hold back your vomit as you pretended to flirt with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, you could come up with a plan of some kind that would make it so Kevin would never bother James, or anyone ever again. It would take some time, but you had all sorts of suits and abilities at your disposal. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all, the bunker was a secret and you didn\u2019t want to be over heard.

How could they? They were just a suit. You turned around and reached out a hand toward Brianna. You only meant to push her away, but as luck would have it, your hand fell on her breast. You were both still in your swimwear, but you were now groping another girl in somewhat of a public place. \u201cAh\u2026 sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was my fault, I started it.\u201d Brianna assured you and started laughing. \u201cNot sure why you get shy over something like this. We\u2019ve know each other for years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking back, memories of this world began to swim to the front of your mind. While James was your first friend, Brianna was your first female friend. You two had plenty of sleepovers and other girl only activities. When you started to develop, she always liked to grope you then complain about her own. The two of you began to joke around before getting your bikes and heading back to your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s as big as I remember,\u201d Brianna told you, looking around as you arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHopefully you won\u2019t have to meet my entire family again and we can sneak in for some food.\u201d To your surprise, the house was empty. Your mom must have taken the rest of your siblings out for some reason. That was good news for you, as you and Brianna pulled out some food from the fridge and began snacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what did you find in the woods?\u201d Brianna asked, as they ate. \u201cA cave or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKind of?\u201d You shrugged. \u201cTrust me. It will be cooler if it\u2019s a surprise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOookay?\u201d Brianna raised an eyebrow. \u201cIt better be worth all the suspense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. It will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversations turned to school and what they were planning to do during summer vacation. You were only half paying attention. Your thoughts were going on about how to show Brianna the bunker, along with your plan to get back at Kevin. There were a couple options available to you, depending how much you wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst was to show Brianna everything in the bunker straight. She was clever and could help think about how to use it to get revenge. After she finished screaming and running around in excitement. The next was to see if you could try something on her before entering the bunker. A plan was forming in your mind, but you needed to test something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you use a power of a suit and then took off the suit, would the power still be in affect?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, you might get cold feet and show her something else in the forest and pretend it\u2019s what you were talking about.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you led Brianna through the woods, you began to worry about what she would think about this. Would she consider you formally being a guy? Since the suits only work if you are a guy, that meant she had to realize you were a guy originally. What you did at the pool was sure to upset her when she found out. That lead to you planning how you might have to tweak her mind so she wouldn\u2019t question certain things. It was really complicated because there were a few ways to get a male suit. You would either have to give up your original body, or get a suit pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really didn\u2019t want to go through childbirth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre we close?\u201d Brianna asked, after you two had hiked a bit through the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlmost.\u201d There was a small clearing with a couple stumps you used as a marker. \u201cYou can wait here. Got to double check where it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t remember?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve only been here once.\u201d You reminded her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little bit or arguing, she agreed, mostly because she was tired. You ran off ahead and down the path to the entrance to the bunker. The door slid open and you slipped in. You ran down the stairs into the main room. Your objective was the living area where you had discarded the Shokuhou outfit. Hinata didn\u2019t have any mind control abilities, so you had to swap.  You quickly stripped naked. Reaching a hand up behind your head, you found the hole and began to pull off her skin. Once the suit was off, you grabbed the Shokuhou one and pulled it on. Besides not being athletic, the suits were actually pretty similar. Both girls were rather busty with long hair. Practice was also making putting the suits on much easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou threw on a shirt, panties, and skirt, not even bothering with a bra right now, and grabbed a remote out of the purse. After that, you clicked the console so your current body was considered normal. Hinata\u2019s suit was spread out neatly on the bed. The last thing you needed was Brianna to run off when she saw someone else. Now she would simply think you returned. You left the bunker and headed back to the clearing. Immediately feeling the physical toll because of the fact Shokuhou was not nearly as physically strong as Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBack already?\u201d Brianna asked, standing up. \u201cYou were barely gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI found it easier than I thought.\u201d You replied and waved for her to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow!\u201d Brianna gasped, when you revealed the hidden door. \u201cIs this some kind of old military bunker?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot quite.\u201d You two traveled down the stairs and entered the main area. She had just started forward to take a look when you clicked the remote. \u201cSorry.\u201d You told her when she immediately froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her under your control, you had time to decide what to do. Your first idea involved Kevin. Did powers work once you took off the suit? If not, your current idea wouldn\u2019t work. It was a long shot. Because while you could use your powers to make Kevin behave and stop bullying people, the second you swapped to a different suit would mean that he reverted back to normal. Even if you tweaked Brianna to avoid asking certain questions, you couldn\u2019t swap suits or those commands would vanish. You really needed to figure out the rules for the powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, before you tested it out, maybe you could have a little fun with her?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You could see through a crack and could monitor her if your mind control broke. Take a deep breath, you removed your shirt. It would be easier to just throw on the upper half to prevent things getting out of hand if your powers did break. Taking a deep breath to calm yourself down, you slowly reached a hand up and began to remove the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Shokuhou\u2019s head fell forward and you were now standing there with your own head on top of her body, Brianna didn\u2019t move. That was a good sign. Slowly, you remove the suit until it was only your lower half still wearing it. Brianna still didn\u2019t move. Gathering your courage, you stepped out, half naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrianna?\u201d You called out, slowly approaching her. She didn\u2019t move a muscle. \u201cAnyone there?\u201d You waved a hand in front of her face but gathered no response. \u201cWake up!\u201d You cried, grabbing her shoulders and shaking her. Still, no reaction. Shokuhou\u2019s powers were too great. \u201cWell, at least I know it works.\u201d She walked around her and slapped her butt just for fun. \u201cHmm, I\u2019m half dressed, can I still order her around?\u201d You think out loud. \u201cBrianna, dance for me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried using the remote to make her move and still nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gave you an idea on how the powers would work. Any lingering effects would remain, even after the suit was taken off. However, no new affects would work if the suit wasn\u2019t completely on. You suppose a way around this would to use mind control to make them obey you, regardless of what you looked like. Something for later perhaps? Right now, you had one of your friends to help experiment. It was time to decide how to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first option was to awaken Brianna and have her step outside of the bunker. While she did this, you would turn yourself back to your original self with the reality option and explain how this bunker worked. She would treat you like she always did and you knew she would want to try a suit, once you guys found a male skinsuit for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond was to continue pretending to be a girl. Turning your original body into a skinsuit would allow both of you to try out new bodies by passing your old body around. It was kind of convoluted, but it would work. Brianna would put your body on, turn her old body into a skinsuit, then your body would be considered her real one. That way, she could try on any suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA third option was a little mean. You had mind control powers and could tweak her mind into becoming your assistant. You could test things out without any arguing or hesitation. She would be willing to help you try out anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Luckily, you were still half dressed in her skin. It only took a few seconds to pull the upper part of the skin suit over yourself. Once you finished adjusting the map, you looked your friend over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Brianna.\u201d You say, thinking about how to word this. \u201cYou will go up the stairs and wait outside the bunker until I come get you. If anyone else discovers you, you will make up something about why you are there.\u201d You didn\u2019t think anyone would show up, but it was to be safe. \u201cOnce I come get you and bring you down here, you will naturally be excited to try out the suits. You will be open to whatever you have to do to be able to do so. It\u2019s something fun we can do together and you will never tell another person without my permission.

What female suit did you want to keep as your main body? You gave commands to Brianna to listen to you regardless what suit you had, so you didn\u2019t need to stay in Shokuhou. In fact, this would be a great time to try another suit out. Your thoughts turned to the different girls you could turn into as you removed the rest of Shokuhou\u2019s clothes and skin. Taking the suit over to the living area, you shoved it under the bed. There was a small chance Brianna could recognize it and be suspicious of mind control powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the Hinata skin on the bed, you thought about what you wanted to do. First option you had was to stay in the Naruto universe. There were a lot of hot girls you could transform into. Of course, there were countless anime options out there for you to explore. Why not check out some other one? In fact, you could expand your experiences to other genre. It\u2019s not like Brianna was going anywhere.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It felt a little different than the other skinsuits. This one felt a little slimier rather than a synthesized plastic. It made sense though, as who this girl was. You pulled open the hole in the back of the skin and began to get in. Once again, you felt the strange but not unpleasant sensation of skin tightening and warping your body. The head was the final piece and it actually didn\u2019t have hair. Still, once you adjusted the face, it wouldn\u2019t matter. After one last check to make sure the suit was on correctly, you turned and went back to the living section and looked in a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/9M4KZYJPLXkF8bSD9\" target=\"_blank\">https://images.app.goo.gl/9M4KZYJPLXkF8b...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head resembles a hammerhead shark, with purple eyes and webbed ears.

They were extremely powerful swimmers, could breath underwater, and could use magic. Ruto in the games could control water. You reached up and grabbed your bare breasts.

You could change that though if you wanted. There were countless outfits all over. You could find something to suit her body. Ruto had a very sexy figure as an adult. You didn\u2019t actually feel uncomfortable being naked so going nude would be fine. Once you selected the reality option, everyone would assume you were normal, naked or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou needed to decide before going to the machine and making this your real body, turning your old male one into a suit for Brianna to use.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When you got out, you discovered another suit, this one male. You held up the skin and examined it. It was definitely you. You recognized your hair and face, though your package down below was a little small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMust be the cold air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is my real skin now?\u201d You muttered, reaching up to try to find the opening in the back of your head and neck.

If she only knew you were Ruto right now. \u201cThe only rules to using these suits is that you can only wear one at a time and you have to wear the opposite sex suit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut didn\u2019t you say these were all female?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I first came down here, yeah.\u201d You nodded. \u201cHowever, I have this male suit here.\u201d You held up your former body. \u201cThis suit let me become a man. Once I became a man, I used this machine here.\u201d You pointed behind you. \u201cTo make it my real body. Then I turned my old body into a suit before wearing another.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead then.\u201d Brianna crossed her arms smugly. \u201cProve it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d You expected this. \u201cListen to me\u2026\u201d The trigger worked. Her eyes appeared blank. \u201cYou will stand there and pretend not to notice anything until I say awake. At that point, you will believe you saw me change suits and recognize my current body. You won\u2019t ask what happened to my original body.\u201d She nodded and you moved to the terminal. A quick reset and your normal body was considered Shokuhou again. Now, she could recognize you as Ruto. \u201cAwake!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god!\u201d Brianna squealed, hopping on her heels. \u201cYou\u2019re Ruto, from Zelda.

Let\u2019s have some fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bolted off and you smiled. It would not doubt take a little bit for her to decide. To pass the time, you thought about what kind of outfit she would choose. A video game character seemed likely. Knowing her, she might even chose a Zelda character to match you. She played those games a lot, almost as much as Super Smash Brothers and Mario Party. You laughed to yourself and looked down at your body. You were definitely feminine but not quite as detailed as a normal human. You reached down between your legs and realized your anatomy was the same, just hidden better. The pleasure rippled through you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeast you had something to do while you waited.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She still believed you were Shokuhou. \u201cHinata, a couple Magical Index characters, and now Ruto.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou always did like Index.\u201d She laughed. \u201cBut you chose mostly safe options.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSafe?\u201d You asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing.\u201d Brianna smiled and wouldn\u2019t elaborate, no matter how much you tried. \u201cI see you preferred the naked option.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuto doesn\u2019t wear clothes.\u201d You protested and she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you got to the lake, you stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould I\u2026 push you in?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese clothes are perfectly capable of going into the water.\u201d Brianna reassured you. \u201cSpecifically made for mermaids I guess? That bunker has everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me.\u201d You pushed until the wheels were just in the water and Brianna pushed herself off into the shallows and just laid there. \u201cNot going to swim?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWaiting for you.\u201d She answered and then looked around. \u201cPlus I want to admire this amazing scenery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a pretty nice lake, you had to admit, once you parked the chair under a tree. The water was clear, it was large enough not to be considered a pawn, and two rivers in the forest flowed into it. The sun was high in the sky and no one else was around. The forest blocked the view of any houses close by, so it was a secluded spot. You stepped into the warm water. Funny enough, it felt natural and, even though the rocks were slippery, you didn\u2019t feel like falling at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady?\u201d Brianna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you both were in water waist high, you dove into the water.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ruto\u2019s race lived underwater, so it was to be expected. The subconscious personality loved being here over dry land. It was amazing how fast you could swim with these fins and webbed feet. You blew through the water like a torpedo. Not too far away, you saw Brianna swimming almost as fast, her tail going up and down as she swam. You swam over to her. There was something you wanted to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you understand me?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep!\u201d Brianna replied. \u201cCool. We can talk underwater.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnderwater races had to be able to communicate somehow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to check out the fishes.\u201d Brianna told you. \u201cSee you later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waved and swam the opposite direction. The water got darker the further you went down, but it wasn\u2019t like you couldn\u2019t see. You reached the bottom and just glided a couple feet above the mud, looking at all the catfish and schools of bluegill nearby. Naturally the fish swam away from you. You were an unknown large creature and they assumed you were a predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wonder what else is here? Maybe something cool sank.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to swim effortlessly around, looking for what might have gotten stuck down here, but nothing. There were only a few pieces of metal trash people had thrown down. An hour passed as you were just exploring before you knew it. The only reason you realized that was you began to feel you had to use the bathroom. There was no way you could get out and make it back to the bunker easily. Looking around, you didn\u2019t see Brianna nearby. Taking the opportunity, you let Ruto\u2019s personality take over for a moment as you released while moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She won\u2019t notice a small patch of warm water.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing everything below you began to swim upwards and just floated along about ten feet below the surface. A sudden tap on your forehead awoke you from your semi unconscious state and you saw Brianna grinning while floating above you. In response, you reached up and grabbed her chest as punishment for awakening you. She slapped your hands away and did the same thing to you before pointing to the surface. The two of you floated upwards until you found your head in the cool air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSwimming like this is way better than in my normal body.\u201d Brianna told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more.\u201d You grinned. \u201cDay\u2019s still young.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what next?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then I realized a monster girl feels so different than myself, that I wanted to test it out more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean not feel like yourself?\u201d You asked curiously, as you followed Brianna. She was looking around the rows of suits, but it was obvious she was leading you somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have legs,\u201d she reminded you. \u201cYet I could swim naturally without them. They felt like I always had them, but at the same time different.\u201d She gestured all around you. \u201cYou found this amazing place. It\u2019s time to take some risks and try new things.

It\u2019s time to experience different bodies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d You relented. \u201cShow me who you want to be and I\u2019ll go along with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna pointed to a costume. At first, it seemed pretty normal. The girl had long bright red hair that reached past her back. Her ears are large, pointy and red, and she has fangs and a long tongue. She also has small scales on her cheeks. The large breasts and a curvy figure were nice on the upper body until your eyes trailed down. Her most noticeable physical trait was her long, red snake tail. The full length of it you estimated was around 7 meters long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s Miia from Monster Musume, right?\u201d You asked, recognizing the girl. \u201cDo you have a fetish for no legs?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got you lightly punched in the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShush you. This is going to be amazing. Help me in. I\u2019m not sure how to fit since the tail is so long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo it like last time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled open the slit in the back and began to climb in. This time, as you watched, you saw her lower body begin to slide in. You watched the online of her feet press against the inside of the snake tail. As the skin began to tighten around her waist, the tail began to inflate and Brianna nearly fell over. You caught her just in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah, I lost my legs there.\u201d She shifted around and began to rise as the snake tail was already up and working. \u201cCool!\u201d She pulled the rest of Miia\u2019s skin on and then grabbed a light colored button down top and a blue skirt with a belt. Miia\u2019s typical outfit. \u201cHow do I look?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/Fpf9vB7Z5kZZ68vp8\" target=\"_blank\">https://images.app.goo.gl/Fpf9vB7Z5kZZ68...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust like her.\u201d You admit and walked around. You reached down and touched the scaly tail. It felt so lifelike instead of plastic. \u201cCompletely natural.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour turn to choose.\u201d Brianna told you and gestured to the other girl skins nearby. \u201cDon\u2019t be shy and choose something adventurous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew the series Monster Musume and there were a lot of attractive monster girls in that anime.

Your old body now became a suit, which you then put on. It was a little difficult getting Ruto\u2019s fins in the suit, but you eventually managed. Once your original skin adjusted, it was your turn to step into the machine. Ruto\u2019s body returned to being a skin and you were back having your own body. Knowing you couldn\u2019t wear clothes, you opt to just walk naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna made sure to whistle at your junk swaying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou already made your decision and pulled down the body of Rachnera. Like Brianna and Miia, you were debating how to get in without falling over. Her upper body was fine, you were used to that. The spider lower half was another story. The actual abdomen was large enough for you to crawl in, but the eight legs themselves were much thinner than your own. You figured your best bet was to slip your legs into the main spider body and go from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled open the back of Rachnera\u2019s upper back and slipped one leg in. Once it was pressed against the floor, you put your other one in. With a quick jerk, you got it up to your waist. It felt like a normal suit that you were just standing in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you felt what could only be described as your legs dissolving and you fell forward on your face. Brianna laughed and then you experienced your lower body expanding rapidly like a balloon. In a few seconds, you found yourself propped on the lower spider body, but not standing up. The actually body was pressed against the floor and your eight legs were just laying useless to the side. As you tried to stand, your legs flailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t stand up!\u201d You cry to Brianna. \u201cI can\u2019t figure out how to control all the legs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinish putting the costume on.\u201d She replied. \u201cYou can use their memories. That\u2019s how I can slide around as Miia.\u201d Her snake body twisted and coiled around as she slid around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stuck your arms into the suit and you felt the skin tighten. Black carapace covered your arms from the shoulders down, and gauntlet-like plating on your hands ended in sharpened points. Your fingers were also very long. Taking a deep breath, you then pulled her head over your own. Everything went dark for a second before your eye sight returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly were seeing things from more than two eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis\u2026.\u201d Your six eyes blinked in sets of twos as you tried to get used to it. \u201cI can\u2019t even control the eyes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax.\u201d Brianna told you and grabbed your hand. \u201cJust let your mind merge with hers for a moment. Everything gets easier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath and relaxed. Rachnera\u2019s mind began to educate you and you took control of your legs. You felt your entire body rise as your eight appendages lifted you up with ease. You blinked and brushed a strand of lilac hair out of your many eyes. You were greeted with Miia, really Brianna, smiling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee? Isn\u2019t this more fun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what now?\u201d You asked, taking a few steps, hearing the tap of your spider claws hitting the hard floor. \u201cAfter I get some clothes.\u201d You added, running your hands over your upper body and remembering you were naked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking through the vast amounts of choices he had scattered about in probably every direction, Anthony really wasn't sure on what to pick. Being an avid fan of anime and manga in general, many of the grotesque skins appealed to him in all kinds of ways. He could be that character from that anime, or that character, or that... It was like he never would leave. A single glance told him that if he actually decided to try all of it, he wouldn't. Forcing himself to decide, he took an aisle at complete random, and didn't look before it seemed to stop. As he had covered his eyes with his hand, he looked at the line to his side, jumping slightly in surprise. The existence of suits of the girls from K\u00e4mpfer surprised him, but in a good way. If there was a series he liked yet also didn't, it was K\u00e4mpfer. It gave him a couple of laughs now and again, and it was at least decent, if not more. Even so, an anime which contained gun-toting schoolgirls and a fire-throwing girl who was actually a guy wasn't something he would recommend to anyone. It was silly in its own way, but that kind of \"silly\" that just didn't appeal to everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsuru was likeable, yet not. Anthony himself really liked and disliked him, probably because the guy's stupidity was amusing, how simple-minded he was really annoyed him at the same time. However, that didn't stop him from actually taking a liking of him, or probably just his female form. A strange form of delight went through Anthony's head when he noticed the blue hair hanging from the wall, a school uniform, among other outfits, neatly stacked on a shelf beside. Hesitantly, he pulled the suit down, but stopped in his tracks, feeling its rubber-like skin between his fingers. It was nearly lifelike, which was scary, but that was probably something he could ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding the zipper on the suit's back, he pulled it down, before having said suit fall to the floor, as he began to take his own clothes off. Exactly why he did was something he couldn't point an answer to, it was just that it felt like the best of ideas. Perhaps it was because one usually didn't have clothes on when they put on skintight bodysuits otherwise, really. Standing bare naked, alone in the giant warehouse, he pulled the suit up from the cold floor, and began putting it on. First came his feet, which made the suit's legs bulge out grotesquely, but as it didn't seem to make it fall apart, he continued. Because he didn't have a mirror, he couldn't admire himself, standing around with female skin draped over him, but with his own head sticking out. Was it supposed to be like that? He recalled the zipper, and pulled the head over his own like a fully covering mask. Pulling up the zipper, he felt sudden changes beginning to take hold. After probably only a few seconds, he was Natsuru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...W-Whaa!?\" He gasped. Even his, or now her, voice had changed! Anthony was shocked at how a rubbery suit could've changed her so much, just like that. Still shocked, she moved her new head around, only to find a mirror on the side of the racks, and went over to it. Yes, that was exactly a naked version of Natsuru standing in front of her. Not exactly thinking it was real, she moved her hand over the new lump of fat on her chest, and squeezed. The sudden feeling through her body told her it really was real. No magician or version of \"The Hidden Camera\" could perform such a trick. Such a feat was completely impossible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring in disbelief at her new self, she noticed how her reflection shivered heavily. Indeed, she was cold, seeing as she was naked in the warehouse. Recalling clothing, she went back to the shelf where she found the suit, and began putting the school uniform on. Even if it was incredibly breezy being in a skirt, it was still better than being naked. Soon, she began pondering on what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFemale Natsuru in school uniform <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.cosplayhouse.com/images/D/Kampfer_Natsuru_Senou_costume_ver_01-4.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.cosplayhouse.com/images/D/Kam...</a><br>\r\nFemale Natsuru with friends in casual clothes: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_I2GjFmeTgtA/Sy3X32OBrCI/AAAAAAAAB5g/oLiC_4vsGE4/s1600-h/natsuruanime.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_I2GjFmeTgtA/Sy...</a></span></div></div>",

They were perfect facsimiles of the characters in every way. The sagging faces, vacant mouths, and empty eyeholes still a gave a hint of the characters' personalities. You chuckle slightly as you notice Mikuru's whimpering expression and Haruhi's small scowl...at least that's how you perceived them to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShy and meek girls...they are appealing....but you are in an excitable mood. For a normally calm person, you could hardly contain yourself. Being an anime character, let alone entering an anime universe was beyond your wildest dreams. You quickly shed your clothes, tossing them in a messy pile on the ground. With so much pent up energy, you want to scream and to run around in your soon to be new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikuru would not do and neither would Yuki. The idea of an aggressive Mikuru and an excitable Yuki sounded like a good suiting idea for later on, but not now. You liked both characters, but not for your first masking as you wished to stay in character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haruhi it will be,\" you stated, reaching out for the suit.

Shifting your eyes down the aisle, they come to rest on the skin of a teenage girl with dark green hair that extended down to her shins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuruya...how could you have forgotten her? Another one of your favorites. Despite her limited appearances, this minor character was still endearing. Tsuruya exuded the most carefree attitude of the show's girls. She treated everyone pleasantly enough, and wasn't as bossy as the brigade leader. You also wondered for the longest time what her personal name is as Tsuruya is her family name. Still, suiting as Haruhi is appealing enough. While you won't have the real Haruhi's true god-like powers, you were eager to test the suit's limits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich one to pick?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Feeling inside of his chest, which kept him from actually thinking straight. If he was going to be honest, he couldn't decide on anything at all, and his gaze shifted across the row of character from the show. Everyone from the normal ones to the gender-bendered versions of characters was there, which only kept him eyeing them even longer. The problem was, he couldn't decide which one he would pick, either. Of course, he had choices... He could just pick one at sheer random, closing his eyes and pointing at one of them, but he was sure he wouldn't be satisfied with the choice. Sure, he could just pick another suit if the suit didn't satisfy him, but he wanted one he was immediately satisfied with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, he felt his hand nudge at something hard lying in his pocket. Fishing the item out, he quickly realized it only was his cellphone, although... It was his cellphone. Maybe a friend could help him with choosing? As soon as the thought left his head, he was already pressing the number-keys on his phone to bring out James number. After a few beeps, he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hello, James speaking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, it's Anthony!

Unbuttoning his dark blue shirt, he looked for a place to store his clothes, deciding on a vacant cubbyhole located next to the skin. Then came the pants followed by his boxers. The warehouse was a little cold but still on the pleasant side as stood the there naked. He almost had second thoughts as his eyes drifted over the other girl suits from the series, but shook it off. If continued he would never suit up. Might as well get it over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another thought or stray glance he seized the Mikuru suit from behind, removing it from the rack. Noting a seam running from crook of the neck down to the tailbone. Acting on a steady pace he slipped his right leg into the suit, noting the elasticity of the artificial skin, and how it slid down into place without much difficulty. Then came the next leg. As he brought the suit's waist up into place he noted an internal sleeve within the suit to place his manhood. A slight hint of arousal came as it slipped into place. It's only then that he noticed he was a few inches shorter. Looking down he saw the other half of the suit hanging limply, the ends of the suit's long hair touching the concrete floor, he as saw his legs were noticeably thinner and smaller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nResuming his pace, he slipped one hand into the suit's arm hole, followed by the other, slipping it on was easier than a glove. His arms were a little shorter now, not quite like Mikuru's but definitely more petite. In one motion Anthony took his newly suited hands and stretched the top seam closest to the neck and dove his face in. Pushing upward the walls of mask pushed back. Feeling pressure all around his head he continue, as his mouth connected with Mikuru's. Then his ears popped into place as the muffled sounds with the mask became the crisp ambient sound of the warehouse. Then the nose, surprisingly the suit did not smell of cheap rubber, in fact it smelt like nothing. Finally the eyes lined up, stretching the suits eyelids over his eyes, he instinctively pressed it over his closed eyes. Opening up his eyes he still had the same vision, but using his hands he felt the contours around his eyes noting they were definitely larger. Last part he looked down at his sagging breast, cupping each one in her hands she pushed them into her chest rubbing them, as the mounds warmed up and took a nice natural bounce. Feeling the tailbone Anthony found a fleshy zipper tab, and drew it up to her neck. As soon as the seam closed Anthony's felt a single jolt much like when one got shocked. This was replaced sustained pressure throughout his body. The effect lasted only a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to a nearby full length mirror he looked at his reflection mouth agape. A perfect copy of the traveler, in all her anime pigment hue glory. Anthony noted a slight shadowing that was often present in movies he seen when cartoon characters came to the real world, but it was Mikuru...he was Mikuru. Closing his mouth the character in the mirror did the same, following every single movement. The novelty of each sensation was so pleasing, he knew now that masking as any beautiful anime girl would have been satisfying. Feeling her soft long orangey hair, her slender curves, and that cute star-shaped mole on her left breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My voice should be the same as...\" he trailed off, as his new voice was a perfect copy of the dub character's one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking mentally about speaking Japanese, even though he knew very little, he spoke again and noted he had the Japanese voice of Mikuru. With the Japanese mindset, he decided to speak some English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Da quik blown foxsu jumpu ova da razy dog\" he said in very broken English. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving a need to stick to his native tongue he mentally pictured himself talking English, and repeated again, this time noting the dub character's voice returned. He personally preferred subs, but the thought of speaking Japanese so well, and English so badly weirded him out more than having Mikuru's body. Time to dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided right from the start to go for the North High uniform, as he cared not so much for maids. First some nice panties which slipped on with little trouble. After struggling with the bra, he mentally search Mikuru's head, and decided to put her in partial control as far as dressing went. This was good as he new nothing about getting this sailor suit on. He was in control and not at the same time, it felt like that little voice in back of your head, or instinct that tells you what you should do. It was all controllable as Anthony tightened the light blue belt around the matching blue skirt, followed by pulling over the shirt. Straightening out the collar, he grabbed the ribbon from the shelf and expertly tied it into place. He picked the winter uniform, so his sleeves were covered. Turning around he faced the mirror again and grinned. He only watched a few episodes but could gauge that this expression was not fitting of Mikuru, as he tried a small demure smile, and big worried eyes. It was shocking how well he was able to copy her. Then again having this body helps a great deal. Returning to a more neutral face Anthony gave the mirror a once over. One-hundred percent Mikuru. Now what to do? </span></div></div>",

You nervously glance at another show's section ahead and then back at the one in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I try this out or go on to another show...? I'll look at another... No! Wait! This one's fine. What's there to be afraid...it's only Cardcaptor Sakura...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, nothing seems to rattle you in real life, and you often spoke your mind without fear of judgment. It's not that you're an inconsiderate big mouth or a rebel. You respect others' feelings, but hold no reservations voicing your opinion when needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and it's a good show. Nothing to be ashamed about no matter what the others will say.\" you reason while approaching a prop shelf. Picking up a partial deck of Clow Cards, you riffle through them absently; your mind in deep though. It was one of the first anime shows you've seen and got you hooked to the anime subculture. Regardless of the bad TV dub, you were originally captivated. Finding the original uncut episodes made you appreciate the joys of this cute series even more. Yes the show was made for kids, but you consider yourself a kid at heart. Regardless of the hackneyed phrase it is true. After all to see the world with child's eyes keeps things interesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be frank, keep it simple, enjoy life, and let no one bring you down.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose are words you try to live by every day. Still, it's hard with your bratty older sis egging you daily. Your other siblings are much better, but they too have a way of pestering and embarrassing you at times. Putting the cards back, you continue to pace around this section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they found out I wore CCS character I'll never hear the end of it.\" You're comfortable enough with your gender and proud to be a man. Still, you have no problems getting in touch with your feminine side. You appreciate the cute and sentimental parts of life. Nothing others could say would make you less of a man because of it, even if you become a cute magic girl...or one her friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat still did not ease your mind completely. If only you could wear male suits. You wanted so badly to be Syaoran and test out the boy's swordsmanship. Also, if only you craved a mature, sexy, or bad-ass type of woman character than it was more tolerable, at least to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But no one has to know if I don't tell. Anyways, I control the entrance to the warehouse and can use that as leverage if they do find out.

You and your sisters used to watch Fairy Tail together so you decide it might be fun to try her out. You take her off the rack and look for an opening in the back and you then proceed to put your legs in. Surprisingly the suit stretches so your legs fit inside. Next you stick you arms and torso in and finally you stick your head in and zip it up. The moment you fully zip the skinsuit up you feel the skinsuit tighten shrinking you to fit inside next you feel your chest inflate making D-Cup breasts. Next you feel a sucking feeling fron your crotch as you watch as your penis gets sucked in transforming into a vagina finalizing your transformation. Worried about what just happened you reach for your back only to find your zipper was still there. You then turn around to put some clothes on when a big machine catches your eye. You walk up to it and read the big label on it (Body Maker: make the skinsuit you wear your new body). Curious you step inside only for a door to close behind you. Then you feel a tingling sensation on your back, you then proceed to reach for your back only to discover that the zipper has disappeared. Next you feel your skin tingle as the skinsuit merges with your skin. After that the door opens and you walk out. As you where walkimg away you hear a \"Ding!\" followed by a \"Plop\" sound. You turn around to discover a hatch had plopped out a skin suit version of your old body. \"I think I'll just leave that there for now.\" You say as you walk away back to where you found the Lucy Heartfilia skinsuit . \"Well I better get dressed I dont want to be bare naked.\" You say. You then proceed to put on her white bra, panties and socks, her blue and white shirt, her blue miniskirt and brown belt, her black boots, and finally you tie a piece of your hair with a blue ribbon. \"I wonder what I should do know?\" you say.</span></div></div>",

You don't really believe these suits can do all the enclosed instruction book said they could, but they are still very well designed, almost lifelike, so you you still want to give them a try on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up the Vivian suit, as well as its hat and gloves.  You put the arms and head around your own, but you have trouble figuring out how your legs are supposed to go into Vivian's... Leg?  Tail?  What would you call it?  Whatever it is, you have trouble putting it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That book said I could control these suits with my mind.\"  You say with a bit of sarcasm.  \"Maybe I should ask the suit to help me put it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if it was listening, the lower appendage of the suit suddenly wraps around your legs, causing you to tumble over.  Then the suit seems painfully tight, shrinking your head and arms.  But it's nothing compared to what's happening to your legs.  They are pressed together until it feels as if you only have one leg, and you can't even feel the bones in them any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay there panting for a few minutes before trying to get up again.  Your new appendage makes it surprisingly easy.  You look yourself over, seeing Vivian's purple, shadowy skin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really worked?\"  You ask, in an adorable voice.  It would seem that it did.  Before you panic, though, you remember how that book said that unless you got pregnant, you could get out of the suits at any time.  Since the rest of the book seems to be true, you don't need to worry yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, what set of clothes are you planning to wear?</span></div></div>",

These suits belonged to the Broodals, a new set of villains introduced in the recently released Super Mario Odyssey, or at least the female members of the group. You know how the warehouse worked from the note, but you were still a little amazed that characters who were so new to the Mario series were already in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did rather like the Broodals during your time playing Odyssey, so you decide to try on one of their suits. After a moment of pondering, you decide to try on the Madame Broode suit. While Hariet did look more appealing, Madame Broode was so different from you in every way that it seemed enticing. She wasn't human and was a woman, traits shared with Hariet, but she was also older and... larger. Becoming her seemed like such a completely different experience from your own body that you couldn't help but want to try the suit on. You'd always be able to take it off if you decided you didn't like it, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how big exactly was the Madame Broode suit? Was it shrunken down to about the height of a normal person? Or was it accurate to its in-game size, towering several times taller than what Mario would have been?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you pulled the suit off the rack, it suddenly occurred to you that you had no idea how you were going to put this thing on. Laying it down on the floor, it was so large that you could probably fit inside one of its hands if you tried hard enough. It was accurate to the game, with her towering over Mario, but it made it a bit impractical to wear a suit of her, comparative to the other more human-sized suits lining the racks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, you figure it was still worth a try, so you open up the zipper on the back of the suit, strip naked, and step into it. You do your best to get your feet into the feet of the suit, the suit's legs pooling around your ankles. Your feet obviously didn't fit the suit's feet, but you managed to get them into about the right position. Next, you worked on pulling the suit's arms up your own like oversized sleeves. Your fingers obviously didn't reach to the ends Madame Broode's chubby digits, but you fit them into place anyway. You now had the bulk of the suit hanging from you, but thankfully, most of it was pooled on the ground around your legs, so you weren't holding up its full weight with your body. The only part of your body that wasn't in the suit yet was your head. Of course, just like the rest of the suit, the head was ridiculously large compared to you, but you did your best to put it on anyway. You tried to line it up so that you could see through the eye holes, even if that meant the actual top of the head was hanging behind you, and the mouth was hanging down near your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew you probably looked ridiculous, but you didn't really have a way of checking, because you certainly wouldn't be walking over to any mirrors with the bulk of the costume pooled around your legs. Instead, you opted to complete the process. You pulled up the costume's back until you could find the end of the zipper, and pulled it up until the suit was closed, a difficult task considering your fingers didn't fit properly into the suit's fingers. The moment the suit was closed, it began to work its magic. To an outsider's perspective, it would look like the suit was being inflated, like a balloon being filled with air. But for you, it was a much more uncomfortable experience. You could feel yourself growing, bones stretching and shifting into place, flesh bulging out of your body to fill the suit's folds. It was all rather unpleasant, but soon enough, it just stopped. The suit had finished its job, and the zipper disappeared from the back until it would be needed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were right about how different everything would feel. Although you could certainly see that you now towered over the other suits in the warehouse, that wasn't really something you could feel. You could, however, feel the rolls of fat falling from your body, the flabby breasts hanging from your chest and the void between your legs, the long, blue curls that hung from your head, the layer of fur that covered your body, the long ears that stood upright atop your head, and the fluffy tail that sat above your backside. You pat down your body with your chubby, four-fingered hands, feeling the soft, jiggly flesh you now possessed. It was a little offputting, having stayed mostly in shape yourself. You considered taking the suit off now, and trying out a different one, but ultimately, you endeavoured to stick it out a little longer, deciding to try and have a little fun with a body so different from your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't going to stay naked, though. Although your fur kept you fairly warm in the cold of the warehouse, you didn't really feel comfortable walking around naked, even if it wasn't your own body you were walking around in. You figure that you should go for the obvious choice of clothing, and just put on Madame Broode's clothes, seeing as most of the clothing in the warehouse was made for people much smaller than you currently were. You slide on the oversized bloomers, and are a little surprised to find no sort of bra amongst her clothing. Although in hindsight, with the way they jiggled around in-game, it probably should have been obvious that they had no sort of support. Next, you squeeze into the large red dress, stretching it in several places despite its size. It was uncomfortably tight around your plump body, you decided it was better than simply walking around naked. You finished off my putting on Madame Broode's various accessories; the gold spiked bracelets around your wrists, the pearl necklace around your neck, and the large pink hat atop your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout getting dressed, you'd managed to get used to the way Madame Broode's body jiggled with every movement you made. It was still a bit uncomfortable, especially with the dress tight around your body, but it didn't bother you as much. You paced back and forth a bit, getting used to walking around in an unfamiliar body, as you pondered what to do next. You could always go outside for a bit. You were kind of curious how it would feel to have the wind running through your fur. Of course, you were a little worried about having someone spot you, and start freaking out about a giant rabbit monster. Perhaps there'd be a way inside the warehouse to make it normal for you to look like this? And while you're at it, a way to make the door big enough for you to fit through. On the other hand, you could explore the warehouse a bit more. You could see over the racks with your new size, so navigating it should be a bit easier. You were pretty sure the note said something about a machine that should be able to put you into the universe of the character whose suit you were wearing, so that could be fun. Although, Madame Broode was one of the bosses of the game, and you weren't so keen on getting a Chain Chomp to the face, courtesy of Mario.</span></div></div>",

He pulled the suit up to his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was really getting uncomfortable. His manhood felt completely squashed as a painful feeling off getting kicked in the groin filled his stomach. He ignored it though and began to fit his arm inside the suit's. His more muscular arms stretched Malon's thinner arms out like a bag of popcorn. He brought the torso of the suit up to his and stared down the new cleavage in front of him. Finally the head was all that remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring through the eyes of the back of the mask part of the suit, Anthony closed his own and pulled Malon's face over his. When he opened them, it was like he was in a whole new world. All he had to was close the zipper in the back and he would become Malon. Fumbling for the handle, he grasped it and slowly worked it up his spine. Until at last the zipper was shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony waited for the longest few seconds until he felt something move in his body. His muscles bulged out, then there was a steam exhaust sound and all the muscles on his entire body slowly shrunk. He stared at his arms are they got smaller and more feminine. His hands shrunk to delicate soft woman hands. Any fat in his body lurched and spread to his chest and legs. The flat breasts of the Malon suit ballooned out in front of his eyes. His manhood no longer felt cramped, in fact he didn't think it was there anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the changes finished up he felt a twinge in his entire body. Slowly his world began to grew around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooaaah.\" Anthony said in a female voice that he guessed was Malon's as he shrunk down to near 5 feet.</span></div></div>",

It is Medli, the young Rito girl from The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. You always though she was sort of cute, but her suit seemed far too small for you to fit into without ripping it or stretching it like an inflated balloon. Still, you figured you might as well try it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take Medli's suit off the rack, and remove your own clothing. The suit had an opening at the back, running from the base of her neck down to just above her bottom. You slowly worm one leg into the suit, somehow managing to work your own foot down into Medli's bird-like one. It definitely wasn't comfortable; your foot felt very cramped, and the suit looked a bit stretched due to you being larger than Medli was. Medli's whole leg only ended up coming up to your knee. But you didn't let that deter you. You put your other leg into the suit, although it goes a lot more smoothly this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done, you bend down to put your arms into the suit. Medli's small hands balloon out as your larger ones fit inside. You try to stand up straight, as you had been hunched over in order to put your arms in while still having your legs in, and that's when the magic starts. Your back does straighten out, but instead of rising up, you body just shrinks inside the suit. Your limbs work themselves into place as they shorten in length to match Medli's and the limbs of the suit deflate back to their normal size as your limbs inside of them do the same.You feel a discomfort in your groin, as your manhood shrinks away, morphing into something matching what the suit has. Within moments, the world seems a lot larger, as you now possess Medli's body from the neck down. All that remains is to put on the head of the suit and zip it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull the head of the suit over your own, and match the features of the the suit up to your own s best you can. You reach behind yourself and fumble with the zipper with your now smaller hands. It takes a little bit, but you eventually manage to work the zipper all the way shut, and it seems to disappear after that. You'd be worried, but you should be able to take it off whenever you want, so the zipper disappearing shouldn't be a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocking back and forth on your small, bird-like feet, you take a moment to just take this all in. You now have Medli's entire body, naked at that. Her clothes sat on the shelf next to where you had gotten her suit from, but the warehouse also had the clothes of all sorts of other characters if you wanted to try them on. Although, now that you were Medli, you should be able to use her wings and fly, and that was something you were very excited to try out, clothed or not.</span></div></div>",

While looking through the section dedicated to video game characters, you see a subsection dedicated to girls from the Sonic the Hedgehog series. You've been a fan of these games for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne suit stands out to you: Blaze the Cat. You've admired her for her strength and no-nonsense attitude. The note said you can let a character's personality be in control if the wearer wanted, meaning you can watch that cool, calm, determined hero firsthand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, you can BE that cool, calm, determined hero!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou practically jump at the thought, and grab the suit off the rack, not caring if this is a prank. Without bothering to remove your clothes, you put your legs and arms into the suit, zip it up, then stick the head on. You feel a bit disappointed when nothing happens. You then realize that you need to take your clothes off first. You get out of the suit, take off your clothes, and get back in the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the suit seems a bit tighter. Then a lot tighter, tight enough to start reshaping you. Your body becomes lithe and slender, the excess mass magically squeezing into your tail, chest, and over-sized head, or simply vanishing entirely. You feel your skin covered in soft fur instead of a suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes, and see a small ball of fire in front of you. In fear, you jump back into the racks as the the orb disappears. You wonder where it went, only to have it suddenly appear in front of you again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitantly reach out to touch it, and find it doesn't burn you. In fact, it feels quite nice. You remember now that Blaze could control fire and couldn't be burned, and after you became her, now you can too. You mentally move the fireball about experimentally, before snuffing it out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing.\" You say in Blaze's voice. Talk about an understatement. Turning around, you see that there are mirrors behind each rack. You look at yourself, feeling a bit embarrassed about being naked, even if nobody is around except for the walls of staring costumes. You reach for the shelf next to the rack you got the Blaze costume from, taking her clothes and putting them on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much better.\" You say looking in the mirror again. You wonder how you can use Blaze's memories, but figure that that can wait till you've taken her form for a high-speed spin through her world.</span></div></div>",

You start the machine up, following the steps the machine gives you carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it asks you to choose what time to enter the series, you pick a week after the events of Sonic Rush Adventure.

You hear a hum from the machine, and feel a blast of energy, knocking you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up in a large, comfortable bed, in a dark, but elegantly decorated room. You look out of a large window, near a door to a balcony, and see the moon and stars shining brightly in the night sky. Turning around, you head to the only other door in the room, trying to figure out where you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you open it however, you open it too quickly, and accidentally knock over a koala in uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Assassins! Somebody sound the alarm!\" He hurriedly picks himself up off the ground and points his spear at you. \"You're not going anywhere....\" He stops when he gets a better look at you. \"Your majesty!\" He says with a tone of shame in his voice. \"Pardon me, your majesty. I'm a bit jumpy tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, Guardon.\" You tell him, Blaze's memories automatically telling you the captain of the guard's name. \"I'm feeling disoriented myself. I think I need a quick walk to get my bearings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you you wish, your majesty.\" Guardon says. \"Just be careful not to spook my troops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a thankful nod, and start your slow walk down the halls of what you guess to be Blaze's palace. Beautiful vases, plants, and statues, as well as decorative weapons and suits of armor line the halls.  All the doors are closed, and aside from the guards, there aren't any people, but you chalk that up to the fact that you are apparently up so late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you come back to your room, you can't help but wonder if you might get a chance to meet Sonic and his friends tomorrow, before remembering that Blaze lives a dimension apart from them, meaning the chances of that aren't promising. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But,</i> You think as you close the door to Blaze's room. <i>That doesn't mean I can't have an adventure of my own tomorrow!</i> And with that, you curl up into Blaze's bed and go to sleep.</span></div></div>",

You decide to start off with a shower, Blaze's memories guiding you the washroom. Like your bedroom, it is very large and elegantly decorated, with fine tile floors, large mirrors and beautiful paintings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take off your clothes and start up the water in the shower. It feels quite nice at first, but soon the water starts to weigh down your fur. Speaking of which, washing a body covered in fur turns out to be quite time consuming, and you go through three bottles of shampoo before completely cleaning yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you try to dry yourself off, neither the towel nor blow-dryer seem particularly effective. <i>How long does this take?</i> You grumble, tossing the towel to the floor before, in your frustration, covering yourself completely in flames, which ends up getting you perfectly dry. <i>Wow. That'll save me some effort next time.</i> You think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Still,</i> You think, as you put your clothes back on. <i>I wonder how anyone without fire powers has the patience to bother with washing and drying fur.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exit the washroom, ready to get breakfast. You head down the same halls you walked last night. This time, the halls are filed with maids, servants, and politicians scurrying from room to room, trying to keep everything in order.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the dining hall, where a canine maid quickly sits you down at a long table. \"I'll get you the usual, your majesty.\" She says, before leaving for the kitchen. She comes back a few minutes later with tray covered in fruits and pastries, all of which smell delicious.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thank her, and begin to eat. After you are satisfied, you put the leftovers into hammerspace for later. You then leave the dining hall and head outside to the palace garden where a lovely selection of flowers, hedges, and trees are on display. Ignoring them for now, you go to the palace gates.  Once you're outside, you wonder where to start your exploration.</span></div></div>",

You didn't want to catch a cold after all. Once that was done, you decided to look around. There were rows and rows of costumers, ranging from any kind of fiction you could think of. Turning a nearby light on, it really showed how much was really there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are all these here?\" You asked yourself, to no answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, you kept walking down, seeing if anything caught your eye. There were many costumes from famous anime and video games and such, so you had a wide range to look at. However, you accidentally slipped on a small rock, hitting your head hard on one rack, causing something to fall on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing your head, you looked at what fell on you. You looked up to see that the Fire Emblem section was above you, so you looked at what fell. It was an orange tunic of some kind, with some familiar orange gloves and black stockings. Your eyes widened once your brain came to the right solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Mia's outfit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia was a character from Path of Radiance, later appearing in Radiant Dawn. It was a great transition for the series to go from 2D to 3D, but that was beside the point. What were you to do now? You had this costume, but what exactly were you to do? Try it on? You looked back up to where the clothes feel on you, seeing a body costume with Mia's hair on top. Your mind entertained the idea of putting it on, but wouldn't that be weird? Still, there was no one here, so you could do it without shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing with that option, you stripped your clothes off, bringing the body suit to you. You tried inserting your legs in, which oddly seemed to fit, despite how Mia was younger than you were. Still, you took that as a sign and kept going, putting your hands through the arm sleeves. Putting your head inside and adjusting it, you reached down for the zipper, zipping it up as much as you could. Soon, it was down, and you had never felt more bizarre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I....AGH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, it felt like the suit came to life or something, as if crawling on your skin. The suit started suppressing on you, almost like a second skin. It especially pushed against your chest and groin, making them feel really tight. It started as discomfort, but soon grew into slight pain, causing you to fall to the ground, panting as you slowly felt them fade away. However, as they did, you saw dark hair fly into your face, causing you to comb it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened?\" You immediately clasped your hands over your mouth, hearing a voice much different from your own. You slowly forced yourself up, seeing what seemed to be average breasts on your chest. You blushed immediately when you saw them, as you pretty much knew what was between your legs by now. Even without the wind, it was pretty cold, so you immediately went over and grabbed her clothing. After getting on the panties and bra as best you could, on went the sleeveless orange tunic. The black belt that held her sword went on next, followed by the orange and black gloves. The shoulder guards were on next, which surprisingly wasn't too hard, followed by the black stockings and shoes. Finishing the look, you saw Mia's white headband in the back, putting that on as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, I'm actually her.\"</span></div></div>",

You began to wonder if you should just get out of this costume and leave, maybe come back in the morning. Then again, your parents would like to know where you were going, so that probably won't work. What were you to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, seeing yourself in this body was a bit appealing. Not that you were a pervert or anything, but Mia was really cute. She was a quick favorite of yours from the game after all. The fact that there was a costume such as this still felt so unreal to you, yet it wasn't really bad. However, that still left you at the question of what you should do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to look around a bit more, maybe even find a better costume if you came across it. However, you didn't seem to be in the mood for changing even as you looked. Eventually, as you turned a corner, something caught your eye. It appeared to be some kind of machine, with a containment unit and some keypad in the front. As much as your sci-fi instincts were telling you to stay away, your curiosity was stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" You walked right over, looking at the computer in front. You knew some things about computers, but not so much about code and the like. There was an option there, saying \"Transfer?\" with a \"Yes/No\" option. What did this thing do? Well, since you had come this far, you might as well check all of it out. You pressed down on the \"Yes\" option, with several lines of code appearing with a message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Confirmed. Please step inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile obviously a computer voice, you looked around to see what it was talking about. Suddenly, you saw the containment unit open, just like in the movies. You shielded your eyes from the bright light, looking inside to see what it was. However, the very second your whole body entered, the door slammed shut, shocking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?! Hey, let me out!\" You banged your hands against the door, but nothing happened. You soon heard the voice again, apparently counting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"4......3......2.......1......Begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou braced for impact as best you could, but all you saw was light as you blacked out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The note said something about \"suits\" and that they were supposedly very special and all. You didn't really see what the big deal was with them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might as well take a look around\" you decided and began walking around the warehouse. Almost immediately, you wondered over to the video games section, since that was your favorite anyway. Looking around, you could see suits made from many female characters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder if there's any Fire Emblem suits in there\" you wondered and looked closer at that particular section. Eventually, you found suits resembling the characters from that particular series. You smiled ad you discovered it and took a closer look. Your eyes eventualyl fell on one suit in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that Micaiah?\" you asked yourself. You reached a hand in and grabbed the suit, pulling it towards yourself. When you got it completely out, you saw that it was indeed Micaiah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMicaiah was a favorite of yours. In your opinion, she was one of the best Lord-type characters in the series. Not many seemed to like her, but you especially did. There was something very alluring about her, and she appealed to you. However, you noticed something else about it. The suit was naked, as in not having any clothes. Turning your head, you could see a stash of Micaiah's regular clothing next to where you got the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, not really what I needed to see. Oh well, might as well humor this thing\" you decided on. You remembered the note you found at the beginning but you decided that it would be best to try things out first hand. However, the first thing you realized was that you pretty much had to strip down to put the suit on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figures\" you muttered as you put the suit down and began stripping off your clothes. A chilld wind seemed to make its way in as your skin was exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brr, little chilly\" you said as you finished taking your boxers off, completely exposing yourself. You could only hope that no one else barged in while you were doing this. Putting that aside, you grabbed the suit again and looked it over. There was a zipper in the back. Without hesitation, you pulled it down, opening it up for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go\" you said as you slowly placed one leg in the suit to try it out. You knew that you were probably a bit bigger than Micaiah, and that might break the suit when you thought about it. However, your leg seemed to effortlessly fit into the legging of the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it's all good\" you said as you placed your other leg into the suit and placed it all the way in. Once that was done, you placed your arms through the smaller openings. To your slight surprise, they fitted in just as well. With that done, you pulled your head into the opening for Micaiah's head. Inside, you could see through the openings for Micaiah's eyes and mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, nothing out of the ordinary\" you muttered to yourself. You then realized that you had left the zipper undone in the back. Reaching back, you pulled on the zipper until you got it back up to the base of your neck, where it ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, is that all?\" you asked yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy, were you wrong.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't entirely painful but it was enough to make you fall to the ground, clutching your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! What the heck?!\" you yelled out, hoping for the sensation to end. As it was happening, it almost felt as if the skin was crawling all over your body, like it was becoming closer to your skin than it was before. You didn't really know what it meant but you weren't really focused on that, given your current condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as suddenly as it came, it stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou collasped to the ground, breathing hard. That was something you definately didn't want to feel again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that about?\" you asked before gasping. That was not your voice! Your hands went to your mouth, and you realized that they were smaller and more delicate than normal. Looking around, it didn't look like you were looking out of holes anymore. As you flipped your head around, long silver locks of hair flew into your face. Your eyes widened in realization after seeing the silver hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! This is....\" you started before looking down over your body. It was, in a sense, the same Micaiah body suit you had just changed into. Except, this time, the skin felt real. The hips, waist, breasts, hair, and everything else all felt so real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unreal\" you muttered to yourself in what you assumed to be Micaiah's voice. However, before you could think anymore of it, you realized that your new sensitive skin felt bitter against the chilly wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, clothes\" you said in a bit of a hurry. You didn't want to catch a cold or anything. You found Micaiah's clothes where you first saw them and laid them out. The first thing you needed were the undergarments, which composed of a white bra and panties. Nothing too out of the ordinary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a minute of figuring out how to get your breasts into the cups, you slid a pair of tight black leggings over your feet and legs and brought them up to your waist. The tights covered everything, even the feet entirely. Next, you followed it up with the pair of tan-colored boots, which also had a bit of a heel to them. You slim them up your legs, using the red lace to tie them around your upper calves and knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, you picked up the purple top that Micaiah wore and slid that over your head, making sure the dress part of it stayed down. You then wrapped a brown belt around your waist that helped keep it down. For your arms, you put on a pair of black sleeves that were fingerless and went up to your bicep. To top it all off, you took the large blue scarf and wrapped it around your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't really need a mirror. You knew by now that you looked exactly like Micaiah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unreal\" was all you could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you looked further in and noticed a machine there. It was kind of hard to describe but it certainly looked futuristic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that do?\" you asked yourself as your approached it. Along the way, you almost lost your balance, thanks to both the heels on Micaiah's boots and your new center of gravity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will be a pain to handle\" you grumbled as you walked closer to the machine. There laid some instructions as to what the machine could do. One of the things you noticed was that it could make this suit your official skin, therefore turning your old body into a new suit for you to turn back into later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good\" you said as you pressed the appropriate buttons to activate the program you wanted. Then, what looked like a laser shot from the machine, engulfing you in it's brightness. When it died down, the skin oddly felt even more comfortable. Then, you looked at the floor and saw what was your old body, laying as a plain body suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, so this stuff does work\" you said out loud. This was somewhat confusing but getting pretty cool that you could take these forms whenever you wished like this. Getting it out of the way, you placed your old body suit with your old clothes in the same spot where you got Micaiah's suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what do you do?</span></div></div>",

You were interested in seeing more of what it could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's this?\" you asked yourself, pressing another button on the machine. However, while you figured out how to swap your skin out, you had no idea what this button did. You probably should have waited to figure out what the machine does first. The machine began charging with energy, causing it to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't look good\" you said, taking a step back. Before you were about run and get away, the machine engulfed you in a burst if radiant light, blinding you and lighting up the warehouse. Then the light dissipated within the warehouse, you were nowhere in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****The Space between Worlds*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W...Where am I?\" you said hazily as you tried to keep your eyes open. All you see was swirls of light surrounding you. You couldn't really figure out what it all meant. Your mind was too hazy to think straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where.....am....I... going?\" you said with a soft voice as you closed your eyes and blacked out again, unable to stay consious any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****New World*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike when you felt like you were laying on clouds before, you suddenly felt like you had faceplanted on a hard rocky surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what hit me?\" you asked out loud as you slowly crept to your feet. You stretched your arms and legs, trying to get the aches out of your limps. You had no idea what that huge light show was about. However, you would soon get your answer. As you stretched out, your eyes caught your surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou no longer saw the walls of the warehouse, or any city you remembered. All you saw were levels of wooden and rocky houses with numerous stairs connecting them all. You looked further upwards, seeing that the elevation seemed to get higher as you looked up. At the very top of where you see, a huge dark castle sat on the top. You gasped as you realized where you were. You were no longer at the warehouse, or even in the same country or dimension. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in Nevassa, the capitol of Daein!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kidding me!\" you almost yelled out, as your foot hit something on the ground. You looked down to see a bright yellow tome on the ground. Picking it up, you realized that it had to be a Light tome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...I'm now stuck in Tellius....and in Micaiah's body?\" you slowly stated out loud. This was almost overwhelming to you. While part of you thought it was cool to see Tellius up close and personal, the fact that you just thrust into a war that you could easily die in didn't make you feel comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you heard yelling and clashes of metal from nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's that?\" you wondered as you began running in the general direction of the sounds. After rounding around a house, you could see Edward, a myrmidon, fighting a bandit by himself. Looking over to the left, you also saw Leonardo, an archer, standing by and getting ready to strike from long distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must be in the Prologue. So, I'm stuck at the beginning of the story as a woman. Joy\" you muttered sarcastically.</span></div></div>",

How in the world would you stand a chance fighting in a war-torn country? However, you had to think about this logically. You were Micaiah now; essentially the de facto leader of the Dawn Brigade and the one who keeps morale up. You fleeing would screw that image up. Not to mention that it could also screw the story up, or end with you captured or dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalk about a lose-lose situation. You gulped to yourself and began to fun forwards towards the fight, all the while thinking that you were dead meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Micaiah! Glad to see you. A little birdy told me you'd be here. Yours actually\" said Leonardo, finding some time to talk to you. You smiled a bit, remembering him saying something like that from the game. Immediately, you shook your head. You had to stop thinking of this as a game. It's real enough, certainly enough to get you killed if you're reckless. Game over is permanent after all (especially in this series).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yune got to you? Great!\" you replied, trying to play the part as well you could. Although, being a girl who could see the future was as far from normal as you could get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if you're done chatting, perhaps you can help?!\" yelled Edward. You looked over to see them fighting a fighter, one of the stronger axe-wielders around. You knew that this had to be the boss, so Edward would have a little trouble with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go. You watch for any reinforcements\" you told Leonardo, trying to sound in command. It apparently worked because Leonardo nodded without hesitation and turned to watch for any enemies. You ran forward towards where Edward was fighting the enemy leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This is insane. How am I supposed to fight when I don't even know how to use this\"</i> you thought, referring to your Light tome. As you thought this, you reached a good point where you could probably land a long-range strike. Making sure the leader was too focused on Edward, you opened the tome, looking for some hints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gibbersh. Total gibberish\" you muttered to yourself. This was infuriating to say the least. You were useless in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhh!\" cried Edward, taking a cut to the side. It wasn't crippling, but he was totally wide open now. The leader smirked, assured of his vitory over the swordsman. You gasped and tried to think of a way to save him. As you panicked, your mind flashed for a split-second. Sudenly, you felt different, like you were still in control, and yet you weren't at the same time. Before you could think, words arose out of your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"O light, gather and open my path\"</b></i> you spoke. The language was unfamiliar to you, yet a part of your mind was able to translate the words. The gears in your head began to spin before clicking. It was the Serenes language, used for magic spells in this land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the command, a ball of light appeared above the leader before spearating into smaller strands of light and striking the bandit leader a deadly blow. He didn't even know what hit him before he collapsed dead on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe it. You actually did it. You used magic!</span></div></div>",

However, something more disturbing came to your attention. Seeing Edward about to be struck down seemed to ignite something within you, and it was like something guided your hand to use magic. Somehow, on the outside, you exerted a certain calm and started to walk towards Edward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What is this?\" </i>you thought as you approached Edward and crouched down to his level. Still on autopilot, you moved your hand to an injured spot on Edward and closed your eyes. You didn't know what was happening until you felt that same feeling fill you up before a light blue glow enveloped your hand. Going back to your game knowledge, this had to be Micaiah's special talent: Sacrifice, which healed most wounds. After Edward looked healed, the feeling of being on autopilot left you, and you felt total control again, leading to more confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks a bunch Micaiah! One more hit and I'd be finished\" said Edward, sheepishly grinning. You were a little annoyed that he'd be so casual about it. Then again, alot of young sword-wielders were casual, so he fit. You shook your head, trying to keep appearances up while you tried to figure out what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks lady!\" yelled a young voice. You turned around and saw a young boy and his mother. Remembering them from the game, you had a small conversation, which involved the mom saying that the Begnion Occupation soldiers were just allowing the bandits to roam free. Speak of the devil though, they appeared when the conversation was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You over there!\" yelled one solider, wearing the customary red armor of Begnion. You glared a bit at them, forgeting your worries for the moment, as you remembered how these soldiers treated Daein citizens like slaves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well, look who decided to show up\" said Edward sarcastically. Honestly, you wanted to take these soldiers out, feeling a little more confident after taking the bandit leader down. However, you felt a tug on your shoulder before long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Micaiah, we can't take them on now! We have to retreat!\" said Leonardo. You thought about it and nodded. You knew that you had to keep a low profile for a while. There was no Daein Army at the moment so you needed to exercise caution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll settle my thoughts on that way back\" you thought to yourself as you said good bye to the mother and son and left with Edward and Leonardo through the alley way, making for a rather easy escape, since there were very little soldiers to get away from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******Few minutes later******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we lost them. Too easy\" said Edward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't let youe guard down. We got to get back to the hideout. Hopefully, Nolan and Sothe will meet us there shortly\" said Leonardo, earning a nod from you. You needed some peace to sort things out in this strange world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Meanwhile******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhh!\" yelled a soldier as a lance was impaled through him, dealing a critical blow. The other soldiers cringed as their leader, Jarod, a halberdier and leader of the Occupation Army, withdrew his lance from the corpse and tossed it aside, blood leaking out. Jarod was mad to say the least and immediately ordered a search of the area, causing the soldiers to leave since they valued their life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they left, Jarod looked over the keep and grinned. This little event intriuged him greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Things were getting a little too dull here. A little fresh game is just what I need\" he smirked.</span></div></div>",

He checked it out and found that it could create suits. He experimented with it, and came to female Ike costumes. He figured that whoever created everything there had seen some pictures. He decided to create one of the Ike suits for fun, since it wasn't like trying one on could hurt anything...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suit came out and Anthony examined it as he took off his clothes. He was actually half a head taller than the costume itself, so he figured it'd be a tight fit. He was therefore kind of surprised when his legs and stomache slid in the spots they were meant to go in with no stretching, and only a bit of tingling. He noticed the same thing when he put his arms in the arms of the suit, and with that, putting the remaining part of his torso in. He finished by putting his head into the suit's head area as well. Then he zipped up the back, and was amazed at how natural the skin felt on him. He could feel the cold air, which was odd because he should have been hot in the rubber bodysuit, and he could feel his bare feet on the ground, which he also shouldn't be able to feel since they were also in the suit, along with his hair, which was longer and in a ponytail, on his back and shoulders. He lifted his hands and felt all over the bodysuit\u2026 and realized something, something impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw a full-length mirror in the corner, and ran over to it to have a look.

This began to make you wonder if you could find suits from one of your favorite series. That would be Fire Emblem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, would they have those here?\" you wondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through the rows, you were delighted to find exactly what you were looking for: a Fire Emblem section. There were so many, as you would expect from such a series. Looking through some all, one caught your attention. It was a bit hard to tell with the suits being naked not having complete faces, but there was one with pink hair that you recognized. Holding up one end of the suit, you could make out just enough to see that it was Marcia from the Tellius games. If you were right, this was the one from Radiant Dawn. It was an intriguing find, and holding up a bit of the suit made you a bit curious about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe I should....\" you pondered to yourself. This whole thing was kind of weird. Why would you try on a suit from his weird place and all? Then again, you had a certain curiosity about these kinds of things. With that in mind, you went and stripped off your regular clothes, feeling a little cool from the slight chill. Thinking quickly, you tried to put the suit on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, isn't she smaller than me?\" you asked yourself. However, the legging you put your leg in seemed to fit your leg perfectly somehow. Feeling a little weird, you took it as a sign to keep going, and you put your legs and arms into the suit. Adjusting your head into the suit, you were able to grab the zipper and zip it up to your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you did, a discomforting squeeze covered your body, making you wince and hold yourself as you felt your body being shifted in numerous places. You could feel an emptiness forming in your groin area as well as most of your body thinning out and small orbs inflating on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, the discomforting squeezing stopped, and you collapsed to the ground, slightly exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" you started before gasping and bring your hands to your mouth. Your voice was distinctly different now, and you felt short pink hair against your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, did I just...\" you trailed off again, realizing that your body just became Marcia's entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before you could think further, the slight chill made you shiver again. You got up and walked back over to where you found the suit, finding Marcia's Falcon Knight uniform from the game. How you managed to get all of it on confused you to no end, especially regarding the armor. Still, it was comfortable enough, if only to keep the wind off of you.</span></div></div>",

It was funny hearing it, considering that the games she was in had limited voice acting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, another question soon came. What to do now? You likely weren't going to go outside like this, so that was out of the question. However, there wasn't much else to do inside the warehouse either. What to do. What to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, you saw some flickering lights down another hall of the warehouse, coming from some kind of machine that you didn't recognize at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is something like that doing here?\" you asked yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked over, seeing the computer screen in front of you. Behind it, you could see some kind of containment unit, likely meant for someone to go into. You pressed something on the screen, instantly getting a \"Transfer?\" option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" you asked yourself. However, before much else happened, you ended up pressing \"Yes\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Transfer started. Please enter containment.\" appeared on the screen.

However, before you could get out again, the door closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Hey, what gives?!\" you cried out, banging on the doors again. However, they wouldn't open, and you saw a countdown. \"Uh oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Transfer in 3......2........1.......Start!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, everything around you went white, and you quickly passed out, not knowing what was happening to you.</span></div></div>",

They were suits! Tons and tons of suits, seemingly suited towards many games and shows and such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, if it wasn't so creepy, this would be completely awesome. I wonder...\" you pondered to yourself. You were wondering if one of your all-time favorite game series was here as well. The only way to find out was to look around extensively. However, as you had the series on your mind, you felt as if you were slowly being guided towards a certain destination. Shoving that aside, you found a shelf with exactly what you were looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fire Emblem! All right\" you said with a smile. As you guessed, tons of suits were there, all girls it seemed. One thing you noticed was that these suits seemed to be \"naked\" in a sense, with their regular clothes right next to them. You questioned this but decided to look anyway. As you looked at the many suits there, one stood out. You gently picked one up, feeling the soft surface as if it was living, and noticed the familiar face and long green hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lyn? Well, this is pretty cool\" you told yourself. That's exactly who it looked like; Lyn, a character from the first Fire Emblem released in the US. In addition, she was the first playable Lord that players got to use so she was pretty significant. As for you, well you really liked her character and personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, well, let's see what this is about\" you said to yourself. No one was down here with you, so you might as well use the suit. You striped off your normal clothes until there was nothing on and held the suit up. You pulled the zipper down and gently put your right leg through the legging. You figured that you would probably be too big for it, considering Lyn was probably smaller than you. However, it surprisingly felt comfortable, like a glove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis intrigued you even more, so you slipped your other foot in, feeling the same thing. Then you pulled the suit up, pulling your arms through the arms of the suit, feeling similarly comfortable.You then put your head in, adjusting it so your eyes and mouth were in the proper spots. All that was left was to zip it up. With some effort, you were were able to reach around back and zip it up to your neck.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't entirely painful but it was enough to make you fall to the ground, clutching your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! What the heck?!\" you yelled out, hoping for the sensation to end. As it was happening, it almost felt as if the skin was crawling all over your body, like it was becoming closer to your skin than it was before. You didn't really know what it meant but you weren't really focused on that, given your current condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as suddenly as it came, it stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou collasped to the ground, breathing hard. That was something you definately didn't want to feel again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that about?\" you asked before gasping. That was not your voice! Your hands went to your mouth, and you realized that they were smaller and more delicate than normal. Looking around, it didn't look like you were looking out of holes anymore. As you flipped your head around, a long ponytail of green hair whipped in front of your face. Your eyes widened in realization after seeing the green hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! This is....\" you started before looking down over your body. It was, in a sense, the same Lyn body suit you had just changed into. Except, this time, the skin felt real. The hips, waist, breasts, hair, and everything else all felt so real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unreal\" you muttered to yourself in what you assumed to be Lyn's voice. Sounded like what you would expect out of an older teen lik her. However, before you could think anymore of it, you realized that your new sensitive skin felt bitter against the chilly wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, clothes\" you said in a bit of a hurry. You didn't want to catch a cold or anything. You found Lyn's clothes where you first saw them and laid them out. The first thing you needed were the undergarments, which composed of a white bra and panties. Nothing too out of the ordinary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou first started with the dark green short-sleeved top, which went on easily. Following that, there was a pair of tights of the came color, likely to keep anyone from seeing the panties you wore now. Given Lyn's usual wear, that seemed like a good idea, so that went on too. After that was the main emsamble, Lyn's blue sacean clothing. You looked at it first, seeing how comfortable it seemed on the top, although it, of course, etending into the split skirt, which would reveal your legs entirely. You always thought of it as a wierd garment, but you had to do ti pretty much. You slipped it on over your head, pulling it down over your body. As you thought, it was pretty comfy on top, although how it revealed your legs made you blush in embarassment a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, you continued with the orange sash that tied around your waist, not leaving much empty space. Following up that was some socks and Lyn's brown boots. They were pretty comfy too, to your surprise. To finish it up, you wrapped Lyn's sword sheath around your waist and put her dark fencing gloves on your small hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't really need a mirror. You knew by now that you looked exactly like Lyn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unreal\" was all you could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you looked further in and noticed a machine there. It was kind of hard to describe but it certainly looked futuristic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that do?\" you asked yourself as your approached it. Along the way, you almost lost your balance, thanks to your new center of gravity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will be a pain to handle\" you grumbled as you walked closer to the machine. There laid some instructions as to what the machine could do. One of the things you noticed was that it could make this suit your official skin, therefore turning your old body into a new suit for you to turn back into later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good\" you said as you pressed the appropriate buttons, which opened a door for you. Following its lead, you walked it and watched it close. Soon enough, you heard the machine come to life and seemingly scan you from head to toe. It was a wierd feeling as you soon witnessed a bright light engulf you. When it died down, the skin oddly felt even more comfortable. Then, you saw the door open and step outside. You looked at the floor and saw what was your old body, laying as a plain body suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, so this stuff does work\" you said out loud. This was somewhat confusing but getting pretty cool that you could take these forms whenever you wished like this. Getting it out of the way, you placed your old body suit with your old clothes in the same spot where you got Lyn's suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what do you do?</span></div></div>",

You were in an underground warehouse, in the body of a video game girl, all during the middle of the night. Not exactly much to do from where you were standing. You had made this suit your own for now and neatly packed your old body on to the shelf. Now you just needed something to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, you began walking around, still having to get used to your new body, as evidenced by your wobbling and stumbling. It was a bit annoying, although you had to get used to it if you wanted to keep this body for a while. You might as well put it back if you can't get used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turned another corner, something caught the corner of your eye. It was another machine, bigger than the one you went into just a minute ago. There seemed to be quite a few commands, judging by the input board on the side. Part of you felt a little anxious around it, but your curiosity wanted to see what it could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly approached the machine, learning to balance a little better, and looked at the small screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Input command? What is this?\" you asked, pressing a button on the keyboard. At the touch, another command came up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Transfer? To where? And what?\" you asked. However, you wanted to see what would happen so you pressed the ENTER key on the \"yes\" option. At the touch of that button, the machine roared to life, making you flinch back a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh. Maybe I shouldn't have done that\" you told yourself as you considered running. However, there would be none of that as a bright light emitted from the machine and englufed you as you tried to shield yourself from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you end up?</span></div></div>",

You assumed that it was some form of training bra as they probably didn't have those in the medievel world. Nothing too out of the ordinary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst off was Tiki's pink dress that went smoothly over her small body. Pulling it down, you noticed how little of your legs it covered. Good thing the panties were actually pretty solid, covering your privates well. Following that, you found Tiki's pink scarf and wrapped it around your body. A red sash followed, you wrapping it around your waist. It was pretty long, often making you wonder how Tiki walked with it. After that, you found and put on some of Tiki's accessories, like the bracelets on her right wrist, the tiny red wrap around her left wrist, and her anklets that looked like something out of royalty. Following that, you found Tiki's red shoes and put them on. They felt wierd compared to your old shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo complete the look, you found Tiki's small dragon tiara. Smiling a bit at it, you placed it gently on your head, making sure it was on right. You didn't need a mirror now. You knew that you looked like Tiki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unreal\" was all you could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you looked further in and noticed a machine there. It was kind of hard to describe but it certainly looked futuristic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that do?\" you asked yourself as your approached it. Along the way, you almost lost your balance, thanks to your new clothing and long hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will be a pain to handle\" you grumbled as you walked closer to the machine. There laid some instructions as to what the machine could do. One of the things you noticed was that it could make this suit your official skin, therefore turning your old body into a new suit for you to turn back into later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good\" you said as you pressed the appropriate buttons, which opened a door for you. Following its lead, you walked it and watched it close. Soon enough, you heard the machine come to life and seemingly scan you from head to toe. It was a wierd feeling as you soon witnessed a bright light engulf you. When it died down, the skin oddly felt even more comfortable. Then, you saw the door open and step outside. You looked at the floor and saw what was your old body, laying as a plain body suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, so this stuff does work\" you said out loud. This was somewhat confusing but getting pretty cool that you could take these forms whenever you wished like this. Getting it out of the way, you placed your old body suit with your old clothes in the same spot where you got Tiki's suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what do you do?</span></div></div>",

You were in an underground warehouse, in the body of a video game girl, all during the middle of the night. Not exactly much to do from where you were standing. You had made this suit your own for now and neatly packed your old body on to the shelf. Now you just needed something to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, you began walking around, still having to get used to your new body, as evidenced by your wobbling and stumbling. It was a bit annoying, although you had to get used to it if you wanted to keep this body for a while. You might as well put it back if you can't get used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turned another corner, something caught the corner of your eye. It was another machine, bigger than the one you went into just a minute ago. There seemed to be quite a few commands, judging by the input board on the side. Part of you felt a little anxious around it, but your curiosity wanted to see what it could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly approached the machine, learning to balance a little better, and looked at the small screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Input command? What is this?\" you asked, pressing a button on the keyboard. At the touch, another command came up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Transfer? To where? And what?\" you asked. However, you wanted to see what would happen so you pressed the ENTER key on the \"yes\" option. At the touch of that button, the machine roared to life, making you flinch back a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh. Maybe I shouldn't have done that.\" you told yourself as you considered running. However, there would be none of that as a bright light emitted from the machine and englufed you as you tried to shield yourself from it. Before too long, you had vanished from sight at the warehouse, heading for somewhere far away. Very far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt like you were floating in a black void, hardly able to think straight. You could only wonder what you were in for before you black out completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you end up?</span></div></div>",

There was only a tiny light illuminating the place, but you could see that there were selves of.....stuff everywhere. You walked over and tried to pick up what was there. What is was surprised you. They were suits! Tons and tons of suits, seemingly suited towards many games and shows and such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, if it wasn't so creepy, this would be completely awesome. I wonder...\" You pondered to yourself. You were wondering if one of your all-time favorite game series was here as well. The only way to find out was to look around extensively. However, as you had the series on your mind, you felt as if you were slowly being guided towards a certain destination. Shoving that aside, you found a shelf with exactly what you were looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fire Emblem! All right\" You exclaimed with a smile. As you guessed, tons of suits were there, all girls it seemed. One thing you noticed was that these suits seemed to be \"naked\" in a sense, with their regular clothes right next to them. You questioned this but decided to look anyway. As you looked at the many suits there, one stood out. You gently picked one up, feeling the soft surface as if it was living, and noticed the familiar face and long blue hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, isn't this Lucina?\" You wondered aloud. That's exactly who it looked like; Lucina, a character from Fire Emblem: Awakening, you really liked this girl. She was kind, had a strong sense of duty, and was just all around great, especially for a female Lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, well, let's see what this is about.\" You said to yourself. No one was down here with you, so you might as well use the suit. You stripped off your normal clothes until there was nothing on and held the suit up. You pulled the zipper down and gently put your right leg through the legging. You figured that you would probably be too big for it, considering Lucina was probably smaller than you. However, it surprisingly felt comfortable, like a glove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis intrigued you even more, so you slipped your other foot in, feeling the same thing. Then you pulled the suit up, pulling your arms through the arms of the suit, feeling similarly comfortable.You then put your head in, adjusting it so your eyes and mouth were in the proper spots. All that was left was to zip it up. With some effort, you were were able to reach around back and zip it up to your neck.</span></div></div>",

Something was going on with this suit, and you felt as if ants were crawling up your skin. Suddenly, the skin felt like it began to tighten, forcing some discomfort. Your teeth grinded together as you tried to get through it. Through this, you were able to raise a shaking hand to to your face. However, your eyes widened in shock as the hand began to look natural, not like a hand in a suit. This feeling extended to your other hand, as well as both of your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your mind raced to comprehend this, a pressure began forming in your chest. You looked down in horror to see the two formorly lifeless breasts come to life, filling up in front of you. Your hands raced to cover them, and you were shocked to feel how real they now were, like you really had them. This compressing feeling extended down your legs, and then down to your feet, making the suit overtop feel real. A similar compressin occured in your groin, as the suits womanhood forced on it's way into your own. Before another though crossed your mind, your head began to itch, as the long blue hair of the suit merged with you to become your own hair. Suddenly, it didn't seem as if you were looking out of a mask, and the face of the suit felt like it was your normal one. As your mind raced, the event stopped as quickly as it came, and you collapsed to the ground, briefly blacking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you came too, you immediately noticed how cold it suddenly felt. Wrapping your arms around yourself, the event from before came back to your mind, and you looked over your body in shock. No longer did your body look masculine at all. All there were was soft feminine curved and hefty breasts. A hand on your head confirmed the long hair that now flowed from your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did that just happen?\" You wondered aloud, before your hands clasped over your mouth. That voice was dinstinctly feminine, and you recognized it as Lucina's. Somehow, this suit had transformed you into her. Well, not totally it seemed, as you briefly touched your neck and found that the zipper was still there, although it felt harder to pull down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you made the conclusion that this suit transformed you, you needed to get some clothes on before you got a cold. Going back over, you found Lucina's outfit from the game. The outfit was mostly blue like the game and you had not much trouble getting the clothes on, although the bra took some effort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, you found a mirror close by and looked at yourself. You gasped slightly as you saw Lucina's real form standing in that mirror.</span></div></div>",

Using in closer, you could even see the Brand of the Exalt in your left eye, which thankfully didn't hinder any eyesight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thankfully.\" you laughed gently to yourself. However, right as you said that, you heard knocking. Very loud knocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Anthony! You in there?!\" yelled a male voice. You jumped a bit since you recognized it instantly. It was James, your friend and fellow video game fan who came with your family. How did he find this place? Did he see you come in?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anthony!!\" he knocked even louder. James was quite insistent when he wanted to be. You sighed and looked yourself over again. Did you want to reveal yourself to him like this? Lucina was James' favorite female Fire Emblem lord, but even he would this bizarre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it might be a good surprise for him.\" you said as you walked towards the door, getting a grasp for walking with the new body. As James kept knocking, you slowly opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\" you said nonchalantly in Lucina's voice. As you thought, James was standing right there, and the guy was stunned in shock at what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What the....\" he started. Before he could continue though, you looked around, not seeing anyone else, and shushed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story, just get in before anyone else comes.\" you said quickly as you grabbed James' arm and pulled him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****One long explanation later*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, so that's the story.\" sighed James, after hearing your explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You obviously believe me right?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, the proof is right in front of me. If I do say, you do have good taste.\" smiled James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny.\" you sighed. Then you turned to him again. \"Hey, let's pick one out for you. Let's have some fun with this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....sure, but which one?\" asked James, a bit more careful on this than you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you had one in mind.</span></div></div>",

I certainly hope that doesn't effect you.\" James smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny.\" you rolled your eyes at him. However, you were positive that had nothing to do with it, so you got to where you were looking and grabbed a suit. Smirking, you walked over to James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go.\" you said with a smile, tossing the suit to him. James caught it, and immediately recognized it by the long, flowing red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cordelia? Why her?\" he asked. You figured he would guess correctly. He played the game as much as you did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? You like her right? You groaned for hours about how she was portrayed.\" you said in a matter-of-fact way of speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah. Whose bright idea was it to make her another Catria? She got snubbed big time.\" defended James. You kept smirking at him, which quite honestly, looked wierd on Lucina's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then you have your answer. Try being her yourself.\" you reasoned. James still looked unsure. Who wouldn't be, given the bizarreness of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, you win. Just don't laugh.\" said James. With that, James tripped his own clothes off, although he asked you to turn away. Your response was that you were both guys, although James was quick to say that he didn't see two guys here. Shrugging, you gave in and turned away. James was always insecure about that kind of stuff. Just the kind of guy he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so now the zipper, right?\" he asked. You responded by saying yes. Soon enough, you heard the zipping of the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so now what....\" James started to say before he felt the suit conforming against him. Just like you, he felt the discomfort and nearly fell to the ground. Wanting to help him out, you ran over and helped him stay upright, as you could see the suit forming his new womanly assets against his body. James felt his body twist and turn into Cordelia's hourglass form, and soon felt her long red hair flowing against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like with you, it was soon over. As James layed on the floor, breathing hard and shivering slightly from the cold air, you immediately ran over and grabbed Cordelia's pegasus knight uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, befoe you catch a cold.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute or so later, you helped James put on Cordelia's red uniform and white armor, becoming a replica of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...is unreal.\" James said, gasping slightly as his new voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, right?\" you smiled at him.</span></div></div>",

James had taken some time to get used to Cordelia's body. As one might expect, the armor felt pretty strong, but also light. Probably ideal for a pegasus knight. Of course, kind of like the others, Cordelia's boots sported some heels, which James was trying to get himself used to right now. You also found a brave lance (the same lance in Cordelia's artwork) nearby and gave it to James. He was trying it out a bit, with some difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This thing isn't light.\" panted James, tucking his lond hair behind his ear. \"And how does she fight with all this hair anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't look that bad. Could be worse.\" you said nonchalantly. James groaned at you in response. Turning away from James for a minute, you noticed something in the back. There seemed to be a machine. It wasn't too big, but probably around your size at least. There seemed to be some container that could probably one of you in there as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey James, quit hurting yourself and get over here!\" you yell over at James. He had just missteped and landed on his butt, getting up gingerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow.\" he groaned as he walked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you keep that up and you might give Sumia a run for her money.\" you grinned at James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up.\" he retorted. After that, you both took a look at the machine, neither of you knowing what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how about we set something and get in there?\" you asked James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you nuts? What if it kills you or something?\" James spat out. You rolled your eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess giving you Cordelia's body was perfect after all. You're a real worrywort, just like her.\" you began to laugh, making James pout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but don't cry to me if something goes bad.\" said James. Nodding, you looked at the screen. There seemed to be a default setting, with the screen asking for a \"Yes\" or\"No\" answer to \"Go in?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go into what?\" James asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's find out.\" you said, clicking \"Yes\" on the screen. The next command was \"Please step inside containment unit\", to which the pod behind the screen opened up. You immediately walked to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get me out if things go wrong right?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure.\" said James, rolling his eyes, which actually looked kind of cute on Cordelia's face. Anyway, the doors soon closed. James kept a close eye on the screen, and watched commands pop up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sequence initiated. Begin transfer.\" came up on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Transfer? Transfer where?\" asked James. Just as he was starting to worry, he heard the machine roar to life and a bright light engulfed him. It must have stayed that way for a minute or so, until the light dimmed down, allowing James to get back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What was that?\" he stumbled a bit. Looking over, he saw the pod die down and reopen. You were no longer in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anthony?!\" Hello?!\" James called out, but no reply. \"Oh man, where did he go? Should I follow him?\" James asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of him was worried about getting into a lot of trouble, but James didn't want to leave you behind. Deciding that it was worth it, James repeated the commands and got in himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy, I hope this isn't a huge mistake.\" said James as he closed his eyes, braced himself, and found himself engulfed by light again.</span></div></div>",

The shock seemed to get James' eyes to open, immediately being exposed to a searing sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh....what?\" James said meekly. However, he looked up and saw a young man with blue hair standing over him. It barely took a second for James to see who it was. It was Chrom, the main character of Fire Emblem Awakening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" James then almost screamed out, getting him to sit up. Feeling something weird on him, he looked down, seeing himself in a red Pegasus Knight uniform. He remembered going into Cordelia's body a while ago, but the last few moments were all foggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright? You took quite a hit there.\" said Chrom, offering a hand to James. James was still stunned silent but he accepted the hand and got to his feet, stumbling a big on his heeled boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....I think I'm fine..What happened?\" asked James, looking around. He was in some kind of valley, with other members of Chrom's army scattered about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fainted. After we defeated the enemy, you passed out on the ground. I think the shock of what happened was too much for you.\" said Chrom, a sympathetic smile on his face. James shook his head a bit, trying to get any cobwebs out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, I see.\" he said slowly. Was he in the game now? Was that what that machine was for? If he had to guess, this place looked similar to Chapter 7: Incursion, when Cordelia first appeared. If that was the case, then he just came in after the battle was over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm actually in Ylisse?! Holy cow!\" </i>thought James, not sure whether to be excited or scared. With that in mind, he looked down and saw his Brave Lance at his feet, so he picked that off the ground. He could even spot Cordelia's pegasus a ways away, getting tended to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happened after I passed out?\" asked James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Emmeryn has gone back to Ylisse. We're to head back to Regna Farox to request reinforcements.\" said Chrom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So it is right after the battle.\"</i> thought James. He tried to compose himself a bit. He now knew where he was and what was going on. Of course, looking around, he couldn't see Anthony anywhere. If he was Cordelia here, then Anthony had to be Lucina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"If he's here too, I wonder what he's up too.\"</i> thought James. With that, he turned to Chrom, his Brave Lance still in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do you when we're leaving? Regna Farox is a long ways away.\" said James, trying to be in character. Cordelia was known for being very efficient in her work and always on top of things. He didn't want anyone to find him weird. Chrom gave him a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very soon. Just about ready to go. Make sure you're ready, although I imagine that won't be a problem.\" said Chrom. James gave a sheepish smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....yeah. No problem.\" he said, sighing after Chrom left him to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just entered a war zone in Ylisse, and as a woman on top of that. Was there a way back? Could he really die here?\" The thought chilled James to the core. He could only hope that those fears wouldn't come to pass. He began walking, getting more used to the heels, and approached Cordelia's pegasus. James didn't have much experience with any animals, but he tried what he hoped would be best. He tried to pet the mount, which responded by rubbing against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, well that wasn't too hard.\" James smiled. Things could be looking up if this was any indication. Although, he didn't even know the mount's name, which could be a problem. However, right at that moment, a sudden voice made him a few feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi Cordelia! Are you feeling better?\" said a chipper female voice. James turned around and saw Sumia behind him. Sumia was another Pegasus Knight, although known more for clumsiness than skill. However, she was great with animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....uh, hi.\" said James, still reeling from her sudden introduction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Khan looks happy to see that you're okay. He got quite fussy when you collapsed.\" said Sumia. James nodded at what apparently was the pegasus's name, thankful to know what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well I'm sure.\" said James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a minute later, he heard Chrom's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, time to move out! We head for Regna Farox immediately!\" commanded Chrom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the journey was under way.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With Emmeryn believed to be safe in Ylisstol, James marched with Chrom's army towards Regna Ferox, the largest nation on the continent of Ylisse and ruled by the two Khans, Basilio and Flavia, with Flavia currently the full ruler. James didn't know what to expect from suddenly going from an average guy to a soldier in the army. The distance to Regna Ferox wasn't short, and the nation was generally pretty cold on top of that. As they were marching along, James could swear her legs felt like jelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You all right?\" Sumia, who was walking alongside James, asked in concern. Sumia had stuck by James' side, being the friend she was. James was happy for the company, as it allowed her some ease despite having to be another person entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm okay.\" James replied, trying to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's good. I remember how you told me that you're a lousy runner, so I wanted to be sure.\" Sumia said. James flinched as she remembered Cordelia saying that she became a pegasus knight because she was a lousy runner. James almost blushed at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't too bad. I just need to get used to it.\" James said in her defense. Sumia smiled and nodded. Then, she seemed to have some sort of inspiration and drew James close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you should talk to Chrom when you get the chance.\" said Sumia. James went as red as her uniform at the thought. She remembered that Cordelia didn't have any conversations with Chrom in the game, no supports or anything (outside one in a DLC). Obviously, it was due to her shyness and inability to put her feelings into words<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you say that?\" James asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've gone through so much, and I think he could help you.\" Sumia replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that's true.\" James conceded, saying it kind of slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like he's busy with Anthony right now. Perhaps you can talk with him tonight when we set up camp. I know you'll probably be the first one all set up.\" Sumia said with a smile. James went red again at the compliment as she looked towards Chrom upon hearing Anthony's name, only to see the Avatar that most resembled her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" She said softly, while wondering about the connection between the group's tactician and her friend. Man, was it weird having to deal with a woman's body like this. It was one of the reasons why James hadn't talked to anyone other than Sumia since they started marching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Later that day (at camp)*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom had decided to set up camp near the highroad as the sun began to set. Many were relieved to get some rest, although some still had energy to burn, like Sully. Another Shepherd, Stahl, ended up having to keep her restrained. As they set up camp, as Sumia actually predicted, James had her part of the camp all set up very quickly. It felt like a blur to her, like something came out from inside her and guided her body. It felt weird, yet good at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Maybe it's some natural instinct of her body or something.\" </i>She thought to herself. Having Cordelia's sense of responsibility could come in handy. However, she kind of dreaded having to go through with Sumia's suggestion of talking with Chrom. Not just because of Cordelia's shyness to talk to him, but partially because of her own to talk to the commander of an army.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess there's no time like the present though.\" She said, leaving her supplies all ready to go and trying to find Chrom.</span></div></div>",

You go to the Awakening set of suits, and you happen to spot a particular suit, that of a certain black haired woman who you know well, Tharja. Tharja is all around darker in every way than any non-Henry character who can be recruited into Chrom's army, and originally joined Chrom's army because she didn't care one way or the other about the conflict between Plegia and Ylisse, and she was angry at being ordered by the king of Plegia to kill all the Ylissean people who were attempting to rescue Emmeryn. Shortly after, she had a dream where the Avatar took advantage of her body and promised to marry her, and in her warped mind, she decided to hold the real Avatar to it (this was only revealed in Japanese media) and fell for him, and began stalking him, doing everything in her power to try to win his heart, along with it being heavily implied that she wanted him to do in real life what his dream self did. You decide that you want to become her, and wonder how she'd react to that thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou undress and pick up the Tharja suit. Even deflated, you can clearly see the assets that gave her the title of \"the one with the best body\" in the Japanese version. You turn it to face away from you and pull the opening open wide. You place your right leg inside her right leg, expecting resistance due to size difference, only to find that your foot slips in as easily as putting on a glove, as well as feeling like that part of the suit really is your skin. You quickly slip your left leg in, and pull the suit up to your waist. You note an emptiness at your crotch where your penis usually is as you put your arms in, and pull it up to your chest, attaching Tharja's breasts to your chest, which causes them to inflate to full size. You give a quick squeeze, and feel a moistness down below, before shaking your head and getting back on track. You grab the head of the suit, and plung your head in, arranging your facial features to line up with Tharja's. Upon completing this task, you find that you don't seem to be looking out of the eyeholes of a mask. You turn your head quickly, whipping your new hair into your face. You take your dainty new hand, and move the hair out of the way, then you stare at it in amazement, before finding a mirror and looking in. The Tharja in the mirror looks back at you with an amazed look on her face. You give a wide grin, which looks odd on Tharja's face, so you shift it to one of Tharja's smirks as you put a hand on your hip. You start to play arround with expressions and poses, before taking note of how chilly the air is on your naked skin. You go over to the outfits, and you see several different ones, ones for each of the outfits she can class change into (including the Bride class's wedding dress), but decide to put on Tharja's default Dark Mage outfit, The skintight bodysuit goes on easily enough, all things considered, and you follow with everything that goes overtop of it. After securing the cloak/cape, you pick up the headrest and put it on. You pick up a random Dark Magic tome to complete the look, and head back to the mirror. You do a quick twirl, followed up by Tharja's giggle just for the heck of it, before bursting out laughing. As you calm down, you consider what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

You try to reach out and cling to a nearby the shelf, but soon find your legs have gone numb. And upon falling to the floor you black out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awake to find yourself standing upright. You try to look around, but find you are not in control of your body.

Here, let's try thirty jumping jacks, followed by forty curl ups.\" The man says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-forty?

You think, but are unable to express it in any way, but regardless, your body continues to act on its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, Tharja, you must be fit if you want to be useful in a fight.\" The man who you now recognize as none other than the over protective knight Fredrick says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait if that's Fredrick, and he's talking to Tharja...oh crap!' You mentally gulp upon the realization. 'How the heck did I get here?

This began to make you wonder if you could find suits from one of your favorite series. That would be Fire Emblem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, would they have those here?\" you wondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through the rows, you were delighted to find exactly what you were looking for: a Fire Emblem section. There were so many, a s you would expect from such a series. Looking through some all, one caught your attention. It was a bit hard to tell with the suits being naked not having complete faces, but there was one with blonde hair that you recognized. It was Lissa from Fire Emblem: Awakening, and one of your favorite characters in the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe I should....\" you pondered to yourself. This whole thing was kind of wierd. Why would you try on a suit from his wierd place and all? Then again, you had a certain curiosity about these kinds of things. With that in mind, you went and stripped off your regular clothes, feeling a little cool from the slight chill. Thinking quickly, you tried to put the suit on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, isn't she smaller than me?\" you asked yourself. However, the legging you put your leg in seemed to fit your leg perfectly somehow. Feeling a little weird, you took it as a sign to keep going, and you put your legs and arms into the suit. Adjusting your head into the suit, you were able to grab the zipper and zip it up to your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you did, a discomforting squeeze covered your body, making you wince and hold yourself as you felt yoru body being shifted in numerous places. You could feel an emptiness forming in your groin area as well as most of your body thinning out and small orbs inflating on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, the discomforting squeezing stopped, and you collapsed to the ground, slightly exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" you started before gasping and bring your hands to your mouth. Your voice was pretty different now, and you felt long blonde hair at your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, did I just...\" you trailed off again, realizing that your body just became Lissa's entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before you could think further, the slight chill made you shiver again. You knew that you didn't want to catch a cold in this dank place, so you looked back at the shelf and found Lissa's default Cleric gear. You quickly grabbed it and tried to put it on, although the metal garment that went under the dress felt weird. Still, you got it on, even putting on her headdress and arranging your hair in Lissa's signature ponytails.</span></div></div>",

The full impact of now being in Lissa's body hit you, with your mind still trying to accept it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I actually look like this now.\" you spoke, noticing how Lissa's voice now came out of your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, another question soon came. What to do now? You likely weren't going to go outside like this, so that was out of the question. However, there wasn't much else to do inside the warehouse either. What to do. What to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, you saw some flickering lights down another hall of the warehouse, coming from some kind of machine that you didn't recognize at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is something like that doing here?\" you asked yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked over, seeing the computer screen in front of you. Behind it, you could see some kind of containment unit, likely meant for someone to go into. You pressed something on the screen, instantly getting a \"Transfer?\" option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" you asked yourself. However, before much else happened, you ended up pressing \"Yes\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Transfer started. Please enter containment.\" appeared on the screen. At that, you saw the containment unit open, allowing you access. You looked inside, wanting to see what was up about it. However, before you could get out again, the door closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Hey, what gives?!\" you cried out, banging on the doors again. However, they wouldn't open, and you saw a countdown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Transfer in 3......2........1.......Start!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, everything around you went white, and you quickly passed out, not knowing what was happening to you.</span></div></div>",

You felt a chill wind around you, although it wasn't as nippy as before. Not only that, but you felt warm rays of sunshine bearing down on you. Your eyes slowly stirred open, seeing a clear sunlit sky above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Is it morning already?\" you asked yourself. You got an answer soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Lissa! Time to wake up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately jumped at the call, seeing that you were just laying in a field, specifically around a campsite. You could see what remained off a campfire just smoldering a little bit away from you. You gave a confused look. Where were you right now? And why were you just referred to as Lissa? Surely this was still just a costume right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lissa, are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the voice to your left and turned, gasping as you did. Standing right there was Chrom, Prince of Ylisse. Looking down, you were definitely still in the Lissa costume, and he was referring to you as such. But how did this happen? You were just in a warehouse just a while ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....\" you muttered, your brain all confused right now. Chrom gave a look of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess last night must have affected you a little more than I thought. I apologize.\" said Chrom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, for what?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you remember last night? We were attacked by those strange soldiers and that Marth fellow saved us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered how familiar that sounded. Awakening's Chapter 2 revolved around Risen appearing and \"Marth\" saving Lissa from one of them. Slowly, the gears in your head were turning. Whatever odd reality this was, you were somehow stuck just after Awakening's Chapter 2. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, yeah. Yeah I remember that. Heh heh.\" You tried whatever you could think of to get Chrom off your case. \"I, uh, guess I'm still half-asleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrom actually gave a sincere smile at those words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's good then. I'd hate to see what Emm would think if I brought back traumatized. You are the delicate one after all.\" he said, which seemed to ignite something inside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not delicate!\" you almost yelled, which surprised you. Where did that come from? Lissa had a line like that, and the way Chrom said it somehow forced that out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" smiled Chrom while rubbing the top of your head a bit. \"Well, Frederick and Anthony are all set. We should get going to Ylisstol. We still have to tell Emm about those weird soldiers, as well as the Plegian bandits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelping yourself to your feet, you saw Lissa's Heal staff to your side and picked it up. Problem is, you had no idea how to use it. How does one use a Heal staff anyway? Not only that, if you had no idea, the others might get suspicious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd wait, did he just say Anthony?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm Anthony.\" you muttered to yourself. \"Unless this world somehow modeled the Avatar after me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back with Chrom, what you imagined was true after all. The Avatar of this world was indeed modeled somewhat after your real world form. So now, for some reason, you were stuck as a Princess of Ylisse, and a healer on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy.\"</span></div></div>",

You've always had a bit of a thing for the 'punk rocker chick' look she rocks. And you do rather enjoy her dry, sarcastic humor. You pick the suit up; the artificial skin is not warm to touch, but holds a lifelike texture to it. The thing is deflated, but even like that you can make out its defined feminine curves, nicely toned muscles, and average-sized breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping it over, you can see an opening from the base of the neck to the pelvis. You're about to begin inserting yourself inside, but catch yourself when you realize that you're still dressed. \"Whoops.\" You mutter quickly, before shedding yourself fully. You start entering the suit again, this time in your birthday suit. As you slip your feet into the suit's and wiggle your toes, you're amazed at its elasticity -you're a good couple of inches taller than Paine, yet the suit stretches easily to accommodate your frame, though it is a squeeze. It takes some effort, but you're able to fit your limbs in the corresponding holes of the suit. You inspect your new body, which has been increasingly less uncomfortable as time passes. (Maybe this was just you talking crazy, but you're think the suit's beginning to shrink your body, little by little.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And for my finishing trick, I'll make Anthony disappear.\" You remark jokingly to no one in particular, looking at the vacant, fake-skin sac that is Paine's head; the final part of the suit. Taking a deep breath, you plunge your head into Paine's. You make sure everything's aligned: nose to nose, mouth to mouth, eyes to eyes, ears to ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up tall to look in the mirror, inadvertently closing the seam. You suddenly feel an enormous pressure begin to weigh down on you from all sides. Your body is changing, rapidly morphing into something different as your flesh is pinched and molded like clay. A hot and pleasurable feeling erupts from your core, and suddenly you feel naked again. Your eyes blink open. You walk towards the mirror a few feet away and inspect yourself. You gasp, and a female voice exits your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, staring back at you from the mirror with a wide-eyed expression that is no doubt on your face is well, is Paine. Quickly composing yourself, you smirk -just as the real Paine would- and quip in her voice, \"Ta-da!\" Hearing her voice come from your mouth, her saying what you want her to say... a shiver of pleasure runs through your body. For all intents and purposes, Paine is yours. You can make her do and say whatever you want...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you just gonna sit here drooling over me?\" The Paine in the mirror asks, no small amount of sarcasm in her voice. Though it's really you who says it, providing her with life, animating her like a puppet. \"Some clothes would be nice.\" The silver-haired woman in the mirror frowns, resting a hand on her hip and shifting her weight to one leg. This, too, has been you pretending, and though you make a good point, the prospect of self-pleasure while role-playing finds itself very erotic to you. On the other hand, you're also eager to see Paine in her full getup, and the cool air of the warehouse nips at your new skin.</span></div></div>",

With no hesistation, you take the naked Kairi suit from Kingdom Hearts 2 off of the shelf and wonder how you are going to put it on. Finally, you see an opening in the back. With that, you take your clothes off, leaving yourself naked. You have to admit that it feels weird putting on a naked girl's suit. Anyway, you open up the suit and begin to step in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Kairi is a bit shorter than you, so you wouldn't normally be able to fit in this thing. However, as you place your right leg in the suit, it slips right in like it is meant to be there. Your leg feels tingly as it enters the suit. Anyway, you shake that off and continue on. You think that it's just apprehention or something like that. You proceed to place your left leg in and the same thing occurs. \"This is strange.\" You say to yourself. Anyway, you slip the top half on. It stretches like elastic. Although, it didn't feel like anything you've had before. It's almost like... it's a part of your or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, you shake it off and fit your arms through their sockets and quickly put everything in place. Almost immediately, you stop right there. It's like you were actually a girl. For some reason, you felt an emptinees in your lower area and a weight on the upper area. Both were things that weren't there before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around for a mirror, and upon finding one, look in to discover that your manhood is gone.

The bra takes a few minutes but you eventually get it hooked on correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will never understand how girls deal with these things.\" You grumble to yourself. Next, you grab Kairi's white halter top and pull it over your head. It feels kind of tight against your body. Next, comes the mini dress. You bring it over your head and pull it down, placing your head through the opening which also contains a hood. The dress has three zippers on it although two appear to be decorative. The other, which goes right down the middle is zipped up from the botton up to under your breasts. Next, come the lilac shoes. You pick them up and slip them on your feet. You realize that appeantly people don't wear socks in the Kingdom Hearts series so, like Kairi, you wrap the shoelaces around your ankles. Then, you grab a black belt with some kind of book holder on the left side and put on. Next, you pick up Kairi's blue, black, and white bracelets and place them on your left wrist. To top it off, you find Kairi's necklace and put it on as well.

You pick it up and place it in your pocket for safe keeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing that, something catches your eye; some sort of device in a corner of the warehouse. \"What is that?\" You wonder as you walk over to it. You see that it is about the same height as an average human, with what looks like a laser on it.. \"What is this?\" You wonder out loud, not knowing what it was. You decide to re-read the note. Maybe it can tell you what it is. You run back to the note and pick it up. You read it over to find out about any devices. Eventually, you find it, \"Ah-ha\" you say. The note says:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is also a device that, when used, can imprint the suit that someone is wearing as that person's normal body. The result is the user becoming the character while their prevous form becomes a new suit in its place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, this device can make Kairi your actual body and turn your 'Anthony form' into a suit.

For an oversized key, it's pretty fun to use. As you are practicing, you spot a device in a corner of the warehouse. \"What is that?\" You wonder as you walk over to it, dispelling your keyblade as you do. You see that it is about the same height as an average human, with what looks like a laser on it.. \"What is this?\" You wonder out loud, not knowing what it was. You decide to re-read the note. Maybe it can tell you what it is. You run back to the note and pick it up. You read it over to find out about any devices. Eventually, you find it, \"Ah-ha\" you say. The note says:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is also a device that, when used, can imprint the suit that someone is wearing as that person's normal body. The result is the user becoming the character while their prevous form becomes a new suit in its place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, this device can make Xion your actual body and turn your 'Anthony form' into a suit. The thought was intriguing. However, should you do it? </span></div></div>",

That's your cue so you begin to walk into open view. The room looks just like it does in the games, with it's 13 towering 'seats'.

You kept Xion's personality in front, as to make sure that you didn't do anything you shouldn't. As you did that, you were in awe seeing Twilight Town in real life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost nothing like the game. Well, some areas were the same, yes. However, the place was so much bigger with places you never got to explore in the games. This awed you and made you smile on the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as one can expect, the mission was simply a practice run, meant to show the ropes of how things go. It certainly didn't help that Demyx didn't even have half his heart into it, that is if he had one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, this is such a drag. I'm so glad that we're finally done and we can RTC already. Oh, that means 'Return To the Castle' by the way\" groaned Demyx, as you and him were walking back to where you left the dark corridor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Sheesh, what an absolute complainer! Can't he whine in his head or something?'</i> you said in your mind, your face remaining stoic as to keep the facade up. It felt wierd allowing your body to move on autopilot in a way, and yet be able to think clearly with no problem. Funny how that works out. You hoped that, soon enough, you might be used to it enough that you wouldn't need to keep Xion's personality in front, but rather be able to imitate it yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, you and Demyx stepped through the corridor, the darkness having no effect on you thanks to the coat. You both emerged in the castle, the corridor closing behind you. It took you a second to realize that you never ate anything during the mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Do nobodies really not need food or something?\"</i> you thought to yourself. You turned your head around a few times, trying to see if Roxas had returned yet. You didn't see him, but Xigbar noticed and walked over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey poppet, you looking for Roxas?\" he asked, a sneer on his face as he did. You kept the stoic look up, seemingly not paying much attention to him. He chuckled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're kind of late. The kiddo already went to his room. Probably sleeping like a baby right now\" snickered Xigbar. You really didn't like this guy. From a video gamer's perspective, he's an interesting character. Meeting face to face, he was a bit annoying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot saying a word, you started walking away from everyone, not in the mood to talk (even if you wanted to). Seeing that Roxas was probably already in bed, you figured you'd head to your room. Another thing came to mind, you didn't even know what time it was. Twilight Town doesn't exactly have a good sense of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll never understand this place\" you actually muttered to yourself. You were alone, hence why you put yourself in front for now. Your throat felt odd and your higher voice cracked a bit thanks to lack of use. You allowed a small smile at your situation. Soon enough, you found a room with your name on it, or Xion's anyway. Without another second, you walked in and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, this will take getting used to\" you said to yourself, allowing yourself at least some time to act normal. Demyx's session with you only covered basics, like treasures and barriers and such. Things like magic would probably come in the next few days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also supposed that your body was following the games' physics, at least for a while. Despite having the keyblade when you were at the warehouse, you found that you couldn't summon it right now. You assumed that your body would have to learn it at the appropriate time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving not much else to think about, you took your gloves and boots off and got into the bed, since you doubted that there were pajamas provided. As you started to go to sleep (putting Xion back in front just in case), you kept thinking about what you should do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Well, I'm not particularly fond of killing myself later on. Maybe I can change things for the better, so me and Roxas can stick around'</i></span></div></div>",

Krystal is your favorite female character in the series (not counting how she acts in Command, as it isn't canon), and you were upset when you found out that she was only playable for a short time in Adventures, due to Andross trapping her in, ironnically, a crystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly strip down to nakedness, and begin to put the suit on. Your right leg easily fits into the right leg of the suit. You wiggle your toes, and see the it happening with the suit's toes, you also note that you feel as if you have fur growing from your right leg, not just being on your right leg, but growing from it. You put your left leg in, noting the same feelings as when you put your right leg in. You pulled the suit up to your groin, and then began to put your arms into the suit's arms, noting that you now feel an emptiness where your penis used to be. You soon have all of your body in the suit, with the exception of your head. You look behind you, seeing a tail attached to your behind, waving around casually, with no effort on your part, in fact, it feels so natural, that if you hadn't looked, you wouldn't have even noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach back with your new right hand, and rub your new appendage, and sigh in content at the pleasurable feeling that goes throughout your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wonder fur coved animals loved to be rubbed.\" You muse. \"That felt very good.\" With that final remark, you reach forward to grab the head of the suit, and you place your own head inside. You make sure that all of the facial features are aligned, and then you seal up the suit, the zipper disappearing in the process. You are now a naked Krystal. Of course, since you now have fur, you aren't the slightest bit cold, however, you want to see her in your favorite outfit of hers, the normal Starfox Assault outfit. You find it, and go to put it on, only to freeze in your tracks. You realize that if you're going to go into Starfox Adventures as you planned, there will be no point in wearing that outfit, as she wears a tribal kind of outfit in Adventures, so you'd be wearing that anyway. You're at a cross-roads, but you eventually decide to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal's Starfox Adventures outfit: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images.wikia.com/starfox/images/1/1b/Krystal.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://images.wikia.com/starfox/images/1...</a><br>\r\nKrystal's Starfox Assault outfit: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images.wikia.com/starfox/images/c/c3/Krystal5.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://images.wikia.com/starfox/images/c...</a></span></div></div>",

You quickly put on the Assault outfit, in addition to picking up Krystal's staff, and placing in its minimized form on your back like Fox does in Adventures, then you walk over to a full-body length mirror, stumbling a little due to the heels on the Assault outfit, combined with your new breasts, and look in it. You see Krystal looking back at you, a grin on her face matching one you've got on yours. \"Now, I've got to do something about my balance problem, plus, if someone sees an anthro fox, let alone one from a video game, they'll freak out.\" You think for a moment, and then remember what the note said. You tap into Krystal's mind, using it to learn how to keep your balance in this body, you then walk over to the main computer and look up any possible ways of taking care of your remaining problem. You find that you can use the computer to alter reality so that people believe that you've always been Krystal.  You alter reality so that everyone, with the exception of Randy, since that would defeat the purpose of showing him that you've become Krystal, believes that you have always been Krystal. You then walk out through the door, closing it behind you. Before going to Randy's, you decide to go back into your house to see the results of how things were changed. You get to your house, and go inside. Mia, your normally twin sister, but who is now a younger sister due to you having an 18 year old body, looks up and you and grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sis, you back from exploring?\" She asks, not at all wondering why a female fox girl is inside her home, or even wondering how it is possible that the child of two humans is a humanoid fox in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now, at least.\" You reply. \"I'm heading over to Randy's place soon, but I figured I'd stop by here first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\" She said before grinning. \"Too bad you're a fox and not a wolf; he'd be trying to get a date with you in an instant if you were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ok, so she realizes that I'm a fox, but doesn't think it's odd.' You think. You head to your room, and open the door. Inside, you find that things look pretty much the same, although slightly more girly, with jewelry on a stand in your room, and upon checking your drawers and closet, you find that your clothes have been adjusted to be worn by a girl of your new size and shape, along with female exclusive articles of clothing, such as bras, along with new outfits that you recognize as Krystal's, including copies of the one you are wearing now. You continue looking, and you see several skirts and dresses, and a closer look at your old clothes reveals that all of your clothes for special occasions where you have to dress fancier have been replaced by dresses of the same colors. While looking around, you see something that, if you were in an anime, would have caused you to sweat drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is with girls and shoes?\" You mutter, quietly enough to avoid anyone possibly hearing you. You're comment was directed at the fact that you saw several shoes in your closet. There were several kinds, sneakers, high-heels, boots, both knee-high and normal (high-heeled or otherwise for both), sandals, you name it, and it was probably there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave your room, and then exit your house. You walk down the street, passing several people, none of whom pay any attention to you, acting as if you are completely normal, even though normally they would be freaking out. You go to Randy's house, and knock on the door. The door opens, and you see Randy on the other side. His eyes go wide and he takes a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-\" He begins, before you cover his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make a scene; I'll explain everything to you if you let me inside.\" You tell him. Randy nods and takes a step back. You walk in and close the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, how are you here? You're supposed to be a fictional character.\" Randy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me, Anthony.\" You reply. Randy rolls his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right, like I'm gonna fall for...\" He begins, only to pause in shock as you, after making the zipper appear, unzip it enough to get your head out, and thus, Randy sees your head on Krystal's body. \"Anthony!? How!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found a warehouse full of suits of fictional girls.\" You begin. \"Putting on a suit turns a guy into the girl he's wearing a suit of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you chose Krystal.\" He says. You nod, pulling up the mask again, and re-zipping it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and I came here to offer to let you try on a suit as well.\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why me and not Frank?\" Randy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you like Star Fox more.\" You reply. \"We can go into the series of the girls we become, and I'd like you as back-up. Of course, you'd have to be Katt, since the other humanoid girls are non-canon, and I plan to go into Star Fox Adventures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good with that.\" Randy replies. \"Anything you need me to do before going to Sauria?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, find Falco, and convince him to go with you.\" You reply. He nods, and you both leave the house to go back to the warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait how did you get here without a fuss?\" Randy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a machine in the warehouse that alters reality, and I used it to make everyone but you believe that I was always Krystal.\" You reply. \"Because of it seeming to be how I normally am to them, they can't realize something is wrong, even though I'm a completely different species. Mia didn't even think it was a little odd that I'm a fox, when my parents are humans.\" You get to the warehouse, and while he is putting on the Katt suit after getting undressed, you go and switch outfits, and then you go to the device that turns suits into the actual bodies of the ones wearing them. You place the newly created Anthony suit on a rack next to your normal clothes, which you had put away when getting undressed, right as Randy finishes getting dressed in Katt's clothes. \"Alright, ready to go in?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Let's do this!\" Randy replies, Katt's voice coming out of her mouth. You both go to the machine to bring you into the series and enter different pods.</span></div></div>",

The most prominent suit on the shelf was, obviously, the Samus Aran suit. You decided that Samus would probably be the best character to test out the new power with. So, you took the suit off the shelf along with the Zero Suit that came with it.The suit was roughly your height and shape (aside from the curves, obviously), so fitting into it shouldn't be much of a problem. As your foot slid down into the corresponding hole, it felt as though the foot of the suit was becoming one with yours. Ignoring the feeling, you pulled on the rest of the Samus-skin up to your chest and slid your arms in, leaving only your head uncovered. With a sigh, you pulled up the hood-like head, complete with blonde ponytail, up and over and zipped up the back. Suddenly, the sensation you felt in your foot resonated to the rest of your body. It felt as if the skin was being melded into your own. Looking down, you saw the suit reshape your entire form; taking mass from your waist and distributing them to your hips, butt, and chest, forming Samus's sexy curves and breasts. Next thing to change was your crotch. The slight bulge in the suit disappeared and was replaced with Samus's vagina. Finally the changes moved to your face. You could no longer feel your own nose and mouth, but instead Samus's. You were now completely Samus Aran. Looking down, you see the body that you've seen in games for years, but never from this perspective. Still having a very male mind, you begin to get aroused by your new assets (or lack there of). Instead of the usual hard on, however, you felt a strange, yet good feeling in your groin. You could have some fun first, or put on the Zero Suit and explore.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You find one of the warehouse's computers. You examine the programs, and see that in addition to a more complete list of rules and instructions for using the warehouse and it's costumes, there are programs that can rearrange the order of the isles of costumes, search for which costume is in which isle as well as make new costumes of as-yet-unmade fictional girls, human or anthropomorphic versions of non-human video game girls, or even female versions of male video game characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about your friend Randy. Recently Randy had been playing though Okami, a game about Japanese mythology, in his free time. The protagonist was the sun goddess Amaterasu, taking the form of a wolf. You know Randy loves wolves, and loves the idea of becoming fictional girls.  Putting the two together by making an anthropomorphic Amaterasu costume for him would probably make him the happiest guy on Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly enter a command to make such a costume. Within seconds, a large machine nearby begins to hum. You walk over to it just in time to see it place the costume on a shelf, along with a collection of foods, scrolls, pots of ink, holy mirrors, beads and swords. Suddenly a computerized voice rang through the factory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is impossible to give the power of a god, so wearing the Amaterasu costume will only give you the power of a very strong spirit instead.  We apologize for the inconvenience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well, that's not a huge problem.' You think. 'After all, Amaterasu was cut down to that level in the game, so Randy should still be able to use her powers just fine.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over the costume, admiring its beauty. \"You know,\" You think out loud to yourself. \"It wouldn't hurt to give it a try out myself.\" You head to the computer again, commanding it to freeze time until you leave the Warehouse. \"Actually, it may be better if I try it on and show it to Randy. I mean, he might not believe me if I don't give him proof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remove your clothes, and grab the costume. You slip your legs inside, feeling them altering to stand in a digitigrade stance. As your waist slides into the suit, your penis vanishes with a strangely enjoyable feeling, as a fluffy white tail grows from your spine. As the suit covers you even more, you grow moderately sized breasts. Lastly, your head changes to that of a wolf, your ears pointy and your mouth and nose growing into a snout, with sharp teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a strong, distinct power within you, and to test it out, grab on of the blank scrolls and dip your tail in a pot of ink. Using it, you paint a picture of a seed dropping into the ground in front of you. When you stop and put the scroll down, you see just that scene unfold before you. Then the seed sprouts almost instantly into a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling satisfied with your abilities, but not wanting to leave a tree in the warehouse, you hold the scroll again, this time painting a sword slicing through the tree. When you put the scroll back down, the tree is suddenly sliced in half, and falls before fading away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the pot of ink, and see it is almost empty. You remember that the ink basically represented how much magic Amaterasu could use. It refilled gradually, but using too much of it at once would turn her mortal for a while. With this in mind, you decide that you'll limit how much you use your celestial paintbrush from now on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk back over to the computer. It's bit harder to type with paws, but you manage. You find a set of controls to prevent people from making a big deal of some of the stranger costumes. Using these you manage to warp people's perceptions of you, making it so that nobody but Frank and Randy will think anything odd about a wolf girl running around town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, will you head out to find Randy immediately, or do you have something to do here first?  </span></div></div>",

Do you where he might be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia strokes her chin in thought. \"I think he and Frank went to the mall to get some video games, or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mia!\" You say, running out the door before your sister has time to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wolf's body, you can easily run from your neighborhood to the city where Frank and Randy typically shop, without feeling tired in the slightest.  When you reach the mall, you look back for a second and see that wherever you had ran, flowers had sprung up as if out of nowhere. Shrugging it off for now, you enter the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost people ignore you, as expected, but some children stop and stare at you. Slightly worried something might be wrong, you ask the kids \"What are you looking at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just wondering why you're wearing all that red makeup.\" A little girl comments. You remember that Amaterasu's markings and weapons could only be seen by children or those that believed in Japanese mythology. You were pretty sure you wouldn't have to worry about that last one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found it in the woods.\" You say as you go on your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you reach Game-Stop, where you see Frank playing a demo of some game in the corner of the store, with Randy watching. With a grin on your face, you decide you'll have a little fun flirting with him to see how he'll react, before telling him about the warehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there.\" You say in a low tone. \"I heard one of you boys had a love for wolves?\" Both boys turn around, their jaws dropping when they lay eyes on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes...\" Randy said, surprised and nervous. You're a bit taller than him as Amaterasu, plus you don't see naked wolf girls running around that often, so you can't really blame him for that reaction, though. \"I do like wolves a lot.\" He paused. \"You look kind of familiar....  Are you Amaterasu?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin widely, very likely creeping Randy out, given your wider mouth's many sharp teeth. \"I'm glad you recognize me Randy. Though I wish your friend Anthony had told me how handsome you are.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrank stammered. \"Anthony sent you to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I asked him where I could find a boy who loved wolves with all his heart,\" You dramatically declare, \"as I have an amazing gift for such a boy.\"  You strike a pose of holding out a gift. \"So, are you interested, Randy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a look of elation on his face Randy nods. \"Sure...  Can Frank come along as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why not.\" You say, \"I just might have something nice for him as well.\" You turn around. \"Follow me!  And try not to get left behind!\" You say as you dash off.</span></div></div>",

Curious, you examine it, and find that it's a suit of Iris, from Megaman X4.  You figure that costume must be \"wearing\" the red and blue dress because Iris, being a reploid, didn't need to wear clothes, but was built to look like she was wearing them in order to seem as human as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suit is made of some kind of a lightweight metal and has synthetic skin on the face.  Wondering what it would feel like to be a robot, and having a soft spot for Iris, you try the suit on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't feel any different, so you so reach for your back to make sure the costume is on right, but realize that, rather than feeling your gloved hand touching your costumed back, you feel only your hand on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked.\"  You say in Iris's voice.  \"Wow.\"  You think.  \"The reploids were even more human-like than I thought.  I didn't even notice when the change came over me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice a purple crystal by your feet.  You pick it up, and suddenly something clicks.

Upon inspecting the many shelfs of suits, you discovered that they indeed were suits. It was kind of cool, yet also kind of creepy. There were suits of all kinds, from any series you could imagine. Naturally, being a video game lover, you decided to check out the video game section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So many to pick from. Whoever made this had a lot of free time\" you chuckled to yourself. Eventually, you found yourself in the Mega Man section. Being curious about it, you took a look at the shelf. When you did that, your eyes were drawn to a certain duo of suits. Bringing your hand over one, you saw that this one was the suit of Maylu Sakurai, a character from the later Mega Man games. Looking over, you guess that the other suit was her NetNavi, Roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, well I guess this could be interesting\" you said as you brought the suit up. Maylu was 11 years, so naturally the suit would probably be incredibly small to someone like you. However, your curiosity was getting the best of you, so you decided to try it on. At that, you stripped your normal clothes on, feeling a little chilly from the cool night air. You certainly didn't want to be naked for long. With that in mind, you unzipped the zipper in the back and gently put one foot in, partly thinking that you're crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the foot seemed to fit in like a glove, expanding a bit to fit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wierd\" you say but you decide to continue. You place another foot in and the same thing happens. You put your arms through each sleeve and duck your head into the head part. You adjust it so your eyes and mouth are exposed and begin to pull the zipper up the back. Soon enough, you zipped it right up to the top of your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you did, a searing pain ripped through your body, causing you to grab yourself and fall to the ground. Itwasn't the worst feeling but it was enough for you to groan in discomfort. The skin felt like it was crawling, moving over your body. A particular pressure began to build in your chest and groin. Opening one eye, you gasped as the empty little breasts of the suit expanded, although not much given Maylu's age. However, a huge pressure built up in your groin, as if it was trying to push your manhood out of existance. A pressure also began building in your head, as if it was trying to take root in your skull as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, it ended as quickly as it began. Panting in slight exhaustion, you slowly propped yourself up. Looking down, you saw what you were beginning to believe. You had Maylu's body, a complete replica of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as you wanted to get a grip on this situation, your new skin felt very sensitive against the night wind. Looking over, you saw her clothes where the suit was before. The first clothes were a training bra and panties which you immediately put on. Then came Maylu's classic wear: A light green long-sleeve shirt, a blue evst over it, pink skirt, thigh-high black leggings, and red shoes.</span></div></div>",

After discovering the change, you got a good feeling for yourself and make sure you weren't dreaming, you decided to go wake up your friend, James Walker. He had come along on your family trip out here, and he was sleeping in a guest bedroom. You carefully got him up, making sure he didn't freak out when he saw you. You were able to calm him down and get him out of the house, explaining everything along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, pretty much\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's pretty interesting. Although, what do you want me to do about it?\" asked James. You looked over to the Roll suit and picked it up, gesturing to James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since I'm Maylu, I wondered if you could be Roll. They go together after all\" you said. James gave a rather serious look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, this is all interesting, but I don't know if I want to be a girl like that\" he said. Not missing a beat, you shoved the suit into his arms, making him stumble a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on. It'll be fun. Trust me\" you said in Maylu's voice. James almost found hard to take you seriously sounding like that, but he sighed anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, I'll do it\" he relented, which made you happy. At that, he stripped off his own clothing andf began putting on the Roll suit. Being a NetNavi, Rolls \"clothes\" were already on her, including her helmet, although everything was deflated at the moment. With that, James got himself in, adjusted it, and zipped it up in the back like you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe feimmediate effects, hugging himself as the discomfort came around. You could see Roll's small breasts inflate, while the same pressure in the groin you felt also took place. The clothes, particuarly the boots and helmet, hardened as one would expect. Roll's cyber ponytail also hardened as well. Before long, the discomfort subsided and James was able to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unreal\" he said, gasping as he heard Roll's feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"cool, huh?\" you said, getting mixed reactions from James.</span></div></div>",

You and James walked over there, feeling a little odd in your new bodies. When you got there, you saw alot of options on a screen. One of them seemed to imply making these bodies your new ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" James asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it means that this machine can make these bodies really ours. I mean, I can still feel the zipper in my back\" you said, feeling said zipper. James reached back and he agreed with that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, well we've come this far. Might as well do it\" said James with a smile. You smiled in agreement and pressed the option ont he machine. You both heard it start it and beam two beams of light on you and James. It felt like something was being taken out of you, although it wasn't as bad as the initial transformation. When you both came to, you both saw suits of yourselves. Taking a minute, you both put your suit and clothes where Maylu and Roll used to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, so these are our real bodies now. How cool is this?\" you said in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pretty cool, although all the pick is a little offsetting\" said James. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps\" you said. However, you ended up misstepping on a spare part of the warehouse and tripped, falling right into the machine. James gasped and ran over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it, you klutz!\" he reprimanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\" you apologized. However, that wasn't the end of it. You apparently hit some button on the machine as you fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you press?!' asked James franticly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a great flash of light engulfed both of you, knocking you both out before you knew it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ugh....wha?\" you asked groggily as your eyes slowly opened. It seemed like it was broad daylight now, despite it being night before. You were really confused right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" you asked yourself as you propped yourself up. You seemed to be in a room, a rather nice one at that, but one that looked clearly made for a girl. Looking down, you saw that you were still Maylu. Not only that, the place looked....how to put it.....animated. Like it was completely different from where you were before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were about to question why, you heard something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anthony!\" yelled a feminine voice to your left. You looked over and gasped at what you saw. What was there seemed to be a real PET, or Personal Terminal. It looked like the really old version from earlier games. However, what surprised you the most was seeing Roll in there. However, that meant that....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James?\" you asked as you slid off the bed and walked over, picking up the PET. Roll, or rather James, looked peeved at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James, is that you?\" you asked. James crossed his, or rather her, arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it's me, and I'm pretty ticked off right now! How did we end up here?\" asked James. You really couldn't figure how, although your mind did go back to when you tripped and hit a button. The gears in your head began turning as you figured it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it now. I must have hit some button to send us in the Mega Man world. Apparently, we also stay as ourselves. So that's why you are in there\" you explained. James nodded in understanding but still looked ticked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously? Ain't that great, so instead of simply enjoying a costume, I'm now stuck in a life-or-death world?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess. Look, I guess we just have to act things out for now. I don't know if we can even get back to our world, so we have to keep things as normal as possible\" you explained. James sighed, before smirking a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. As you wish \"Maylu\"\" James taunted, giggling as he did which made him blush a bit out of embaressment. You smirked as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well \"Roll\", guess we need to be off then. Looks like it's 7:20 right now. Can you see if there's a schedule in there somewhere?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose, although although I've never been this hands-on with a computer before\" said James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither have I\" you said. James looked around his personal space within the PET. There wasn't much in it. Perhaps he could decorate it a bit. Hey, if he had to live here for a long time, he might as well get comfortable. Anyway, a screen appeared in front of him. Not questioning it, James tried to search for a schedule or calendar or whatever. Luckily, he was able to find one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, here we go. Looks like today is a school day, and it starts at 8:00. So better get a move on\" said James. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right away\" you replied.</span></div></div>",

After all, you had to play the part well, as no one knew how long this would go on. You strapped your PET into a holder on your hip and grabbed what seemed to be your backpack on the ground. It felt wierd to be doing this, like you were in elementary school again, which you were for the most part now. You sighed as that realization came to you. Then again, that means it probably won't be hard, since you had the intelligence of a high schooler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong story short: you walked down and encountered a dark-haired woman who was likely Maylu's mother. You had breakfast there, making sure what nothing seemed off about you. With that, you waved good bye to \"Mom\" and ran out the door, finding Maylu's scooter along the way. With that, you were on the way to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, so this is what ACDC Town looks like up close\" you said to yourself in awe. It always amazed you that DenTech City contained so many different location. You asked James if he thought the same way but he didn't answer. Making sure you didn't run into anything, you pulled your pink PET out of its holder and looked at James, who seemed to be looking at something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Learning the system of course. If I have to be the Navi, then I better learn who to work stuff. Otherwise, we won't get anything done and people will get suspicious\" he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good call\" you replied, rubbing your neck briefly. Hearing such a young girly voice come out of your mouth still felt wierd, which James agreed with. Then, you remembered that you really have no idea where the school actually is. You asked James if there was a map in there somewhere. Thankfully. he was able to find one in a file. It was a good thing that he was pretty good with computers to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, you rode all the way to the academy, following James' instructions.s you imagined, that place was huge. Luckily, there was a school schedule and such in the file James found. You were able to use that to find your locker and get what you needed for the few classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you do without me\" James said in a matter-of-fact fashion. You told him to not push his luck, which he just smirked about. That being said, you were able to find the classroom easily. However, along the way, you couldn't help but notice a couple of strange looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we're getting looks from some of the guys\" you whispered to James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess now we know how that feels like from this angle\" said James as you sat down in your seat, nodding in agreement as you did. You had to admit that the skirt felt really wierd though, especially considering its length. James fighred that it might be more bearable after a while.</span></div></div>",

A few minutes ago, you nearly jumped out of your seat when Dex Oyama, one of Lan and Maylu's friends, came right behind you to say hi. You grumbled a \"Hello\" right back at him but you were still annoyed at that little stunt. You could hear James slight giggling to himself at the sight. Soon enough, Ms. Mari, the teacher, came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello class...\" she started before a loud \"BAM!!\" came from the door. Ms. Mari looked startled for a second before opening the door, allowing a dazed Lan Hikari to fall to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering when he would show. Guess he really is late all the time\" you said to yourself, smiling a bit though as you said that. As you imagined, Lan got a stern talking to before being allowed to get to his seat. He then looked right at you and smiled, saying that this was a personal best for him, which made you sigh at him. He was as clueless as advertised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Ms. Mari got the class going. The first class of the day was English, which was no problem for you so you kind of zoned out a bit. You remembered that the other navi's often got together inside the computer, so you naturally considered having James go in as well. He denied wanting to go at first though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding? I don't want to have GutsMan breathing down my neck\" reasoned James. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wing it then. You'll have MegaMan to protect you after all\" you smiled as you plugged in the PET and downloaded James into the computer. After you did that, you started writing some notes, at least to keep appearances up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Cyberworld*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter downloading, James appeared in the cyberworld, seeing a tiled landscape with a number theme through the \"sky\". James groaned at his luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn it Anthony. Just my luck\" he grumbled. Suddenly, he heard giant steps behind him. He looked behind to see the ape-like navi himself, GutsMan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GutsMan happy to see Roll!\" he nearly shouted, making James wince a bit. It would have been hard enough enduring GutsMan as a guy, but now he was stuck as the navi he had a crush on (as if Roll would ever return them though). Still, you had to get used to this sometime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...um, hi\" James replied, not quite in his strongest voice. Thankfully, he was saved when he heard more navis coming in. He looked back to see MegaMan and Glyde come in. James breathed a sigh of relief, as GutsMan instantly changed tactics and went after MegaMan. However, after a brief hello, MegaMan passed right by him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Roll, how are you doing?\" he asked politely. James felt himself calm down, as MegaMan was an easy person to talk to, although the whole being Roll thing still made James feel wierd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good, thank you\" James replied. Glide came over, acting in his usual gentlemanly nature. James allowed himself to smile a bit. Perhaps he could work this out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Real World*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day just seemed to breeze by for the most part. Many of the classroom topics were things that you already knew, but you kept writing just for the heck of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, soon enough, it came time for Virus Busting class.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just before the class began, the inevitable happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi Maylu!\" came a strange voice from behind you. However, you remembered it well and facepalmed before turning around. It from noe other than Dex Oyama, the NetOp (Network Operator) of GutsMan. This guy had a major crush on Maylu, which was also reflected in GutsMan, who liked Roll. If memory served, both girls shared mutual disgust of such a thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh god, are you kidding me? I gotta deal with this?\" </i>you yelled mentally. James was thinking the exact same thing. He kind of liked GutsMan and all, but the last thing he needed was to be the object of his affection, which was almost enough to make him hurl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite honestly, you wondered how to handle this. Outside of Maylu's own family, this was your first real encounter with someone. Your mouth kept moving but only stutters came out. Unfortunately, Dex noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? You ok Maylu?\" Dex questioned, leaning a little closer. Perhaps a little too close for your liking. Quite frankly, you were close to panic mode, and your mind was racing for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What to do?! What to do?!\"</i> your mind screamed. Suddenly, as if answering your prayers or something, a wierd presence began to fill you up. It was a bizarre feeling, like you were still in control to an extent but like there was another mind in there somewhere. What you did know though that suddenly your mind felt clear and you looked straight at Dex, a friendly smile appearing on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine Dex. Just spaced out for a second\" you said. You felt wierd as those words left your mouth. It didn't sound like you talking, even though it technically was. This was confusing as heck. Luckily, Dex grinned, obviously buying whatever that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You spacing out? Didn't peg you as one. Figured that was more Lan's thing. I get the feeling he's rubbing off on you in a bad way\" saidDex, laughing as he said that last part. Your expression angered as he said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what do you mean by that?\" you said in a tone that wasn't harsh, but enough to get the point across. Dex backed upa bit, nodding his head rapidly. ace smiled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good\" you said happily, giggling slightly. Dex told a seat behind you, feeling like he dodged a bullet there. As you turned your face back to your desk, you suddenly felt forced to the front again, the wierd sensation gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah man. What was that?\" asked James from the PET. \"If I didn't know better, I could swear that you were acting just like Maylu\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What? D-Don't say something wierd like that!\" you almost yelled, not wanting to believe what he just said. James flinched a bit, putting his hands up in surrender of that subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before you could think about about James said, the door opened, meaning class would begin now.</span></div></div>",

She slowly reopened the door, and a dazed Lan Hikari fell to the ground in a heap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wow. He's even funnier up close\" </i>you thought to yourself. You could tell that James was laughing as well. Lan slowly got up, much to his chagrin and looked at Ms. Mari, who wasn't too pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice of you to join us Lan\" she said in a somewhat scary tone. Lan flinched a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I almost made it this time\" he defended himself. The rest of the class just laughed at him, and you had to laugh as well. It was too funny not too. Embaressed a bit, Lan walked over to his seat, which was right next to yours. He sulked a bit as he did, muttering about something incoherently. You decided to let him cool off for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, long story short, it felt like most elementary schools, as you had different class periods with the same teacher. For appearances' sake, you wrote notes, but didn't really pay attention. You already knew this stuff, and you had more important things to worry about. What really happened back there with Dex? Did some part of Maylu take you over? Was it trying to overwhelm you? So many questions that you didn't have answers to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames wasn't feeling that great either. How could he, being stuck as he was? It felt wierd to be wearing what he was wearing. That being said, he at least tried to get a feel for what to look for in the PET. Other than that, nothing really interesting happened, although you did hear Lan challenge Dex to a netbattle later on. Getting a good look at Lan's PET, you saw the generic navi he had at the beginning of the series.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So, I'm at the very beginning\" </i>you thought to yourself. After some classes, you had lunch from the cafeteria, which was satisfactory. However, Maylu's short skirt really became a bother later on, as you still felt some stares at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telling you, I'll make it next time!\" sweared Lan as he ate his lunch next to you. Feeling a little more comfortable, you tried to manage the situation without the aid of some wierd mental thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doubt it. Pigs will fly before you consistantly get here on time\" you smirked at him, which made him more frustrated. </span></div></div>",

Upon inspecting the many shelfs of suits, you discovered that they indeed were suits. It was kind of cool, yet also kind of creepy. There were suits of all kinds, from any series you could imagine. Naturally, being a video game lover, you decided to check out the video game section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So many to pick from. Whoever made this had a lot of free time\" you chuckled to yourself. Eventually, you found yourself in the Mega Man section. Being curious about it, you took a look at the shelf. When you did that, your eyes were drawn to a certain duo of suits. Bringing your hand over one, you saw that this one was the suit of Sonia Sky from the MegaMan Star Force games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, well I guess this could be interesting\" you said as you brought the suit up. Sonia was 11 years, so naturally the suit would probably be incredibly small to someone like you. However, your curiosity was getting the best of you, so you decided to try it on. At that, you stripped your normal clothes on, feeling a little chilly from the cool night air. You certainly didn't want to be naked for long. With that in mind, you unzipped the zipper in the back and gently put one foot in, partly thinking that you're crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the foot seemed to fit in like a glove, expanding a bit to fit you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wierd\" you say but you decide to continue. You place another foot in and the same thing happens. You put your arms through each sleeve and duck your head into the head part. You adjust it so your eyes and mouth are exposed and begin to pull the zipper up the back. Soon enough, you zipped it right up to the top of your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you did, a searing pain ripped through your body, causing you to grab yourself and fall to the ground. Itwasn't the worst feeling but it was enough for you to groan in discomfort. The skin felt like it was crawling, moving over your body. A particular pressure began to build in your chest and groin. Opening one eye, you gasped as the empty little breasts of the suit expanded, although not much given Sonia's age. However, a huge pressure built up in your groin, as if it was trying to push your manhood out of existance. A pressure also began building in your head, as if it was trying to take root in your skull as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, it ended as quickly as it began. Panting in slight exhaustion, you slowly propped yourself up. Looking down, you saw what you were beginning to believe. You had Sonia's body, a complete replica of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way\" you gasped out, your hands flying to your mouth as a high feminine voice scaped your mouth instead of your usual masculine one. However, what snapped you out of this was feeling a small chill breeze through the shack, reminding you that you were naked. You would catch a cold if this wasn't stopped quickly. With that in mind, you ran over and grabbed Sonia's clothes, which were laying neatly together on the shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no problem with the underwear, as it invulved just simple panties and a training bra. Next came a yellow t-shirt along with her light green shorts. Finishing up the look was Sonia's trademark pink hoodie and blue boots.</span></div></div>",

It was perhaps that most bizarre thing you had ever experienced, which was currently conflicting with the part of you that found this very awesome. As you felt various places, you still felt the zipper at the top of your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it doesn't completely change\" you said to yourself. As you looked around, you happened to spot a small portable device near one of the shelves. Curious, you walked over and grabbed the device. As you pressed the buttons, wierd commands seemed to appear on the device. One of which was \"Complete Swap?\" with the usual options. You had no idea as to what that meant, but your anxious fingers ended up pressing the button on the \"Yes\" option. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, a new feeling ripped through your body, like you were merging with the suit even more than you did before. Luckily, this effect didn't last long as the pain you felt with the suit. However, it was still enough to make you gasp for breath when it was done. At first, you didn't think anything changed, until you felt your neck again. The zipper was gone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? It's gone, but then what happened to....\" you started, wondering what that meant for your body if this suit was totally yours now. However, you soon felt something against your foot. You looked down to see a suit made of your old body there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so that's what it does\" you said as you picked the suit up. Wanting to keep it safe for now, you placed it and your clothes neatly into the spot where Sonia's originally was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is cool and all, but I really need to watch what I press from now on\" you said to yourself. This was strange stuff after all. Anyway, while figuring out your next move, you spotted a larger machine in the very back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another machine?\" you wondered as you walked near it. Just how many machines were there in this little shack? Regardless, you decided to take a look anyway. You gently pushed what seemed to be an \"On\" button and you heard the machine roar to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool\" you smiled as you looked at the screen. You pressed another button, seemingly getting to another option. This one seemed to say \"Transport?\" with yes or no options. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Transport where?\" you wondered out loud.

Of course, it all seemed to grind to a halt as you suddenly felt yourself \"landing\" on something pretty soft. In addition, you could feel the early morning sunshine come down on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what hit me? I feel like a truck ambushed me\" you said to yourself as you groggily propped yourself up. What you awoke too seemed to be some kind of hotel room. A pretty fancy one at that, not one that you ever got to stay in. You took one quick look down, seeing that your body was still that of Sonia's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, so I'm still Sonia. But where am I?\" you asked yourself. Looking to your left, you saw Sonia's guitar hung up in a place where it wouldn't break. Deciding that it was time to get up, you got up from the bed and grabbed the yellow guitar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, it's actually lighter than I thought\" you said out loud. Looking at the front of the guitar, you saw where the guitar served some properties similar to a transer. It made you wonder how Sonia made it work though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I can figure that out later\" you said as you kept the guitar with you, walking over to where a small kitchen was. You felt pretty hungry, which made you wonder about how long you were out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I sleep through the night? Or was it already morning when I got here?\" you wondered. Your head began to hurt though from all this hard thinking, so you figured that it was best to leave it alone for now. You had bigger problems, like how in the world were you going to be able to pass as Sonia here? You pretty much came to the conclusion that this was her world that you were in now, given the animated look to everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another look to Sonia's guitar, you saw that it was empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that means  Lyra hasn't appeared yet\" you said to yourself as you grabbed a roll out of the kitchen.</span></div></div>",

At first, you looked around frantically, before remembering who it could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That sounds like...<b>Lyra</b>! Dang, what timing\" </i> you thought. Right as you thought that, a beam of pink light rained down from the ceiling, enveloping you in its light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhh!\" you almost screamed. The feeling was bizarre. You weren't in pain, but it wasn't pleasant either. It almost felt like a wierd version of being electrocuted. For a second, it felt like the light was going to completely envelop you, but before it could, it slowly dissipated, as if it ran out of juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was a shock\" you said, shivering a bit from the tingly electric feeling flowing through you. You really hope that that would be the last time you'd have to endure that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It didn't work. Why is that?\" you heard a soft voice. Knowing who it could be, you looked at Sonia's guitar. There in the.....flesh....was the FMian, Lyra. She wore a disgruntled look on her face as you looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?! And what did you just do to me?!\" you nearly screamed at her. Of course, you already knew those answers, but you had to play the role. Things could get out of hand very quickly if you didn't get into character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Lyra, and I'm a being from Planet FM. You've probably never heard of it, but it's quite far from here\" explained Lyra. Again, it was stuff you already knew.Nevertheless, you tried to keep the act up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-OK. Well then, what were you trying to do to me? What did I ever do to you?!\" you kept yelling. Honestly, you were pretty sure you weren't acting anything like Sonia, but it's not like Lyra knew that. Lyra seemed to cross her arms, as if contemplating something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, to be honest, I had hoped to take control of your body. Your EM wave frequency is the same as mine, so I naturally went to you. My orders were to apprehend a friend of mine, but who knows if it's worth it\" said Lyra. Again, you knew what she meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've heard of strange beings appearing and messing things up. Guess that's you and your friends?\"you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so, although the other FMians and I don't really see eye-to-eye alot\" said Lyra. You knew that, as Lyra wasn't quite as motivated as other FMians. After all, she did kind of like Omega-Xis. However, Lyra then spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, you say other things have been happening, but the city looks intact. Someone being a hero?\" Lyra seemed to smirk a bit at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, because Mega Man always helps out\" you said. Lyra didn't know anything personal about Sonia, so you were free to do some things that the normal Sonia probably wouldn't have known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mega Man? Ah, of course, must be Omega-Xis. So he found a human host of his own. I'm guessing he couldn't take control either\" said Lyra.</span></div></div>",

If you recalled correctly, she wasn't big on trust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lyra, why are you being so straight with me? Don't you think I might babble about this to someone?\" you asked. Lyra smirked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since you were able to resist my control, I figured that I might as well come clean. No use holding back if this wasn't going to work. Don't think that this means I trust you either. I'm not entrusting you with anything\" explained Lyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should just leave\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wouldn't be beneficial to me. You and I share the same frequency. I don't have much else to go at the moment, so I'll just hang out here until I get bored\" said Lyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really got an attitude problem\" you spat at Lyra. Quite honestly, you weren't thinking about acting like Sonia like you. Lyra was really ticking you off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could say the same about you. Although, it is rather refreshing to see someone so fiesty\" said Lyra. You sighed in response. Lyra would probably drive you crazy right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, whatever. You can stay as long as you want. In return though, I'd like some help from you\" you said, trying to sound in control, which didn't sound like much with your little girl voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and what kind of help would that be?\" sneered Lyra, as if she didn't believe your words. However, you soon both heard someone knocking on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonia! Open up Sonia!\" came the loud voice of a man. You noticed that it had to be Sonia's agent, who was intolerable at best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, not him! Get me somewhere else. Anywhere that's away from him!\" you cried out, hoping to escape this situation. Lyra shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine fine, but don't cry to me if we go somewhere worse. Beggers can't be choosers\" smirked Lyra. At that, Lyra's music-based pink energy engulfed you. You felt extremely lightweight as Lyra pulled you both out of the the hotel room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sped away, you could hear the faint cry of the agent noticing that Sonia was gone, which made you giggle a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did you and Lyra end up?</span></div></div>",

You still felt a tingling feeling as the pink light disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shocking, huh? Such high-speed travel must by new to you humans\" smirked Lyra from tha guitar. Once you got your bearings back, you glared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have to be a smart-alek about everything? you stared at her. Lyra shrugged. Anyway, you heard many noises around you and looked around. You were now in some amusement park that Echo Ridge apprently had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. I didn't know this place had an amusement park\" you said in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you humans do here anyway? I just picked a random spot to transport to\" said Lyra. You looked at Lyra as you adjusted the guitar to your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's a place where you do lots of fun stuff basically\" you replied. You hadn't been to an amusement park in a while, so this should be fun. Of course, there was the fact that you had the body of a famous celebrity though. That could cause some issues. As you thought about it though, Lyra perked up suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" you asked, as you were jerked a bit by Lyra's sudden movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sense another EM being nearby\" said Lyra. You wondered if could perhaps be Omega-Xis. Either him or another FM alien. Either way, it intrigued you to find him and his partner, Geo Stelar, sooner. Perhaps you could become friends with him sooner than the games or anime showed. With that, your mind was made up and you asked Lyra where she felt it. She explained that it was a bit to the west, although she wondered why you asked. As she did ask though, you sprinted off in the direction she pointed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs odd as you felt, running in this little girl body, you were determined to get the ball rolling on this. You knew what would happen eventually anyway. After sprinting for a while, and panting in exhaustion a little bit, you spotted Geo himself, seemingly hiding from something. You wondered if he was hiding from his classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. What are you doing?\" you asked with a smile as you approached him. Geo seemed a little startled from your sudden entry, although he calmed down quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, nothing too important. Just....hiding\" he told you. That pretty much confirmed your suspisions. \"Don't tell them I'm here. I'm getting a bit annoyed with my classmates' antics\" he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. Your secret is safe with me. Come with me for a second\" you said as you grabbed his arm and pulled him into the nearby bushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Geo asked as calmly as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a second\" you requested from him. After thinking that you both were good, you turned to him.  \"Sorry about that. I just wanted to get out of everyone's way. I'm Anth-Sonia Strumm. Nice to meet you\" you introduced yourself, catching on to your little name slip and offering a handshake. Thankfully, Geo thought nothing of it and shook back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you. I'm Geo Stelar\" he introduced himself.</span></div></div>",

Geo however immediately broke the handshake, a little surprised and worried that someone knew. Part of him began to wonder though if you were just playing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I won't tell anyone. It just wasn't that hard to tell that it was you. I've heard about all those neat things you've done for Echo Ridge\" you tried to explain, which seemed to calm him down a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I believe you, but how did you figure that out?\" Geo asked. You pointed to your guitar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She told me. Her name is Lyra\" you introduced her to Geo, to which you heard her grunt a little, which was kind of amusing. However, you both were startled by a growling noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lyra?!! Here?!!\" yelleda loud voice as a green light materized from Geo's transer. There formed Omega-Xis, an AMian and Geo's partner, who fuse together to become Mega Man. When he materialized, Lyra did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's been a while Mega. How are you doing?\" Lyra spoke in an amused tone. Omega-Xis growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you have to be sent of all people?\" he spat out, to which Lyra narrowed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm just as capable a warrior as you, or have you forgotten?\" she questioned. The conversation ended up going back and forth, and you and Geo separated yourselves from the argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that\" said Geo. You gave him a sincere smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. I'm just glad to meet the actual Mega Man\" you told him, glad to actually meet a hero like him. Geo blushed a bit at the compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing. Mostly it's Mega's power\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How modest of you\" you replied. Suddenly, Geo's eyes perked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second, you said you're Sonia Strumm? That famous clebrity?\" he asked with surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that's what they call me\" you replied. Geo was still surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. To meet someone like you out here\" he said. However, you calmed him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not think about status right now. How about we go and have fun on the rides? I've been bored for quite some time\" you suggested, gesturing to the rides. Geo looked a little cautious about it but gave a small smile anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not\" he replied.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Resident Evil always had a very impressive collection of cool and interesting female characters, Ada Wong was always the one that stood out the most to you. Ever since getting the fourth game and getting the chance to really play as her, you just found that you got kind of hooked with her. You found her to be an incredibly interesting character, and constantly wanted to know more about her. And now, you had the chance to actually BECOME her, and learn things about her better than anybody else could. It was an offer you found it impossible to refuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull the hollow suit off the hook, and try to find some kind of opening. After a couple of seconds, you find a skin-colored zipper running along the spine of the suit. Without hesitating you undress and start by slipping your feet into the suits. Next up came the legs, and after them the waist. With each body-part you covered, you start to dress in the suit quicker and quicker. Soon enough, the only thing left is to stick your head into the suits and pull the zipper. You hold your breath, as if to reassure yourself that everything is going to work out, and stick your head into the suits, aligning the features along the way. Without putting more thoughts into it, you finish by zipping up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment you feel like you lose total control over your body, but after a while you feel your senses return to you, except that they now feel quite... Entirely new and weird. Looking down, you could clearly see why. Gone was your male body, replaced with the gorgeous naked (female) body of special agent Ada Wong. \"Wicked\" you coo in her sultry voice. You tried out a few stretching manuvers, and tried to get a bit more comfortable in your new form. Reaching for the back, you found that the zipper was gone. Once you wished for the zipper to come back however, it appeared again. You sighed with relief, now knowing that you could just take it off if you really wanted to. You also realized you had the memories of Ada, which also helped you get more used to your body and the ways of being a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached for her evening dress and started to dress yourself. The heels were a bit of a bother, but Adas memories helped you get used to using them. You also notice her equipment lying on a bench next to the hook, and strap them to the belt on your new exposed thigh. Eventually, you are a perfect copy of Ada Wong, if not actually her. You notice a mirror to your side, and gaze lovingly at your new form. A smile forms on your new lips as you run your hands over your new body. \"I could certainly get used to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also notice what looks like a pair of very odd machines. Looking at the note stuck to one of them, you learn that one of them can make the suit into your real body, and the other can actually transport you into the world the suit comes from. Naturally, both seemed incredibly interesting, but even so... You look down at your body again, and smile again as you stroke your chest gently. While you were up for an adventure, you had this gorgeous body all for yourself, and letting it go to waste felt silly. Then again, maybe it wasn't that important. To say the least, you were quite torn about it.</span></div></div>",

After a fair bit of walking, he came across suits of the characters from Batman - the Arkham-universe to be precise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing he noticed where the suits of the female characters, and he quickly - almost jumping - ran over to them, and began pondering on which to pick.</span></div></div>",

That was just too good to be true, so of course he had to try it out. Picking it up off the shelf, he noticed there were two different suits: the Catsuit and the Selina Kyle suit. Both had an opening in the top half of the body, Selina in the back between the shoulder blades and Catsuit between the breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, he picked up the Selina suit. After all, the Catsuit wouldn't fit Anthony, and he'd probably look quite odd in it. <br>\r\nFirst, Anthony picked up the Selina suit and examined it. He discarded his clothing and threw away his shoes. He then put the suit on, and after an awkward few seconds he suddenly felt his body reshaping. Bones cracking and shifting, his body becoming muscular yet very slender, with hardly any decrease in size. Catwoman was, after all, rather tall. He then felt his manhood being pressed in by the suit, only leaving a vagina, and the chest part merges to fit his own chest. He now had breasts, which were quite large yet no bother at all. He also gained Selina Kyle's short haircut, and her beautiful green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transformation being complete, he looked in the mirror and saw only Selina Kyle, the famous cat burglar known as Catwoman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m a teenager, with unrestricted access to the internet and all manner of imagery.  If some sexy... big breasted Jedi wishes to wriggle and touch herself in front of me\u2026 awesome, but unless you plan on putting out\u2026 don\u2019t waste my time. Brianna\u2019s more likely to give me some than you are.\u201d He turned another page and seemed to be done with the discussion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony\u2019s arms just fell to her side, her face screwed up in some mix between being let down and amusement. \u201cFine\u2026 wasting your time am I?\u201d Anthony flicked her wrist casually, and the GameInformer in Randy\u2019s hands was tossed aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude\u2026 stop messing with my shiz\u2026. Close your top up and give me the sticks. I wanna get some Mass Effect on.\u201d He reached forward and turned on the 360 as Anthony sat down on the couch, buttoning up her top and handing Randy the controller, all the while looking confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re seriously\u2026 not even interested in letting me boss you around for a bit with this body?\u201d It was like this entire plan was for naught. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I said, Bro\u2026 Either open your lips, or shut your mouth.\u201d Matter-of-factly, Anthony was silenced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook! I don\u2019t care what kind of day you\u2019re having; you don\u2019t come into my house and talk like that to me! Either calm down or get out. How\u2019s THAT for an ultimatum for you.\u201d He had gotten slightly riled up, emotions must\u2019ve been a new thing to Satele because her face had become flushed, her chest was heaving up and down and up and down, a few hairs out of place\u2026 and Randy was digging it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dropped the controller and looked at Anthony, a sort of look in his eyes. \u201cAlright, Man\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. Let\u2019s just calm down.\u201d He reached forward to wrap an arm around Ant\u2019s shoulder, it coming to rest right on her left breast. Eventually, his other hand came around to keep the other boob company.  \u201cYou know I like aggressive chicks\u2026 you really wanted me to do this to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony almost didn\u2019t understand what was happening until he felt those big boobs on her chest, moving up and down and feeling rather bare against the wind. Randy had gotten her shirt, robe and bra off without Ant noticing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally good at this aren\u2019t you\u2026 who have you been practicing on?\u201d Anthony said, trying to slide away without much issue, although Randy sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to give up. <br>\r\n\u201cI did say that Brianna was likely to give me some, right? You ply her with enough booze and she\u2019s like slutty putty. \u201cHe paused to think about what had to have been a lovely evening, while Anthony stood up and tried to walk away, putting on some sort of top and wondering how he got himself in this deep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope.\u201d Randy grabbed her arm and sat her back down on the couch, ignoring above the waist for now and getting that belt of hers off. \u201cWait uh\u2026 Randy was that the doorbell?\u201d She said trying to get away from this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk for a while dude\u2026 I gotta focus.\u201d Ant was NOT going to sit there and just take this, he tried to push away from Randy, not really remembering her almighty powers and abilities, but Randy in some sort of horny rage wasn\u2019t going to be out shoved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile! Thousands of Miles Away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young Boricua was walking through the city streets, eyes bouncing back and forth between iPod screen and road, hoping not to get ran over. Stopping at a crosswalk, she sighed and wondered what to do with the rest of her day. Pulling out her phone, she checked her online friends and what not. \u201cNope\u2026 no\u2026 no\u2026 N- BING BONG! StarFighter364 is online\u2026 time to go bother, Nathan.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning right around, she began a quick and speedy B-Line to Nathan\u2019s Pad! After a perilous journey, crossing 4 blocks and a trip to a pizza place, she arrived at her destination, a bag of garlic knots in hand and a box of Hawaiian Barbecue Pizza!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rang the doorbell, waiting a few moments while humming the Doctor Who theme. After no reply she bent over and pulled the spare key from the false rock. She\u2019d been at this house too much\u2026  Pushing open the door she kept up her song, hoping to find a good reason as to why she was being ignored.  Coming around the corner into the living room she came upon\u2026 ugh\u2026 such a weird sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy was trying to plow Satele Shan\u2026 that asshole. Satele was putting up a fight but damn.. Randy was resilient! Like Lupin the III. He had at least 2 fingers in her mouth, his pants down and one hand around her waist, trying to pull her in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlriiiiiiiiight.\u201d Brianna set down the pizza, hoping all this fuckery would come to an end. She was sadly mistaken. They were still going at it and Brianna got a wee bit mad. \u201cOi! You lot! Stuff it!\u201d The two stopped immediately. \u201cRandy, Get the fuck off her! Satele...  Cover yourself up! I don\u2019t care what the tradition is on Naboo, This is Earth! Put on some damn pants.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe two of them split apart and Satele even tried to smooth over her skirt. \u201cNow\u2026 disregarding the fact that I\u2019m WAY disgusted at you.  Why did you bring a Cosplaying Prostitute to Nathan\u2019s\u2026 don\u2019t you have a house?\u201d She crossed her arms, ready to throw the both of them out when Satele did the unthinkable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up, Brianna and Randy\u2019s eyes on her bare chest, one in anger, one in want. Reaching a hand behind her head, she did some odd fumbling for a moment and then\u2026 removed her head\u2026 like a mask. Letting it hang limp over her chest, both people came upon the view of Anthony\u2019s head, resting on Satele\u2019s body\u2026. Or inside her skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you to stop calling me Nathan, Bunny.\u201d A nickname Brianna had always despised. Another thing she despised, although fairly new on the list\u2026 was her perception of reality being destroyed as it was right now. Her entire body swayed on the spot before she fell forward, her head crashing into the oak end table and passing right out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood Job, Anthony. You killed her.\u201d He looked down at Brianna\u2019s lifeless form before bouncing to Satele\u2019s hands, then her chest and then Anthony\u2019s face. \u201cLend me that suit for a bit\u2026 I got an idea to save her. Thief\u2019s Honor\u201d Anthony wasn\u2019t even going to consider it\u2026 but honor amongst thieves was serious business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Plus, if the nameplate is anything to go by, then this room contains material from Fate/EXTRA and Fate/Zero as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready you can feel anticipation rising. What marvels await you beyond the other side of the door? Just open the door. That's it. A simple action, just open the door and see what wonders lie beyond the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there's a feeling, a quiet nipping feeling at the back of your mind to go to the next door. It was a feeling you're all too familiar with. The feeling to go deeper into this hallway of doors, passing video game series after video game series as if your very actions are being controlled by an unseen power. Even now you can hear it's presence whisper into your ear, whispering that you should go to the next door and repeat the cycle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel torn. There in front of you lies the world of Fate and all it's wonders, but what else could be there at the door next?</span></div></div>",

Still, the note had mentioned the magic of his place, so if it was right then the small size of the suit compared to your own body should be no problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping one leg into the suit, you find Ashley's leg only comes up to about your knee, but you don't let that discourage you. You step the other leg in and attempt to pull the suit up a bit higher so that you can slot your arms in without squatting down. However, rather than the suit pulling up higher, your legs seem to shrink down into the suit, becoming smaller and thinner. You were shocked by this, barely able to move as it occurred, and as such, you were still pulling the top of the suit up tight as you had been before the shrinking started. Once your legs were short enough to match Ashley's, the suit was still pulled tight up to your groin, and as such you felt a large amount of discomfort as your genitals were compressed, and then inverted, becoming Ashley's vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what you had gone through, you were wondering whether you should continue going though with this, but looking down at the top half of the suit in your hands, you figure you might as well finish the job. You put your arms into their proper spots, and feel the same shrinking sensation you had your legs. Still being a young girl, Ashley's chest was still pretty much flat, something you were somewhat glad for. You already had to deal with having a vagina; growing breasts would be something for another time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow all that remained was to put the head of the suit on and zip the suit up. Taking the head of the suit in your hands, which you noted were now very small, you pull it over your head and line the features up as best you can, what with Ashley's eyes being much bigger than yours, and her nose being smaller. Once that's done, you reach behind you, and after a little bit of a struggle, you pull the zipper closed. Even though your limbs had shrunken down to Ashley's size, you still felt the suit contracting, becoming tighter, all over your body. You shut your eyes and double over from the pain. And then, almost as quickly as it started, the feeling disappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt no longer feels as if you are wearing a suit. Rather, you feel completely naked, and you can feel Ashley's long, black hair flowing down your back. It doesn't look like you're looking through the over-sized eye holes of a mask anymore. Everything felt real. You had really become Ashley, the young witch from the WarioWare series. Pondering your next move, you realised how cold it was in the warehouse, and decided you should get dressed. You take Ashley's clothes off of the shelf next to where the suit had been and begin putting them on. You start with her panties and her tights, before pulling her dress over the top. Your new hair got in the way a bit, so you decide to put it up into two pigtails like Ashley usually did. You complete the look with her tiara, neckerchief, and of course, her shoes. You now looked exactly like Ashley did, both in body and clothes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You approached the Ribbon Girl suit hanging on the rack. She had been one of the first characters revealed for the game, and despite more being revealed as development went on, you still liked her the best. It was rather odd to see her skin hanging limply from the rack, though, her clothes hanging next to her. Strangely enough, her ribbon-like arms didn't seem to be as springy as they seemed in game, instead being coiled tightly to resemble normal arms. They also seemed to have normal hands at the end of them, albeit the same pink as the rest of her arms, instead of her usual ARMS, although closer examination revealed her signature ARMS laying nearby, acting as gloves that she could put her hands into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were somewhat disappointed that the arms of the suit didn't seem to have the same springy qualities that Ribbon Girl's usually had, but you supposed it would be rather difficult to put your arms into the suit otherwise. Regardless of your disappointment, you decided you might as well try it on, strange as it might be to try on the skin of a young woman. There didn't seem to be anyone else in the warehouse, so you went ahead and just stripped right there, leaving your clothes in a pile next to the rack. It was a bit cold in the warehouse, so you were eager to put something else on, and so you quickly grabbed the Ribbon Girl suit off the rack. It seemed a little short for you, but not so much that it would look too awkward wearing it, although you male body being inside the female suit should make it look awkward enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou undo the zipper on the suit's back, and step a leg inside, worming your foot all the way down to the end. It was a bit tight, but since you had already gone this far, you figured you might as well keep going. You step your other leg inside the suit, and pull it up to your waist. Next, you pulled your arms into the arms of the suit, making sure all your fingers were in the right spots. The suit looked a bit stretched out now that you were wearing it, but you kept going regardless. All that was left was the head, which you quickly pulled over your own, matching your facial features up to the suit's. You were now completely inside the suit, and all that was left was to zip it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you close the zipper, you suddenly feel pain all over your body, as if it were being stretched and squished in ways it wasn't supposed to. Your body shrank down to the height the suit originally was, and your limbs shortened and hands and feet shrank. Your waist crunched inwards, and your calves slimmed. Despite everything else shrinking, your thighs and rear actually inflated to feminine proportions, and your chest bloomed outwards into a pair of breasts. You could feel your facial features rearranging to match Ribbon Girl's, and the suit's crotch flattened out as you could no longer feel your penis, but inside gained feeling in an entirely different private part in its place. As strange as the gender switching felt, though, your arms felt stranger still. Their shape slimmed down to look more feminine, but it felt as if they were hollow, as if you only had feeling on the surface off them, and not the insides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as suddenly as it started, the pain stopped, and you felt the cold of the warehouse again, as if the suit were your own skin. You realised that was because it really was your skin now. The zipper had vanished, although you knew from the note that you should be able to take the suit off whenever you wanted to, so there was no longer anything indicating that this was a suit and not your real skin. It certainly felt very real, regardless. You could even see the nipples on your new breasts stiffening in the cold air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Wow,\" you mumble, enthralled by what just happened, noticing that your voice now sounded like Ribbon Girl's rather than your own. The suits in the warehouse really did work as advertised, you could really become these characters. Still as much as you were excited about this, you couldn't help but wonder about your arms. The still seemed to be fairly normal despite what they looked like, rather than the springy coils you'd seen in game. You wondered if that was something you needed to activate or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back over at the rack where you'd gotten the suit from, feeling Ribbon Girl's ponytail dancing across your back as you did so. You had stepped back a bit while putting the suit on, so it was far enough away that you couldn't simply reach over and get something off the shelf without walking over to it first. Or at least, that would be the case normally. You decided to try and test out whether you really did possess the ARMS ability now that you were Ribbon Girl. You thrust your arm forwards toward the rack, trying to focus on extending all the way towards it. To your surprise, you arm obeys, unraveling its coils until you are able you latch onto something, and then quickly returning with it in hand. Instead of returning to its tightly coiled form, like the other arm currently was in, it instead stayed loose and springy, like it appeared in game. Now that you knew you could extend them easily enough, you tried to deliberately tighten it again, and once again, your arm obeyed, returning to its original form, looking like a female arm with a large ribbon wrapped all around it. You supposed it was a bit more convenient to have normal sized arms from time to time, instead of having them constantly loose and potentially getting caught on things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou change your focus to the thing you had grabbed off the rack, frowning as you realised what it was. You had been aiming to grab Ribbon Girl's mask, but you had been caught off guard by the sudden extending, and you arm had shot off in another direction, grabbing something else. you instead held in your hand the mask of Twintelle, one of the other characters in ARMS. You were about to put it back, when you suddenly had another thought. You would like to get dressed, if only to protect your new body from the cold air in the warehouse, but who's to say you had to wear Ribbon Girl's outfit just because you had Ribbon Girl's body? The clothes for the other ARMS characters were hanging on the rack too, next to their respective suits, and beyond the rack, the were clothes for all sorts of other fictional girls. You could put on your own little fashion show if you wanted. Still you could put on a fashion show as anyone, but as Ribbon Girl you had the ARMS ability. Why squander that? Maybe you should just get dressed in Ribbon Girl's clothes and then try out your new arms some more.</span></div></div>",

Sliding it up your waist, you tuck your precious member and your butt into the suit, padding your ass out to a nice level. The arms come next, slipping them into place and matching each finger to its respective location. The chest of the suit is then matched up to yours, showing off Kaede's rather large breasts. The seam behind you seems to be fusing together on its on, but finally you pull the mask over your head, aligning your eyes and mouth to the holes. Once everything is on, the suit fully compresses, becoming a much tighter second skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha...Ha....Ha.....\" The compression was tough. Your voice is now much higher, the voice of an angel comparatively. Turning to a mirror, all that stares back is Kaede Akamatsu, the lovable, sexy pianist. Currently naked. Taking one of her breasts in your hands, you jiggle them around, feeling the sensitivity of a new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhh....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a sexy moan, you look towards her signature clothing.

If he's masturbating over the original Kaede, wait until he's sees the actual thing right in front of his face! Ringing the doorbell, you wait. You hear muffled swearing, what sounded like the zip of pants, and a quick \"I'm coming!\" Opening the door, he sees his dream, right in front of his eyes, and starts gaping like a fish. You let out a slight chuckle, before proceeding to speak. <br>\r\n\"Hey James.... I watched you through the window.\" You speak sexually, trying to turn him on. <br>\r\n\"You did?...\" His reply is filled with doubt and embarrassment. In response you pull him closer into your breasts. <br>\r\n\"If you find what's on a screen attractive, let me show you a real performance...\" You quickly plant a small kiss onto his cheek. He blushes profusely. <br>\r\n\"Are you real?\" You quickly responded to him. \"Of course I am, let me show you just how much I like you.\"<br>\r\nSliding your tongue into his mouth, you plant a warm kissing, melding your tongue with his. After a few moments, you finish, but keeping him close to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we go upstairs for some...real fun times.\" You then proceed to say a certain line in the cutest face possible.<br>\r\n\"James...please....do it with me..\" He blushes even harder before proceeding to try to kiss you with his eyes closed, perfect. <br>\r\nJust as he's about too, you push him away. <br>\r\n\"Keep dreaming, You really didn't recognise me?\"<br>\r\nQuite shocked, he questions you. \"Anthony?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course man...

His eyes are perfectly fixated on your breasts as you jiggle them up and down and up and down. He unzips his fly without even thinking. \"Uhh... your fly's open James.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH SHIT!!\" He quickly takes a step back into the house, you follow suit, shutting the door behind you. Fumbling with his zipper, James is mumbling to himself, probably about how embarassed he is now, seeing Kaede's full form right in front of him. Made even more greater by his cock, protruding hard from the front of his pants, a perfectly long member!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuddering, you feel a delicious tingle crawl up your spine. Your not stereotypical school you, your a tall sexy piano player, Kaede Akamatsu, ready to give your greatest fan a brand new kind of performance to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall I assist....\" In a slow gesture, you move your smooth hands down towards his cock. Pulsing involuntarily in your grasp, the thick veined length, as you give a small *squeeze*.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what are you........Ohhhhh...Oh yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning in pleasure, his eyes start to roll upwards. You begin jacking him off- humming the remembered Clair De Lune along, sliding his foreskin back and forth creating a concerto. \"Ohhhh....your so hard...\" You purr, hearing a more sexier version of Kaede's voice, feeling the dripping of precum leaking out of James' shaft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nhhhhhh...\" His knees give way as his back hits the wall, you jacking him off creating a symphony of pleasure. Although, you can't help but giggle at his discomfort, mindless pleasure showing on his face as he scratches the paint off the wall, the very sight of Kaede Akamatsu putting on this kind of show!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA salty, familiar smell enters your nostrils. So very strong, James groans, his body now clay, moulded by your hands. \"Kaede...\" He moans, tongue sticking out towards you. <br>\r\n\"I'm right here.....\" You breath, as glissening, glowing precum starts coating your fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the greatest question.

Catching sight of yourself in the mirror- or rather, you see Kaede Akamatsu, her face snaked with sweat...a lewd expression plastered on her face, humming one of her favourite tunes while jacking off a rather ballooned guy, now that you think about it. Admittedly, your becoming even more turned on too...locking onto the mirror, knowing that you have the knowlege to do anything you like, its watching your own hentai doujin, in the final moments before the orgasm, but your the star!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you have a thought. You quickly pull away from James and run upstairs. He shouts in a daze.<br>\r\n\"Come on dude....Why!???\"<br>\r\nYou respond back. \"You still have that bunny suit right?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh.....Yeah!! It's in the cupboard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving towards his room, you find it stashed away in a corner, the parts of a purple bunny suit. If your going to knock him up, why not do it right....<br>\r\nStripping down, you plaster Kaede's clothes throughout the room. Taking a hold of the pantyhose, you slide them up your legs feeling the silky smoothness and a slight smell of musk. Next, comes the bodice itself. You slip one leg through, then the other, pulling it upwards, until you feel a small protrusion around your ass.<br>\r\nIt's a light blue dildo, haphazardly glued on. There's one on the front too, right where your vagina is. It's almost perfect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSticking them in, the first one goes straight into your ass and starts vibrating.... \"Ahhhhhhh.......\" You moan, building up your own sexual pleasure. You then did it with the one over the vagina, sticking it straight in!!! \"Ohhhh....\" You purr, a vibrating concerto building up and up!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving on, you pull the bodice over your breasts. It fits, barely, before proceeding to pull tight the strings making up the corset. There also seemed to be a lock on the back, so you snapped it close as well. I guess you'll have to ask James for the key. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attach the cuffs and bowtie around your wrists and neck, locking them in place, before proceeding to place the bunny ears on your head, and locking the high heels onto your feet. What you see in the mirror brings out the lewd in you, a perfect being of lust, ready to spring on James. <br>\r\nYou bite your lip, your back arching ever-so-slightly as a sizzle of pure sexual electricity courses up your spine. You can feel your full nipples stiffen, pressing up against the fabric of the bodice. Your thighs pressing together, entirely by instinct, as a hot, creamy heat wells up between your long, smooth legs! Is this how it feels when girls get horny? You have to admit, you're rather liking it...time to go get em. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneaking back round as best you can, you see James at the bottom of the staircase, moaning in pleasure. It looked like he still was jacking off to your curvaceous form....let's introduce ourselves!<br>\r\nSlowly walking down the staircase, you place your hands on your hips, moving as slowly and as sensually stimulating as possible. <br>\r\n\"Hey baby....\" You moan in delight, James follows suit. \"Ohhhhhhhhh...!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the bottom, you sensually lay down on his lap, holding his throbbing member, as the vibration from both him and yours make a symphony to die for. Shimmering in your vision, you hold James' cock right up to your lips, breathing hard, lips panting, right as he *thrusts* straight into your mouth!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a *scrape*, a wet schllllttttt as his cock sinks into your mouth - Dark spots dancing in your vision, as you let out a heady moan, in Kaede's voice \"mmmmnnghhhhh!!\", as you taste cock for the first time!!! It's so *big*....so hard....so thick, and as the throbbing tip drops onto your tongue, the taste floods the pallete!!! Salty....muscular.....animalistic....your big plump lips curling around James' shaft. So you *Suck*, and as your tongue slides over his member...fulness taking your breath away!!! Drool trickes down your face, probably due to inexperience....but you keep going sliding your tongue over a member of what seemd to be a sloppily improvised blow job! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, you feel James' palm resting on the back of your head, pushing down hard- fingers digging into the blonde locks of hair. You almost gag, as the first inch, then another, slides into Kaede's tight, sloppy throat...your going to swallow it all!!! Somehow, you manage to steal breaths around the shaft powering through layers of cartilage until....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fuck....I'm cumming so bad!!!!\" A faraway voice moans, as his hips draw up, giving Kaede the first throat-fucking she's ever had!!! Which is why its only a moment before gallons of gooey spunk floods your mouth, down your spasming throat, straight into Kaede's belly!!! Barely tasting it, you feel his cock draw out and oozing cum, with no time to rest as the vibrations in your labila and ass continue!!! James' cock hovers before you....dripping with semen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look amazing!!!\" He breathes.....\"Please, let me fuck you......just once!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you placed your legs in the suit, you felt them grew and tone out to fit the legs of the suit perfectly. You then felt your member get pushed in by the crotch of the suit, ad your hips and ass grew outward when your entire lower body was now in the suit. Your waist caved in, your chest blossomed small mounds and then inflated to Power Girls most noticeable features, and your arms changed and toned to fit the arms of the suit as your upper body was now in the torso of the suit. You placed your head inside the head of the suit and felt your facial features turn feminine and felt the hair on the suit as though it was your own. You were now a naked Kara Zor-l aka Power Girl. You put on your suit, and it felt much more pleasurable then you initially thought it would be. Especially when fitting your huge boobs into the skin-tight suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left the room to test out your new body. Turns out, the powers came with the suit. You looked at a large crate near you that looked pretty heavy, and tried to lift it. You ended up finding this an effortless feat because you could lift it with one finger.

Then, of course, you look down again, drinking in the ample cleavage of the luscious breasts that are now yours. Just the sensation of HAVING these 36DD beauties, though an alien one, makes you smirk with giddy delight. The way they jiggled and bobbed with your every step... so strange, but not exactly unwelcome. <i>Plus, with Power Girl's super-strength, no back problems from having these huge tits!</i> you think with a smile. And you keep right on smiling at you continue to strut through this warehouse that seems to stretch on without end, hands on your shapely hips, your cape flowing behind you. You belatedly realize just how...feminine and slinky your walk is, not to mention you just ran a gloved hand through your short, blond hair in a rather feminine manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis makes you stop with a jolt. This suit...was it already altering your mind, your very thoughts and mannerisms? Or was it you just adapting to this new physique? \"Whatever the case, I like it!\" you eventually decide, taking note of how soft and mellifluous your voice now sounds in your ears. Still, it was quite a shock to hear something so angelic escape your lips. Your raise one gloved hand up to your lips to trace them. Even with the glove on, you can feel how plump and pouty they are, ripe to be kissed. \"Maybe...maybe the suit is affecting me...\" you think aloud upon realizing that that thought, the notion of a guy planting one on you, isn't exactly repulsive. Did you WANT that, or was this transformation just so amazing, certain things weren't registering they way they should at the moment?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the case, you couldn't spend all day in here. Hopefully, the suit and its Kryptonian powers would work outside the stump-warehouse. \"They'd better. Power Girl kinda NEEDS sunlight to function,\" you remind yourself. But going out in Power Girl's costume... It's not like it was Halloween, or convention time in the city. As amazing as it was to practically become a goddess, you weren't going to rush into this TOO fast. Perhaps you could find some other clothes to go out in besides Power Girl's costume, and get used to being a girl in general?</span></div></div>",

Plus, people seeing someone dressed as a comic book superhero actually, well, FLYING... That would guarantee some unwanted attention. And for the moment, you wanted to keep this warehouse a secret. But as you look around, you realize that you were so lost in the moment, strutting around as the super-sexy Kara Zor-L, you wandered far away from the entrance. And the shelf where you found the Power Girl suit and any alternate outfits for her. And though you got the hang of flight, super-speed and X-ray vision, more or less, you didn't feel confident enough to go zipping around at super-speed, and possibly wreck some shelves in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuttering a curse, you fold your arms under your breasts, and do your best to ignore how this pushes your new, ample bosom way up, highlighting your cleavage even more. You realize you'll need much more time to get used to this body, both its superpowers and its...nicer attributes. But as you look around, desperately hoping to find something else to change into, you see you've wandered into...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You recognize the character portraits of ladies from a slew of different franchises. Wild Arms, Legend of Zelda, Fatal Frame, Overwatch... But as you look around the shelves for women's attire that won't attract TOO much attention in the outside world, you find a possible solution that's just overflowing with irony: Dead or Alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecifically, it's the portrait of Tina Armstrong that catches your eye. Instead of walking, in your haste you hover over to the shelf in question, your red cape flowing majestically behind you as you did so. And you belatedly realize that, if anyone were in the warehouse with you, they would have gotten a sweet glimpse at Power Girl's - or rather YOUR - full moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeat rushes up into your cheeks as your boots softly touch down in front of all the stuff available for Tina Armstrong. The suit for the character herself was there, of course, but no need for that. Power Girl was a little taller, much heavier, and, well, had some SWEET superpowers. But Tina was close enough in height and (you stare down at your chest again) bust size to make wearing her clothes viable. So you strip out of Power Girl's costume. Holding the costume up with a couple fingers, a free hand on one hip, you look down again at Kara's naked, insanely built body. Wiggling your toes, swaying your hips... Everything was so different, seeing womanly beauty from this perspective and FEELING so womanly to boot, yet curiosity trumped your lingering male ego. With you free hand, you take a moment to feel up a bare boob, and let out an involuntary yelp when you pinch your own nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God oh God... plenty of time for that later,\" you tell yourself, shocked by how sensitive a body that can survive meteor strikes could be. \"Don't get ahead of yourself.\" With that, you let the Power Girl costume fall to the floor and reach for the shelves with Tina Armstrong's costume. Thankfully, there's some sensible undergarments in there. A lacy, embroidered white bra and panty set among them. Figuring you'd need to get used to feminine stuff anyway, as you were going to milk this warehouse for all it was worth, you decide to slip them on. Even though Kara's super-strength makes having massive breasts a non-issue, the support of a bra still felt welcome. You sigh contentedly as the cups slide into place. If only you could get the hang of fastening the back strap....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you're done with the eternity that is figuring out how women fasten their damn bras, you reach for a pair of blue jeans Tina wore in Dead or Alive 2. As you hoped, they slide right on. \"At least some things work the same as a woman,\" you think aloud as you fasten the belt's buckle. Then you reach for Tina's knee-high, lace-up boots from Dead or Alive 2. After sliding those on as well, you take a deep breath and walk around a little. Surprisingly, it's simplicity itself. At first you think it's just automatic with this body, but then remember your foibles with the bra strap. You lift one foot up, effortlessly keeping balance on one high-heeled boot, and notice the wide, 'chunky' shape of the three-inch heel. THAT'S what made it so easy. Stilettos would have had you falling on your ass. Still, walking in those 'chunky' heels felt surprisingly good. You seemed to glide even more elegantly across the warehouse floor now, and they just FELT so comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo complete the look, you grabbed Tina's jacket from Dead or Alive 2, and her white blouse from Dead or Alive 5; that requires undoing your belt to tuck it in. Mix things up a little, but mostly because Tina's corset top from DoA2 would've showed off too much boobage, and you're not QUITE ready for that yet. And of course, you make sure to button up Tina's blouse ALL THE WAY. You're surprised the buttons are all there, to be frank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, looking down at yourself again, you see a completely different picture. Those shapely legs seemingly poured into denim, your ample bosom now contained within a tight-fitting blouse and a bra underneath. And with no cape, only a thin layer of denim covered your peach of an ass. Still, it was sufficient for walking around the city without drawing TOO much attention, and getting an idea of what life was like on the other side.</span></div></div>",

Nothing too girly like a dress (yet), and not too much skin showing. But with the way these jeans highlighted your toned legs and shapely ass, and the blouse doing nothing to hide how voluptuous your rack was, you'd be surprised if you didn't turn any heads. The idea both makes you nervous and...entices you a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So I guess there's no point looking for anything else here,</i> you decide as you scoop up the Power Girl costume and hover once more. Flying was steadily getting easier, and you use your power to levitate yourself a bit above the shelves, hoping to find the entrance again. You still can't help but glance at all the other outfits and accessories for other women, but you decide against overdoing it. <i>Besides, I don't think KArne Starr has pierced ears. How could she get that? Kryptonite needles?</i> Other jewelry, like necklaces and rings, you dismiss...for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, you find the entrance again. You place the folded Power Girl costume next to your discarded guy clothes, then fish around for the pant pockets' contents in the latter. Realizing that those things would be too noticeable, and thus suspicious, in the jeans pocket of a woman, you stow your wallet and keys in a pocket on the inside of your leather jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, you walk up to the warehouse's main door rather than hovering. Thus, you get a good listen of your high heeled boots clacking against the polished warehouse floor. It sounds louder than you figured it should. Wouldn't stiletto heels be making far more noise. As you open the door, you belatedly realize that it's probably Power Girl's super-hearing. And when you step back out into the outside world...</span></div></div>",

Whatever magic sustained that warehouse you stumbled upon must've mitigated the assault of Power Girl's ears, but after stepping out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt slammed into your brain, your very soul, all at once. Honking horns, plane takeoffs, barking dogs and a menagerie of other noises from the far-off city away assault your eardrums. Even the sounds of heartbeats...EVERY heartbeat in at least a ten-mile radius, suddenly ring in your ears. The peaceful sounds of the forest you recall before going into the warehouse now seem to mock you as sounds from miles away pound into your skull, and you can't help but let out a girly scream as you, a mighty Kryptonian, is brought to your knees! You slam your hands over your ears in a vain attempt to block out the plangent din from miles away, but the sounds keep drilling into your head, and now you slump over, a pathetic, twitching mass kicking up dirt and fallen leaves. Your heat is now pounding so fast, it's making your breasts jiggle like mad in your blouse, but it barely registered as the onslaught of sound continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't how it was supposed to be!

Actually, it wasn't that hard to ignore the dangling sensation, as your ears were still besieged with every little sound coming from the nearby city, and perhaps the entire planet. Would you have to soar beyond Earth's atmosphere, just to catch a break? Or would you have to abandon the idea of being Power Girl, and settle for another woman to transform into?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the way your ears were still aching, it looked like the latter would be a prudent course of action, so you begin to crawl back over to the warehouse's open doorway. After a few seconds, though, the absurdity of that hit you. You were POWER GIRL now, and a little trouble with your superpowers had you mewling and crawling like a little bitch!? \"NO!\" you scream as that sank in. The mantle of Power Girl... to have such a sensuous body, such a tantalizing array of powers... Giving all that up just because one particular power was proving a momentary hindrance!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, here's my first test as a superhero. Proving I can handle a little pain and master my superpowers, otherwise I don't deserve them,</i> you tell yourself resolutely, forcing your own voice to drown out all the other sounds. Forcing your will to overpower the sounds. <i>Now how did they say Superman does it in the movies? Focus on just one sound at a time?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in that deafening melange of noises drilling into your eardrums, you try to pick out a particular sound. You sift through the din for something soft, something unannoying. That's when you're certain you can pick up the sound of a turbine from that new wind farm not too far from the city. Something slow, boring, droning, a predictable pattern...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith intense focus, and a level of discipline you had no idea you possessed, you continue to hone in on that one wind turbine. Focus on the sound of its blades spinning, to the exclusion of all others. And miraculously, it seemed to be working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany more minutes pass before this trick works well enough that all the sounds stop pounding your skull like a drum. Still, you're shaken from the ordeal, and your heart is still hammering, making your dangling breasts jiggle all the more. Gritting your teeth in frustration, you force yourself into an upright position, though you're still not feeling well enough to get off your knees. Looking down, you see some blotches of dirt on your nice, white blouse. With a groan of annoyance, you brush off the dirt as best you can, still intending to look decent once you can strut into town. And at one point, you carelessly brush across your chest, making your tit jiggle, and in the process you're reminded of how sensitive these things are...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, while still concentrating mightily on that one wind turbine, you stand back up in your high-heeled boots. Though the turbine's droning still resounds in your ears, you can still pick up some other close sounds, like a woodpecker hammering away, and a light breeze whistling through some grass and fallen leaves. You will still need time to adjust to super-hearing, so perhaps it wasn't a good idea to fly out of the forest. Getting out of the woods the old-fashioned way, on foot, was perhaps in order, plus it would also give you extra time to adjust to a woman's body in general.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're still groggy from the unexpected skull-pounding, courtesy of your new Kryptonian super-hearing. But at least, by using the 'focus on only one sound' trick, you're learning how to cope. Still, zipping around the skies at top speed is out of the question for the moment. So if you wanted to go into the city to strut your stuff in this Power Girl suit, it had to be the old-fashioned way. On foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, that put a damper on the fun of actually becoming a superhero, but hopefully patience would be rewarded. With a sigh, you take a step forward. Balance is fine, though for some reason you figured that walking in high heels, even chunky ones, wouldn't be as easy outside the warehouse. Getting bombarded by just about every sound everywhere didn't fuel your confidence either. Yet you still find gliding forward in those high-heeled boots to be simplicity itself, even with the uneven terrain. Twigs and leaves crunched with a pleasant sound underneath the thick soles of your boots. Hopefully such ease and grace would carry over if and when you decided to wear fancier heels. \"I'll just have to get used to the way my...ass sways,\" you mutter to yourself as you shut the warehouse door and saunter on, acutely aware of how your shapely derriere swayed in what you imagined was a quite seductive manner. And Tina Armstrong's jeans would do little more to hide that than Power Girl's costume. And then there was the jiggling boobs. Granted, your lovely cleavage was no longer visible through a 'boob window', but still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Still, once I get over this hearing problem, I think I could get used to being Power Girl,</i> you think to yourself as you continue your leisurely stroll toward the forest's edge. Though you still focused mightily on the sound of a singular wind turbine miles away, other sounds of the forest float into your ears. Squirrels chittering in many trees along your path, birdsong blasting from every angle. It no longer drills into your skull like before, much to your relief, and the melange was starting to feel melodious. Looking up, you see some squirrels skittering across branches. Maybe it was the new feminine side you just discovered, but part of you wants to float up at super-speed and snag those squirrels, snuggle them close. But until you could be confident that your super-hearing wouldn't adversely affect your other Kryptonian powers, you had to be patient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back ahead, you come across a river. But using flight wouldn't be necessary to cross it, as there was small bridge you could use. You begin to walk across it, the distinct sound of your heels striking a hard surface once again resounding in your ears. You're getting more comfortable with that. It's almost as melodic as the sounds of the forest, in a way. Looking over the bridge's railing, you see your reflection in the water. Your shortish blond hair being lightly tossed around by a breeze, a lovely but confused face staring back up at you... Your mouth hangs open a little in surprise from how it hits home that this knockout is now you, so long as you keep the bodysuit on, and everything about it feels so real! Just briefly brushing a hand against one breast drove that home. And the rest of you... You bring your fingers to your lips again, and with no glove on this time, you feel the plump, moist texture of Karen Starr's very kissable lips, then the surprisingly softness of her cheeks. Of course, to anyone else, your flesh would probably feel more like hard rubber, and like solid concrete to whoever tried to strike you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat gives you pause for a moment. While being a Kryptonian, no one could hurt you physically. But if you wanted to...experiment with what this body could do, would you be able to even FEEL when someone hugged or kissed you, let alone simply touched you? And just HOW far would you be willing to go anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese questions continue to cause you turmoil as you continue your walk out of the forest. And at long last, you see a familiar road. The stump-warehouse had been on your family's rather expansive property, but you had walked in the opposite direction. The outer edges of the downtown areas weren't too much farther. Looking up, you note that there's a few hours of daylight left, absentmindedly brushing some blond locks of hair out of your eyes as you did so. So in the time you had before you were expected back home, what do you decide to do first?</span></div></div>",

Still too afraid to try out flying in broad daylight, you glance at the schedule, and you're in luck. There's a bus due in less than five minutes, ready to take you into the heart of the downtown area. And since you're quickly growing more accustomed to your super-hearing, you're fairly certain that the droning engine sound steadily getting closer is that of a bus. You also pick up the heartbeats of some people also waiting at the bus stop. And since you can also acutely hear blood rushing to a certain organ below those beating hearts, you can hazard a guess as to why these folks are suddenly aflutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan, inadvertently placing your hands on your hips as you do so, all while doing your best to ignore the furtive glances these horndogs cast your way when they're certain you don't notice. It's not one of your superpowers, but you can practically feel their eyes zeroing in on your ass as you dig into your jacket's inner pocket, looking for change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercifully, the bus arrives soon after you find exact change, and you take long strides right to the back of the bus. If any guy wanted to ogle you, let them be forced to have to look back to do so, exposing themselves. <i>Geez, I'll stop being so dismissive when girls complain about creepy guys drooling over them,</i> as you slump back into your bus seat. Your sudden empathy with the fairer sex doesn't seem to register with some of the actual women on the bus with you. You catch quick glances of envy from some of the other ladies on the bus. <i>Don't hate me because I'm beautiful,</i> you silently tell them, grinning a little. You breathe in deeply, making your ample bust even more noticeable. <i>Flaunt 'em if you got 'em.</i> It still amazed you how much of a knockout you were as Power Girl. Good thing she didn't need any cosmetics to bring out her beauty, as you wouldn't know what to do even if you did have makeup. Even nail polish would probably be beyond you. Maybe you could get pointers from Anna, Mia and Mary later. That is, if you had the guts to spill this new secret...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, it's not too long until the bus drops you off downtown, and you simply set off in a random direction. By the time anyone expected you back home, you could just fly out of the city under the cover of darkness. And so, with the din of the noisy city becoming less and less of a hindrance, you resolve to just take in this first-time experience of simply walking down the street as a woman. The way you gracefully glide over the sidewalk in those high-heeled boots is a curious thrill all in itself; so what if you have to wait a little longer to try unhindered flight? Though the sensation of jiggling boobs would still take getting used to, and the way heels made you walk in a more feminine manner... You could still feel eyes fixated on your denim-clad ass. Not to mention when cars slowed a little as they passed you by, the gaze of the male drivers shifting your way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel heat rise into your cheeks again, and your fingers absentmindedly brush against one of those cheeks, then through your shortish yet girlishly soft hair. You shudder as you wonder what sort of reception you would have gotten had you chose to wear something much more feminine like a dress, or dared to expose cleavage like Power Girl's costume does. And as fate would have it, when you look to the shops on this side of the streets, you see all sorts of women's apparel in the windows. Handbags, jewelry, designer dresses... <i>Just HOW deep into this am I willing to go?</i> you ask yourself nervously. And though you don't walk any slower, you can't turn your gaze away from the stuff in the windows, visualizing yourself with a purse slung on your shoulder, or with those fancy necklaces and bracelets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can be drawn too deeply into getting all femmed out, a pleasant aroma wafts up into your nostrils. <i>Hmmm, pizza,</i> you think with delight, looking across the street and seeing a pizzeria. Granted, Power Girl didn't exactly HAVE to eat. In fact, now that you think about, you feel a bit more invigorated after stepping out into the sunshine, as one would expect. Still, how different would something as simple as stopping for pizza be in this voluptuous form? Glancing over to the traffic signs, you see you're clear to walk across, and don't hesitate in doing so. Though one driver almost doesn't notice the light is red, and screeches to a halt just inches from your legs. Not that it would have hurt you in the least, but it would've attracted unwanted attention. And the guy driving that car... Despite you having the right of way, he hurls a slew of epithets your way, not the least of which were 'bitch' and 'skank'. You casually give him the finger without glancing back. <i>Count yourself lucky I decided against trying out my heat vision, you prick.</i> Not giving that pig another thought, you head toward the pizzeria.</span></div></div>",

It stretches over your body, then fills every little crack, every hole, every pore. You look between your legs and find what looks like pussy lips attached to your balls and penis. Once the suit has penetrated to every cell in your body, you start to change. Your chest expands. Your body shrinks. Your face changes. Your bones crunch and grind, which is sorta painful. You look down again, past your expanding chest, to find that there's a very long clit, which shrinks to normal size quickly. You can feel the suit changing your insides, mostly growing a vagina and uterus. Then it stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that you have to find a bathroom quickly. Your bladder must have shrunk. You run at the door, but when you grab the handle, you just stumble through it. \"Interesting,\" you say to yourself. \"I'll have to explore this a bit more to figure out how it works. Maybe I could put on Mystique's suit next.\" Suddenly, you feel fluid shooting from your bladder out your crotch. The relief is heavenly, but it's going to make a mess... but... there's no puddle on the ground. Then you notice you foot still inside the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now <i>that's</i> cool! I wonder if I can--\" You're interrupted by the stream splashing on the floor, and one of your feet. You quickly try to think of yourself as transparant, and the stream, which has reduced to drops, doesn't splash anymore. \"Interesting.\" You step back inside the warehouse to take a look around, find the bathroom, find any other facilities, that sort of thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a minute, you start to get cold. That's right. You're a girl... a naked girl. You run back to Kitty's shelf of clothes, then feel how painful it is to run without a bra, so you make your steps less up and more forward. It helps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat uniform do you put on?</span></div></div>",

Fleur would have been about twenty when she married Bill Weasley despite his injuries, and the empty, alive-looking skin looks a little older. Also it comes with a pretty dress and associated clothes much like what a stylish Frenchwoman of a decade or more ago might wear. There's only one copy of Fleur's nine-and-a-half inch rosewood wand (presumably with a veela-hair core) for all the Fleur suits. You guess that this is a married Fleur from after the defeat of Voldemort but from before her first pregnancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hair of the suit is a strange but stunning silver-blonde that looks completely natural with the suit's pale, almost glowing skin. You can see from the shape of the empty skin that Fleur is a tall woman with elegantly long but slender hands and feet. The suit is one piece, slit from chin to crotch, and you put your left leg into its empty left leg. Your leg slips neatly into place, your wide foot into its narrow one, and in moments your left leg and the suit's have combined into the left leg of Fleur Delacour!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you are entirely Fleur below the waist, your boy parts absorbed into your silver-haired crotch and your hairless legs almost aglow with the look of part-veela girl-skin. Soon you're Fleur up to the neck, and you almost frantically stuff your boy head into the glorious but hollow girl head and seal yourself shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories new to you flood into your transformed head. A new female personality engulfs your male one. At first it seems as if your Anthony self no longer exists, but soon you're sure that it's intact and definitely in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA naked Fleur Delacour gazes contentedly back from the convenient full-length mirror, admiring her tall, slender silver-haired body in an almost matter-of-fact way. A recent memory of hers tells you that now the war is over, she (you, sort of) and Bill have been trying very hard to get her pregnant. Bill's long-healed injuries have been no impediment.  You laugh gently and beautifully but your inner Anthony self doesn't feel Fleur's love for or sexual attraction to her husband.  Just as well, really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman you've become</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You are a boy named Anthony who has moved into a new house out in the countryside, with a lot of land, and with a forest on the property. while exploring the forest, you find a hidden door that leads underground to what appears to be a warehouse with no one in it. You quickly learn that the first person who finds it becomes the owner, which happens to be you. Once the warehouse is yours, you find that you can make it so that nobody can find any trace of it if you don't want them to. You discover that the room is full of suits of fictional girls, and that any time a new girl is created in a work of fiction, a suit of them appears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou actually become the girls while wearing the suits, from all of their abilities, to the fact that you'd be another gender. There is also a device that can imprint whatever suit you're wearing, and make it your actual body, with the one before it being turned into a suit. You can also have yourself transported into their series. While wearing the suit, you can access their memories (unless the suit was once the body of a real person), and put their personalities in control if you want to, but able to make them do anything you want (but their personalities can't overpower those of the person wearing them, meaning they can't seize control over the person wearing them).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo gay/lesbian stuff or incest (although you can have fun with a female family member's body if you have become them, just so long as you don't have sex with the family member).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeep any names of characters the same throughout the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf I find out that someone who adds has stolen someone else's chapter, and then posted it as their own, then I'll delete it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo killing off Anthony or ending the story. If a person would die while inside the series, then they will reappear in the real world, unless they can be brought back to life in that series (like with the dragon balls)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny character who in their series is called a god will be considered a powerful spirit instead in this story, even if the charaters from their series won't call them as such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have just finished school for the year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the character suits will be naked, with their clothes and any other object they've had at any point on a shelf next to them. Since the clothes off all characters are there, you can have a person in any suit wear any character's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of the reality altering device, nothing can change the reality of the outside world. Time freezing and slowdown work, but no time travel itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA suit can only be worn by a person of the opposite gender, meaning only male bodies can wear a female suit, and only female bodies can wear a male suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll normal character suits must have a human/humanoid form. There is a machine that can make special human versions of non humanoid/human game girls, and can make a complete human form of a humanoid game girl. In both of these instances, the person who puts up the choice must put a link to a picture, except if they immediately make an option chapter afterwards giving more choices for how the character would look (in which case the links would be needed there instead). I am debating on whether or not to allow someone wearing that kind of suit to go into the series.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same machine can make female versions of male human/humanoid video game characters. The person who puts up the choice must put a link to a picture, except if they immediately make an option chapter afterwards giving more choices for how the character would look (in which case the links would be needed there instead). These characters can enter into the series, but any relationship they'd had with a female character will not be in the series (examples: if someone goes into the Starfox series as a female Fox, they won't have a relationship with Krystal, and if someone goes into the Mario series as a female Mario, that person won't have a relationship with Peach, and none of the girls with crushes on Mario will have them on the female Mario).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny medical condition (example: blindness) that a fictional character would have will not be had by the person wearing to suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf a character becomes pregnant while in the series, but delivers the child in the real world, then the child will be a suit. The same applies if one of the parents is below 18 if they conceive the child in the warehouse. There is also a device that can age up a suit created this way, but not passed the age of the youngest parent. The suits conceived take 9 days instead of months to reach development.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA character who is in the suit, or the body of a fictional girl will be able to tell as soon as they conceive a child, and can choose to make the child a suit if they are old enough to support a child, even though they could have the child not be a suit by that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny girl that would be the mother of another character (such as Ninian from Fire Emblem if she gets with Eliwood) will have all of those children first, in the order that they were born in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe above three can be used to create male fictional suits, but not suits of people not from a fictional series.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf a suit of a person not from a fictional series is created, then you can put the suit in a device that will let you make up a personality for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf a person wearing a female suit becomes pregnant, then they can't take it off until the child or suit is no longer in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile inside the warehouse, time can be frozen outside the building if the owner (you) wants it to be frozen, or automatically if someone is inside a fictional series. Outside of the aging device and growth in the womb, the bodies of people in the warehouse won't age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody can enter the building if the owner isn't inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo turning Anthony evil or changing his personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUse proper grammar and spelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can mentally control the suits, and make them put themselves on (You stay in control). This includes if someone else is wearing it, as a safety feature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a device that can alter reality, and the memories of others to having someone wearing a suit to being that person normally. Only Anthony is immune. If reality is altered, only people who have been screened from the process will remember how things were, with nobody finding anything odd about it. For example, if Anthony was to turn into a woman older than his parents, people would know about him being older, but won't question it, and the same thing would go if he'd turn himself into an anthro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters who can transform between girl forms and boy forms will be in girl form the whole time, with no traces of the boy form. Note that you can't go into the series as these characters except if there is a point where they don't change.<br>\r\nExamples:<br>\r\nRanma<br>\r\nNaruto using the Sexy Jutsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there is ever a debate on the gender of a character, then ask me, and I'll decide. Characters that are counted as female:<br>\r\nHaku. There is no way that Haku is a boy in my opinion, and I can think of several reason for Haku to lie about her gender and claim to be male.<br>\r\nVivian. In the English version of Paper Mario the Thousand Year Door it is true without a doubt, and by what I understand, the info in the journal about the characters in the Japanese version comes from Mario's point of view, and since Beldam calls Vivian a man during an insult, Mario could quite possibly only believe it to be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease put up links to pictures of the fictional girls during the option chapter they are mentioned in, or the chapter someone turns into them. Also, if you can, put up links to images of any original characters from that series, or any fused characters. (I'll do my best to edit the chapters already up to include images). Don't hesitate to use pictures of what the girls are doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere may be other things I'm forgetting, so everything else is fair game unless I remember anything else and add it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony: 16 years old. A lone-wolf, but not a mean person and is very stubborn. Will always be there for his friends if he can; become his enemy and you will have a hard time. He is not a lone-wolf towards his friends. Tall, with dark brown hair and dark brown eyes. Wears dark blue jeans or shorts, black shoes, with the shirts he wears being either completely dark blue, completely yellow, completely red, very dark blue with the word Nintendo written on the front, or black with a picture of Sonic on the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther Characters (Note, there are changes, due to the fact that one woman having as many kids as Diana did in the original is unrealistic):<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura: Anthony's older sister by a few months. 16 years old. She wears brown boots, jeans, and a black shirt. She has blond hair. She is a very selfish person who thinks she is better than everyone else. She still cares for her siblings, and unknown to them, has threatened Sarah to not let Zoey know the truth after kicking her butt, since Zoey cares for her step siblings and step father, and Laura doesn't want to risk Zoey distancing herself from them. Kimberly kept custody of her after the divorce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack: Anthony's older brother. 20 years old. Gets along with Anthony and and the rest of their siblings, except Laura, although both care for each other. Zoey thinks Zack is just a friend of Anthony's. Kimberly kept custody of him after the divorce. Has a crush on Mary, but due to being step siblings, feels awkward about it, so he doesn't tell her. He doesn't know she feels the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly: Anthony's 42 year old mother. She wears black high heels, a grey skirt, and a grey shirt. She has long brown hair. A very kind person, she cares about other people and tries to help them if they need it. Sad that her family was split apart, but she and Henry just couldn't make it last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah: Anthony's older step sister. 17 years old. She's shallow, liking only what's popular, and is a real witch (Not literally, just personality wise, and I won't write the word originally used to describe her that was used by the person who created her) towards Anthony and friends. Always dyes her hair to whatever hair color is popular. Fears Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna: Anthony's younger step sister. 15 years old. Just started the swim team 3 months ago. She has a long, straight golden hair, average eyes, pointy nose, and her mouth is not big, but not small, and she always smile in front of people, and giggles as she talks, which makes her look cute on the face. She is thin, and moderately short, around 160+cm in height, she has the breast of C-cup sized, it's not that big. She is also good in sports, and intelligent in her work, and she is popular among her age group, but not exactly as popular as school models. She looks up to and respects Anthony. She loves anime and video games. She wears a wide variety of clothes, but wears a green one-piece bathing suit while swimming. She has a crush on Anthony, but feels awkward about it, due to Zoey not knowing, and them being step siblings, so she hides it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy: Anthony's younger brother. 13 years old. Loves video games. Has a crush on Bethany, although she doesn't know (more info will be added when someone expands upon it).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoey: Anthony's younger step sister. 10 years old. She is majorly in love with Anthony, but due to thinking that they are actually related, she feels awkward about her feelings and hides them, acting like she just has a brother complex, however, if she found out the truth, she would make no effort to hide her feelings. She likes her friends, and unlike Sarah, she doesn't like populars or following them. She has a short, light brown hair in pigtails, amber-colored eyes and a smile that fits greatly on her face. She has normal breasts, not too big because she's so young. She wears mostly skirts and shirts, but she has some jeans, and sometimes she wears dresses, she loves all colors equally, and thus, she has many different colors of clothing. She likes candy (mainly chocolate), playing videogame, and she loves love stories. Anthony likes her too and they've always gotten along. She has the personality of a cute 10 year innocent girl, she wouldn't do anything bad even if forced to. She knows her brother is a nice person and inspires in him. She loves being praised and is a hard worker. Would do everything for her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia: Anthony's twin sister who gets along with him very well. Her favorite fictional character is Mia from the Fire Emblem series, because they share the same name, and similar personalities. She naturally has black hair, but always dyes it purple in order to be like her favorite character. She is almost always wearing a skirt or dress. She likes sports (one of the few kinds of things that she doesn't wear a skirt for), but can't stand cheerleaders. She is easily excitable, more so when she has some kind of sugar (which is why she usually isn't allowed by her family to have any when at home or out at a family event).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she has some kind of sugar, then she gets so hyper that she sometimes starts pulling pranks, although they're never harmful. She is an odd mix of being a tomboy and girly-girl, but gets annoyed with girls who are complete girly-girls. Shares Anthony's love of the sword, anime, and video games, but because of how hyper she is, she hardly ever reads books, because she think they're too boring for the most part.. She's a little faster than Anthony, but a little weaker. She is also a couple minutes younger than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary: Anthony's older step sister who is in college. 21 years old. Waist length, dark brown hair kept in a ponytail, same eyes as Anthony, shorter than Anthony but athletic. Humble and willing to help out. She enjoys playing video games with Anthony a bit. Likes spending time with friends and Anthony when possible. Adapt at video games somewhat (not as much as Anthony or the others), pretty fast as she almost beat a track record. Nimble as well (as in she could be an excellent thief if she desired) She likes sticking up for people when they feel oppressed, she has a strong sense of justice, and she is a tomboy. Prefers to wear a lavender sweater over a white tank top, along regular jeans and white shoes. She has a crush on Zack, but since they are step siblings, feels awkward about it, and doesn't tell him. She doesn't know that he feels the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana: Anthony's step mother. She is a widow, with her late husband being Henry's distant cousin. She married Henry a little over a year after her late husband's death, during that time, Zoey was born. Since Henry has the same last name as her married name, Zoey hasn't been able to find anything weird about it that could cause her to figure out. (This is all for her for now, I'll update it if/when she is used again)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry: Anthony's father. 42 years old. Is in the military, but his section hasn't been called in to outside conflict at the time. He is about to begin some military training required, and won't be back for two weeks. He'll either leave while Anthony is at school, or the next day, depending on who is writing. Originally married to Kimberly, but they couldn't make it last. All of his kids blame him for splitting up the family. (more info will be added when someone expands upon it).Frank: A guy the same age as Anthony and Mia, Anthony's only just met him, and he already feels Frank would never do anything like back stab him, a true blue friend. Has dusty blond hair, brown eyes, and is really random and hilarious. Lives 3 houses down from Anthony, and they'll go to the same school once summer is over. He is really into fictional girls and becoming them, although he's not gay at all. This is the chance for him to have his dream come true!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy: A guy who just met Anthony after Frank told him about Anthony. He has been a long time friend of Franks. Has semi-long brown hair and deep blue eyes as he is From Germany. Obsessed about wolves and shares the same fictional girl attitude Frank does. He really loves the character Renamon from Digimon. But is saddened that she is not real and dreams about becoming a Renamon somehow but knows it won\u2019t ever happen. He has a semi-fierce attitude like the wolves he likes so much but is loyal to his friends and would kill himself before betraying his friends purposely. Very fun loving and likes parties and fighting as he is a black belt in kickboxing. His he loves wolves and has the nickname \"Wolf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna: 16 years old. She has long white hair, dark skin and bright green eyes. She wears a red, white, and blue jacket with a Puerto Rican flag on the backside. She also wears a pair of pitch black jeans and red and white chucks. Laid back, yet somehow, easily excitable. She loves video games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames: 16 years old. 5'9, average build. Short strawberry-blonde hair, blue eyes. A little shy but is kind to others, loves all kinds of Nintendo games, RPG's are favorite. Likes to hang out with friends as much as possible, doesn't talk a whole lot, really into sports as well. He cares deeply for his siblings, especially his special needs brother. Tries to be outgoing and talkative, but he more often than not can't come up with what to say. Doesn't really know what he wants to be in life. Mostly just trying to figure out what works. Wants to have a girlfriend but doesn't really have a good grasp at romance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm giving 300 gift points to anyone who adds actual chapters without breaking one of my rules.</td>",
