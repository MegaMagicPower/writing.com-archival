            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frankie was already awake when his alarm clock began to beep. Today marked his first day of high school, and like any normal thirteen year old he was extremely anxious. Unlike any normal thirteen year old, however, Frankie had just recently crested five hundred pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd always been a large boy, just a little on the chubby side, but after his father divorced his mother when he was five, his mom had babied the entire family, feeding them extra sweets and comfort food. Things really started getting out of hand as Frankie approached his teen years. Kids had always made fun of him- due to his massive size he couldn't take part in sports or other ply activities. Recently, however, the teasing had ramped up, and when the teasing ramped up so did his eating, sending the young teen spiraling into morbid obesity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Frankie would never admit it (not even to himself) he did love his huge body. He loved the warmth of the thick layer of fat that coated his entire body, he loved how his body jiggled and sloshed with even the slightest movement, and he even loved touching and pinching his thick rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed and rolled out of bed. Frankie had long given up on trying to sit up, his massive belly made it nearly impossible and his long buried abs were unable to support the weight. He stood up, steadying himself on his bed side table. Once his body stopped jiggling, he began the slow waddle to his mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it was only a few steps away, Frankie was already starting to get winded. When he finally reached the mirror he stopped to study himself. The teen usually slept in the buff, but modesty had long ceased to be a problem for him. His heavy belly covered his privates (now painfully swollen but irritatingly inaccessible) and hung down to his mid thighs. At this point, his belly was so big that he could barely wrap his arms around it. The rest if him wasn't so little either. His hips and ass were wide rolling expanses of milky fat that were forever knocking into things. His love handles were thick, almost two inches of overhanging flab. His thighs were enormous flabby tree trunks. With every step, they rub together, and against his crotch and underbelly. Even his chest was soft and doughy. His moobs were saggy and a long time ago had expanded into the area underneath his arms. A large double chin was neighbors to his man boobs, and was slowly but steadily becoming a triple chin. Every part of his body was covered in a thick layer of lard, even his fingers looked like tightly packed sausages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Frankie sighed, grabbing his love handles and shaking  them slightly, sending ripples through his body. Well, maybe it wasn't so bad. He cocked his head, before shuffling to the side and wincing. He large belly pushed out into the space before him, almost like it was a completely different entity. Worse, he couldn't even see the entirety of his corpulent form in the mirror. Either his ass or his belly was cut out depending on whether he shuffled forward or backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down (a view composed entirely of his saggy tits and belly), Frankie tried to push it from his mind. Who knew? Maybe this year would be different! Maybe this year he'd get friends, and the bullies would find someone new to pick on. Hell, maybe he'd even find a girlfriend (or perhaps, a boyfriend). It was a brand new year after all, and anything could happen! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr potentially get a whole lot worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResigning himself to his fate, Frankie decided to start getting ready.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well, first things first. Grabbing a mostly clean pair of boxers, Frankie flopped down on his creaking bed. Now the easy part: easily he pulled his boxers up around his calves. Now for the harder part: his thighs and underbelly. This was a bit trickier. While difficult he was able to scoot his boxers up his thighs and around his expanded belly. At the expense of his breathe, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, he sat panting at the slight exertion. Then he hefted himself up again, once again sending his belly sloshing. Frankie grimaced and fiddled with the elastic band of his boxers. The band was pulled as tight as it could, and cut deeply into his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce standing, he grabbed a pair of jeans. They were new, bought a few weeks ago by his mother for his first day of school. After trying them on once to make sure they fit, he hadn't touched them again, preferring the comfort of his boxers and sweatpants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Frankie sat down in his bed and began the arduous task. When he reached his thighs, he encountered a problem. Despite his best efforts, Frankie was unable to pull the pants up over his thunder thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat dripping down his brow, Frankie leaned back. With a grunt, he was able to up the jeans up. Panting, Frankie wiped the sweat off his brow. Now for the hardest part, getting it around his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was already apparently, that the jeans weren't getting around his belly apron. With another grunt, he pushed it to the side and tried to button his pants. After a few moments of struggling, he stopped to catch his breathe. This was the most exercise the obese teen and gotten all summer. Still panting, Frankie sucked in his tummy and tried again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of trying to pull the fabric closed, he stopped and flopped down on his bed. Now that he was lying down he decided  to give it one last go. With one last herculean effort, he managed to get the pants putting and zippered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie winced again, and fidgeted with the waistband. If his boxers had been tight before, his jeans were painfully tight. He rolled over again, to check himself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly apron lolled over the hem of his jeans and he was rocking a rather large muffin top. He looked as though he was ready to burst out of the jeans. Frankie sighed. Five hundred pounds of fat stuffed into a four hundred fifty wide jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie looked away, and grabbed on of his shirts. That went on a bit easier. When he caught side of himself in the mirror, however, he sighed in frustration again. The shirt was just a bit too small, and revealed a good inch of belly fat. That was a easy fix though. Frankie grabbed one of his hoodies and through that on, zipping it up. There! That  solved that problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHard work done, Frankie wiped sweat from his brow. The boy was still quite out of breathe, but he'd over come the greatest hurtle. Quickly, the boy threw on his socks and shoes and brushed his teeth. When he was done, he headed downstairs for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother, sister and younger brother were already down there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Frankie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it was early, his mother was already cooking up a storm. The plumb woman had already put out a spread: large stacks of pancakes, crunchy bacon and sausage, greasy eggs and toast smothered in butter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie's younger brother Jake had already tucked in. While younger by three years, he was by no means a small boy. Frankie was larger by a good hundred pounds, but the ten year old had already crested into morbid obesity. In fact, he was already larger than Frankie had been at his age, despite being a few inches shorter. As the baby of the family, Jake'd been babied all his life-spoiled even- and had almost no memories of his fitness obsessed father. So it made sense that he was larger- he had a three year head start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Frankie's elder sister, Jenna, was biting into an apple. While Jake had no problems tucking into his super-sized meal and his expanding waistline, Jenna was just the opposite. The fifteen year old had grown self-conscious of her size -a modest three hundred twenty pounds compared to her younger brothers. She'd been on her way to morbid obesity once too, but subjected to the same teasing as Frankie, she'd grown health conscious and started working out and dieting. A lifetime of overeating however was hard to remedy however. Jenna was quite stylish however, and usually wore clothing designed to slim down her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's your breakfast hon.\" Frankie's mother set down a plate in front of him, filled to the brim with food-a six stack of large pancakes, eight pieces of bacon, three sausages, four eggs and a stack of buttered toast. She kisses his chubby cheek, \"Eat up, baby, you need your strength for school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie looked down at the spread and fiddled with his waistband. His pants were painfully tight, and about ready to burst. It probably wasn't a good idea to eat all the greasy food(and probably get bloated). However... His stomach let out a long, painful gurgle. Despite having a rather large midnight snack last night, he was famished, probably from his previous battle of the bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother patted his hungry belly, \"Sounds like someone's hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie loomed down at his belly, pinching a roll of fat with one hand, trying to decide what to do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the end, hunger won out. Frankie cleared his plate, plus and extra three pancakes and sausages, leaving him overly full and terribly bloated. Now the pain around his middle was excruciating. Resisting the urge to belch (his mother's one rule), the teen massaged his swollen belly with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother glanced up at the clock. \"Oh goodness, we're going to be late!\" Grabbing her car keys, Frankie's mom ushered her waddling brood out into her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir first stop was the middle school. If mobility was a problem for Frankie, it was a major issue for Jake. After a moment, of struggling (and Frankie's hands on his ass pushing him up) the obese ten year old finally made it out of the doors, panting and already exhausted. Frankie watch as he made his slow way up to the school's entrance, pausing every step to catch his breathe, belly sloshing around and popping out if his shirt. Not that Jake minded- or could even see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had always considered his younger brother a cute kid. His baby fat and chubby cheeks made him look adorable, and his curly blonde hair only cemented his cherubic resemblance. However, if something was not done, Jake  would probably be immobile by the time he was Frankie's age. Maybe earlier at the rate he was going. Though Frankie thought he looked cute, he weren't sure how he felt about that. Maybe Jenna's attitude was rubbing off on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe high school was only a few blocks down from the middle school, but Frankie's mother drove the two, knowing that Frankie wouldn't make it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun you two!\" His mother called, as they left. Jenna rolled her eyes at her brother,  and Frankie returned the gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Frankie entered the halls, he knew that this year would be no different from the rest. As he passed people, they would point and stare at his obese body, a few even openly gawking. The high school was a regional school, meaning that for most of the students, this was their first time seeing the five hundred pound freshman. No one made any comments yet- they were probably too shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite running late, Frankie managed to make it to homeroom on time. Sweat dribbling down his brown and onto his cheeks, Frankie crammed himself into a desk in the back. The fit was almost as tight as his pants, but that was to be expected and something the big teen was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned back in his chair panting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Hi.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie looked up, mildly surprised that someone was talking to him. Standing before him was a smiling boy, with on hand extended. The boy seemed friendly enough, judging by his smile, and looked Asian- Korean or Japanese, Frankie would have guessed by the types of restaurants in the areas. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I'm Lewis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie took the boy's  hand in his sweaty one and give it a shake, \"Frankie.\" You say slightly bewildered that a...</span></div></div>",

Thin, with small wiry muscles, an even tan and effortlessly cool. His short dark hair was spiked, making it look like he'd just rolled out of bed. On his shirt was the logo of a band Frankie had never heard of (but was probably super cool) and his plaid shirt was unbuttoned and rolled up to his elbows. He wore glasses, black and the only thing chunky about him.Even his jeans were cool- baggy and ripped (something that the never made in Frankie's size). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie couldn't help but stare at him.. Well that and wonder if Lewis might need a stronger prescription.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you.\" Still grinning, Lewis slid into the seat next to yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, nice to meet you too.\" Suddenly, suspicious he look around the room, watching for anyone laughing. No way someone this cool, would sit next to him if it wasn't for some overly elaborate joke. However, besides the stares Frankie usually garnered, no one was giggling in his direction. In fact, most of the students looked more anxious about their rapidly approaching first day of high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus christ.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie's head whips back around when he heard Lewis begin to speak again. The other boy however was still smiling. Frankie  did note that he looked a  little worried too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like I'm about to have a heart attack.\" He continued, \"I mean- lets stop dickin' around and start this already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact that Frankie wanted nothing more than to prolong the wait for  the eminent school year, he nodded. \"Yeah, if we don't start soon, I'm gonna die of anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of their apparent differences, Frankie found Lewis extremely easy to talk with and soon struck up a fast friendship with the boy. Apparently, his parents ran the Korean BBQ and he'd seen Frankie and his family come in a few times. Frankie also learned that Lewis was an honor student (mostly due to his parents breathing down his neck than any personal commitment) and that they were both currently obsessed with the same MMORPG.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith less than five minutes on the clock to homeroom starting, Lewis asked to see Frankie's class schedule. After studying it for a few minutes, his face broke out into a big smile, \"Awesome! We have social studies and gym together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInvoluntarily, Frankie groaned at the mention of gym- though things might be better if he had a friend in class. When Lewis passed the papers back, Frankie also noticed they had the same lunch period. Awesome, so he had his favorite and least favorite periods with his new friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should sit with me.\" Lewis added, Frankie nodded but the conversation was ended by the bell, signaling that homeroom had begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the teacher turned her back on the class to write something on the board, Lewis shot the obese teen a thumbs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie grinned back, finally happy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the classes he had with Lewis were in the afternoon, that meant that Frankie would have to slug through most of the day alone. No one bothered him, but he could hear people giggling when he walked by and had even caught a few people pointing at his enormous rear or jiggling belly. By the time his first class with Lewis, Frankie was practically jogging to it.</span></div></div>",

Even the constant snacking in between classes wasn't as much food as he was used to at home and as a result he was ready to stuff his face silly. And so Frankie bounded down the halls as fast as his fat body would let him towards the lunch room, jiggling the whole way. When he opened the door to the lunch room however, Frankie remembered that he was supposed to sit with Lewis and his friends. He could see the whole situation about to play out in front of him. They'd probably all be jerks and make fun of him for his weight... but then again, Lewis didn't. So Frankie filled his tray with half the usual amount as to look less like a pig (although it was still quite a lot) and headed over to the table where Lewis was sitting.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frankie took a look at Lewis' friends. They all looked relatively cool, but at least they weren't the cookie cutter type who wore all the same style of everything. Sucking in his gut, Frankie managed to slip in next to Lewis. The other kids looked at him for a bit and Frankie's face reddened, but then Lewis remembered to introduce him. \"Hey guys, this is my friend Frankie. We're in homeroom together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy, here it comes,\" Frankie thought to himself, bracing for a barrage of insults. Instead, he was met with warm smiles. A short Portuguese girl with dark red hair (probably died) stuck her hand out at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Gabby\" she said kindly. Frankie bashfully shook her hand, mentally twitching when his arm jiggled from the simple motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, Frankie. We were just talking about some of the latest scumbags running for office these days,\" Said a tall, lanky blond boy with a crooked nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that was mostly you, Nick.\" Said a shorter, chubby black haired boy. Then he turned to Frankie. \"Sorry, Nick likes to rant about politics. I'm Matt. I like drawing and being a cynical asshole, but at least I find myself funny.\" he said with a straight face, and Frankie laughed. Frankie looked at what Matt was doodling at the time, and had to say that it was honestly pretty impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis gestured towards another boy at the table who was busily chowing down into his lunch. He was tall with short, almost shaved blond hair and had a strong muscular build, but enough soft chub to cover it all and give him a nice belly without being \"fat\". Seeing another boy who appreciates food made Frankie feel a little better. \"That's Conner.\" Lewis pointed out. \"He's the resident redneck, or at least as close as you can get at this school.\" Lewis explained that Conner also played that MMORPG they played.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the only thing they have in common!\" A taller girl with multiple colorful bracelets sitting next to Gabby chimed in, wriggling her eyebrows suggestively. Lewis glared at her and threw a muffin wrapper at her, hitting her in her rainbow dyed hair. She responded by punching a bottle in his direction, bouncing off his head, then off Frankie's belly then back in front of her. \"WHOO!\" She shouted in celebration of her conquest over adversity. Clearly this girl was rather enthusiastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunch proceeded calmly for the most part, and Frankie was surprised that nobody brought up his weight (which was pressing against the table the whole time) until out of all of them, Lewis mentioned something. Frankie had more food than most of them (except maybe Conner), but to his dismay his stomach let out a fierce growl. The table giggled, and Lewis said \"You should probably go fill up that tank with seconds, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no... I'm good,\" Frankie said, still shy around these new potential friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I've seen you eat at my parent's restaurant before. I know you can put away more than that! Now go get some more. We don't want you passing out on us.\" He said this in a way that poked fun at him, but there was no hatred. It was a warmer way of saying it, unlike what he was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie waddled up towards the food to fill his tray for real this time. When he was up there, he looked back and noticed an interaction. Lydia, the girl with the rainbow bangs, punched Lewis in the arm and winked. Lewis then shoved her back, laughing. Lydia turned to whisper something to Gabby while Lewis turned to Conner, clearly saying something to him. Conner nodded and smiled, then gave Lewis a pat on the back. Matt was lost in his sketches and Nick was browsing for what was probably the latest memes or news articles regarding national policies or something Frankie didn't understand.

Frankie was very pleased that his school cafeteria was ala cart, he could get as much as he liked. He piled on his favorites. Considering he hadn't taken what he normally would have the first time around, he grabbed enough to compensate, plus a little extra. Frankie wasn't feeling embarrassed about his appetite anymore, now that Lewis and his friends had accepted him. After grabbing seconds, he grabbed some desserts while he was up at the line, he didn't want to do too much walking. After paying for his food, he went back to Lewis and his friends and sat back down. Lewis looked at Frankie, he then said \"That's more like it, Frankie,\". with a smile on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConner then chimed in. \"Dude, that's a lot of food, mind if I have some?\" Frankie didn't really want to share. It's not that Frankie was selfish, but he usually didn't like to share his food. However, he was trying to make friends and he didn't want to botch it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Here, take a couple of brownies.\" Frankie then handed them over to Conner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks dude.\" Conner said with a smile. Frankie then proceeded to eat the remainder of his lunch. After about 10 minutes, Frankie had devoured his seconds and desserts and he was now quite full and was bloated again. He unconsciously rubbed his very massive belly to help soothe it. Despite the pain, he really enjoyed the sensation of being overly full. As he rubbed his belly he noticed Lewis looking down at it, with a wanting look in his eyes. He meet Lewis' eyes and Lewis cheeks turned scarlet instantly and looked away. Frankie wasn't quite sure what to make of it. He couldn't imagine that a gorgeous male specimen like Lewis would find him, a mountain of blubber, at all attractive. Frankie, Lewis and all the rest of the gang carried on until a the lunch bell rang and they all went to their respective classes.

As he waddled down the halls kids murmured, glancing his way but looking away before they thought he could tell they were talking about him. Of course, when you take up a third of the hall and jiggle with every slow step as Frankie does, you come to expect this kind of treatment. Better than being ignored, Frankie figured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie collapsed into a chair as soon as he got into the classroom. A blonde girl behind him made a disgusted face, but he didn't notice and if he did he probably wouldn't care. Frankie rested his doughy arms on his belly, feeling the mound of lard rise and fall as he took in air. Once the world came back to him and his breath steadied, he looked around his class. It wasn't a huge class. There were at least 20 kids including himself. Matt and Lydia, Lewis' friends from lunch, had sat next to him but he hadn't noticed while he was catching his breath. They were studying each others' complex notebook doodles and Lydia was showing off a set of new sketching pens she got over the summer, prime and ready for NOT math.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher rose from his desk. He ran a hand through his thinning, graying hair and approached the board. As he rambled on about expectations for the year in a dreary tone, masked with an earnest but weak attempt at hopefulness, Matt prodded Frankie's arm with a pencil. Frankie turned around, his second chin contorting around his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Frankie,\" Matt whispered. \"Are you any good at math?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sort of.\" The obese teen replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, 'cause I'll need someone to copy off of this year,\" He chuckled, but Frankie got the feeling that he was serious. Lydia nodded in agreement with Matt. Frankie turned back to face the board. As he zoned off, his hands gently squeezed the soft surface of his stomach. Frankie had a habit of playing with his belly when he got bored. The squishiness soothed his mind and before he knew it math class was over. Frankie looked at his schedule as Lydia leaned over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you next class is...\" She ran a finger over his schedule.</span></div></div>",

Frankie tried to remember which classmate that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he usually sits with us at lunch. He was off at some GSA meeting today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a GSA?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, gay-straight alliance? Basically people talk about issues with bullying and gay stuff. Not that we really have a problem with that in our school, but Karl's always complaining there aren't enough gay guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he seems...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, pretty much,\" said Lydia. \"Well, you'll find out next period!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and while you're there, can you do something for us?\" Matt looked as if he had just remembered something. \"Lydia and I have this theory that Karl's into... bigger guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...?\" Frankie blushed a little and subconsciously sucked in his gut, not that it did anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, so see if you can catch him staring at you or anything. Karl's pretty bad at hiding when he's into a guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, what even makes you think he'd like a guy like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I don't really know if it's my place to say...\" Matt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Connor.\" Lydia giggled. Matt rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Connor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, those two have an on and off thing going. They hate each other though so it's fun to watch. And if you've ever seen them go at \"it\", well... Oh, and Karl never gives a clear answer to what his \"type\" is so we figure it's guys like Connor, otherwise he'd be chasing after Lewis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-seriously?\" Frankie's head was spinning with all this gossip. He never figured Connor would be that type of guy... \"Well, I guess I'll keep an eye out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet!\" Lydia got up and grabbed her bag. \"Well, I've got to get going to science...\" She pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt got up casually. \"And remember, you did NOT hear that from us. Or at least you didn't hear it from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie got up too, although not as easily of course, and headed through the halls to his next class. Chorus class took place in a basic classroom, fitted with risers, stands for sheet music that half the students couldn't read, and a piano in the corner. Frankie grabbed a seat off to the side. The cheap plastic groaned under his weight. Other students filed in, guys moving to one side, girls moving to the other. A tall, thin boy with freckles and neat, short hair, skipped merrily into the room. The moment his gaze shifted to the side of the room with Frankie, however, he paused mid-step and blinked a few times, facing away. The boy took a deep breath and casually strolled over and too the seat next to Frankie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi! You must be the new guy. I'm Karl!\" He said in an upbeat tone. \"So, are you tenor, baritone or bass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, am I what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Karl's face sunk a little, as if Frankie told him he had never heard of Gandhi. \"Tenor is higher voices, baritone is middle and bass is low.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I'm a baritone I think? I don't really sing, I just got this class 'cause they needed more guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't worry. Choir is my favorite class! I'm a tenor by the way.\" Karl rambled on for a bit about the finer points of singing, and how if Frankie's good he should try out for the school musical. All the while he was smiling in a way Frankie found both genuine and intentional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Karl...\" Frankie cut him off. \"You sound like you know what you're saying but I really don't know anything about this stuff...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe I could teach you some time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie decided now would be a good time to test Lydia and Matt's theory. \"Yeah, that would be cool.\" He stretched back in his chair, his belly poking out from the bottom of his shirt. Karl's eyes fixated on the soft fat for a brief moment before Frankie pulled his shirt back down. \"Oh, sorry about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, it's fine... haha...\" Karl laughed it off, but something in his voice wavered from his previous confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher came in and began warming up the class. Frankie wasn't quite used to the scales and fumbled every now and then, but Karl was on point. In fact, it seemed like Karl was making a competition out of it almost. Then the teacher announced that he needed to hear from all the new students to assign their part, bass baritone or tenor. When Frankie was called up, Karl smiled at him and said \"You'll do fine!\" but Frankie wasn't so sure...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Frankie looked down at the vast spread of breakfast, then fiddled with his waistband. These new jeans were painfully tight; Frankie thought they might even burst when he sat down. It probably wouldn't be a good idea to eat all that breakfast on the first day, he thought. However his stomach had other ideas, and let out a long, painful gurgle. Despite his rather large midnight snack, Frankie was famished, probably from his battle to get his clothes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother patted his hungry belly in passing. \"Sounds like someone's hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie looked down at his belly, fiddled with his waistband, even grabbed a roll of fat with one hand, trying to decide what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother spotted his hesitation, and stopped by him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those jeans are too tight, aren't they, my little butterball?\" she said in a loving tone of voice.  \"I thought they might be. And I bet that shirt is a bit small.  Head back upstairs - there's a 'Vast Waistband' shopping bag just inside my bedroom door.  I got some bigger jeans and shirts for you yesterday, my growing pumpkin.  Leave those ones in the bag and I'll return them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I love you, you're the best!\" Frankie said in relief.  Hauling his gelatinous quarter ton back up the stairs, he panted with both exertion and relief.  Grabbing the shopping bag and heading into his own room, he, straining, strips off the constricting jeans and shirt.  In the bag he finds two pairs - one bigger, and one much bigger.  With effort, reaching around his globular gut, he pulls the bigger pair on - and finds that they're actually stretch denim, a kind he's never had before!  They don't restrict his gut at all!  And the t-shirt is much longer than his previous one... no gap at all around his gutline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling very happy about first day in new clothes now, Frankie fairly bounces down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the table, Frankie gorged through his heaping plate, plus a second mounded plate and then three extra pancakes and sausages.  Pushing back from the table, he felt replete \u2013 pleasantly stuffed. Resisting the urge to belch (his mother's table rules forbid it), the teen blimp massaged his swollen belly, easing the tension within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother, happy her flock was full, now urged them along.  \"Time to go kids, school bells don\u2019t wait.\" Passing them their lunches, Frankie's mom marshalled her obese brood out the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first stop was Jake\u2019s middle school. Frankie found walking distances a chore, but Jake absolutely detested having to walk any distance.  Their mom angled her minivan as close to the school doors as possible, then Frankie helped push the immense ten year old up from his seat and out the sliding door. Frankie watch as Jake made his laborious way up to the school's doors, pausing every few steps to catch his breathe.  Jake\u2019s belly bounced and swayed as he waddled, threatening to pop out of his shirt with every step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie deemed his younger brother a cute kid. Jake\u2019s baby fat and chubby cheeks had made him very adorable when he was younger, an image that his curly blonde hair still suggested. However, even Frankie could see that if something wasn\u2019t done, if Jake\u2019s growth didn\u2019t slow, Jake would soon be immobile \u2013 maybe even by the time he became a teenager! Frankie wasn\u2019t sure how he felt about that \u2013 not that he was a super athlete or anything himself.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nFrankie and Jenna\u2019s high school was only a few blocks away from the middle school, but Frankie's mother drove the distance, \u2018to save time\u2019, though also because she knew Frankie would be sweaty if he had to walk that far in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun on your first day, you two!\" their mother called, as they headed away from the minivan.  Jenna rolled her eyes, but Frankie grinned back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, his momentary positive spirits soon evaporated.  As soon as he entered, Frankie knew that this year would be no different - as he passed, other kids would point at his obese body, and a few even openly commented. This high school had many feeder schools, so the kids who knew Frankie and his extraordinarily fat body were outnumbered by others who had never seen a 500 pound guy before \u2013 and Frankie could just read the shock and revulsion in their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his slow rate of progress, Frankie made it to his new homeroom on time. As he crammed himself into a desk, he felt sweat dribbling down his back. The desk was a tight fit \u2013 like the first pair of jeans he\u2019d had on this morning, he really overflowed it, but he was used to that at school.  Sometimes he got lucky and a classroom would have chairs and table, but not often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to lean back, and quiet his panting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Hi.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie looked around, not believing anybody would speak to him. Standing beside the desk was  a smiling boy. He looked friendly, and reinforced this with a smile, and looked Asian-American \u2013 something about the eyes.  Frankie wondered if he was Korean or Japanese \u2013 there were some good Korean and Japanese restaurants in the city.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I'm Case,\u201d he said and extended his right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankie took the boy's hand in his sweaty one. \"Frankie.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new boy is ...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though it may be a couple of hours away from the start, he would thought this may be a good time by taking a shower to try and ease it off a little bit.  So he would start grab a towel and amenity kit and runs the tap which he likes to turn it on before he goes in.  Otherwise, he might feel the cold water whilst standing inside the cubicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shower was never used to accommodate such a massive size like Frankie since the family hadn\u2019t been moved houses as such.  So whenever happens, he had to make a brace and waddles to try and squeeze himself in with his widened hips touching the frame in between.  He would somehow managed and Frankie turns his head seeing his bottom heavy frame marked in cellulites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess I don\u2019t mind getting squished in there, now that I\u2019m so big.\u201d  Frankie says to himself with that smile which again, he hips and belly and his butt are so huge, it pressed onto all sides of the shower as he had gotten his massive body all wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would rub all over his jiggly frame as each touch makes it feel soft and warm, but also wobbled so much just as he was in great comfort for the time being.  Normally this would calm himself down and out thinks the negatives he was simply worried for one thing and the other.  With that almost out of the way, Frankie would then take the amenity kit and first uses the shower gel to rub and give his entire fattening lard a good clean before using a shampoo to wash his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards and for a good while, it was time for Frankie to get himself out of the shower.  So he would switch off the water and squished his way through the shower frame to get himself out and drys himself with a towel he had to go every part, which causes the rolls to drop so much.  He was almost finished when he heard from his mother calling over to let him know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrankie dear, your breakfast is ready!\u201d  His mother yelled from the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be there in a minute Mom!\u201d  Frankie replied and would waste no time as much as he can, by getting out of the bathroom and headed to his bedroom to get changed.</span></div></div>",

He knew it wouldn't be long before he couldn't reach it at all so he had to make the time he did have left count. Frankie remembered about a year ago he had been at school when this huge girl came into his class, she was just looking round the school but just looking at her curves had made frankie feel somthing he had never felt before although you wouldn't be able to see it under his then 350lb frame he could feel his erect penis pressing into his under belly. Upon getting home he had searched the internet about larger girls and had gotten into masterbaiting but as his weight increased he found it harder to reach his penis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly waddled back to his bed and sat down hard hearing the bed creak under his bulk. Loading up a website of some larger girls on his phone he proceeded to lift his belly, a task which proved to be harder than you'd think. He began by wedging his hand under his overhang and slowly pushing up, every time his hand moved it sent ripples up his body, he could feel them with his chin which was pressed against his chest. When he finally got his tidalwave of rolls damed up behind his arm he used his other hand to begin to jerk off strugling to reach the base he had to rely on his fat pad to do most of the work, every time he tugged there was an echo and like an echo the louder/harder the shout/tug the larger the echo so if he tugged hard enough and fast enough at the tip he could get enough of an echo to cum. After 3 minutes he was almost completely drained of energy so with a last efort he got enogh of a flab echo to finnish his wank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhausted he rolled about till he could sit up letting his fat slosh about. He wouldn't admit it but he did like his fattness it was just so nice to take up more space than every one else. He shook his belly and smiled to himself, he knew he could never be thin and he thought about how it would be to be the fattest person in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting changed he went downstairs for breakfast. There was a huge meal prepared on the table and after eating his fill he got up and walked to his front yard for the school bus his belly was firmer how and he ticked his hand under his overhang and started playing with himself. When the bus arrived he got on and could feel the bus sink under his weight. When he got up the stepps he walked along the aisle. </span></div></div>",

He\u2019s cute looking, still in his high pitched voice, and is one-half of the music group with his best friend, 15 year old Charlie.  Despite this in some way, something\u2019s were seems to be off but, and that was his weight in size.  Normally, he would be slim-sized, normal healthy lad by the looks of things, but it wasn\u2019t the case when he is now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s because he had just ballooned up massively, and looked liked he weighed at 1,000lbs, and pear-shaped too.  The question many would have to ask is how did Leondre get so big at this time?  Well, here\u2019s the backstory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs mentioned before, Leondre was slim just like his best friend, and one day, he went alone and was asked to help some assistance by his science teacher st school.  He liked so many subjects and was good at things, so he helped out as much as he could.  Around that time, something jumped into something, and Leondre reacted in a shock way and took a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s when he bumped onto the large cabinet with chemicals in place.  Luckily all was still in place... except one!  The glass that was placed at the very top of the cabinet, toppled and the liquid made a spillage, causing Leondre to be poured all over.  That was the scary since neither him or his teacher knew what it would cause with this effect.  But it didn\u2019t took long and so with their shocked faces, Leondre was getting fatter, and was ballooning up in gigantic proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like it had never been seen or done before, and Leondre was the first person to be treated by accident, even when his body was expanding to that point.  He was freaked out to begin with, when he was gaining so much weight faster, and it took five minutes to settle it down when his gain stopped at a milestone at 1,000lbs in obesity weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biggest part of his body was his massive butt and thighs, so wobbly and wide, it can take up a couch as such, even his belly was looking fatter too in much sense.  The teacher was shocked, and Leondre may have been too, but it didn\u2019t take a while until he would make a blush smile as if he likes this stuff.  That\u2019s when it all happened, but to give it a huge surprise, that\u2019s only happened half an hour ago!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo as a result, only his teacher knows this as it\u2019s witness, and so it may be so he had to surprise everyone, including his best friend, Charlie!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess it\u2019s time to show the world what I look like now.  But first, I wanna surprise Charlie and see what he thinks about me?\u201d  That\u2019s what Leondre wanted to start with first, heading over to meet his friend for a surprise.  But where does he meet him.</span></div></div>",

He's nothing more but a bully, but he wasn't born to be on, since he had been bullied from a very young age, but since then with no help to make it stop, Deston thought it would be an ideal that with his size ballooning up immensely, he would return the favor and decides to start becoming a bully, even for his own size no one can stop him by any means.</span></div></div>",

Instead, he was huge, I mean huge in obesity, up to 1,000lbs he now weighs for his age, and it was an extraordinary sight for anyone to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite being the largest and fattest boy by any means, Lewis still loved being so huge, and is still eating with great care, although he's still mobile, thanks to some plus-sized modeling and sumo wrestling training to keep him moving whilst being a half-ton kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he's still goes to school and other places and had offered some extra clothing with a help with some people to help him and his family in support.  As mentioned, he's a very kind kid, and always get along with his friends, despite their amazement he still receives but didn't matter for him.  But one things for sure, is that he doesn't take bullying kindly, and he would be able to stop them to either for himself or if he see's his friend's getting hurt by any means.  Despite that, he's the friendliest of the lot, and looks well for others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis size is a pear-shaped look, with his butt and thighs are so big, it was the most featured loom of his size, although his belly is also larger and doesn't seemed to mind of getting rubbed for comfort.  Right now, we would begin the story, as to where Lewis is at now? </span></div></div>",

Lewis has a sibling and lives with his parents, who are all  slim, unlike himself.  It was very dullcult at the first when Lewis was a toddler and getting larger at that point.  Clothes had be to brought in large sizes, more foods had to be fed for a larger child, and even other things Lewis had to challenge through obstacles, like through doors and furniture not being in favour of him and his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite all of that, Lewis is still a very happy boy, and his family are all the same, knowing they loved him so much, no matter how big and fat he is.  All what his family wanted to do, is to try and make Lewis happy as much as possible and forget the negative things that are about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was in the afternoon, and Lewis was finally home from school.  Again, he had to get through the narrow door before sliding in sideways, whilst having his belly and butt touched onto the doorframe.

That\u2019s when sadly, his Dad had only thought about for a couple of seconds.  Once he turned around, he was facing his son\u2019s massive butt and got slammed onto the floor before it came crashing down with a mighty shake and booms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis father was squished all over by the size of that rear end, it had taken up the length of the couch and a child is so heavy, his Dad was struggling to move or get himself out of there.  From Lewis\u2019 point of view, he didn\u2019t managed to remain in inbalance and took the fall as a result.  He was in the sitting position on the floor, and being so tall, it does look like a monstrous state of a size, if anyone did came over to see what\u2019s going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad, where are you?\u201d  Lewis wondered in a bit of concern, as he looked around and wasn\u2019t seemed to be in here from his points of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it didn\u2019t take long until to realised when he heard some mouthing voice from underneath his own weight.  That\u2019s when he was shocked and quickly got up to his feet, and let him go from being squished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad, are you okay?  I\u2019m sorry for squishing you this way.\u201d  Lewis looked worried, as his father sat up, trying to take a breather, before he can be seen smiling and replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s not your fault, son!  You\u2019ve been unbalanced and it happens, so don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d  His Dad gives his son some comfort and a smile, knowing he\u2019ll be fine and all was just an accident as it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat brought Lewis some smiles in relief, since this is one of the challenging things he had to overcome, whilst being so big at 1,000lbs.  He see\u2019s his father standing up and now he has to say about the undies he had got on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s kinda tight!  But I\u2019m hoping to get used to it for a while I guess.\u201d  Lewis says with an honest debate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo probs, I\u2019ll see what we can do.  But as king as your fine, I\u2019m fine as well.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth chuckled and and would discuss some dinner in that.  Soon, his father waved and left his son be for now, so that he can make loads of dinner to prepare.  In the meantime though, Lewis would keep the new undies for the time being and come over to lay on top of his bed.  It freaked underneath his massive weight, but like as mentioned before, it wouldn\u2019t matter for him as such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed some rest up after going all these places at school the whole day, and what better way to take some rest by...</span></div></div>",

The answer is his bottom half of the body.  Most of the weight had come to his legs and rear, which Rex had been like this throughout his life.  Despite having problems of getting through a single door, which he had to squeeze himself through, Rex likes the size of his massive rump, and he would always look at the mirror, giving it a jiggle as it wobbles effectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe loves life regardless and everything seems perfect for him.

His knowledge helped him and his family become rich, putting him to a life of luxury. However, while the temptations that came with being rich didn't go to his parents' heads, he took full advantage of it. 5 years later, Alex was huge for a 10 year old. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face was rounded with two cherubic cheeks with a couple of chins below it, his hair was long and unkempt, and sometimes covered his face while he slept. His arms were pudgy, but weren't so large as to squish into each other while unbent. His moobs had a sort of rounded shape to them, which, along side with his long hair, could cause him to be mistaken for an incredibly obese girl, not that he <i>minded</i> the confusion. His belly was large, able to dominate his entire view while laying on his back in bed. His legs were wide, due to their shortness causing all of the fat stored there to spread outwards, and making his rear pretty large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was laying on his custom made bed, which was built so he could lay on his back without his legs propping up his belly, by requiring a second mattress just for his large rump, which was firmer than the top mattress. He was more or less nude, with only a pair of XXXXL underwear covering his rear, not that he really needed to wear anything, as his large belly sufficed when covering his front. Stretching for a bit, Alex then reached for his nightstand which had his phone, so he could text someone to get him breakfast... that is until he heard his mother calling for him. \"Alex! There's something important for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex grumbled, 'so much for a peaceful day' he thought, while shuffling his body to the right of his bed. On the floor on that side was a \"hover board\", which was more of a large square with wheels attached to the bottom of it. It was, however, remote controlled via Alex's phone, and it was strong enough to hold all 500 pounds of him. As much as he would like to, his parents wouldn't let him get a mobility scooter, insisting on \"getting on [his] feet once in a while, even if you don't move them much\". Slowly stepping onto the board, just so then he didn't destroy it with weight plus the force from the drop, he blushed a bit as his belly drooped all the way down to his knees, before sighing and opening up the app that controlled the board. He didn't like standing up at all, due to reminding him of one thing: how short he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he is just a kid, Alex was a fair bit shorter than boys his age. As he drove his hover board towards the living/dining room, he stopped to look over at something: a measuring stick, with both inches and centimeters written on it. There were colored marks on certain points of the stick:<br>\r\n5- 3' 5\" (105 cm) <br>\r\n6- 3' 8\" (112 cm) <br>\r\n7- 3' 10\" (117 cm) <br>\r\n8- 4' 0\" (122 cm) <br>\r\n9- 4' 1\" (125 cm) <br>\r\n10- 4' 1.5\" (125 cm)<br>\r\nHe shook his head and continued onward. He knew that his growth was stunted at around age 8, but the reminder of it still haunted him, taunting him. He stopped again, this time giving himself a light slap on his cheek. \"Get it together\" he said to himself, \"you shouldn't let that of all things hold you back. Besides, that means more of your weight is fat, correct?\" he asked himself, before blushing a bit and then continuing onward towards the living/dining room<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally arriving at the living room, Alex saw...</span></div></div>",

Arms that right now were hard at work feeding pizza to their massive owner.<br>\r\nDarren could feel his belly drop off the side of the couch while he laid there, on his side, watching some talk show re-run. It wasn't the most comfortable position, but recently he had found it harder to breathe laying on his back, besides, his chest would drop toward his face making it difficult to eat if he did so. So on the side it was.<br>\r\nAfter finishing his pizza Darren stood up, a heavy task. He pushed himself up to a sitting position and rocked a few times back and forth to build a momentum before pushing himself upright. After a moment to catch his breath he waddled over to the computer and sat down there. His belly filled most of his lap and his butt stuck out on both sides of the chair. And Darren loved it all. Ever since he had been a kid he had enjoyed being big, the look of it, the feel of it, even the limitations. He loved how hills got him out of breath quickly, how stairs was nearly impossible, that he had to buy clothes at a special store for the extremely obese.<br>\r\nAfter his normal online check-up Darren got dressed and headed out to...</span></div></div>",

While getting dressed poses a certain challenge to guys of Darren's girth, buying his clothes at the special 'Big Guy made life easier, as their clothes were designed to be easy to put on.   The jeans, for example, had fake belts built in, while really having elastic rugby-style waists; or you could suspenders, or just go with rugby pants.  All the shirts had extra-wide, extra-long bodies and long tails to cover extra-low hanging guts - even the t-shirts were super long!  Darren's school had a dress code, but he had no trouble meeting it.  For today, he grabbed a favourite brown polo and fawn cargo rugby pants, then headed out for supper with his pals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey met outside the school's cafe - which, given the 'upmarket' aim of the school, was a 'bistro' - and headed in for another of the 'gourmet' meals the school prided itself on.

A freshman 50 takes a lot of effort...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or just letting go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very heavy duty letting go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So maybe I should exercise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you hated exercise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but, you know, getting around is getting hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd suggest you find someone to help you get out more. Maybe this new roomie would walk with you, or help you get off the couch more often.  I could prescribe diet pills, but what you need is exercise to help regulate your blood sugar and your appetite. How far do you walk to class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, think on what I've said, and what effect all this extra flab is having on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK doc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if you want to grow to be the size of the Goodyear blimp at college, that's up to you.  I'm just here to remind you that being this size isn't very healthy, or good for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yet you are 553 pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin sighed.  \"Yeah.  I knew I was heavier, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the number scares you, get a scale and weigh yourself every week until the number starts to shrink.  Even better, walk to my office every week and have my nurse weigh you - that'll give you the number and get you out too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor then wrote a prescription for Kevin to walk more, and come weekly for a weigh-in.  Kevin, who'd been expecting a tongue-lashing, was relieved.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe headed out of the doctor's office, and<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Deciding to try tanning his backside he calls to his friends for aid. Dan and Taylor were two of Perry's good buddies in high school and after Perry dropped out of college he begged his father for some assistants and nominated them, at $125,000 a year they were paid to give Perry anything he wanted, each had an expense card with no limit for any purchases. Both quickly come from watching TV inside, seeing Perry they know to each take a hand and pull, as his heavy form slowly shifted from laying to sitting. In a sitting position Perry's mass became little more than a jiggling sphere of fat, as one might expect of a belly thats over 100\" around. Each aid took a leg and slowly rotated their blob of a friend around, then since he was too lazy to do it, they strained to lower him into a comfortable laying position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile laying on his back Perry gave the image of a beached whale, the folds of his tremendous mantits wrapped around to the back where they formed giant fat mounds, surrounding and encompassing his upper arms in fat folds. The sweat that had accumulated from him laying there and the minor exercise of eating began to accumulate in the small divot in the lower part of his back where the beginning of his belly apron folds was. Below that Perry's tremendous rear lay happily out, over four feet wide Perry took pride in his buttocks and it's size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another hour of being rolled over and polishing off his snack Perry wanted lunch, but where at? </span></div></div>",

While Dan draped one of Perry's loose fitting tents - oops, polo shirts - over his upper body, Taylor wheeled over a lift and sling.  With Dan helping Perry roll back and forth, Taylor got the broad canvas straps under Perry's backside, then pushed buttons on the sling lift to raise him up.  Dan then rolled Perry's powered chair under his rump, and Taylor lowered him down again.

To make the most of that contrast, he parked his chair near the coatcheck, and with Dan and Taylor supporting him slowly walked - waddled - the seventy-five feet to his reserved table.

Thumbing his way to the page with the incantation he reads the spell a few times in his head to make sure he'll cast it correctly. Looking at his blob of a son Thomas smiled as he began to say the chant. <br>\r\n\"Gemuk jiwa ini untuk dua kali ganda berat badannya Perry!\" he exclaimed. Perry began to moan while his eyes closed in what looked like blissful ecstasy. Perrys soft hips began to shake and quiver while they expanded from their already tremendous size to even greater proportion. What wasn't covered by his enormous belly was beginning to break into smaller folds, each expanding into vast rolls of pure soft fat. <br>\r\n\"Mmmmmmm... so faaat...\" Perry moans while releasing a titanic fart. His already enormous body continues to expand, Perry manages to move less and less with the additional pounds being added to his self, his flabby belly continuing to grow across his bed making his head, the only thing that was mildly restricted in how much it could grow sink further into his expanding chest and back. Perry felt his neck growing too as it swelled up making what little jawline he had left  disappear into a pool of flab with the soft bump that could have been called a chin once sit in the middle. The growth continued until Perry sat on his bed as a soft flesh colored hill.<br>\r\n\"Dad, I cant move my legs at all and my arms are too heavy to lift!\" Perry managed to say before releasing another gigantic fart which left the sweat drenched hairy asscrack shaking. \"This feels so good, make me even bigger dad, I want to be FAT!\" Thomas skimmed the book to find something interesting to cast on his growing boy and found.</span></div></div>",

I need more FAT!\" Perry groaned as he squirmed as much as he could, causing his body to ripple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dad nodded and started to read the spell.  Perry didn't know it, but his dad was reading off the spell that would add any amount of weight to his fat ass. The obese slob merely waited for the effect, nearly drooling at the thought of being even fatter.  He felt a tingle in his giant, hairy butt and groaned.  The tingle grew and grew as he started to feel his butt expand bigger.  It spread out wider, pushing his hips bigger, and also inched it's way back.  The fat bunched up as his fat ass cheeks grew bigger, pushing up his back fat as his ass started to expand up his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerry groaned and closed his eyes, \"Mmmmn, dad... ohhh, thank you, dad.  Oh, my butt... my butt feels so FAT, so HUGE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft grunt escaped Perry as he released another huge fart.  It burst out as a quick blast that ended before an even bigger one started to rumble on.  His huge ass quaked and rocked with the force of his fart that grew deeper as his ass grew bigger.  Perry moaned from it and tried to push out another.  It didn't take much coaxing for one to rumble right out causing Perry to moan from how good it felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis butt finally stopped expanding with the cheeks pushed halfway up his back and about 7 feet out behind him.  His hips were immensely wide, forcing him to be pinned down even more.  It'd take a team to move his butt at this point.  Perry opened his eyes and panted softly.  This was absolute heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much did you add back there, dad?\" he asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm... I initially thought about 500 extra pounds.

Instead, he let out another giant fart that felt weird trying to make its way out of his ass that was seven feet from his back and a good two feet above where the average man's waist would be. He let out a loud yawn and another loud fart that sent his ass quivering. \"I think I need a nap, dad. Thank you. Thank you so much.\" Perry smiled as he closed his eyes and leaned back into his ass, rubbing his hands over his soft, squishy moobs that wrapped all the way around his back and hung low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it, big guy.

He pulled out his bong and loaded it with some of Perry's finest weed. Hairy, smelly, sticky, and covered in crystals. He grabbed a lighter and stopped at the edge of Perry's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, I guess I'll have to crawl up to reach your head. You okay with that, big guy?\" Sam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, yeah, just take off all your clothes and stuff first and tread lightly.\" Perry smiled. He knew Sam and Max were happy to get naked with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" Sam set the bong and lighter down and stripped down to nothing, exposing his giant bubblebutt, fat 8 inch piece of man meat, and hefty apple sized balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax followed suit, revealing his thinner, but equally hard body and his 6 inch rod.</span></div></div>",

He'd be 7,600 pounds of wobbling, jiggling, sexy fat.  More fat than anyone could ever hope to have!  No one would ever be bigger than him at that point!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it, dad!  I need to be huge!\" Perry says, almost moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas chuckles, \"Calm down, son.  Don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then starts to read out the spell to the best of his ability.  It took about a minute to get through it as Thomas had to decipher the old writing to get the spell read correctly.  Though Perry just sat there smiling, thinking about what almost 4 tons of fat is going to feel like.  His smile slowly melts as he starts to sweat more than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man... I'm so... hot...\" he pants as his face gets red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas watches for a second before getting his cellphone out to call an ambulance.  Perry holds up a fat hand in protest and Thomas can see the fingers on that hand are starting to plump up even more.  He's panting and groaning, but he's, more importantly, growing bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fat hand falls onto his belly with a wet slap and he moans.  His belly is widening out significantly, but it doesn't seem to overflow the sides of his thighs.  This is probably do to the fact that Perry's thighs are spreading out thicker and flabbier, matching the size increase of his gargantuan belly.  His moobs are now sagging lower underneath his flabbier arms, pushing the heavy sacks upward.  His fat cheeks are bloating out, almost like mini-bellies themselves now, forcing his plump, red lips to pout.  Thomas wanders around his growing son and sees that Perry's already fat ass is now becoming two giant moons slamming together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerry groans again, \"Ohhh, I'm... so... heavy... dad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis breathing is shallow, most likely due to how horny he is since the magic helps him bypass the problems of the fat.  His body was smothering his bed and with one loud CRACK it fell to pieces underneath him.  He fell the short distance, making the room rumble from the impact.  Perry just moaned and felt his belly push over his fat feet and onto the carpeted floor underneath him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... much... FAT!\" Perry bellows as he continues to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly is so big it's pushing his fat thighs apart as best as it can.  This causes him to almost straddle the poor mattress underneath him that is all but compressed into a pancake underneath Perry.  Thomas just smiles and realizes his son is now a few inches taller than he is while sitting!  This is due to his son's gigantic ass and thighs that are pushing him up high as if he were on the plushest mattress ever created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerry is becoming a fat monster now.  Thomas guesses he's crested a ton by now and his boy still has three more to go.  He rests his hand on Perry's fat side and watched more and more of the floor disappear underneath Perry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes about an hour, but when Perry finishes his growth...</span></div></div>",

It well filled the room and the rolls just kept coming. The nipples on his moobs, which now was pushing against his face and were under his elbows, perked. They lifted his arms and he loved the feeling of his elbows making circles in the extremely squishy boob-fat. His mounds of fat, that was his ass and thighs, grew larger so he could lean his head back into it. His shoulders were layered with fat and rose so he could barely move his head. \u00a0His growing number of chins wobbled with each shaking breath, his cheeks drooping from mere weight. He was sweating hard at the thought of this fat around him, unconsciously adding lubricant to his body so it jiggled more easily. The pure movement of his own lard around him made his painfully hard pole release it's fluids into the abyss \u00a0between his thighs, making his eyes roll back with pleasure.\u00a0<br>\r\nBy the end of another hour he was sweating profoundly and said in wheezing breaths thought of a splendid idea, he requested \"Do...

For three weeks every month throughout the entire year, Perry lived on a gigantic yacht filled with beautiful women waiting on him hand and foot. His assistant stood by his side most of the time unless Perry would request for privacy time. Eating, lounging, watching Tv, playing video games, gazing at the honeys serving on him. Perry truly lived the life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy his side, stood Sami. His trusty female assistant who is at the whim of his every command. She feeds, him, clothes him, protects him, does just about everything that needs to be done. Gets done by Sami. She originates from Japan oddly enough standing at five foot seven tall. Tall for an Asian woman anyway. She's had a good amount of experience working secret service for the prime minister of Japan for eleven years before being handpicked to serve Perry. A downgrade sure, but the pay was good. And hey, Sami sometimes enjoyed Perry's personality and company. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, during Perry's mid-afteroon breakfast (yeah he does that) Sami came walking in urgently. \"Woah, slow your roll there. You're gonna give me a heart attack,\" Perry laughed with a leg of lamb in his mouth. \"Sorry about the sudden intrusion,\" she bows, \"But we may have an embezzler on the ship.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn embezzler? The mere mention of the word made Perry feel stupid. He didn't know what an embezzler was or what they did. Instead of wasting his breath asking, he made a mental note to look it up later, and nodded for the meantime, \"Who is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSami told Perry about the new worker on the yacht. The black chick. Roberta Rod. From her resume, Roberta seemed a little aloof about being professional having gone through bucket fulls of jobs since she started working at the age of 16 up until now six years later. \"Oh, I've seen her around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerry's jowls formed a smile, if anything Roberta had to be the prettiest girl on the ship with THE nicest body. Amazing hips, breasts, thighs, butt. Like, the tuxedo uniform that all workers had to wear. That. Of all of them, she wore it best. It hugged her curves gently without giving away too much.  She's also married, from what it seems but as Sami reported doesn't wear her wedding ring on the yacht. Something seems up with the marriage.

Her hands grabbed her black haired head. The silky strands of hair followed her jumping, \u201cPromotion?!? It\u2019s about time!\u201d The light skin beauty did a small jig in celebration; the other co-workers look on in both disapproval and jealousy. \u201cTo what exactly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo taste tester,\u201d Sami adjusted her specs, \u201cYou\u2019ll be the personal taste tester for Perry and be earning four times as much as you do now. As well as eating four times as much,\u201d Sami muttered under her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoberta followed Sami out of the kitchen, but before regaining her professional composure, \u201cWoo! I\u2019m out of here bitches!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSami lead Roberta up to Perry\u2019s private suite on the yacht. In all of the two months she\u2019s worked here, never has she been up to this part of the ship. It seemed more magnificent the closer she got. Then all of that flew out of the window once the door opened. \u201cHey, Perry.\u201d Roberta greeted with disgust lingering in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words that she said about Perry didn\u2019t change once she saw him in person. He was as she told her other co-workers. A fat, smelly dude. Perry was one call away from being featured on TLC as an after school special about weight management. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad you could join me to be my taste tester. We all knew you\u2019d be the best for this job.\u201d Perry poorly lied, wiping the crumbs from one of his chins. Roberta held her laughter at Perry\u2019s predicament. How could somebody let themselves go this bad? What a loser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo problem. Anything to make your experience all the better.\u201d She too lied with a toothy grin.  Sami nearly puked at the falseness in the air. \u201cAnyhow, it\u2019s lunch time.\u201d Sami clicked her fingers. Following the snap where two servants who wheeled in two big carts, obviously filled to the brim with food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two servants lifted the lids. Roberta eyes widened at the amount of food Perry had eaten for Lunch and looked at her own cart, \u201cWhen you say taste test\u2026you mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe mean,\u201d Sami interrupts, \u201cYou\u2019ll be eating what Perry is going to eat for the following day and you won\u2019t be paid until you finish at least seventy five percent of your meal.\u201d She states firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerry instantly dives into his meal. Full on knowingly what\u2019s going into his large stomach is delicious. Roberta on the other hand hesitated. One on hand, eating five pounds in a meal was physical impossible and may be too demanding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoberta personally had a lot of thoughts about Perry. A lot fo them being that he\u2019s a lazy fat fuck and wanted to do nothing, but blow through his parent\u2019s money till the day he dies. Sure, one could draw a lot of similarities between Perry and Roberta, but at least Roberta worked for a fraction of the money she spent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, the one thing on Roberta\u2019s mind that had distracted her from feeling full. The money. The money was way too good to not do something as simple as eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkiing two hours ahead when Roberta had finished much later than Perry. At least 75% of her meal consumed. She leaned back and rubbed her turgid stomach, \u201cI\u2019m gonna die.\u201d She thinks to herself. Stomach practically about to burst, \u201cAnd I gotta eat dinner like this too? Shit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryday Roberta had the duty of eating through a meal fit for Perry\u2019s consumption. Yeah, it did suck having to eat through five pounds worth of food in one meal. The money was very worth it. By the tenth day her stomach had started getting used to eating so much, thus making this less of a challenge, but not by much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the time when more days passed everyone spotted Roberta noticed herself gaining weight. Then everyone started to notice. Every night the uniform started getting more difficult to remove and every morning putting it on started becoming a chore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m still within the dress code.\u201d The white sleeves f the button up pinched her bigger arms, her pants felt tighter than what she was comfortable with. Even around her chunky calves they downright looked painted on. And they buttons of her white dress shirt exposed a few glances of belly flesh. Even then she struggled to keep it tucked in. The buttons around her chest annoyed her the most. Her breasts had gone up a cup or two and those buttons were nowhere near fastening. Oh well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis led to the one incident when Roberta taste tested lunch for Perry one the third week. A button couldn\u2019t suffer the pressure any longer and flew somewhere into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, sorry.\u201d Roberta spoke meekly, \u201cGuess I\u2019ve been packing on a few pounds since the promotion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe valley of her cleavage had grown much deeper. It isn\u2019t hard to tell that Roberta\u2019s breasts overflowed the bra cups that they were shoved into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocating the button to the right of Perry, Roberta waltzes over. Even with plenty of room in the well room Roberta\u2019s hip ended up brushing against Perry\u2019s fat. She bent over to pick up the button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerry\u2019s jaw dropped amongst the site of Roberta\u2019s bigger ass making the seams of her pants scream. That food has been going somewhere. About thirty pounds worth of body fat on Roberta and it make her look good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoberta\u2019s eyes hit the mirror, she noticed Perry gazing at her body. Had he liked the weight she gained? Sure, something like this is looked down upon, but could that blob sitting in the middle of the room be her meal ticket?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His pants are also slim fit, and he has a nice pair of muscular legs,particularly his tights. Tom has to force himself to stay focused as he waddles over to greet Oliver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Oliver, I'm Tom.\" They shake hands, Oliver has a tight, firm grip and Tom don't really want to let go, but he has to, otherwise Oliver might feel uncomfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey go to Tom's office. Tom lets himself fall into his chair and stretches his legs, it felt good to sit, standing made his legs hurt. Oliver is sitting in the chair opposite the desk. His face isn't what most people would think of as pretty, but with his slightly tilted nose and long brown hair he has a certain charming beauty to him once you look closer at him. And looking closer was just what Tom was doing, he tried to hide it make it seem like he was just finding something on his computer, but Oliver said: \"I can see that you are gay, no point in pretending to find some document. I don't mind people looking, in fact, I dress like this because I work hard for this body and i want people to appreciate it. Whats the point of working out everyday if one never show anyone the result.\"<br>\r\nTom wasn't quite sure what to reply so he just nodded and made some confirming sounds. Oliver just grinned and leaned back, obviously waiting for Tom to begin the interview.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interview went well and Tom decides to hire Oliver. He finds a measuring tape and throws it to Oliver: \"Take your measures and I'll order some uniforms for you, all the ones we have will be like tents on you.\"<br>\r\nOliver does as told and Tom is amazed at the numbers, they are that kind you usually just read about in health magazines and such. Oliver is just about to leave when he turns around and says: \"Whats your policy on eating?\"<br>\r\nTom was a bit surprised to get that question from someone so obviously a health nut, but he managed to hide it and talk with a normal voice: \"You can eat all you like as long as there is enough of what you want in the counter.\"<br>\r\n\"Great, that will save me a lot of money on food.\" Oliver smiled as he said it, \"See you tomorrow big boy, can't wait to begin working with you.\" Then he disappeared through the door.<br>\r\nTom was not sure why Oliver had called him big boy, but he liked it.</span></div></div>",

D-licious occupied floors 3,4,5 and 6.<br>\r\nJose began seeing over the numbers from their chain of fast food restaurants.<br>\r\nAt 11 o'clock it was time for lunch. Jose leaned forward and used his arms to help lift himself up. Once standing he took a deep breath, streched and grabbed his coat, or tent, as some would refer to it. He then began waddling his way to the elevator. Seeing Jose walk was a sight, his tights were so fat he had to shift his whole body to walk, the movement caused all of his fat to jiggle wildly, and his labored breathing was very audible. Reaching the elevator Jose sat down at the bench next to it resting his legs before he pushed the button. While waiting for the elevator to arrive Jose began to get up by rocking a bit back and forth, building up a momentum before he attempted to get up. The first attempt failed and he fell back with a thud. The second attempt was succesessful and just in time for the elevator. He waddled inside and leaned against the wall cathing his breath on the way down.<br>\r\nOnce on the ground floor he made his way to the door and waddled in the direction of his favorite lunch place, D-Quick. a restaurant in the fast food chain he had just accounted for. There where no benches on the way there but he knew he could make it if he held his pace, keeping up his momentum. Once he got there he ordered his usuall, 3 cheeseburgers, 3 large fries, 2 large sodas, 1 milkshake and 2 slices of cheese cake. He had it as take away because he needed his time to get back. He only sat down to gather strenght for thereurtn journey.

The elevators are DOA, how're we going to get back to work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit right down, brother fat accountant, and enjoy telecommuting!\"  Chris replied with a grin.  \"I got Shi - you know, the new guy who's always bouncing around? - to run up the stairs and bring down our laptops down.

After two years of dating, feeding sessions, the hottest sex in his life, Randy was finally moving in with his boy friend Max. The two met online at a gainer site and soon the two became inseparateable. The relationship had taken Randy from 600 pounds all the way up to 670 pounds, which wasn't bad. While Max had gone from 150 to... well.. he was still 150 pounds in his 5'11\" frame. Randy didn't mind it, in fact he was quite turned on that Max weighs in a mere quarter of his weight. The dramatic contrast between Max's slim body with a nice lightly defined chest and slightly showing abs to Randy's massive gut that stretches a good 80\" around him was a constant turn on. One night Max was helping Randy fold some of his clothes and Max stepped into Max's pants and held them up. <br>\r\n\"These things are massive,\" Max said and stepped into a single pant leg and pulled it up and squeezed out the bottom. Even Randy's thick thighs which were constantly brushing against each other were thicker than his slim boy friend. As soon as Max was out of Randy's pants the two met on the bed where they both attacked each other with fierce lust. To Max, Randy's body was a heaven for his excited wily and almost every fold was a new adventure for him. The massive fold where his belly cascades onto his waist, where his moobs sit on his belly, his deep belly button and so much more were all targets. <br>\r\nRandy on the other hand had grown so large that he could no longer reach his tool which was burried deep below his blubber, encased in a tomb of fat. On some occasions Max had gone digging looking for the prize with wonderful results. But often Randy would be set off just by Max licking his massive nipples and shaking his belly just right. It didn't take Randy much to get off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two love birds seemed to have gotten lucky in their search for a home. They found a single level house in a quiet adult neighborhood. Unlike other houses they had seen, this one had wider doors which Randy could squeeze through without his love handles pressing against the door frame. The house even had a massive fridge, a walk in shower that could easily fit Randy and another big guy. The realtor said the previous owner was also a big guy.<br>\r\nThe move took a bit longer than expected, Randy looking to reach 750 pounds by the time he's 30 didn't do much lifting, leaving that to Max and a couple of friends. Of course it could have gone faster if the two weren't so incredibly turned on all the time. Any time Randy bent down to pick up a light box full of towels or pillows Max would come from behind and start playing with his boy friend's massive rump. Of course packing wasn't the speediest thing either, the two came across a lot of old clothes at both places and seeing Randy squeeze and destroy old clothes was enough to halt the moving process for a bit too.<br>\r\nNow that the move is complete, what happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Max helped Randy get into his massive shorts and pull them up. Randy decided to go commando since underwear wasn't much of a deal around the house.

It was almost time to upgrade Randy's wardrobe again.

Where the walk was the easiest thing and could easily be down by Max within 5 minutes, Randy's huge body slowed him down to a crawl.

First of all no children were pointing or commenting on Randy's vast size. The boys took note that all the houses were well kept looking and all had extra wide doors. About 4 or 5 doors down they came across the first person outside, a big shirtless 400 pound man with a thick treasure trail leading from his chest all the way down to his shorts as he washed his SUV. The man saw the boys and gave them a polite wave.<br>\r\nA few more houses down the boys spotted a big thick power muscle man with body hair as thick as a carpet mowing his lawn in some shots and well worn shoes.<br>\r\n\"Where did we move? Heaven?\" Max commented eyeing the power bear mowing his lawn.<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Randy commented,\" But hopefully that's not the last of them.\"<br>\r\nAs the convenience store got into viewing range the boys heard a call from the house they were passing by.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me strangers!\" came the gruff, yet welcoming voice.<br>\r\nMax and Randy turned to see a large man wearing a polo shirt stretched against a belly that could easily rival Randy's own. Both boys made faces that inquired that the call was meant for them.<br>\r\n\"Yeah you boys,\" the man said and slowly raised to his feet and walked a bit closer to the edge of his porch,\" Are you new to the nieghborhood?\"<br>\r\n\"We are,\" Randy said and took a few steps closer to the big man.<br>\r\n\"Great to hear, looks like you're a great addition to our little nieghbourhood, looks like you've landed yourself a cute skinny one,\" flirted the man who had a well kept salt and pepper goatee around his mouth which matched his slightly balding short hair.<br>\r\n\"Gee, thanks,\" Randy blushes.<br>\r\n\"No problem, I hope you boys enjoy the nieghbourhood.

Coming from a man roughly between 650 and 700 pounds the boys had to wonder.<br>\r\n\u201cSounds great,\u201d Randy said imaging meeting all of his round nieghbours.<br>\r\n\u201cIndeed, thanks Bill,\u201d Max agreed.<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you boys off to?\u201d Bill poked.<br>\r\n\u201cThe little convenience store,\u201d Randy pointed down the road.<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes..

There was 5 cent candy selection in quarter size variety. Infact, all of the sweet food were at an amazing price. 2 liter bottles of pop which usually sell for 2 bucks regularly 75 cents.

Max would rip open the tubs of ice cream which were partly melted from being the hot sun and force feed Randy the melted cream through the funnel while he ripped open the box of condoms and went to work rubbing Randy's gut as it filled with the melted ice cream before getting Randy on all fours and making sweet love to his ample behind.<br>\r\nRandy got the order right, but also got 6 chocolate bars stuffed into his fat face before Max had him on all four.</span></div></div>",

Max still had to go into to the city for work, but was home early enough to cook dinner for Randy. Within the first couple of days Randy could tell that Max was loving the new neighborhood. The summer weather meant the other plus sized nieghbours were walking around in skimpy clothes, if any. One day Max came home from work and saw the 420 pound Jeff mowing his lawn in his shorts with his giant hairy belly jiggling and bouncing all the way. Max got inside and was down to his underwear before he took Randy by surprise. <br>\r\nEven a simple walk down to The Little Big Corner Sugar Stop was pretty overwhelming for Max. He was truly in an encourager's and fat admirer's dreamland. Randy didn't mind having some plus sized nieghbours.

Bad moments are there so you like the good moments. Some moments also have good and bad moments. Some people are depressed and hate their live. Some because they (think they) are ugly, sometimes because you lost someone you loved our some people, Or when you have a disease and some people because they are obese. But some people make the best of it.<br>\r\n Claire did't need to make the best of it. She was already very happy while she was obese. 500 pounds of fat where on her eight year old frame. A impressive weight for an eight year old. She was also pretty proud at it. Since she weighed 500 pounds with just eight year old she was immobile. She did't really mind it too much. Except the part she could't go out. Lucky her parents were always there and her father had a special wheel chair that could hold his daughters huge weight so the could go out every now and then. Sometimes even a walk in the forest for a picnic. <br>\r\nOf course food was very important for Claire. She ate constantly. She had also a big appetite. That was also part to blame for her huge weight. Partly her parents who saw every cry like a sign of hunger and feed her a lot and did't cared if their daughter gained some weight. <br>\r\nShe was even too fat too go too school. Not that she minded. She hated school. With all those stupid kids that always teased her. She was't bad at school . She was pretty smart. Since she was immobile she  was home schooled for two years now. What was pretty handy for her since the teacher could go a little faster teaching her. Claire was glad she learned to read. It became soon one of her biggest hobbies since you did't needed to move too much for it and you could do it all by yourself. She also loved fantasy.<br>\r\nShe also believed in magical creatures that lived in the forest. Like gnomes and fairies, elf's of course and witches. Especially at the witches stair. It was a long stair in the middle of the forest so there were trees all around it. They said witches cut of branches of trees that would fall on peoples head. There also lived trolls and dragons and (human eating) wolves. Of course also friendly dwarfs and help full pixies and other fantasy creatures. You could call it stupid but Claire believed in those things. Of course with eight years old not being able too move on her own and no other kids around you it was hard too not believe in some things. Besides Claire had a great imagination. What Claire did most of her free time besides eating was reading and watching T.V. Sometimes also drawing a bit since it was getting harder for her too move her arms. Claire always wanted to become a fantasy writer and could keep her parents busy for hours with great tales about princes and princesses, heroes, (good) witches and a lot of other made up figures that had adventures. However all her figures were kind of brave. She hated stories were girls were just sitting at their butt doing nothing besides waiting fir a big strong men to save them. Not that she not liked a big strong men but girls also must do some of it their selves. They could also be heroes.<br>\r\nSo this was Claire's live. A eight year old with long brown hair that could't move on her own. A fat face with puffy pink cheeks that looked like she stuffed a jawbreaker in each of them. Her legs were covered in rolls of fat and she could't move them. Her arms were also covered in rolls of fat and she could hardly bend them. Her belly was the biggest that reached till over her knees in two nice rolls with on top of it two boobs. Her big sister said that it was only fat. Her butt that looked like two beach balls. Claire loved it too be a super sized girl. She also hardly have too do anything since her parents were around her always too do anything and get anything for her. What made her lazy and spoiled.<br>\r\nShe has one big teenage sister who hates that her sister looked like a tub of lard. Mostly she tries too not be around her little sister. She has a mother and father who do anything for her she asks.<br>\r\nThat's a bit how Claire's live is. Now when we start this story Claire...        </span></div></div>",

She rested her arms a bit, leaving her notebook sitting on top of her belly, when she noticed what a fine day it was outside. The birds were singing, the sin was shining, she could even feel a slight breeze through the window. These were Claire's favorite days. If only she could get herself outside...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried, she really did. She lurched forward as hard as she could, sifting chip crumbs and cookie bits that had been sitting up against her for a few days. She wiggled from side to side, but all she succeeded in doing was jiggling her whole massive belly and tiring herself out. \"Mom!\" she called. Her mother, a slightly chubby woman in her 30s, rushed out of the kitchen where she was making Claire a snack. \"What is it dear?\" \"It's such a nice day, I really want to go outside!\" Her mother thought for a minute. \"Of course, dear, but I think you've put on a bit since you last went out. Do you think you'll still be able to?\" Claire paused, then said, \"I have no idea, but I'd really like to try!\" \"Alright, sweety, let me just call your father and we'll get right to it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she waited for her parents to be ready, Claire chowed down on several bags of  chips and a bottle of Fanta, her favorite soda. \"Mom, why's it taking so long?\" she shouted, spraying chip crumbs all over her belly. \"Just a minute, dear, we have to find everything!\" Since Claire's old room had far to small of a door for their cute chubby daughter, all of her old things were stored in there. But, as she was also a perpetually hungry little girl, it had also been given over to food storage, which meant that most of her going-out supplies were stuck in the back. Finally, after Claire had plowed through three of her six chip bags, her parents returned, with her sundress, her sunscreen, a hat, and her plus-sized wheelchair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Claire rarely needed to do anything, she only wore the bare minimum of required clothes, i.e. a T-shirt that just covered her burgeoning eight-year-old boobs and a pair of far overstressed panties. Since she was also so often inside, she was quite pale and just a touch of sun could give her a serious sunburn. Hence the sunscreen and dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever much Claire loved to be outside, there was one thing she genuinely despised about the whole experience. That thing was that, despite her inability to take a single step or even slightly move her legs, she was forced to stand for the several agonizing seconds it took for her parents to slather her with sunscreen and put on her dress and hat. More so this time, as Claire had grown (as growing girls do) and now the dress only went down to her waist, leaving the large portion of hanging flab that went down to her knees uncovered and jiggling. It would have to do, however, until they could get an XXXXL model custom-made. Finally, after nearly two minutes spent on her weak and muscleless legs, she was able to ease back into her double-wide wheelchair and head out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere will she go?</span></div></div>",

She always looked if she saw magical beings. She sometimes thought she did but it might also have been her imagination. Perhaps she saw a little animal and she thought it was a magical being. Of course those magical creatures lived very deep in the forest. Since she could barely do a single footstep she could't go deep into the forest on her own. She was forced to go as far in the forest if her parents wanted to. If she would have been a more active kid she would have walked deeper in the forest many times. But her parents rarely took her deep in the forest. Not because they were scared, but because it was harder pushing Claire's wheelchair there. They mostly staid on the path. That was the easiest with Claire's wheelchair. One of the rare things Claire did't liked about her immobility. But she could live with that. Besides, red riding was also eaten because she went of the path. Partly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then let's go to the clearling!\" Her father said, and started pushing his daughters wheelchair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother of Claire followed. To be honest she was happy that Claire went outside. Normally she spend most of her day inside, eating, watching T.V, drawing, reading and making up stories (to be honest she liked the drawing, reading and made up stories), but it was good if Claire went outside a bit more. Perhaps also meet some others. Since Claire did't went to school she had't much friends. Maybe they would meet some people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think we see fairies?\" Claire asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows honey. Perhaps. But there's a big chance they see us. But you need to believe in them to see them. You can only see them if they want you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire smiled hearing this since she believed in them so she could see them. But then she felt a rumble in her belly.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Eh daddy... did you also took any food?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire come on. You can't possibly still be hungry!\" Her mother said in disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only asked if daddy took some food.\" Claire said innocent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire could still eat some more but she decided she could better wait with eating until she was more hungry . But did her father took any food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Claire. Her father said. Of course I took some food. I could't let my only daughter starve now can I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire smiled. Here under the trees was less sun so she did't have to be so scared to get sun burned. She fast looked around if she saw anything. Even if she did't saw anything she still liked the forest. The trees, and the bushes. Especially the ones with food in them.<br>\r\nAfter some time the reached the clearling.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

Claire, on the other hand, would never do anything like that- she loved animals, cared deeply about the environment, and could barely move her arms, much less run.

But really Claire... you should try sometimes to meet a bit... more... people. You don't have that many friends. You don't really go out much. You don't go to school. Were else can you meet other people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't want to meet those people. Did't you heard how rude they were against me?\" Claire asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother could't say she was surprised. She herself used to be a fat when she was younger. Not even near as fat as Claire but still she was teased because of her size. But a good diet and exercise gave her a healthy weight but she did't saw that happen to Claire. She could barely stand. But she knew how mean kids could be. She also heard the rude comments the other people made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so beautiful in the forest. Why do they have to ruin it. Besides they scare away forest spirits. That way I will never see a pixie or fairy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand that you don't wanna meet those people. But you must understand... that we liked it if you had a bit more friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\" Claire mumbled. \"I would't mind meeting other people, but not people who are rude when you just met them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I understand you Claire. That were't really good people for you to meet. But that one is.\" Her father said and pointed forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire looked and smiled. She saw Mr. leaf. He was a good friend of the parents of Claire. But Claire also loved him. He was very nice to Claire. Sometimes he gave her candy. He could tell fantastic tales about magical creatures.

A new path, something she had always wanted, to take her where she always wanted to go, on the exact day she could use it. It was simply wonderful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's parents were not so convinced. They had heard nothing of any new project, and certainly not one involving the park. However, their minds did not turn to magic; being adults, and far too old for that sort of thing, they instead thought it was some sort of trap, designed to ensnare their daughter in some fiendish scheme. This was made all the more potent by the fact that, when Claire's dad turned around (something Claire could not do) Mr. Leaf had entirely disappeared. To Claire, this would have appeared magical; to the adults, it just seemed more suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all that, they went onward, wheels and feet crunching on the leaves.

About a diameter of 20 yards. There was even a tiny island in the middle. There was also some reed and when they came near she heard some frogs.

In the bushes?\"<br>\r\nHer mother answered. \"See what, honey?\"<br>\r\n\"Something just went in the bushes over there,\" she said, pointed a pudgy finger to where she'd seen the rustling, \"I think it might be a fairy!\"<br>\r\n\"A fairy?\" Her father repeated, sounding incredulous, \"I don't know Claire, it might have just been a squirrel or something.\"<br>\r\n\"But it was glowing!\"<br>\r\n\"It was probably just the light catching off it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire quietly huffed, and her parents went back to reminiscing. If she had the energy to lift her arms, she would cross them in a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fairies</i> are <i>real,</i> she thought defiantly, <i>and one day, I'll prove it! I'll show them!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she gasped, and blinked her eyes a few times as she became convinced she wasn't just seeing things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the bushes, floated a small winged creature, an illuminating glow on its bright skin and flowing silver hair. It looked just like a thin, very tiny woman in a blue leaf-like dress! <br>\r\nClaire could only watch in awe as she approached her, fixing the obese dreamer with her warm green eyes and a soft smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Claire,\" she cooed, her voice smooth and soft as silk, \"my name is Lily. Welcome to the Glade of Fairies.\"<br>\r\nA wide smile crossed the girl's plump face, squishing up her cheeks. \"I-I knew it! I knew fairies were real!\" She froze and then blinked, looking quizzical. \"How did you know my name?\"<br>\r\n\"Why, our friend told us,\" Lily smiled, \"I believe you met him on the way down the path.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's eyes widened in realisation. <i>Mr. Leaf! I knew there was something weird about him!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He told us a believer was in the forest today,\" the fairy went on, \"and he sent you to us to reward you for your faith! And such a pretty young believer too.\" She fluttered toward Claire's head and used a tiny hand to pet the large girl's hair. More of the small glowing creatures were appearing around the pond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire beamed from Lily's words, and slowly craned her neck as much as she could to look at her parents. \"Mom, dad, look! I told you they were real!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom stayed motionless in the corner of her eye, and seemed to be facing away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\" She muttered. \"Dad? Why aren't you looking?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry,\" Lily assured the large girl, stroking her puffy cheek, \"they're just frozen. Time has gone completely still here, including them. None of you are aging either.\"<br>\r\nClaire, feeling soothed by Lily's tiny hand, calmed herself. \"Oh...but why're they frozen?\"<br>\r\n\"Because I want to see how well you can keep a secret,\" the fairy said, a bit more seriousness in her tone, \"a lot of bad people have come close to finding us, you see. So when you choose to go home, you can't tell anyone where we are. Do you understand, Claire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flabby girl was horrified by the idea of someone trying to hurt these poor little creatures. How could they do that? Plus, Lily said it was her own belief in fairies that led her here, so she had to agree.<br>\r\n\"I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily's warm smile returned, and she rubbed the blob of a girl's thick double-chin, making her almost purr.<br>\r\n\"Good girl,\" she said, then looked around herself before whispering into Claire's ear, \"and one more thing; watch out for pixies.\"<br>\r\nClaire blinked, and tilted her head slightly. \"Pixies?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yes,\" the fairy nodded, \"they look like fairies, but with pointy ears and they don't glow as much. They won't hurt you, but they'll probably want to squish your cheeks and bounce on this belly of yours.\"<br>\r\nClaire bit her lip softly. \"That doesn't sound so bad...?\"<br>\r\n\"And if they like you enough,\" she went on, \"they'll want to keep you in their lair, forever!\" She pointed to a gap in the bushes, pitch black inside. \"They'll try to tempt you with candy and sweets, but you mustn't give in, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire gulped, and nodded. The first time she'd have to refuse food...that would be tricky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily nodded, her smile coming back again, and hopped off Claire to float in front of her. \"Come, take a look around!\"<br>\r\nOut of instinct, Claire went to hoist herself off of her wheelchair, and to her surprise and delight, she had the strength to stand up! Something her muscles had denied her for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh my gosh!\" She squeaked, \"I'm standing!\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks to our magic,\" Lily giggled, and patted the large girl's head, \"we'll be over at the lake if you want to meet the others. Have fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Lily zipped off to meet with the other fairies, leaving Claire to have a look around...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For Claire this was the best day ever of her entire short life. Sure she liked it to be fat, but not being able to walk and getting out of breath easily was one of the things that were't much fun. The fact that she never had been able to go deep in the woods was one of the things she hated most. But that was all in the past right now<br>\r\nNow she saw the most beautiful things ever. Fairies everywhere. Boys and girls. They were dancing, playing, flying, sun bathing and doing much more. They were beautiful. Their beautiful wings, their hair and beautiful clothes they had in all colors of the rainbow. <br>\r\nHowever she also saw a few fairies that were totally naked. But none of the others seemed to care. But now she thought about it every animal was naked. Dogs, cats, gerbils, rabbits. No animal wore clothes. They were all naked and fine with it. The fairies were't ashamed to be naked just like animals. Why should they be. Everybody was naked under their clothes. <br>\r\nShe also once heard that nimf's were also naked sometimes like proof of their innocence. Perhaps it was the same like fairies. She decided not to think about it. This was way more important then to think about being naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I almost can't believe it. I always knew there were fairies. But no one believed me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we hear that a lot. But to be honest we don't want that many people believe in us. Not you. Don't get me wrong. There are some humans we like... but other humans are loud and step on toadstools. They crush bugs and destroy plants. They also leaf trash behind. Can's, bags, boxes. I don't mind it if you leave pieces of an apple. some animals eat them and else nature breaks it of. We can do that easy with parts of food but it's harder with other stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never leave stuff behind.\" Claire said. \"I hate those people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know. If you would do that we would't show ourselves to you. But people also have war. They kill thousands of other people. sometimes innocent people. They cut down trees for factory's. We don't like it if those people knew about us. So we make sure most people don't see us. They don't believe in us. But sometimes we meet a believer. Like you. But it has been a long time ago since we last saw a believer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we also like younger ones. Babies and toddlers believe anything.\" A other fairy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it so much I finally see some fairies.\" Claire said. \"I always dreamed of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful.\" Another fairy said. \"Not every being that lives here is nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told her already about the pixies.\" Lily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pixies are just one things. There are other things. You don't have to be afraid of tree spirits. But you also have leprechauns. Who like it to lure people to their parties. Let them dance until their feet fall of their legs and then let them continue dancing on bloody...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" Lily shouted. \"Your scaring her. Besides she can't dance. Without our magic she would't even be able to walk at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true.\" Claire said friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well but she needs to know about the dangers. I mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She just saw fairies for the first time, Let her enjoy that. Our friend will warn her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I think you deserve this!\" Lilly said, and gave Claire a kiss. It felt nice with a strange but not unpleasant feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that.\" Claire asked a bit confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well fairies normally hide from people. But now, thanks to this kiss they won't hide from you. They now know you are our friend.\" Lily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA red haired fairy that only wore a green bra and panties suddenly landed on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our friend told us you also make up stories about fairies, pixies and other things. I would like it to hear some of those stories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly about a dozen of fairies started to fly in circles around her. All  asking her to tell them stories. Claire fell on her big soft butt<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I could tell you a few stories. But I'm not sure of it is 100% true how you are in real life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that does't matter. We heard so much strange stories about fairies, that are nothing like we are in real life. To be honest we find it kind of funny. So tell a story. If you like we can tell you after wards what's real and what is't.\" A little fairy with white hair said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... All right then I guess.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire went sitting in the shade under the tree and about twenty or thirty fairies went sitting or lying around her or listening from a branch and a few even on her body. Soon everyone was caught up in her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut from between the gap in the bushes several eyes were watching them.         </span></div></div>",

Almost all of the little creatures had broken into small mutters of panic, all except for Lily who was sat on the large girl's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire giggled at the fairies' silliness and rubbed her plump hands over her plush middle.<br>\r\n\"It's not a monster,\" she said, \"it's just my tummy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairies began to relax, assured there was no danger.<br>\r\n\"Wow, your tummy's really loud!\" One of them giggled and patted it with her tiny hand, making it wobble.<br>\r\nClaire giggled and blushed. \"Hehe, I guess it's lunchtime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily smiled and hovered in front of Claire's larger, rounder face. \"If it's food you want, we have plenty of fruits and berries in the glade. Great big ones too! Why don't you go have a look around on your own, see what you can find? And please, eat to your heart's content. There's plenty for all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, really?\" Claire grinned. She wasn't a big fan of fruits (the only ones she ever did eat were the ingredients of desserts and snacks) but these were special fairy fruits! She'd happily take some of those any day. \"Thanks, Lily!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some help from the fairies, the heavy girl got to her feet and began waddling around the space, looking for these fruits she was told about.<br>\r\nShe eyed up the dark gap in the bushes as she passed them, thinking she had seen something before waddling ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she didn't get far, stopping just a few steps away after hearing a new voice from behind her. \"Hello, little girl.\"<br>\r\nClaire slowly turned in place, and blinked as a new creature was before her. It was another girl, the same size as a fairy but rougher looking and not as illuminated. She had big pointy ears, a short dark red dress and black hair. She had a smirk on her face and her hands behind her back in a coy pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire recognised the features from Lily's warning. It was a pixie!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" The obese girl asked.<br>\r\n\"My name is Gale,\" the pixie smiled, bowing your head, \"and you're Claire, yes? I overheard your talk with the fairies.\"<br>\r\nClaire nodded. \"They told me all about pixies...\"<br>\r\n\"Did they now?\" Gale giggled, and slowly floated around Claire's head. She tried to follow, but her neck just couldn't turn enough. \"I suppose they told you how we like to take greedy children and keep them to use as our playthings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire gulped and nodded, her heart beating a little faster. Gale suddenly rushed over to her face and grabbed her plump cheeks in her tiny hands, squishing them up as she rubbed them in a circular motion. It felt...soothing somehow. Claire could feel her alertness start to fade...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're nothing like that,\" Gale assured her, \"we love believers just as much as the fairies do, but they want to keep them all to themselves and not let us meet them.\"<br>\r\nClaire slowly blinked, her eyes squinting from having her cheeks squished. \"Really...?\"<br>\r\n\"Really,\" the pixie nodded, and let go of her, \"but we're nothing like that. We're just as nice as those fairies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was almost sure that Gale was lying, but...she couldn't be fully sure. Her voice sounded so honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to prove it, I have a little gift for you,\" Gale purred, and put her hands behind her back again. She held them back out and revealed a plump slice of cake, white and red with frosting and fruit. \"Some special pixie cake! It's far better for you than those silly fruits those fairies probably had you going for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's eyes widened as she stared at the cake, and her tummy let out another loud rumble. She knew all the warnings Lily had given her about pixies, but Gale seemed very nice, and that cake looked so yummy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe longer she stared at the dessert in the pixie's tiny hands, the more her resolve faded...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire was about to grab the cake and take bite but suddenly she thought about something. Claire loved fairy tales and many times in stories somebody was warned to don't do something. But they always did and came in trouble. Like little red riding hood. She was told to stay on the path, but she did't. And she got eaten by the wolf. Good the hunter rescued her and her grandmother but that was't thanks to red. That was just dumb luck. <br>\r\nShe suddenly remembered a movie she once saw. Pan's labyrinth. She wanted to see it because there were fairies in the movie. However the movie was sometimes pretty scary and she had two weeks of nightmares after wards. However, in the movie a girl need to go to a room to get a dagger. Three fairies helped her. However there was a monster there with eyes in his hands, and a table filled with food. She was warned to don't take any food. But she did and the monster woke up and devoured two of her fairies. Never give in to temptations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks. It's very nice of you but really. I rather don't take it.\"  Claire said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why not?\" Gale asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Claire felt something. Like a spiderweb around her broke. Just a few seconds ago the voice of Gale sounded so honest and everything seemed to be fine, but now suddenly it did't. Claire realized it had been a trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard that pixie's like it to squish in cheeks and bounce of big bellies and keep people in their lair forever.\" Claire said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you that's not true.\" Gale said like explaining to a child one plus one is two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps. But you did like it to squish my cheeks so probably the rest is also true. I have no reason to trust you. It's better to be safe then sorry so no. I don't take that cake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Gale seemed a lot less friendly. Her hair seemed to wave upwards and her eyes had a scary glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait Claire. This is't over. Our master has his eyes on you, and he is used to get what he wants. Just wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud bang like a gun shot Gale was gone. Claire lifted her shoulders and walked further a the saw the glade full with fruit. Also forest fruits that she used on deserts. She stuffed some them in her mouth and must admit they did't taste that bad. But the she saw some fruit she did't knew. It seemed to glow. They also seemed delicious. She took one bite and was sold. This was without a doubt the best thing she ever tasted. She wolfed the fruit down. She saw some other fruits that seemed to glow. She ate them one by one and each of them tasted fantastic. They were better than candy, cookies or junk food. Claire could't describe it other then more then fantastic. <br>\r\nThe she saw Lily. Lily put her hand in her side and looked at her with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I should have know you would eat some fairy fruit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's fairy fruit?\" Claire asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fruit that glows. Just like us. Tell me now Claire how do you feel?\" Lily asked. \"I mean physical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel... very good.\" Claire said. \"Fantastic. A lot better I felt in a long time. Like some weight is of my shoulders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not surprised. That fruit keeps us healthy. You're a big girl Claire, but I believe in the human world they don't see you like healthy do they?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"No not really.\" Claire said with a weak smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... after eating that fruit you don't have to worry about that. The fruit makes you healthy. I guess it made your organ's stronger. So you don't have to worry about hart diseases ans stuff no matter how much bigger you become.\" Lily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean fatter.\" Claire said with a smile. \"Don't worry. It's no problem. Say it. I know I'm fat. But I like being fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you are fat you can get diseases. That's why you have all those diets. But since you ate that fruit you will be healthy no matter how fat you become.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire smiled wide. She must admit that she was always a bit scared that her weight could become a problem for her health. But now it sounded like she did't have to worry about that.   <br>\r\n           <br>\r\n\"Oh by the way, I did saw a pixie.\" Claire said. \"She said her name was Gale. She offered me a cake. But I did't take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the name Gale Lily froze. She almost seemed to choke in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gale? Her name was Gale. Black hair, red dress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. That's her. Do you know her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. She's my sister.\" Lily said sounded defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how? I mean you're a fairy and she's a... do fairies turn into pixies?\" Claire asked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Not really. But fairies can turn into pixies. But it's kind of rare. But my sister is one of those fairies that became a pixie. I can't stand her. Lucky you did't eat that cake. You would have been in her power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said her master got his eyes on me? Should I be worried?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry too much. We will protect you. But it would be better if you don't walk around here on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. I can't walk without your magic.\" Claire said and laughed. </span></div></div>",

The forest was, once again, a place of joy. Lily smiled and clapped her tiny hands together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you like to do now, Claire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire thought for a moment, touching one fat finger to her second chin. \"Well, I know about fairies already, but what about other magical creatures? Do you have anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly giggled. \"Of course we do, but if I told you about all of them we'd be here forever!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's face lit up with joy, but, as she thought over that remark some more, the brightness left her somewhat. Lily took notice and flew in closer, looking into Claire's eyes with some concern. \"Is everything okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire nodded. \"Yes, it's all so wonderful, but...\" She paused for a moment, unsure of herself, then burst out, \"...I don't want to stay here forever!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily recoiled in surprise, then flew in much closer, hugging the sniffling girl's neck fat tightly. \"Oh, Claire, that isn't what I meant! I just meant that there are a lot of creatures here, that's all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Claire was not to be consoled. \"I know that, I just...I <i>want</i> to stay here and learn about all these creatures, but I also like my parents, and I'm afraid...\" She paused for breath, and started crying. \"...I'm afraid if I leave, I'll never be able to come back!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily looked up at her. \"Don't be silly, Claire! We would never force you to stay away! You can come back whenever you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire smiled too, her tears lessening somewhat. \"R-Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily smiled. \"Yes, of course. You can be certain of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Claire cheered, but another troubling thought crossed her mind. \"But it may not be for a long time...it's very hard for me to leave the house, and...\" She trailed off, unwilling to finish her sentence: <i>soon I probably won't be able to.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that, either!\" Lily's voice broke through her troubled thoughts. \"I'll come and visit you as often as I can! I'll bring some friends, too, so don't be afraid! Soon enough you'll have met everybody in the forest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire looked at her fairy friend, eyes wider than dinner plates. Lily laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come along now, let's get you home, before-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BLAM.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire looked up, startled. Lily swore in fairy-speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew this would happen- Gale's sent a storm after us! Come quickly, now, we'd best get you back to your parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, through a torrential rain, fairy and fatty headed back to the trail, back to the world of humanity. The rain soaked Claire's inadequate dress and seeped between her many folds. Lily flitted around her, dodging raindrops. Finally, they made it back to Claire's still frozen parents, and Claire resettled her huge body in her chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for everything, Lily! I hope I'll see you soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I you, my dear. Now, I must go- this storm requires my attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new friends smiled at each other one last time, then Lily flew off, vanishing into the trees. As she left, so, too, did her magic, and the forest lost its color. Gravity once again resumed its inexorable effect on the fat Claire. The ever-present heaviness of her many layers of fat once again washed over her, burying her in its great weight. Her breathing became labored, her motions sluggish and impossible. Claire wheezed sadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her, her parents were recovering from the effects of time stoppage. Her father shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew! I feel like I've just slept for ages. Lauren, what time is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's mother checked her watch. \"It's only just turned 2, Max- but I know what you mean. I feel the same way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's belly growled. Her parents looked at her, then at the rain above them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My goodness, where in the world did this storm come from?\" her father asked, looking into the sky. \"Well, no matter- we've got to get out of this storm. Come along, Claire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire smiled softly as her chair set into motion. \"Daddy, I saw fairies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you really?\" her father asked, not really listening. \"That's nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's belly burbled again. \"They're coming to visit me soon, they said.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh...here, eat this,\" her dad said, fishing a bag of popcorn out of a pocket on the chair and tossing it to her. \"Don't you worry, we'll be eating soon. Call that Chinese place, Lauren, and get plenty. I bet she's pretty hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night...</span></div></div>",

She ate with a newfound energy, still happy from the events of today. Meeting Lily and the fairies, trying their delicious fruit, even Gale and the pixie storm was an exciting memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my,\" her mom chuckled, \"someone's hungry.\"<br>\r\nClaire nodded, her cheeks filled up with chicken and noodles. \"Mm-hmm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind was racing, wondering when she would see Lily and the other fairies again. She really hoped it would be soon; in fact, she really wanted to go tomorrow!<br>\r\nShe swallowed the mouthful of food, and decided to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, dad?\" She looked at them, \"Can we go back to the forest tomorrow?\"<br>\r\nBut her parents didn't answer. In fact, they weren't even <i>looking</i> at her.<br>\r\n\"...mom? Dad?\" She muttered, a little confused as to why they weren't paying attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, she realised. <i>Wait a minute...!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the open window, a familiar little creature fluttered into the living room, followed by at least half a dozen more. \"Hello, Claire!\"<br>\r\n\"Hi Lily!\" Claire grinned ear to ear, causing her eyes to nearly vanish from her cheek fat squishing against them.<br>\r\n\"We thought since you came to our home, we could come and see where <i>you</i> live,\" she smiled, \"We hope you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course not!\" the obese girl squeaked, and happily watched as the fairies looked around her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this stuff?\" One asked, lifting a noodle from Claire's plate.<br>\r\n\"Chinese food,\" she giggled and had another mouthful. The fairy tried it and scowled, deciding it wasn't sweet enough.<br>\r\n\"There's <i>loads</i> of food in this room!\" One called from the kitchen. \"And a lot of it is sweet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Claire,\" Lily smiled at her large friend, \"do you have any more stories about fairies to tell us?\" The others seemed to light up at the idea, and flocked around the colossal girl. Some settled on the couch, others sat on her head or her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled and nodded. \"Okay! Well, there's one I thought of a while ago...\" she began, and took a mouthful of her dinner before continuing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Though Claire's evening was filled with magic and wonder, the night went on much like any other. The fairies bid her farewell at roughly dusk, leaving Claire to her own devices. However, being normally immobile, Claire's own devices were very simple- a bit of TV, then faling asleep gently on the couch where she spent all her days, wheezing her way into dreamland. Really, the night was entirely normal. Save, of course, for the fact that she was being watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, in the street, a green-suited man gazed carefully around. He was not looking to harm the girl- no, far from it. Mr. Leaf was watching for pixies. He knew of their desires for Claire, and he knew, also, how to deal with them. Mr. Leaf, as one would expect, knew many things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was no fairy, though some would think him so. Rather, he was a mere human, though one with close ties to the magical world. He had found the fairies at a young age, and through knowing them had survived both the Great War and many, many onslaughts from pixies of all shapes, sizes, colors, and powers. The pixies wanted whatever the fairies had- and this large, friendly girl was no exeption. So, to keep her safe, the fairies had designated him, their envoy into the human world, to be her protector. And protect her he would. He kept watch, set a few simple charms around the house, and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other set of eyes made no such friendly gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the street, from the topmost window of a highish building, leered a man in a well-cut black suit. He was not there to protect Claire, far from it. No, Mr. Grief was to help acquire Claire, by any means necessary. As the pixie's spy among the humans, he was the absolute antithesis of Mr. Leaf. Where the former was wizened, old, and jolly, Mr. Grief was young, cold, and calculating. He had stumbled upon the pixies some summers back and willingly enlisted himself to their employ. And he was not about to be outdone by some old green-suited fool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Mr. Leaf turned a corner, Mr. Grief broke the protective charms- <i>Such weak things! What a fool that Leaf is!</i>- and the pixies, feeling the coaat clear, flew inside, Gale leading the charge. Soon, they would have Claire- and there was nothing the obese girl could do about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so they hoped.</span></div></div>",

Just follow my lead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like Mr Leaf had knowledge in magic, Mr Grief was granted his own magical powers by the Pixie King to do his bidding. One of those powers being the pixies' ability to enter and manipulate dreams.<br>\r\nWhich was their plan; to enter Claire's dreams and convince her the pixies were not as bad as they seemed to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay all of you,\" Mr Grief whispered, and the pixies nodded and prepared themselves, \"one...two...three!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once, he and the pixies turned themselves into streams of black dust, and slipped in through Claire's ears to enter her dreams...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire, meanwhile, was happily wandering through a forest deep in her dreams. Birds sang their cheerful songs above her, and the chitters and calls of woodland creatures sounded all around her.<br>\r\nWith her dreams having no limits in terms of reality, Claire needed no wheelchair to get around, and didn't feel a single pound of weight on her enormous frame as it bounced along the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile on her round face turned into a curious frown as her plump nose twitched. She smelled something. Something...sweet!<br>\r\n\"Hello, Claire,\" a young man's voice greeted from behind her, \"it's nice to finally meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little surprised, Claire slowly turned herself around to find an older man, though not nearly as old as Mr Leaf, dressed in a black suit. He wore a smile on his narrow face.<br>\r\n\"Um, hello,\" she muttered warily, \"who are you?\"<br>\r\n\"My name is Mr Grief,\" he introduced himself, and chuckled, \"I know, a bit of an unfortunate name, but don't let that put you off. I'm anything but sad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire tilted her plump head. \"How do you know my name?\"<br>\r\n\"I represent the pixies,\" Mr Grief said, then held up his hands, \"but before you worry, I'm not a bad man. Not at all.\"<br>\r\n\"But, I met one of you,\" Claire argued, \"she was really nasty!\"<br>\r\n\"Ah, that must have been Gale,\" the young man shook his head, \"she's always been a bit of a hothead. Trust me, we aren't all like that.\" As he said that, the pixies began to reveal themselves behind him, wearing mischievous smirks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clicked his fingers, and a slice of cake, similar to the one Gale had offered her before, appeared in his hand.<br>\r\n\"I'd like you to come with us and get to know us properly,\" he said, \"and see for yourself what the pixies are like, instead of what you've heard from the fairies. You'll meet our King, and be treated like a princess! Of course, we'll have you back home before your parents realise anything has happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire blinked, staring at the cake and mulling over Mr Grief's words. The cake looked just as delicious and tempting as before, and she liked the idea of being treated like a princess. She could get everything she wanted, like in the stories...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All you have to do is eat up this cake here,\" Mr Grief explained, \"and we'll happily let you visit our land. What do you say, Claire...?\"</span></div></div>",

That this was't over and that her leader wanted her and would  get her. After that a huge storm. That was't exactly something that made her trust pixies.<br>\r\nAnother point was that people in stories were many times told to don't do something and they always did for some stupid reason. Mostly they became in trouble because of it. She was't planning to be stupid. <br>\r\nBut at the other hand this was a dream. Else she would't be able to get around without a wheelchair. Except with the magic of the fairies. Did pixies also were able to do that? Since fairies were able to turn into pixies they probably had still some of the magic. But could it hurt if this was a dream. The slice of cake did smelled delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Gale did't seemed to nice. Making a storm just because I did't want a slice of cake. Besides when I said No her hair started to move and her eyes started to glow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. That's Gale. She has just a bit of a short temper. But she can be pretty nice when you get to meet her. I'm sure she did't want to be mean. If you come with us you can ask her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" No thanks. Gale said something about I would come with you anyway because of her master or something. That did't sound like I should trust you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. You can't think that every pixie is evil just because Gale is such a hothead. Take you for example, you have a huge belly. Do all people have that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some people believe in Christ. The son of God. But do other people also believe in that god?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...some of them do. But not all I guess. I once heard about Allah. Some religions had more then one god. But what does that have to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You believe in fairies, but does every human believe in fairies?\"<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"No.\" Claire said. \"Most people don't. But I know they do excised. I saw them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like pixies. Now what I mean is just because you are fat does't mean all people are fat. Just because some people believe in Christ does't wanna say all people believe in Christ. Because you believe fairies does't wanna say all people believe in fairies. If Gale was perhaps a bit mean, that does't wanna say all pixies are mean.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire did need to think about that. Not every human is the same. Why would all pixies be the same. But still... She would have to ask Lily about it. But if this was a dream what harm could it do do just take a bite of that cake, But was it save. In Pan's labyrinth that girl was also in a strange world when she met that monster that devoured two of her fairies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. Take a bite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire reached towards the cake. She looked at mr. Grief and the pixies. But then she saw something. But just for one second. Something like when a lightning bolt puts everything in a light for one second. In that one second she saw mr. Grief and the pixies look at her with a wicked smile. She rubbed her eyes. They looked the same. But then again for one second they got that wicked smile. Claire got scared. The seemed very scary with that wicked smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!!! I don't want your cake.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Grief and the pixies suddenly looked very angry. Angry and scary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's waking up. Time to go.\" M.r Grief said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire woke up from her own screams. Her parents suddenly ran inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire. Is everything okay with you?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I... I had a nightmare. It...it seemed so real. I was very scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you poor girl. Are you fine now. Or do you want to sleep with mommy and daddy tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I... I would like that.\" Claire mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's father took the wheelchair.<br>\r\nMr. Grief and the pixies appeared back on the roof. Gale looked at them with a big mean grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And? How did it go without me? Were you able to give that girl the cake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. That's party thanks to you. How you acted because she refused to eat your cake. Or the storm you made after wards, Kind of childish if you ask me.\"  A pixie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGale shove some hair over her face so it covered one eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say it's my fault just because you could't do it. That girl had more Will power then I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. The fairies Will surely protect her now even better. We need to act fast. But not tonight. We need to think of a new plan.\" Mr. Grief said</span></div></div>",

I have had dreams many times but when I woke up I mostly could't remind them. But when I do remind them there are things... that does't make any sense! But this one almost seemed real. They offered me a cake and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did't eat it.\" Lily asked worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I did't. But does that matter? I mean... it was just a dream. Not real.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pixies can visit people in their dreams!\" Lily said. \"If you had eaten the cake in your dream it would be just as terrible if you had eaten it in the real world.

Wait here for a second.\" Lily said and flew away but returned a few moments later with a twig with leafs. \"Eat one of those leafs each night before you go to bed. They make you sleepy, cause nice dreams, and block your dreams for pixies. This way they can't invade your dreams anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a few fairies came back with a chocolate bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" A tiny fairy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh That's chocolate. I tastes very good. Taste it.\" Claire said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy took a bite and got a sign of disgust on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This tastes awful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because you're eating the wrapper and silver paper. Don't eat that. That's not good for you.

It's very sweet. You should try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a wave all fairies flew over to the chocolate bar. Started nibbling and chewing enjoying the taste. In a few minutes there was't a tiniest piece of chocolate left. It all disappeared in the bellies of the fairies. However most had a lot of chocolate left around their mouth. All were smiling in a satisfied way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can always come by if you have more of that stuff.\" Said the tiny fairy that took the first bite. \"What was it again? Shokat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chocolate.\" Claire corrected her. \"Milk chocolate to be exact. You also have pure but that tastes a bit bitter. You also have white chocolate that tastes also really good, and you have chocolate filled with nuts. And after that they filled chocolate with hundred of different  things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we don't like bitter things.\" Lily said but the other stuff. We would love to try that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any more stories?\" The other fairies asked.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. This one is very exciting.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll fairies gathered around her and listened to Claire's story. But several eyes looked at them from the bushes.   </span></div></div>",

The fairies listened with open mouths. Sometimes squeezing each other in the excitement wondering if the hero\u00efne would survive. Even Mr. Leaf must admit this was a good story. Most stories of Claire were good but this one was especially good. He really needed to write this one down.<br>\r\nShe was at a point that was very exciting when Claire suddenly asked: \"Do perhaps have something to eat and to drink. My throat is getting a bit dry from talking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few of them were a bit grumpy she asked something like that at such a moment in the story. But most understand that Claire throat was dry and she had been a long time without food for a girl of her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on.\" Lily said. \"Squeeze that fruit and be careful the catch the juice in a cup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome fairies grabbed some of the fruit and cut it in pieces and other squeezed the juice out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did she do that at such a moment like this? I really wanna know what's gonna happen next.\" One fairy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's the best way to be sure we give her something to eat and something to drink so she can continue. Besides she deserved this for telling that story, and the chocolate.  <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"I guess so. But we also need to protect her from the pixies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. She's a nice girl. I don't want that the pixies take her. Do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... no... but keep in mind I rarely saw pixies put so much effort for capturing one human girl. He must be really interested in her. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm I don't know.\" Lily said. \"Perhaps there's something special about her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah she believes in us. Century's ago every human knew we existed but those times are over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Claire is the fattest girl I ever saw.\" Lily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily had seen many people in the forest. Skinny, normal, chubby fat but no one near as fat if Claire. and most fat people were teenagers or adults. But the pixies wanted fat people. Was he only be interested at Claire because of her weight. She wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you coming Lily. You don't wanna miss the rest of the story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Lily said and followed the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few sips of juice and some fruit Claire continued her story. However she took a bit and a sip every now and then. At those moment the fairies were waiting in excitement to hear what would happen. But finally Claire ended the story with a happy ending. When she was done all fairies and Mr. leaf cheered and clapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the best story I ever heard.\" A fairy screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree!\" Another said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll fairies were praising her for the terrific story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you all.\" Claire said. \"But now it's going to be difficult to think of a story that's just as good or better then this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry Claire. I'm sure you can do it.\" Lily said and smiled.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire smiled thankfully at her and ate some more of her fruit.</span></div></div>",

Almost cut of. Like someone pulled the plug out. She did't heard a thing. She saw fairies flying, but their wings did't moved. No body moved. nothing. Like they were all frozen. Claire had seen this before. It happened to her parents. She wondered if she was frozen too but found out she could still move. What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did't we had an agreement with the fairies about not freezing the others or something.\" Gale asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. But we found a loophole. We were't allowed to freeze them to do something against them. But that girl is a human. She is't a fairy. So we're not allowed to do anything to the fairies while they're frozen but we can do what we want to that girl.\" Mr Grief said. \"But be careful. This spell is fragile. We need to stay calm.

And ever since they first laid eyes on her, the pixies had created delicious food enchanted to not only make her want more, but to also make her lazier and more carefree the more she ate them. She would be the pixies' plaything forever, and she'd be too lazy and relaxed to even think <i>once</i> about it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Claire had no idea of this - all she saw was a yummy cake, and after already being tempted before, she had always wondered what that cake tasted like.

But the she saw some small doors. But they were way too small for her. They were big enough for the pixies but way too small for a human. They took Claire to a normal sized (for a human) door. <br>\r\nBehind that was a nice room. The wands, floor and Ceiling were made from wood.

That was what she deemed important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giggle escaped her as she carelessly crammed some more cake into her waiting mouth. \"This is the life...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese pixies really did seem nicer than she thought...of course, she was totally oblivious to the menacing smirks and giggles she was getting from them.</span></div></div>",

You're not able to carry her.  Not even hundred fairies can lift that girl. You know that. She's a sweet girl and all, but very, very fat.

Took pictures of them and wrote stories about them. Some other fairy like creatures did some jobs for humans if you gave them food. So many people believed in them back then. But in the past centuries people stopped believing in fairies. They also started telling their kids fairies and pixies were't real. Now she finally found a believer and the pixies took her. <br>\r\nLily felt terrible. There was just something about Claire. She really liked her. Lily would do anything to get her back.

Some of those things just happen but most come because of you and some come from your parents. Especially in the start of your life. Your parents who raise you are very important for the happy things in the start of your life. Later when your older you can decide more things for yourself. But most things parents do for you are happy things since normally they love you and normally you love them. But some things your parents do can have influence on the rest or a great part of your life even when you're able to decide for yourself.<br>\r\nWhen Mary's life started her parents chose for her but Mary had possibly chosen the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary was from the first day she came too the world a big eater. Well drinker since she started of course with mother milk. After they started to give her other food her parents gave her a lot of it what she all ate. This only increased her appetite. After she started to eat solid food her weight really sky rocketed.<br>\r\nProbably she had chosen the same thing since she was liked being fat just like her family. Her mother weighed  around 750 pounds. She could't walk. Only thing she did was laying in bed, eating watching T.V be on the computer and talking with her daughters. <br>\r\nMary was also immobile thanks to all the food they gave her. She was already 500 pounds at an age of 9. That's pretty high. But she was raised to be fat. From the first day at school she realized she was different. After she broke chairs thanks to her weight and had trouble walking more the a few steps she dropped out of school and spend all her time sitting at home, eating and watching T.V. All she did was sitting on the couch and she even slept on it since she could't walk.<br>\r\nHer father still had some muscle but he was also 300 pounds. His parents were very rich and after they died in a car accident he got a lot of money and his parents owned some companies and now he was busy running them. So that's why he earned enough money for Star.<br>\r\nStar was a tanned girl with black curly hair that worked there. With an obese immobile woman and obese immobile girl and an obese dad who worked a lot there was't much work done around the house. Like cleaning, laundry and most important cooking for the family. Of course in this family cooking was what you need too do a lot of the time. Lucky Star liked it too cook. At her old house she tried so many things but mostly she had prepared more food people could eat so when she heard about this it seemed perfect for her. Besides it paid good and she had her own room here and she liked Mary her mother and the little 5 year 200 pound Becky.<br>\r\nBecky was Mary's little sister. She was still mobile but did't moved that much since she could only walk short distance without getting out of breath and having sore feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary also once asked star how she got her name and she told that her own mother wanted too give her a name took her outside and decided too call her after the first thing she saw. We don't know if it was true.<br>\r\nMary anyway loved her life and loved sweets and star gave her a lot of sweets and also a lot of other food to keep Mary, her mother, her sister and her dad (if he was home) well fed. Star loved taking care of this obese family and she had started to love every one of them especially Mary.<br>\r\nSo let's start a typical day of Mary.   <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Mary slept on the couch, breathing heavily in her slumber. Her head was drooped forward onto her significantly large chest, a thin streamer of drool pooling on her enormous, yet inadequate T-shirt. I say inadequate, because despite being XL it was barely capable of covering her chest and left nothing at all to the imagination below that. Her enormous belly extended all the way to the end of her lap and a little beyond, drooping a bit towards the floor. Behind her, her butt was large enough to claim two and a quarter of the three cushions of the couch she lived on. Her fat arms rested by her sides, on her fat thighs. Quite simply, she was FAT. As a result, she lived in the living room, mostly because she was the fastest-growing of the family and needed the most food. Soon enough she'd need a bigger couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight noise from the kitchen stirred her, not completely awake but more towards that area. She made a noble attempt at shifting her enormous poundage, which only succeeded in jiggling her quite a bit and dislodging a shower of wrappers onto the floor. Slightly more comfortable, she went back to full sleep with a contented sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar smiled at the scene from the kitchen. She knew the family well, and was as such busily preparing for the four-thirty pre-dinner snack that everybody needed. Today she was making macaroni and cheese, which in addition to being delicious would also help broil the dinner chickens properly. As she grated and added onions, she took a moment to marvel at her \"family.\" Mostly, the measures they took to maintain a familial lifestyle when precisely one of them (Dad) left their rooms on a regular basis. They all had computers, and would Skype each other frequently to catch up. They all had plenty of books and access to television, and on rare occasions various mobility devices would be employed to have a family outing. In many ways, it was perfectly normal. Star was happy to be here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA floor above, Becky also slept. The five-year-old was the youngest and the littlest of the family, still able to move under her own power (although she insisted she couldn't and wouldn't whenever anybody asked.) As such, she still did various normal-people things like wear fitting clothes and use the bathroom alone, although those days were rapidly coming to an end as her stomach threatened to grow larger than a standard pillow. She was as a result spending more and more time in bed, rapidly approaching the level of sedentary of her mother and older sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's mother slept too, in her room. She was the largest of the family by a good 250 pounds, but that window may not last for long considering the rate that Mary's growing. Even so, she was content in her enormity. Her life was good and her family was loving. She smiled through her slumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The atmosphere of stillness was starting to get to Star. It was such a peaceful day. The sun shone brightly on the grass outside, yet mostly avoided the house, luckily for the snoozing occupants. She had already put the macaroni in, maybe she could just take a brief nap...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar was awoken quite suddenly by the oven, beeping as planned at precisely 4:29. She sat up, rubbed her eyes, and then remembered what exactly she was supposed to be doing. Spurred into action, she leapt up and removed all five casserole dishes of the macaroni at lightning speed.  She set them on the counter to cool and busied herself collecting trays and plates. The smell wafted itself through the house as she did so, getting the three immobiles up and ready for a snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary was having just the loveliest dream about ruling a small country when thoughts of macaroni violently intruded themselves into Marytopia and woke her up. She blinked, blearily, stretched her arms as high as they would go (not very) and then scratched idly at her massive paunch, sniffing the heavenly scent of even more food. Right on time, her stomach let out an extremely impatient growl. \"It's okay, belly!\" She said, kneading as much of it as she could reach (not much) \"We'll be eating quite soon!\" And it was true, as Star brought two of the five dishes of macaroni over to her, dished out some onto a plate, and placed it gently on her belly. \"Oh, thank you Star! It smells awesome!\" Mary cried, reaching for her fork. \"Careful, it's quite-\" Star started, but Mary was already shoveling the contents into her mouth, getting cheese and noodles all over her face and chest. Star smiled and rubbed her head, then returned to the kitchen to get Becky her portion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 200-pound sister was still asleep when Star arrived with her single casserole dish of pasta, snoozing quietly on her side with her big belly spreading out across the bed. Star smiled, and waved a fork with a single noodle in front of the little girl's nose. Becky sniffed the air a few times, then tried to bite the pasta, but Star pulled it away just in time. Becky then opened her eyes and let out a joyous squeal at the sight of so much food. Star again spooned some onto a plate and left it for her, then went back to the kitchen for her mother's portion and to let Becky gobble in peace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl's mother, Cassandra, was awake and watching CSI when Star arrived at the door with her snack. Despite being the largest, Cassandra wanted to make sure that her two growing daughters got fed first, as she had dreams of them someday surpassing her. She herself was quite happy at 750 pounds, and didn't see the need to grow too much larger, but she certainly wanted her daughters to. Her dream position was as matriarch of a large family of flab, spreading figuratively and literally across the globe. For now, though, she was quite happy with two immobile (or nearly) daughters. \"How are they, Star?\" she asked her helper as she set the dishes down. \"They're fine, Miss Cassandra. Becky's looking bigger by the day.\" Cassandra took a large bite of pasta. \"Mmm...and Mary?\" Star laughed. \"Of course Mary's growing! We're going to need a much bigger couch before too long.\"  Cassandra smiled. \"Oh, excellent. Dan'll love to hear that.\" Dan was Mary and Becky's father. He was a reasonably sized 300 pounds, but having to support three immobile girls meant he had to stay as mobile as possible. Luckily, this wasn't terrible, as he ran a very large and prosperous furniture company, but it also entailed long hours at the office. He left at eight and didn't often return before six. Nonetheless, he still managed to spend plenty of time with his family. \"What's for dinner tonight, Star?\" Cassandra continued. \"Chicken and potatoes,\" Star answered. \"Mmm, I can barely wait!\" Cassandra smiled, finally digging into the macaroni. Star left her in peace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she returned to the kitchen, however...</span></div></div>",

She then returned to the living room, where Mary...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...was desperately trying to move, for some reason. Mary was in quite a state. She was swinging her pudgy arms back and forth and wiggling her tiny feet, trying like crazy to gain momentum. She wasn't going anywhere, though- only succeeding in jiggling like crazy. Ripples spread out across her enormous belly and ridiculous butt, and her oversized bust bounced up and down in her ludicrously tiny T-Shirt. Sweat coated her massive form and was beginning to form a small puddle on the carpet. Star watched her for a few minutes in confusion and amusement before finally asking, \"Mary, what's wrong? Where in the world are you trying to go?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuffing and puffing, Mary answered, \"I'm so hungry!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar looked at her in amazement. Mary had cleared all three dishes of pasta completely. They looked like they had just come out of the dishwasher. Luckily, there was a contingency plan for this; a stash of snacks stored near the couch in a big cardboard box. Star retrieved it and put a few bags of chips within easy reach of Mary's flabby arms while she went back into the kitchen to prepare some emergency rations for the enormous little girl.</span></div></div>",

Star shook herself out of her amazement and raced into the kitchen, grabbing anything labeled \"instant\" or canned and tossing them into various pots and pans. Ramen noodles, cans of beans, soup, corn, everything that took little preparation was getting heated and seasoned to stuff into Mary. As the stove top bubbled and sizzled, Star chanced a quick look at Mary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stash was nearly gone. Mary was surrounded by wrappers and covered with crumbs. A healthy coating of chocolate and Oreo filling surrounded her mouth (which she was frantically stuffing more Doritos into) and her various ripples, flaps and folds were damp with sweat from her efforts. Her stomach, as if a warning to Star, let out a loud, fierce growl of pure hunger. Star quickly turned her attention back to the food, which now appeared to be done (thank goodness.) Star ladled it onto various bowls and plates and brought it out, on a large tray, to Mary. Hopefully this would be enough for now. </span></div></div>",

The smell of food, sweat, and gas permeated the living room. Star wearily brushed hair out of her face, exhausted. Mary had eaten everything that Star could find to give her in the kitchen, save for dinner, which Star was now worried would not be even close to enough. Chips, pasta, vegetables, everything that Mary, and later, Star had shoved into her gullet was gone. And yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary was an absolute mess. Her various rolls and crevices were filled with crumbs, spills, and splatters of all kinds. Her T-Shirt was soaked through with soups, sauces, and sweat. Her face, covered as it was in cheese, broth, bread bits and chip crumbs, could have passed for a modern art piece. But most impressive of all this was her belly. Mary's massive stomach had gone from its usual saggy and flabby state to being round, and much much firmer. Where normally her belly would droop over the end of the couch cushions and hang towards the floor in rolls, it now stuck out quite a bit farther, and obscured her view forward. Star had no idea how much food she had eaten, but it looked (and felt) like a hundred pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary was exhausted too. She'd moved her arms more in a few hours than she usually did in a day. She panted, trying to get air into her small and generally inadequate lungs. Not only had she moved her arms enough to actually burn (!) some calories, she also had eaten more food than ever before. But she wasn't done yet. Her stomach let out an angry growl, and pangs of hunger gripped at her distended belly. \"STAR!\" Mary cried, \"I'M STILL HUNGRY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar looked wearily at Mary, incredulous and tired. There was an enormous quantity of food in the basement, but Star now had no doubts that Mary would most likely eat all of it.

At first, she wasn't entirely sure why she was awake, but then the scent of a hundred different kinds of food wafted into her nose. She sniffed the air greedily, eyes agleam. In good form, her own sizable stomach informed her loudly that it was very hungry. \"Star!\" she cried. No response. \"STAR!\" she called again, louder. Still nothing. Becky looked around in despair. She was hungry, but that would mean she would have to get up. And <i>move</i>. All by <i>herself</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, sometimes, one must make sacrifices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky took a few deep breaths to prepare herself for the undertaking, and then slid herself slowly onto her feet, sending a wave of jiggles through her belly and butt. She stood there by her bed for a few seconds, then took a ponderous step forward. She jiggled more, her sleeping shirt riding up her belly and her shorts riding down her thighs. Another step, and her feet let out a twinge of pain from being walked on. <i>Ugh</i>, she thought, <i>I'm gonna be SO glad when I give this up.</i> She took a few more steps, her knee-length belly rippling with each one, sweat pouring down her face and onto her shirt. Huffing and puffing, she reached the door, and leaned heavily against it, catching her breath. Her legs were crying out in pain. She considered giving up, but just then the smell of spices filled her nose and reinvigorated her. (Star had just finished cooking something else to feed to her ravenous big sister.) But she was so tired... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a solution presented itself to her, in the form of an old office chair. She smiled broadly.</span></div></div>",

A trail of cardboard, cans, wrappers, bottles, and baking dishes led from the kitchen to the living room. As it got closer to the proverbial Ground Zero, the trail changed from packaging to food- sauce, crumbs, and scraps forming a multicolored path up the couch. At the base was Becky, sticky with sauce and stuffed with a grand mixture of food ranging from baked beans to a recently-defrosted salmon. Her stomach, normally resting somewhere by her knees, was now stretching to mid-calf, so full was it. It rose and fell gently as she slept off her food-coma- she must have eaten thirty pounds of food alone. But, of course, this paled in comparison to the completely ridiculous Mary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary also slept, and was similarly stuffed to the gills. However, since she was so much larger and significantly older than Becky, her stuffed was a LOT bigger. Her belly extended so far in front of her now that it shaded Becky and rested firmly on her sister's up stretched paunch. It had been stuffed up, as well, to the point where she could no longer see in front of it- if she was awake, that is. She had eaten with such vigour that towards the end she had tired her arms out, meaning Star had to feed her, meaning that, in turn, there was food absolutely <i>everywhere</i>. On the cushions, in her hair, on her hands, all over her belly, on the scraps of her too-tiny T-shirt (she'd ripped it to shreds during a particularly vigorous lunge after a bon-bon) and covering her face, as well. But Star had done it. She'd used everything she had in her arsenal, but they were fed. And happy, it seemed. Mary was smiling broadly in her sleep. Taking a peek at Becky under Mary's belly, she too was smiling. Star too smiled, then collapsed into the easy chair and fell into a dreamless sleep.</span></div></div>",

Luckily, though, just as everything nearly went to hell, the first three trucks pulled up. Soon enough, the room was once again filled with the scent of fresh-baked food. Rather than attempt any sort of decorum, Star just put several trays of food and forks near each of the girls and raced to prepare a large platter for Cassandra. Sandwiches, sausages, and sushi all made it onto the big plate before Star bolted up the stairs and to Cassandra. The girls, meanwhile, got to stuffing their faces. Soon, though, the trays near them were cleared, and as they couldn't reach any more they set about wailing again. Star bolted back down the stairs and pushed more trays close by. Tray after tray disappeared down their throats, truck after truck pulled into the driveway, and Star was busier than she ever had been. There was no respite. The enormous girls continued demanding food long past any reasonable hour had passed or any reasonable person's capacity for food. Finally, though, it ended. At three in the morning, Mary took a bite of taco, burped, said \"I'm full\" and immediately fell asleep. Becky, after grumbling slightly, did the same. Both girls were stuffed to the max- perfectly round, tight stomachs, with no give at all. Best of all, there was even plenty of food left over.

Mary, the largest, slumbered deeply, head resting on her still massive belly, a thin streamer of drool trailing its way down her vast expanse. Beneath her, Becky had flopped onto her back, snoring loudly, her own sizable stomach pressing lightly into her enormous sister's gut. Across the room, curled up in a loveseat, was Star, completely knocked out from her huge job of earlier. Though she dreamed of a relaxing vacation, deep down she knew she'd rather be nowhere else but here, supporting her charges with love and food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quiet <i>snik</i>, the relative calm was broken as a largish figure snuck through the door as well as a 347-pound man could. Upon seeing the dimly-illuminated litter of containers on the floor, his tired features broke into a smile. His girls had clearly eaten well. He stepped further in, but unfortunately landed with a <i>crunch</i> on a concealed pie tin. Star shot out of her chair in a flash, overtired eyes working in overtime. \"Mr... Dan! Can I get anything for you? Sorry about the mess, sir, I haven't had time to...\" Dan chuckled and waved a hand around dismissively. \"It's fine, Star! So long as they're fed, anything is fine. I'll fix something myself.\" A wave of relief washed over Star's exhausted face. \"Thank you, sir. They're in the fridge.\" And with that, she collapsed back onto the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a broad smile, Dan wandered into the kitchen and heated up a large plate of rice and steak. He considered eating it down there, but instead walked into the living room, kissed both girls lightly on the forehead, and then made his way upstairs. He greeted the sleeping Cassandra with a smooch on the cheek and set about eating his dinner. \"Babe,\" said Cassandra tiredly, \"I almost fired Star today.\" Dan swallowed. \"Don't do that, she's fantastic. Why would you?\" \"She didn't feed me enough...\" she whined, jokingly. \"Well,\" said Dan, putting his next forkful into her mouth, \"I have the day off tomorrow. How's about I make it up to you?\" \"I'd love that...\" said she. And with broad smiles on their faces, they, too, went to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...</span></div></div>",

Once the implications of the sunbeam worked their way into her exhausted brain, though, she leaped up, ready to spring into feeding mode once again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...only to realize that the girls were already awake, and surprisingly not screaming for more. Rather, it seemed she had interrupted some sisterly conversation. Thoroughly embarrassed, Star cleared her throat and smoothed her hair. \"Sorry, I...er...what do you two want for breakfast today?\" \"I want bacon and eggs!\" shouted Becky. Mary rolled her eyes at her smaller sister. \"That's fine with me, if we have any,\" she said. Star smiled and headed for the kitchen, making up five platefuls for Mary and three for Becky. Despite the fact that they didn't seem nearly as ravenous as the day before, they had clearly gained quite a lot of weight from their stuffing- Mary's belly, though once again flabby, hung down much further than it had before, swaying gently about halfway down the couch. Becky had gained as well, her own mound of stomach flab resting like a moderately deflated beach ball between her flabby thighs. As Star was setting down the plates, she overheard their conversation- and she could tell there was more work in store for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and I definitely want to do something exciting today,\" said Mary, scratching her swollen side idly. \"I've been feeling kind of cooped up, you know?\" \"Sure, sis, rub it in, you're SOO fat, blah blah,\" said Becky snarkily, wolfing down an egg. \"No, I didn't mean it like that,\" replied Mary. \"I just haven't done <i>anything</i>, you know? Sometimes I envy you a little.\" In response, Becky poked her sister's flabby foot with a fork. \"Whatever... But I do know what you mean. We should go and do something today!\" Star rolled her eyes. Though Becky was still mobile, she wasn't really <i>mobile</i>- getting around the house and going for a walk were not at all the same thing. And she hadn't even asked first! Star would of course say yes, but the principle of the thing... She sighed. Mary, oblivious, went on. \"Where should we even go? There's not much to do around here, that's for sure.\" \"Hmm,\" said Becky, chewing thoughtfully on a chunk of bacon, \"we could...\"</span></div></div>",

As Becky did a lot of eating in bed, most of her cartons, bags, and other food containers ended up on the floor, on top of old coloring books and anything else that ended up down there when Becky was bored with it. Star tried to keep it clean, but since Becky was also often asleep she didn't have much of a chance to do so. Seeing as she was downstairs, though, she may give it a shot someday. Not now, though- she had a mission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick raid of the dresser revealed a lot of stale chips and not much else. Star rolled her eyes- clearly Becky had decided clothes to be an unnecessary distraction on her road to bigness. However, Mary was sure to have something that fit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary's room, by contrast, was incredibly dusty- since she had long before relocated permanently to the couch, her room had fallen into disuse. Just stepping on the floor blew up a mildly offensive cloud of dust, and opening the dresser made Star sneeze. Here, though, she hit the jackpot- stretchy pants, enormous shirts, and even several selections of swimsuits. Gleefully, Star grabbed several sets of clothes and headed to the living room. </span></div></div>",

The two sisters watched and ate amusedly as stretchy top after stretchy top utterly failed to contain any part of their rapidly swelling bodies. Pants, too, ripped to shreds almost as soon as they touched the girl's rolls of flab. These wardrobe malfunctions were more likely due to the fact that the clothes hadn't been worn in years rather than the size of the girls (although that was definitely a factor) but nontheless, after an hour of trying on clothes, the girls were surrounded by shredded scraps of fabric- and absolutely nothing to wear. This was not so much a problem in transit, as bedsheets can serve as quite the toga, but one cannot swim in a bedsheet- and swimming was what they needed to do. So, leaving the girls with several bags of chips to nosh on, Star was faced with rather a crossroads- <i>Should I report in to Cassandra, or do I just take them anyway?</i> She really wanted the girls to be happy, but she also didn't want to lose her job- and Cassandra wielded all that power. </span></div></div>",

She feared that, now that she had already been bothered once, the enormous woman would not like to be bothered again- and that, if she was too annoyed, she would fire Star before anybody could mount a defense. Nevertheless, she trudged onward, worried still more that, if she did not ask for permission to take the girls out, she could be a lot more than fired. Put in jail for kidnapping, even.

You see Adam had a crush on a girl named Jenny who was the prettiest girl at school and would always sit in front of him and every summer he would spot her swimming with her friends at the local pool and could see that she would pay attention to a boy named Jeff who was one of the best swimmers at school. Now Adam would have loved to jump in the pool and impressed her with his swimming skills but there was one problem with, that he did not know how to swim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo for a long time he would ask his dad to get swimming lessons but his dad was a cheapskate so he would say no every timed he ask. But luckily for him his dad was friends with Isabel's dad John. So one night when they were hanging out Adam's dad mention how his son would kept pestering him for swimming lessons and John mention that his daughter was an excellent swimmer and could probably teach Adam how to swim for free which was good enough for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo on the first day of swimming lessons Adam was excited that he would finally learn how to swim and would show off to Jenny and she would finally pay attention to him and when he saw the large mansion he got hyped because he thought that his instructor would be an Olympic swimmer that could teach him all kinds of tricks and would definitely impressed Jenny. So when he got inside he immediately changed to his swimming trunks and went to the backyard to wait for his instructor and when finally met her he was both shocked and disappointed. Disappointed because his swimming instructor was obviously not an Olympic swimmer, shocked because she was the fattest kid he had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo naturally he wasn't exactly thrilled that his instructor was this moving blob and was pretty pouting about it but in spite of that Isabel kept her kind and caring personally and taught him some basic swimming exercise and the more lessons they had the more Adam began like her and they started hanging out outside of swimming lessons. They would go see movies together, they would go riding bikes together(with Isabel riding a specialty model bike that could handle her weight) and would sometimes tag along with her when her family would go to an all you can eat buffet. In fact Adam enjoyed Isabel's company so much that he completely forgot the reason he wanted swimming lessons in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Adam was done walking down memory lane they. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could not stop thinking about that strange yellow liquid. He was a scientifically-minded kid- always had been- but, for the life of him, he could not fathom how a simple liquid could keep two impossibly obese people mobile. He'd never thought about it before, but there should really be no way that Isabelle could move at all- he'd seen people much smaller than her in mobility scooters at Wal-Mart. Yet, here she was, able to walk, and at rather a fast clip too.

After finally eating her supper, Jenny was feeling rather satisfied with all that food she ate for some reason. But what Jenny didn't know was because her sudden eating habits, she was starting to get pretty pudgy. It wasn't visible enough for Jenny and her family to notice though, but she is gaining weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in her room after supper, she is starting thinking about what happened to her. \"Oh my gosh, how is this happening? I had this feeling to eat before, but I had always took control of it. Now, I'm eating like a pig. Well at least I'm not getting fat.\" Jenny said not knowing she already was.

What do you mean you don't have a choice in the matter?\" asked Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see I was born with a syndrome that makes me fatter, my mom is a scientist whose inventions help me with my mobility but it gets harder everyday.

After Adam and Isabel were finished drinking they all decided to go back to the pool but before they could jump in they felt a little tremor and saw ripples on the water.

She tried her best to resist them but unfortunately she gave in and rushed directly at the sweets and started eating until they were none left and she was almost as messy as Catherine and Isabel.

Throughout all of supper Jenny's urges didn't strike once much to her relief as she only had one burger and half a steak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter supper Jenny and Isabel went to Isabel's room which has a huge HD tv with several gaming consoles and two bean bag chairs in front of it and a king size bed. The first thing they did was watch a Disney princess movie. After the movie they played super smash brothers where they had a best two out of three match (which Isabel won), then they had a best three out five match (Isabel won again), then a best four out of seven match (you can probably guess who won). After that they were feeling pretty tired so they were getting ready by brushing their teeth and putting their PJ's on. Before she went to bed Jenny looked at the mirror one last time to see that the fat she had this morning was still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe I didn't get a single urge today and I still couldn't lose some weight for tomorrow\" said Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't look that bad to me\" said Isabel. \"You probably regret coming here tonight don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No, I had a good time tonight it's just that tomorrow I...\" said Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to that pool party tomorrow aren't you?\" asked Isabel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know about that?\" asked Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because Adam was also invited. This morning a little bit before school started he tried to convince that Arisa girl to invite me too but from the moment she gave me a look of disgust I already knew that it wasn't going to happen. Adam wanted to not go after that but I convinced him to go anyway since well when was he going to be invited to a popular girl's party again\" said Isabel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Isabel was saying all of this with a smile Jenny could tell that she was hurt. Isabel then noticed Jenny's look of concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about me my cousins are coming for a visit tomorrow, so I won't be alone\" said Isabel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said said they both went to sleep on the king size bed which was big enough for the both of them.

But Jenny needed to confess that it was her. So She walked up to Arisa to try to talk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what are you doing here?\" Arisa asked in disgust \"I didn't seem to invite you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, you did.\" Jenny said waiting for what's about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why would I invite a fat girl like yo...\" Arisa was saying until she realized \"Jenny, Is that you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny then nodded in agreement in disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it!\" Arisa said \"Why did you become so fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see I..\" Jenny was saying before she got interrupted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, you were the prettiest girl around school but now you've turned yourself into a fat pig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other guests overheard what Arisa said and come towards it to see if Jenny did become fat.

He wanted to help, but didn't know if he can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids are still making fun of her by calling her name and poking her belly like people do to the Pillsbury dough boy. Even Jeff the person Jenny liked was hating her, but in silence.

It was a girl about her age, caucasian, skinny, freckles on her face, wore glasses, long red hair and is a foot shorter than Isabel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so sorry\" said Jenny as she held out a hand to help her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay I should have been looking where I was going instead of looking for my friend. By the way I'm Amy\" said Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Jenny. Who were you looking for?\" asked Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've probably seen her around. She's pretty big and eats a lot of food\" said Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is her name Isabel?\" asked Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it is. Do you know her?\" asked Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny then started to tell Amy about how she came to know Isabel and how she spent the weekend at her mansion and the zoo. Just then Isabel came and gave Jenny a hug and than gave Amy a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy it's so good to see you\" said Isabel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to see you too Isabel\" said Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do you two know each other?\" asked Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We met when we were in first grade, one day when someone made fun of my freckles I cried a lot and Isabel comforted me and we've been friends ever since\" said Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam then showed up and said hi to everyone. Then the school bell ringed and they went inside the school. The first class for Jenny was gym and aside from her gym clothes being a little tight and looks from her classmates it was pretty uneventful. After gym was history class and it was also uneventful. Then it was lunch time and Jenny was sitting at the same table with Isabel, Adam and Amy. A few minutes after sitting down someone came up and that person was. </span></div></div>",

Arisa didn't took it so well and we had a fight. After we fought and Arisa didn't want to change, I had enough and left her. So then now I wanted to join Isabel and her friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's a sad story Christina.\" Jenny said to comfort her \"But we can be happy to let you join us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?

After dinner they went outside to look at the sunset with Jenny rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay Jenny?\" asked Adam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's just that I think I might have over done it at dinner\" said Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to rub your belly?\" asked Adam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure if you want\" said Jenny as she was blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam then started to rub Jenny's belly which made her feel good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you sure have gotten bigger since that day of the pool party\" said Adam as he was rubbing Jenny's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny knew that she had to ask him for the dance now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-h-hey Adam\" said Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" said Adam looking up to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to go to the summer dance with me?\" asked Jenny with her face as red as an apple. After a few seconds of silence Adam answered her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" said Adam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!?\" said Jenny surprised that he said yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah why is there a problem?\" asked Adam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's just that I'd thought you'd rather go with Isabel\" said Jenny <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you see right before our hangout Isabel said that she would be busy that day, but if you want to go that's fine by me\" said Adam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater Adam's mom picked him up and after he was gone Jenny immediately called Christina, Amy and Isabel who all congratulated her with Isabel telling Jenny that the day before the dance she would take her to a place to buy a pretty dress for her. Jenny could not wait for the summer dance.</span></div></div>",

But while I got swimming lessons from her I turned my attention to her until you started hanging out with us I started to remember the crush I had on you. Actually I still have a crush on you now that you're more beautiful since the day I met you\" said Adam looking Jenny in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a dream come true for Jenny not only did she go to the dance with the boy she loves but that same boy feels the same way.

Of course not outside where they could run away but rather at lunch in the cafeteria or in the classroom, where there was nowhere to run. She would look for kids in a corner of the room or for example between two tables with a chair behind them and demand their food  if the y didn't hand it over, she would squish them with her massive belly. The reason she was such a brat, was that her parents were very rich and fulfilled her all her wishes. <br>\r\nBut she had one problem and one fear. She loved being fat because it allowed her to boss kids around, but for that she needed to be mobile. While that wasn't a problem currently since she had worked out a lot when she was lighter , she certainly realized that moving was getting harder for her.She couldn't walk as far but still a lot farther than every other girl her weight. She was oblivious to the causes of it though, in her mind she was still as strong as when she weighed less and thought her weight stagnated below 600 lbs. She was convinced that she used so much energy to move around and didn't eat more than at a lower weight. The reality was that her muscles were shrinking due to her lazyness and her weight had increased to above 650 lbs because she demanded food from more people at lunchtime than before.Her biggest fear, immobility was coming closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does her story start?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She normally started by demanding the lunch of either some other fat girl who had no chance against her sheer weight  and si vouldn't defend herself and a fat girl normally also didn't run away which meant April didn't have to get the fooy herself. Another possiblilty were popular girls with all their friends, they all ate together which meant a lot of fattening food in one place since that's all the cafeteria offered (April's parents owned the company that delivered tje food.). The advantage was since all the girls were best friends, you could just seat yourself on top of one and the others would hand over all their food to her to convince to let the girl below her go. After doing one of those two things April always called for Anne, whose parents worked for April's, a fact that April had used to make Anne do things for her in school.<br>\r\nBut it was the first day after the summer holidays and against her believes April had gotten a lot fatter and hungrier. <br>\r\nApril demanded from not less than a group of 10 girls and two fat freinds sitting in a corner. Then she gorged on the 16 pizzas she had received. Because, you see since every kid in the school only ate fatty foods  for lunch they had all gotten chubby, fat or fatter and so ate more, while April still wanted food from the same number of people. <br>\r\nThen she called for Anne, who was astonished as to how much April had already eaten, knowing how much she still would order, but didn't show it like always. April under estimating how much she had already eaten, ordered everything available three times and desserts five times, while ensuring herself that she had always eaten this much. Anne just went off and got the food without saying a thing.<br>\r\nApril's feast continued. Once she was finished she looked completely stuffed her massive belly extending beyond her knees. She had remainders of her food mainly pizza, french fries and ice cream all over her.Oblivious as to how much she had eaten she attempted to get up like she usually did turning around  90\u00b0and pushing herself up with one hand on the table.

April looked around and noticed the bag of Cassandra, the second fattest girl in class and a hopeless glutton, her bag appeared to be full of food. A fact noticed by both April and Anne who hatched a plan then and there to humiliate April in front of the whole class.<br>\r\nApril had already gorged on so much food that and she had just found Cassandra's second bag, which was stuffed to the brim with food(Cassandra always pretended to be sick and never brought her PE clothes). <br>\r\nIn that bag was Cassandra's food supply for the week as she refilled it every Monday morning and then kept it at school, so her parents won't find out. She also ate so much that nothing went bad over the weekend so as not to alert anyone with the smell. <br>\r\nIn that bag was enough food to have April gorge like never before and oh boy would she gladly allow that. Nevermind April who could never resist food.<br>\r\nSo Anne sprung into action, she texted her class about what she wanted them to do and asked April: \"Don't you want to eat all that? Imagine Cassandra's face, if that pig can't stuff herself.<br>\r\nThe thought of Cassandra going hungry motivated April to grab the bag and start stuffing her already full belly like never before.<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, Anne was astonished about the speed of it all, April had finished all of the food, her belly looked bigger than ever. <br>\r\nThere was just one thing left to do. April had to be subconsciously convinced, her mobility was unimpaired so Anne gathered all her strength and heaved April up, so as to not \"burden her unnecessarly\" as she told April, which the dumb fat bully actually believed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short but tiring walk they arrived at the actual swimming pool and Anne looked around, everything was ready, her classmates were in position. After seating April she positioned herself in front of her and began to talk about how it was her birthday and she was going to eat a cake now, which was brought to her soon enough.<br>\r\n\"NO! GIVE IT TO ME!\" :April shouted. But Anne ignored her. April screamed angrily and prepared to bury Anne under her massive belly.<br>\r\nExcept when shetried to get up as she usually did, nothing happened, confused  she tried again and again but she didn't lift her massive belly even a millimeter.<br>\r\n\"Is somebody having trouble getting up?\" Anne asked sheepishly. \"No, you skinny bitch\" April replied. She started rocking back and forth, except she couldn't even lean backwards as her overstuffed belly pinned her in place. Then Anne told April her worst nightmare: \"April, you fat pig you've eaten yourself immobile you idiot.\"<br>\r\n\"If you want to prove me wrong just get this cake\" and with these words Anne lifted the cake just a few centimeters out of reach of April's arms. \"Oh this is too easy\", April said smugly and leaned forward only to be stopped by her gut. Now heavily irritated and infuriated after Anne burst into laughter April shouted: \"I'M NOT IMMOBILE, YOU SKINNY BITCH, I'LL SQUASH YOUR SKINNY ASS AND EAT THAT CAKE WHILST SITTING ON TOP OF YOU!\" Yet as if in doubt about herself, she braced herself, visibly gathering her strength and momentum(by rocking back and forth as little as she actually could). <br>\r\nYou could see her muscles straining in preparation, building up energy, her face full of determination, and suudenly releasing all the built-up tension. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see her face turning red, her muscles straining even more. She grunted in made all kinds of noises and achieved... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... literally nothing her belly didn't move at all her hands got no millimeter closer to touching the cake.<br>\r\n\"Oh, piggy ate herself immobile.\" Anne mocked and the others burst into laughter. </span></div></div>",

May had never heard the wind, nor felt the night, nor any thing we take for granted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay's entire world was four gray walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all her eight years, she had never once left the house, nor her room, nor, even, the bed that she now lay on. The only people she ever saw outside of television were her parents, the only things she ever did were watch television and read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, of course, eat. That was, after all, her only purpose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the very day of her birth May had been fed to bursting. May never learned the concepts of breakfast, lunch, or dinner; for her, every day was one long feast, every day a stuffing unmatched until the next. Her parents wanted her fat- they told her it was beautiful, desirable, wonderful- so she never learned to walk, nor crawl, nor anything for herself- not even the slightest control over her bowels. Her bed served as a toilet, a bookshelf, a shower, a dining table, and everything else one could ever need. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor May, unsurprisingly, was seven hundred pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body flowed out around her, concealing whatever atrophied form she once had from any eyes. Her belly, massive, sweaty, multi-tiered, and impossibly pale, rolled out before her, pushing apart and past the legs she never used and just beginning to hang off the far end of her bed. Her parents, pleased with her progress, would sometimes tickle her here, teasing her, and promising her a special treat when it reached the floor. Her butt, too, was hanging off the sides, bending towards the floor under her cheeks' great weight. Above that, her back fat bulged, dividing into many sundry bulges and blobs. Around front, her breasts, mere bulges of fat, hung similarly, cresting over the sides of the great hump of her belly and dropping, as so much of her did, towards the floor. Her chins, three of them, nearly reached her chest. Her cheeks flew blobbily off her face. And, to crown her form, two perpetually open lips for her feeding tube, a squat, flabby nose for her oxygen tube, two dull brown eyes, often closed, and a head full of greasy brown hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay ate of her tube from dawn till dusk, interrupted only sometimes for tirades of solid food. She breathed from her oxygen tube, made necessary by her weak and pointless lungs. Sometimes, when she felt particularly daring, she would move one of her flabby arms, testing her limited capacity for life, waiting for the inevitable day when they, too, would lose their use and become, like the rest of her, useless nubs on a useless form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than anything, more than any possible thing in her world of four walls, May wished to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could, of course. Not very well, not for very long, but she could. Her parents would not talk to her; whenever she tried, they only said she was wasting energy and fed her even more. Sometimes, when she was left alone, she would, slowly and ponderously, raise one enormous arm to her tube and slide it out of her mouth. Then, gathering all her meager strength, she would speak at the air until she grew hungry again- which was never a very long time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay hoped, someday, that someone would come to visit her, someone like on the television. Someone who would talk to her, hear her voice, and be her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for her, her house was alone, stuck in the middle of the Arizona desert. Her parents had planned it explicitly so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay, if she knew, would have cried.</span></div></div>",

Her parents talking, the constant hum of the fridge, food sizzling under the grill, pipes gurgling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day though, there was a noise she'd never heard before - not in real life anyway. A doorbell! The shrill ring echoed around inside the house, jerking Amy out of a restless slumber. A few moments later there came an insistent knocking as well, as whoever was at the door grew tired of waiting. Amy waited with baited breath, wondering what new sound she'd experience next, and a second later heard her father's swift shoes in the hall, then the door swinging open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? We're very busy, and don't like being disturbed,\" she heard her father's voice snap out. After that though, she heard another voice - the first one she'd ever experienced in real life besides her own and her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr Jensen?\" It said, \"I'm from the bank. You haven't been answering our calls. Or our letters. Or our emails...\"<br>\r\n\"As I just mentioned, me and my wife are extremely busy out here,\" her father said tersely, \"What do you want?\"<br>\r\nThere was a brief rustling of papers, then the official spoke again.<br>\r\n\"It's your house, Mr Jensen. It's being repossessed. Non-payment of mortgage, you see. We've been trying to get hold of you for months - it's damnably tricky to get out here...\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, well, that's the point.\" Amy's father sounded flustered for the first time since that day her oxygen pipe had blocked up and she'd gotten all sleepy. Amy wondered what was bothering him; what even was a 'repossessed'? She'd seen The Exorcist so she knew about possession, but it happening more than once seemed like beating a dead horse to her. <br>\r\n\"How long do we have?\" Amy's father asked.<br>\r\n\"The standard 28 days. If you don't clear out in that time, we'll send in the bailiffs. I'm sorry we haven't been able to reach you until now - otherwise you could have contested this. Nothing that can be done now though. Thank you for your time, Mr Jensen\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy heard the door slam shut, then there was a long, long silence.</span></div></div>",

There was no help or home left; the Jensens had to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was just the small problem of their immovable daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery single thing about May's existence precluded her moving. For one thing, the most obvious thing, she never had moved; the very concept of motion was foreign to her. Of course, the myriad slew of logistical problems did not exactly help matters either. May, being immobile, was entirely dependent upon various machines; if they were to move, these machines would have to be disconnected. There would be no way for her to breathe easily, to eat, to use the restroom- all of these would have to be taken away. Beyond that, she was far too wide to leave through a normal door, but, as the house was soon to not be theirs, there was no way to smash the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, to sum up, this massively immobile, entirely helpless girl would have to be disconnected from life support, moved through a place she could not be moved through, and, provided she could fit into a moving truck, moved to someplace potentially very far away, all without the aforementioned life support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, though, there was no way to stay...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, for days upon days, May's parents agonized, planned, made phone calls, shrieked, and planned some more, seemingly making both no progress and a lot of mess.

The sun, the sky, other people- all these weighed heavily on her mind. Of course, there was no good  way to do this, helpless as she was, but, as a good fat girl should, she wanted to have her cake and eat it, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs that so much to ask?</span></div></div>",

She can move very well and even that, she loved being this big so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a long story to tell, but more like a secret story as to why for a 9 year old would be so humongous to in weight to carry, but maybe some scenes she did some years ago, made her famous for its right. She was admired by so many people, even more so that she looked to squash people to know what she's made of. She may be spoiled, but she still loves people and would always have some fun by any ways in one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer size by the way, it looked like she's a true monster by her sheer size. Her thighs and butt are so gigantic and fat, it was the biggest featured of her body as of late. Her belly was also huge and overlapped her meaty thighs in question. The rest of her body are thickened like huge tree trunks, even she had big boobs to make way for her weight itself and still has that cute look on that smile she loved the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, Kelly was about to start the day, even so when she...</span></div></div>",

When Teddy first saw June come out of her bus he thought that she was the prettiest girl that he had ever seen and was instantly in love with her. For the first few days Teddy was too shy to be anywhere near her so when he saw her he would always run away much to June's confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil one day whe they were both alone with each other he told how pretty she was and that he liked her from the first time he saw her and much to his surprise she told him that the feeling was mutual and after that they became an official couple. Ever since then they could always be seen together either doing activities or sitting with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes it was the best summer ever for these two love birds but unfortunately as the old saying goes all good things must come to an end. They lived in different towns and they were too young for Facebook and Twitter (at least according to their parents). So on the day before they left they met under an apple tree that they called their special spot they made a promise to each other that they would come back next year. The next day they said their goodbyes and got on their respective busses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Teddy's life remained relatively normal the same could not be said about June. You see three months after summer June's parents started to notice that she was getting pretty fat even though she wasn't eating that much. So her parents took her to see a doctor and after doing some test on her they discovered that she got an extremely rare biological disorder where one calorie would be the equivalent of a thousand and her body would register as that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo from that day on she went from a 90lbs girl to a 575lbs one. If that wasn't bad enough most of the kids at school and in her neighbor hood would make fun of her and bully her. She has even tried to ask her parents to not let her go to Camp Coyote but they thought that this camp was something that could help her boost her confidence. So she's still going and she hopes that Teddy will still love her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay so now you know the backstory and now you get to decide which perspective do we follow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeddy? or June?</span></div></div>",

She would regularly hangout with friends and family and she was part of her schools soccer team. Then at the age of 10 she had a boyfriend named Conner. They were the cutest couple ever at least according to her friends. They would go to the movies together, play games with each other and would always sit at the same table in the cafeteria during lunchtime. Yep life was pretty good for Stacey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil one day before the end of the school year Conner decided to break up with her without giving her a reason. When she followed him around without him noticing her she saw that he left her for a fat girl about 300lbs. She then realized that Conner was what they call a 'chubby chaser'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that revelation Stacey decided to gain weight to hopefully win back Conner. So for the entirety of summer she would just lay in bed eating a lot of fattening food ignoring calls from her friends.

Her belly was so big, it overlapped her undies she wore, whilst she was sleeping.  Her butt and thighs are so huge, it looked like the size of beach balls and is the biggest feature of her size.

Considering that she hadn't left her room almost all summer she had no idea how much work it would be to lug her larger frame around, but it would all be worth it if she could just get Conner back. Although at this size there was no doubt in her mind that Conner would come right back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she rode along fantasizing about what would happen when Conner saw her, she was brought back to reality by a loud growl emanating from her stomach as it began feeling like she was starving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing her stomach with her stout arms, she felt her hands sinking into her soft belly to the point they almost disappeared. Frowning she realized how hungry she was, despite the massive breakfast she'd eaten before leaving. All summer she'd eaten almost non-stop except for when she was sleeping, and now that she was going back to school she couldn't do that anymore, and her belly was letting her know it wasn't happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to panic as she realized that lunch was about 4 hours away. How was she going to go that long without food? She needed to get something to eat or she'd starve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMassaging her belly anxiously as her whole body jiggled with every move, she turned back to looking outside, wondering what she was going to do if she couldn't get food before lunch. She couldn't believe she'd changed over the summer break, and not just physically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she really had too much time to think on what she would do, the school came into view through the window. It was a small brick building that had maybe a couple hundred students in a dozen or so classrooms. In front of the school several small groups of kids stood talking or playing while they waited for the bell to call them to class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus let out a hiss as it came to a stop at the drop-off zone, and the other kids began moving towards the door, filing out slowly. Stacey grabbed her backpack and went to stand, freezing as a strange feeling hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tugged at her belly, feeling it wedged between the seat in front and hers. Her belly massage must have pushed it down farther between her spread legs, getting it stuck between the seats. Giving a few more tugs, she let her arms sag into her sides as she panted heavily from the brief exertion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMustering all her strength, she attempted to stand, when...</span></div></div>",

She took a few seconds to try to catch her breath before standing up. As she slowly waddled off the bus, the driver just looked at her in astonishment at how big she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe figured she'd just have to get used to people looking at her like that, since she now looked like a small boulder. Though she still found herself tugging at her shirt slightly as her face turned a light red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, she could here the other children talking and enjoying themselves, though many of them stopped and stared at the large girl waddling towards the school building. Many of them seemed to turn towards each other, whispering to each other as they continued to watch her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was aware of her body shaking with every labored step, as her own heavy breathing filled her ears. She had no idea that physical activity would be this hard, but a part of her was really enjoying the feeling of struggling to do even the simplest things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that you Stacey?\" A tall girl said, as she easily fell in stride with Stacey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lisa,\" Stacey panted, \"Have you lost weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa had always been a little on the chubby side, but it seemed that she'd grown a foot taller over the break, and a foot narrower. Stacey had always thought that she would be skinnier than Lisa until she'd started gaining over the break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond haired girl blushed slightly as she looked down at the ground, \"Yeah. I went on a diet all summer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sucks.\" Stacey panted, looking at the final obstacle that faced her before she could enter the school. There was 10 stairs that led up to the front door, though they appeared more like a mountain to Stacey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems like you didn't have that problem,\" Lisa said, obviously staring at Stacey's round belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" Stacey said, happily patting her soft belly, as Lisa continued to watch it jiggle long after the light blows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a few breaths, Stacey slowly lifted one of her enormous legs up onto the first step, feeling tons of weight dragging her down. Already panting, she pulled her other leg up beside the first, and began working on getting to the second step. By the time she was halfway up the stairs, she realized there was a large crowd of other people gathering to watch her try to climb the stairs. She glanced over the crowd, wondering if Conner was among those watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned back towards the stairs, and continued her slow climb while Lisa tried to help her as much as she could. If Conner was in the crowd he would definitely be crawling back anytime now, Stacey thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she finally made it to the top of the stairs, the crowd at the bottom began to disperse, and she tried to see if Conner was among those watching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Stacey! You've really gotten bigger,\" she heard a boy say behind her. She turned as quickly as she could, standing face to face with...</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s just that I kinda don\u2019t have a big fat person to look after, and it had been a week or so since she left.\u201d  Connor replied in a sad tone, but as soon as he stares right at Stacey and her 500 pound obese body, this caused him to make a smile and says otherwise.  \u201cBut on the other hand, since you\u2019ve surprised me on how much you\u2019ve gained the whole summer, this did make me realised that I do have a fatty to fall in love, and I think you\u2019re that girl I wanna spend more time with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made Stacey\u2019s chubby face brightened red, as she knew she\u2019d just won Connor back, and he even likes having her massively huge.  In fact, Connor may want to make Stacey even bigger as both can imagine about it.  This made her smiled and nodded with full of excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re so sweet, little boy!  Come here and give this big girl a cuddle.\u201d  Stacey smiles and spread he arms wide and offered Connor to embrace her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made no hesitation and Connor replied by giving Stacey a cuddle and noticed straight that she\u2019s tightened the boy, due to the nature of her size it caused to happen.  Of course Connor doesn\u2019t mind since he already experienced it with Julie before.  It would take a while to hug until the bell rings and both let themselves to head to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth simply smiled and walked together, since they\u2019re in the same class for the next subject.</span></div></div>",

It was her stomach that had was the hardest to get through, and trying her best to squeeze through as much as she can.  It only took a couple of minutes however before with a help from Lisa in hand, Stacey had finally gotten through and rubbed her belly to try and calm down the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks!

Or for one\u2019s sake, going on the field trip and take the bus from there.  This doesn\u2019t seem to be the problem at least for the first part.  But when she was getting in on the bus, there was some empty space which stretches way at the back.  This sighed Stacey in annoyance and had to go through the aisle, with her widened hips bumping onto some students which cannot be helped by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore name callings and so, and she eventually finds a seat which her massive butt took up two seats, due to her mammoth weight of a eleven year old.  Lisa had also found a seat and sat across the aisle.  All was settled and it was off to the trip.  Everyone had absolute no idea what kind of buffet their teacher meant, so they would had to wait until they\u2019ve arrived at the place.

Plus, they offered unlimited pizza, which Stacey had taken full advantage of. Though it had been a while since she'd been able to come here in person, since near the end of summer she'd just had her parents bring her food so that she didn't have to move around as much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the bus began standing up as it came to a stop, and the people in the front began exiting towards the delicious pizza that awaited in the building. Stacey had been careful not to let her belly get stuck again, but still found it a struggle to get up. She panted slightly as she waited for Lisa to start making her way down the aisle before following. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, almost everyone was off the bus now, which meant that Stacey wasn't continuously bumping into everyone now with her wider body. She stepped off the bus into the bright sun, feeling a cool breeze across her large body. Most of the other students had already entered the building, but Lisa was standing near the bus waiting for Stacey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey started waddling towards the building, her body a jiggling mass of fat, \"Thanks for waiting for me. I've definitely have gotten slower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa fell into step beside Stacey, \"No problem. I thought for sure that I'd be as skinny as you if I lost weight over the summer, but it seems like I didn't even need to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey glanced at her friend, who seemed almost disappointed. Stacey wondered if maybe Lisa was a bit jealous of Stacey for gaining so much weight while Lisa had tried to lose it just so she wouldn't be fatter than her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked in silence for a few minutes, listening to the crowd of people as they entered the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher was currently addressing the crowd of students, though it seemed like she was almost done, \"...We will only be here for two hours, so make sure that you're done before then. That should be it, so go ahead and enjoy the food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher and all the students went to find a seat, while Lisa and Stacey went to find a booth to themselves. Finding one in the corner, they put their stuff on the seats, and went to grab some pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey began loading up a plate with almost an entire pizza's worth of slices, smelling the greasy goodness. Her stomach let out a loud growl, reminding her she hadn't eaten in a couple of hours. She began waddling towards the booth, and sat down, squeezing herself into the small space between the bench and table. A minute later Lisa joined her, with a plate almost as full as Stacey's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls ate ravenously, quickly devouring the greasy, cheesy pizza on their plates, loaded with tons of toppings. Lisa finished first, she got up to go get another plate. However, as she was about to get up and get more, Stacey found herself stuck in the booth, the top of her belly hanging onto the table, which was pressing her tightly against the bench.

Finally, after a few minutes of trying, Lisa's arms sagged to her sides, as she tried to catch her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm going to need help.\" Lisa said, before rushing off without waiting for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey rolled her eyes, her hands feeling her large belly as she waited for her friend to return with help. She couldn't believe how small everything was now. Before the summer, she'd never imagined that anyone could get stuck in so many places. Still, she wasn't about to give up on food now. She would just have to adjust to her new size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Lisa returned with a few of the staff from the restaurant, who all seemed surprised at the size of the young girl who was stuck in their booth. </span></div></div>",

Instead, she just ate like a pig and wanted to grow so large, she can feel it was coming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey was almost there when her massive body began to push against the table, and can hear the legs was starting to creak at the same time as her gigantic butt had taken up the entire seat and can feel a crunch from underneath.

He brought along a large cart of food he pulled to get there and here's why for this special reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had his dream of looking at girls getting as much fatter and everything and wanted to become the largest person on the planet.  This he may thought that someone his wouldn't be exsist.  That was until he saw a girl named, Kate.  She wasn't just fat in any sense, but you can see when he gets there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter went up to her doorstep and ring the doorbell before he waited for her to answer.  That on, he can hear some footsteps which it quite loud than usual for a 12 year old in some cases.  Then, the door opened and the first sight of Kate was seen in a shocking 500lbs frame but she's still smiling as much as Peter is seeing her right now.  She was in her very tight t-shirt and her underwear which she didn't care what she had wore since the rest did not fit her anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body was like an elephant kinda looking as her belly was draping over her underwear and her thighs and hips have gone wide and larger to the look of the size of her butt she liked the best.  Her face looked so far that she had her triple chins with a smile, despite of that.  She loved it though but wouldn't want to be the largest girl there is to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there, Peter!  I see you got more food for me, yeah?\"  Kate asked wondering by the look of the large cart Peter pulled in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure have, sweetie!\"  He replied before a smile came from both as Kate let's him in the house before taking him to the living room to sit on for some rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was sitting down, he saw Kate waddling towards him with her thighs jiggling from side to side and that was the moment he loved it so much to think about it, especially of her obese size of a 12 year girl. Then, her stomach began to rubble and knowing that she was getting hungry, but not forgot about Peter when he stares at him with a smile and wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, I was wondering since I've never done this before, but are you okay if...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Did you bring any food for me to eat?\"  Megan joked her question and Matt would reply with that shy smirk a bit on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny, but you should already know that this rubbish you're eating is not a sport.  Look at you, you're a fat whale that has nothing more but eating junk food for yourself.\"  That was Matt views which was why he was upset in recent times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\"  Megan was making things to much on Matt and stood up as much as her smirk goes with her 500 pound frame showing right in front of her slim sized brother.  \"Is that a threat?  Are you saying you wanna challenge me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Matt was started to realized his mistake on approaching Megan in this way.  \"Wait, what are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan smiled and reveals in all with her obese body jiggling when showing off. \"I know a challenge you think you could try and beat me, how about a......</span></div></div>",

As Megan and her mom arrived at the dining area Megan looked around to see if the girl that her friend talked about was still around and she was. Megan asked her mom if she could meet her, she said yes and Megan walked up to the large girl who's name was...</span></div></div>",

So Megan came up to the girl who was still eating and decided to talk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there\" Megan said to the girl<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other huge girl then stopped eating when someone greeted her. \"Oh hello.\" said the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't really think I would see another girl who's just as fat as me.\" Said Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm glad that you finally got to see another one up close.\" the girl said. \"By the way, my name's Isabel. What's yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Megan. It's glad to meet you Isabel\" She greeted to her \"So what are you doing here at the mall? Besides eating of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, my mom and I were were shopping for some new clothes since I'm getting close to my clothes becoming too small.\" said Isabel<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Me too. I'm getting a new dress for me since my birthday is coming up this Satuday.\" Megan replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I love birthday's I always enjoy it when I come to my friends or celebrate my own.\" Isabel said \"Hey Megan, how about you sit with me and we can eat together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would love to do that Isabel\" said Megan \"I just need to get my own food first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan then headed towards the food places and got as much as she can eat and get. She then headed back to Isabel who was already back to eating and got her food all set up on the table. Once she got set up, Megan quickly dug into her lunch feast like the competitive eater she is. Since Isabel started earlier than Megan, she finished first and waited for Megan to finish so that she doesn't interrupt her eating. It didn't take long though for Megan to finish since she has been eating as quick as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Megan! you ate that so fast. I think faster than me.\" Isabel complimented<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've actually been a pretty competitive eater which caused be to be this big.\" Megan explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were talking with each other for a bit and enjoy their conversation when suddenly they hear Isabel's mom came up to her. Megan was actually surprised to how huge Isabel's mom was. She was like the biggest human blob she's ever seen and is somehow still walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isabel, it's time to go home.\" Isabel's mom Catherine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, really? I was having so much fun.\" Isabel said disappointed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can definitely see that and would love to have you hang out with her for a little while longer.\" Catherine said \"But we agreed that you would be able to eat here and I'll be eating when we get back to our house so we don't empty all the stores. And I'm getting really hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ok then mom.\" Isabel said as she got off her chair \"Bye Megan.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye Isabe..\" Megan said before she got hugged by Isabel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my daughter is quite the hugger. Let's go then Isabel.\" Catherine said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabel and Catherine were leaving the dining area until Megan says something to Isabel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Isabel\" said Megan \"How about you come to my birthday party this Saturday. I'm sure you'll love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why Isabel can't some to the party.\" Catherine thought \"Perhaps I can talk with your mom to see if she can come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan then sees both Isabel and Catherine walk off until they're out of her sight. She then came back to her mom to continue on with their day. </span></div></div>",

There's a girl as big as my little princess! Guess I should double the order of food that I ordered for your birthday\" said Megan's dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan then went to the living room to watch tv and wait for dinner. As she was watching tv she couldn't help but think about Isabel. She never thought in a million years that she would meet someone who is just as big as her. Maybe she can ask her how she became so huge when she sees her tomorrow at school.</span></div></div>",

She was looking and looking until she found the human blob as big as her that is Isabel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isabel!\" Megan called out to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey there Megan.\" Isabel answered and then hugged her \"It's so good to see you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's good to see you too.\" Said Megan \"Say Isabel I was meaning to give you my number but I forgot to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah Megan, my mom needs to have that if she wants to talk with your mom on it.\" Isabel acknowledged \"You should also have my number as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a plan Isabel.\" Megan agreed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they both gave each other their numbers and talked with each other for a bit. Megan was about to tell Isabel why she's so fat, but then the school bell rang signaling the start of school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, it's time for school. I really wanted to talk with you more.\" Isabel said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Isabel, how about we sit and eat with each other at Lunch?\" Megan suggested<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like that idea, I think we have the same lunchtime together.\" Isabel said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they both left each other with Isabel hugging her and both went into the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was lunchtime, Megan was looking around with her tray full of so much food for Isabel. She then found Isabel also with a tray full of food sitting at a table munching away. Megan then sat at the same table with her and began eating as well. While eating, they began to chat and enjoy themselves. While talking with each other, Megan finally asked her how she got so big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is that all Megan?\" Isabel said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was really surprised at the fact that there's another girl who's just as fat as me with a mother who's even bigger. I just want to know how you got yourself like this.\" Megan said not trying to sound offensive<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's an interesting story Megan.\" said Isabel \"You see, I have some kind of syndrome that completely shuts down my metabolism and makes me gain a lot of weight fast. But, that syndrome also gives me a really strong immune system the fatter I get and I never got sick once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! That sounds so awesome to have.\" Said Megan in surprise<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and my mom is a scientist and helps me and herself walk around like normal with stuff she invents.\" Isabel said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man Isabel, I'm so jealous of you. But you don't have to worry.\" Said Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Megan and Isabel kept talking until lunch time was over. They soon left the lunchroom and headed back to their classes. Soon, school for the day ended with Megan's birthday only two days left.</span></div></div>",

One of the downsides of being a competitive eater.\" Megan said <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Megan's mom drove up and the two got in the car. It wasn't too long for them to reach Isabel's mansion. So once they got there, the girls got out and Megan's mom drove away while the girls get to the door. Once they got to the door, the girls rand the doorbell and didn't wait too long for Isabel to open the door and hugging them while she greets them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hello there Megan. It's so nice to see you again.\" Isabel said as she hugged her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. Though I should get more used to your hugs Isabel.\" says Megan<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know. I just love hugging my friends once I see them again.\" says Isabel \"So, you must be Kristian Megan told me about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, that's me. So where can we change into our swimsuits?\" said Kristian<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, there's a bathroom nearby over there.\" Isabel said while pointing the direction to where the bathroom is<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls brought their swimsuits while they go to the bathroom. They decided to change one at a time starting with Megan. Once Megan got her swimsuit on, she went out of the bathroom for Isabel to go in next. Megan's swimsuit surprisingly fits her rather well since the clothes shops don't really make swimsuits for someone her size. It can really fit well on that massive body she has. But when Isabel came out, both Kristian and Megan were shocked when her one piece swimsuit really shows how big her belly is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo once Kristian put her swimsuit on, the girls got their way to the pool with Megan being slightly out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Megan, are you ok?\" Isabel said in concern<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm just having problems with walking and standing up for a long time.\" Megan said \"But I'll be fine once I get into the pool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, ok.\" Isabel said still sounding a bit concerned<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the girls got themselves into the pool and began to swim around and play games. Although swimming for Megan was kind of hard with her big body. She's not like Isabel who can swim with ease even with a big body. But that wasn't such a problem as Megan kept swimming in the pool until they decided to leave the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a great time we had at the pool. Huh Megan?\" Isabel asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really was Isabel\" Kristian said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah (pant) it was nice (pant) swimming with you.\" Megan said nearly out of breath<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megan, are you sure you're ok?\" Isabel asked in concern<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I am.\" Megan said while breathing heavily \"I just need to lie down and rest for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the girls went back inside, dried themselves and put their clothes back on. They soon hanged out in the living room watching some tv with Megan sitting on the couch still panting heavily. Until soon....</span></div></div>",

Within minutes, the tubby 10 year-old finishes up all those mozzarella sticks with some satisfaction, but still has a feeling to have more in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile waiting, Jenny gulps down some of the Coke to cool down her mouth a bit.

Adam cuts up his lasagna into a piece and eats it up, repeating the same thing in the process while doing some occasional drinking of his coke. Jenny in the meantime, was getting herself a good chunk of her spaghetti and stuffs it in her mouth, also getting in some coke as well and eating some meatballs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey took a couple minutes, but they end up finishing up their meal, both with satisfied belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, that was so great. Megan was so wise to pick this place for a dinner date.\" Jenny said while she rubs her tummy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, was quite a wonderful dinner if you ask me, much better with a great girl like you, Jenny,\" Adam said, making Jenny giggle and blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter letting their meal settle in their stomachs, they pay for their dinner and head back out on the bikes, heading off to their next place.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If one were to peruse the public record, they would find nothing out of the ordinary for Ella Grasime. They would find only that she was an 11-year old girl of Moldovan extraction, that her mother was named Anastasia, that she was homeschooled, and her hometown. They would not find that she had blonde hair or blue eyes, that she despises grapes, or that she was the fattest girl in the entire world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom an early age, Anastasia had conspired to make Ella large. Not by force, of course: she had no desire to hurt her daughter, not by any means. But, given delicious food, a child will eat it, and the more delicious food is given, the more that will be eaten, often sooner rather than later. For that reason, Ella rocketed up from thin to chubby to obese to morbidly obese in a matter of a few years, and by age 4 had reached the whopping weight of 325 pounds. At that point, she had, one day, tried to retrieve another snack for herself from the cabinet and collapsed, wheezing, barely two feet from the couch. From that day forward, she never took another step, and now, seven years later, she weighed over 900 pounds and could not move or care for herself in the slightest. Anastasia, her mother and the sole person she ever saw, doted on her, to such an extreme that Ella, even at eleven, could not speak properly, only able to say single-word pronouncements usually consisting of \"Hungry!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor, at her size, she was constantly hungry. 900+ pounds would do that to a girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf one were to get a good look at Ella it would, at first, be difficult to tell one was looking at a human, let alone an 11-year-old girl. From a distance, she resembled little more than a large mound of vaguely pinkish jelly, wobbling gently with the multiple fans she needed to stay cool. Up close, though, one could truly appreciate what her extreme obesity had done to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElla's belly was the most dominant part of her, a huge swell of fat that reached far beyond her legs and was almost poking off the edge of the king-sized bed where she spent her days. It covered quite a bit of her now-useless legs, which were themselves so swollen with fat that, despite the fact that they were spread wide to give room to her belly, still touched. At the end of each fat leg were two swollen feet, useless for nearly seven years. In the rear, her enormous butt spread out similarly to her belly, itself also almost hanging off the edges of the bed. Between its two formless cheeks snaked one of many tubes attached to her, this one to deal with her, as Anastasia politely called them in Romanian, \"emisiile,\" or emissions. On top of her wide swell of belly sat two formless breasts, as yet untouched by puberty and yet still too large and unwieldy for any sort of conventional brassiere. Next to them her arms jutted out, so incredibly swollen with fat as to also be useless- she could not even feed herself. At the end of these were two chubby hands, which she could still wiggle- but barely, and doing so would leave her exhausted. Finally, her head, ringed with four chins and two fat cheeks that forced her eyes into a perpetual squint, two tubes snaking in to provide oxygen and food in between meals. Ella could still chew, but Anastasia thought that, too, may soon be going, seeing the number of chins attached to her enormous daughter. This was all Anastasia had wanted, naturally- a fat daughter- and for her to continue getting fatter, to 1000 pounds, then to 2000, and onward and upward and outward from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as often happens, there was a problem. Today, when Anastasia arrived with the first of Ella's many dinner carts and took out her feeding tube, her massive daughter said something different. Instead of her usual demanding burst of \"Hungry!\" she instead, with some confusion, wheezed out \"Friends?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnastasia was so surprised she nearly dropped the tray she was holding. \"F-Friends, Ella? What friends? What do you mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor answer, Ella motioned slightly with one hand towards the television, sweat breaking out all over her body from the effort. \"Want friends...like...TV. Go...out...\" She was gasping for breath now, despite her oxygen, but she wasn't done. \"See...world...\" Anastasia, desperate to calm her daughter, lunged toward her mouth with a piece of steak, but still she wasn't finished. \"Please...\" Finally, with her message complete, Ella opened her mouth fully and allowed herself to be sated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, after Ella had been good and thoroughly fed, Anastasia took a moment to consider what her enormous daughter had been talking about. \"She wants...friends, huh? Well, I can understand why, but not how I'm supposed to get her some!\" (Anastasia, alone in the house most of the day, frequently talked to herself.) \"But, for Ella, anything is worth a try, right?\" She turned to her computer, poised to start searching, but another thought occurred to her then. \"Really, though, who cares? Ella won't be going anywhere without my help- why bother? Still, though, she <i>is</i> my daughter... and I <i>do</i> love her...right?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A hot summer sun looms commandingly over a modest neighborhood in California. Despite the largly lower class hispanic population that made up this barrio, one house in particular stands out amongst the others; most notably the one with the  pool and breathtakingly large AC unit installed on the roof. While these cooling fixtures were refreshing for most, to one member of the family it was almost necessary...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mami!\" Maria Santiago bellows from her seated position on the couch, \"Where's the ice cream?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the bottom of the freezer, mija.\" her mother answers quite sweetly, \"Do you want me to get it for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer second-born, Gabriella, fought her older sister's overall girth for room; literally, she had to push against her sister's soft jiggly apron of flab so she could have even the slightest bit of comfort, lest be swallowed by it. \"Mami!\" the scrawny nine year old girl cried in desperation, \"Don't you think she's already fat enough?!\" she held her hands far past her own waify build, \"<i>Muchas Gordas</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria Santiago was by far the biggest girl in the neighborhood at only the ripe young age of fifteen, nearly spherical at this point, which she liked to blame on a hyperlazy thyroid. In truth, her glands<b>were</b> a little bit defective- but as her sisters would often remind her, having lazy thyroids is no reason to make a <i>cerdo</i> out of herself. With this excuse in mind, Maria had never exactly restrained herself in regards to her appetite- but since being confined to homeschooling due to lack of reinforced, double-wide desks she had been taking it to the extreme. Just last week at her quinceanera, she had polished off enough food to feed her family for a few days...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Callate.\" Maria fanned her tripley-chinned face with her chubby hands, \"I'm not going to eat it, I'm using it to cool down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By eating it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Callate</i> poco mocosa!!\" Maria did her best to lunge over her own ponderous bulk in order to make a grab at her younger, much thinner sister but found that she was far too hot sweaty and tired to seriously go after Gabriella. \"Mami!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming, I'm coming <i>bebita</i>!\" her mother calls from down the hall, \"I was doing laundry!\" Her mother, Florencia, was also quite the corpulant woman, though seemed much smaller than when juxtaposed to her daughter. \"Ice cream, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Maria pat her tummy eagerly, barely able to stop herself from salivating at the thought of filling her gigantic honey colored dome of a belly. Even though she kept telling herself that she would put behind her head, her stomach rumbled with it's strong arguement. Without skipping a beat, her mother happilly delivered a single-serving container of rocky road; making sure that it went behind Maria's neck instead of inside her stomach. \"<i>Gracias</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Mari when is Papi taking you out driving again?\" her mother pat Maria's pudgy cheek as she enjoyed the cooling sensation that chilled the sweat trickling down her neck. \"Never.\" Maria pouted, \"you know I'm too big to fit in Papi's junker.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn cue, her mother went straight into defensive mode; \"<i>Silencio</i>, <i>mi princesa es muy flaca</i>!\" her spanish tounge was still fresh, rather than Maria who had been raised to be much more bilingual, \"Mami, look at me!\" the large hispanic girl jiggled her tummy, \"Grande- Gorda- FAT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, mi angelita...\" her mother still treated her like such a child, even though she was old enough to drive, \"I know it's hard but... I know what'll cheer you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria's fat face lit up brightly, a look usually reserved for takeout night at home, \"Really Mami?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Si-</span></div></div>",

Her parents thought Gabriella was irresponsible and decided not to get her another pet after her Chihuahua \"ran away\" but Maria knew what really happened as she thought about the past and chuckled to herself as she proceeded to drink the rest of the melted ice cream. She then saw her mother start walking down the stairs. Gabriella was crying about her threat and her mother was trying to calm her down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maria stop scaring your sister and reminding her about her lost pets mija\" her mother said, \"BUT MAMI, I didn't lose them, FATASS over their ate them\" Gabriella  said while wiping her tears. \"Jovencita, go apologize to your sister now\" her mother shouted, \"but mooooooom\", \"ahora mismo Jovencita\" her mother shouted! <br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I called you a fatass Maria\" Gabriella said looking down, Maria then pulled her closer and whispered, \"Don't worry I won't eat family unless I'm really hungry and theirs an annoying brat around\" she said as she made a toothy grin and stuck out her tongue, \"MOMMMMMMMMMMMMM\", \"Calm down mija, I need to tell Maria something, please be quiet.\" he mother said running out of patience. Gabriella then ran up to her room angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just talked to your uncle, he's busy right now but he said you could practice with one of his employees from the catering company. He said that they were just wrapping up a large banquet dinner and his employee Julio could teach you to drive, the dinner was in the neighborhood so he'll be here soon, get ready mi angelita, you're going to learn how to drive today\" she said with a big smile on her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, I'm finally going to learn how to drive\" Maria said with a look of excitement on her face, \"can you bring me a dozen empanadas so I won't get hungry during the drive and can concentrate\" She added trying to look as serious as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I want you to be concentrated on the road not su vientre\" her mother replied bringing her the dozen empanadas which Maria began chowing down on as soon as she placed them down. </span></div></div>",

Her mother went to open the door and saw that it was Julio the man Abran sent since he was busy. \"Hola Julio, entrar, entrar, Tienes sed\" he mother said ushering him into the house, \"No, Gracias\" Julio said politely turning down the drink, \"D\u00f3nde est\u00e1 la ni\u00f1a\", \"I'm in the living room\" Maria shouted as she started heaving herself off the couch. She rocked back and forth until she finally got the momentum to get herself off, \"I'm ready to go when you are\" she said as she saw Julio and her mom walk in. \"Esa chica es enorme\" Julio thought to himself before he leaned in to get her a kiss on the cheek, \"Hola, mi llamo Julio, tu debe ser Mar\u00eda\", \"Si, nice to meet you Julio\" Maria said but secretly wished it was a younger cute boy.<br>\r\n\"Are you the person Abran sent to teach me how to drive?\" Maria asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes I am, are you ready to practice\" Julio said with a bit of accent but otherwise spoke good English. \"Si, I'm ready to go\" Maria said as she started wobbling outside through the double wide doors that her parents installed for their growing daughter. Outside she saw a huge white van that seemed more like a moving truck compared to a van with the letters Abran's Catering on them. Her mother looked outside worriedly standing next to Maria and Julio, she said to Julio, \"Est\u00e1 seguro de que es seguro?\", \"Yes it is very good to learn how to drive in a large van, other cars will avoid you because your vehicle is so large and judging from your growing daughter she'll need a muy grande de coche haha\", \"Ya mom\" Maria added, \"I'll be okay don't worry, let's go so I can get home before dinner\" She said as she waddled over to massive van and her mother went inside feeling reassured. Julio couldn't help but stare at the massive girl, her hips were so wide it seemed as if her parents would need to be getting larger doors for their house, and her body was massive. If she wasn't 16 she would be the type of girl Julio usually goes for, but he had to get those dirty thoughts out of his mind. <br>\r\n\"So, do you know anything about driving?\" he said to Maria as they walked over to the Van and opened it. \"Ya, mi Papi taught me how to drive in his junker of a truck but I've grown a bit since then\" she said laughing and shaking her gut for emphasise her mass, \"this chica is muy gorda\" she said trying to make a joke. Julio laughed and said, \"You're a growing girl, it's only natural, so I just need to be here for moral support ya? You know about the mirrors and changing from Park to Drive and all that?\" he said as he got in the car, he looked at Maria as she struggled a bit to pull herself in the van, \"Do you need help\" he said, \"no, no' Maria responded as she got herself completely in. The van had one front seat row and the entire back of it was used for catering. As they both got into the front seat Julio could feel Maria's leg touching him, \"Wow he thought, what a massive girl, if only she was 18\" he thought to himself trying to hide any dirty thoughts from crossing his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Maria got in the car, a heavenly smell came in, she looked back and her mouth dropped open and hey eyes opened wide, the van was completely filled with food! \"Why is their food in here Julio\" she said while some drool fell into her cleavage, \"Wow she really loves food he thought to himself\" as he looked at her and saw hey eyes, \"We had a banquet today designed to feed 200 people but only 50 showed up and those people didn't really eat themselves, we usually take the smaller van to pick up the items after a catering event, but we had so much left over food we needed to get the van you're driving in now\" he said smiling. \"Oh. MY. GOD\" Maria thought to herself as she crossed herself and thanked the lord for this opportunity, \"what are you going to do with all this wonderful food??\" she asked looking manic. \"the employees take some and then we throw it all away.\" he said. Maria's eyes opened wide, she covered her mouth, \"you mean all this food will be thrown away?\" she said curiously. \"Ya, I suppose\" Julio responded. \"I can't let that happen Maria thought to herself, \"Could I possibly... eat some of the leftover food\" Maria asked curiously. Julio's eyes widened as he thought to himself, \"Oh my god this is a fantasy, but she's 15, but she is the boss's sobrina, what should I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She crossed herself thanking god and then proceeded to grab one of the boxes at the top. She stood outside the van because their was no room in the back but she knew she would eat her way into the van. She totally forgot about the drive or Julio or anything really, her mind was focused on one thing... FOOD. She grabbed the top box which was filled with rolls and proceeded to chow down throwing 4-5 whole rolls in her mouth before swallowing. Julio saw her enthusiasm and went inside to get her 4 chairs, \"wow her hips are wide, her ass takes up 4 whole chairs.\" he said as he brought them out for her. \"Hey Maria, I brought you some chairs\" He said while setting the chairs down behind her, but she didn't acknowledge him, in the 5 minute time period it took him to get the chairs and bring them outside Maria had already demolished the top row of food in the van and was working her way down trying to eat her way inside of the van. \"MARIA\" he shouted getting her attention while she was holding a container filled with beans that could feed a full family of 8 for a full day, \"venir aqu\u00ed y pon tu culo gordo hacia abajo, I'll bring out some boxes and stack them around you and you can eat while I go and relax inside, it's too hot for me to be out here\" Julio said as Maria shook her head and sat down while she was slurping beans directly from the container. Julio proceeded to make a mini food fort completely surrounding her as he stood their and watched in awe as Maria finished the beans in less than 2 minutes. He didn't know a human mouth could open that wide and swore it was if she was a snake, as he placed the food around her he looked in amazement at the amount of food one girl could eat in a 10 minute period. She finished the equivalent of what would be catered for a small party or gathering. He shook his head in amazement as he swore he could see her visibly growing wider and bigger before heading inside to talk to his co-workers about what was happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was in heaven, and now that Julio was inside she could really start eating. Their were boxes completely surrounding her and within her reach so she wouldn't need to get up until all the containers were finished and by then she could fit in the back of the van to get the rest of them. They were going to throw it away and she didn't need to share any of the food with her family so it was all hers. She has never been full in her life and that's with her gluttonous lifestyle. But today with no limits she was going to eat until there wasn't any food left, the food talked to her and said they wanted to be inside her and she was all too willing to oblige in those demands. With Julio gone she could really stretch her mouth, she proceeded to pick up a whole roast chicken and stuff it inside her and swallow, throwing the container to the ground. She reached for all the containers and would then dump whatever was in them inside her massive opened maw. Beans, Rice, Chickens, Dinner Rolls, Vegetables, Cakes, it didn't matter it all went down her throat the same. While she was holding the last container over her mouth her massive weight crushed the 4 chairs she was sitting on and caused her to drop the whole container in her mouth forcing her to swallow it whole. The plastic tasted nasty, but she felt incredibly sexy with all her new blubber, her ass was now wider than the van and her Belly stood out 5 feet in front of her, her ass stood out another 3 feet making her look truly massive. Her boobs looked tiny by comparison but she knew as soon as she digested her breast would be enormous as well. If she wasn't the biggest girl in her neighborhood, she definitely was now. But that was the last thing on her mind, she wanted to finish the food that was in the van. She slowly heaved herself up off the ground and waddled towards the open back part of the van. Despite being incredibly lazy she was very strong from carrying around 500 pounds with her and had good mobility for someone her size. She managed to get her upper body in but she couldn't squeeze her Massive 115 inch wide hips into the van. \"Oh well, I can still reach all the food so I don't need to get my curvaceous hips in\" she thought smiling to herself as she started reaching for more food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Julio was talking with his co-workers, \"Wow cancelled at the last minute an order for 1000 people, that's A LOT of money to lose\" Julio said to his coworker, \"Well that's there loss\" he responded, \"All the food here was meant for that order and besides your banquet that only had 50 people we had a ton of leftovers to throw away today. I already have enough food to feed my family for a month, you should take some, it's all going to be thrown away anyway.\" Wow Julio thought to himself, \"That's a damn shame, I wonder how Maria is doing, she must be full by now\", he then said to his coworker, \"Why are you the only person working, there should be at least 20-30 people here right now\" His coworker responded with, \"He doesn't want anyone to get overtime and I only have 20 hours, everyone else had almost 40 already so I'm just taking a break before I unload all the trucks and take ALL this food out to the dumpster\" He said emphasizing how much food their was by pointing at everything. \"This is literally a ton of food, literally man, and it's all going to waste, it was supposed to feed over 1000 people, we spent 24 hours preparing this and it all goes to waste, and that's not including the probably couple 100 pounds of food in the catering vans from past orders that I still haven't thrown out, it's a good thing those vans are refrigerated or all that food would of went bad by now\" he said to Julio bitching and angrily, \"My favorite niece is having her Quincea\u00f1era and I can't go\" Julio then said, \"We had over 400 pounds of food and a 100 pound hog in the back of our van that we have to throw away, it's a damn shame it's all going to the dumpster, and sorry about the Quincea\u00f1era.\" Julio then thought to himself, \"I wonder how Maria is doing, I better go check on her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack outside the van was literally starting to lean towards Maria because of her massive weight. She was more wedged in than ever before as she stuffed a whole turkey into her mouth. She tested her swallowing abilities on her sister's pets at 1st but due to their small size she eventually moved on to neighborhood dogs and cats. She even managed to swallow a midsize dog that weighed at least 50 pounds, that unfortunately wondered to close to her house and then disappeared forever. There was a reason their weren't pets in her neighborhood she thought to herself as she chuckled and threw the full size turkey in her open mouth. She easily swallowed it which caused the truck to lean towards her just enough to cause the last container to move close enough for her to drag. She opened the container and her eyes opened wide, it was a fully roasted hog in that container. She wish she wasn't stuck in the van but was ecstatic to get the chance to swallow a whole hog. She reached for it with her chubby arms as her now completely wedged belly didn't allow for much flexibility. she slowly dragged the pig towards her open mouth as she salivated. The pig was too heavy to pick up so she had to drag it, but soon it would meet the fate of the rest of the food in her. She closed her eyes and moaned in ecstasy as she wrapped her lips around the pigs head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Julio went outside 30 minutes later he was amazed. There was a Fat Maria wedged in the back of the van that was tipping over to the back due to her massive weight. Her Ass was massive, her thighs were almost as big as Redwood tree trunks, he body was completely wedged in the truck with no room for him to even peak his head. He heard her make sounds of orgasm as he shook his head and wished she was 18. He went into the front seat just as Maria finished swallowing the pig whole. His eyes went huge, in 30 minutes she finished 500 pounds of food, \"No way\" he said out loud, \"You ate all this?\", \"Yup\", Maria replied with a smile on her face. Then Julio got an idea, \"Could you eat any more?\", \"You means there more!\" Maria said smiling. I think I may have an idea Julio thought to himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack outside Maria was getting close to f </span></div></div>",

Maria's eyes opened wide with excitement, \" M\u00e1s comida, there's more food? I LOVE being huge, I love forcing my sister to squeeze between my fat to sit on the couch, I love mi momma bringing me everything and anything I want, and I especially love my Masiva, enorme culo, it wasn't you that got me fat, I was taking up the whole couch earlier today before we went on the driving lesson\" Maria said filled with enthusiasm, \"Hurry get my fat ass out of here, and get some more food in my mouth\" Maria said pointing at her mouth for emphasis. \"Okay, Okay, let me make a quick phone call and we're good\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulio pulled out his cell phone and made a call, \"hola Juan \u00bfquieres salir del trabajo? Voy a cubrir el resto de su turno para que pueda ir a su sobrina qu Quincea\u00f1era. No problemo, chow\" and Julio hung up. \"There's a lot of food left in other trucks and the warehouse, you have an all you can eat buffet just waiting for you as soon as we figure out how to get your Ass unstuck, contact tu mama and come up with an excuse for why you won't be home soon okay, I just got the only other employee besides me working to go home, so it's just you and all the leftover food\" Julio said to Maria with a grin on his face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria immediately reached into her cleavage and pulled out her phone, she texted her best friend Lupe who was also fat and knew about Maria's goal to truly stuff herself, <br>\r\nHey Lupe you remember that fantasy about me eating everything I told you about, well I have a chance to do that, my ass is already stuck in a van LOL, I'll send a pic in a sec. Can you tell my mom I was dropped off at your place, I'll love you forever bitch XXOO, and she sent the message. \"Hey Julio, go to the back of the Van and take a picture of my fat ass for my friend Lupe, she'll be SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO jealous, once you send it I'll call my mom\" Julio began to blush and meekly agreed to do it, he went to the back of the Van and managed to get her whole ass in the frame, once he took the picture, he sent Lupe the text with the caption, \"Does this Van make Ass look fat lol\". Once he went back to the front he showed Maria and she laughed, \"Good one Julio, figure out how we're going to get my ass unstuck while I call my mom\" And with that Maria started calling her mom and Julio went to the back of the Van<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulio started by pulling on her massive cankles, she felt her shift around and it seemed like he almost pulled her out but he didn't have quite enough strength. If he could just get a little more leverage he would be able to get her out without using extreme measures like getting his car to pull her out. He walked back to the front of the Van to ask Maria a question, \"Sigh, do the boss a favor, get on his good side... damn 16 year old, stupid American laws\" He thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I love you too, Adios, bye\" Maria said to her mother as Julio walked up to the front. \"I'm good, mom thinks I'm spending the night at Lupe's, did you figure out how to get me out yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well about that, you see--\" \"Wait Lupe just replied, haha she's so jealous, she wished it was her ass stuck there, if there's another truck like this filled with food I'm going to get SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO fat and then she'll REALLY be jealous\" she said out loud to Julio smiling, I love that bitch, but I can finally break away from her, I've always been the biggest, but she's been right behind me the whole time, but what were you saying Julio?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I think I can pull you out without using extreme measures, but I would have to... get in between your thighs so I can use the bumper as leverage to pull you out.... If you don't want to I can think of something else, I unders--\" \"Okay do it, I'm wasting away here, if you help me get fatter I'll let you in between my thighs any time you want\" Maria said winking at Julio causing him to blush. \"You're my boss's niece, no.. I mean when you're 18, I mean you're my bosses niece, fuck it I'm going to go pull your fat ass out, see you on the outside\" he said blushing while walking back to the back of the Van. \"If only he were younger, he seems like a nice guy, he's probably married anyway, I'm about to get so fat\" Maria thought to herself as Julio walked away<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Julio, you can do this\" Julio said to himself as he walked in between her soft thighs. \"Oh god I'm in between a 16 year old thighs, why, why god, and it's getting tighter and squishier\" he said out loud to himself. He was completely surrounded by Maria but finally found the bumper, he lifted up some fat that was blocking the bumper and put his legs on it for leverage. \"Maria, when I say push, you start trying to push yourself out okay!\" he got a good grip on Maria's thigh and shouted PUSH. After a couple of pushes Maria was finally wedged free but not before falling on top of Julio<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSMASH, Crash, as the van's front 2 tires went back to being on the ground and Maria's 500 pound self filled with 500 more pounds of food landed Julio. Maria's Face Landed near his crotch and Julio's head landed in between her thighs as he lost his breath due to the 1000 pounds falling on him. His screams for help were muffled under Maria's fat legs, she finally rolled off of him giving him room to breath, \"Hey big boy, you enjoy the show, now where should we go to eat\" Maria said <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulio was gasping for air, \"GASP, okay, okay there are 2 vans that have left over food that I'm suppose to throw away outside here\" he said as he pointed to the 2 vans located closest to the dumpster, \"And then a banquet that was supposed to house 1000 people therefore feed 1000 people was cancelled and all the food for that is inside\" Julio said, \"It's up to you to decide\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmmmm Maria thought, \"Do I want the banquet or the vans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How can you move so well, you have to be at least half a ton now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, my dad was a power lifter before he got injured, and my mom was almost an Olympic weightlifter but got injured and couldn't go, strength runs in my family, which is good if you're going to be a curvy girl like me\" Maria said sticking her tongue out at Julio and shaking her whole body for emphasis. \" I may be a big girl but I can still twerk with the best of them\" she winked at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No twerking, let me lead the way actually, why am I behind you?\" Julio said walking past a waddling Maria. \"I love seeing him freaking out over how sexy I am ha, imagine how good I'll look in 2 years when I have even more time to add meat to this luscious frame\" Maria thought to herself as she followed Julio into the massive catering company. She was starting to sweat a lot, and huffing and puffing the whole way there but when she finally waddled into the room they were keeping the banquet food her jaw dropped straight to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all for me? All for me only, OH MY GOD JULIO I LOVE YOU\" Maria shouted as she pulled Julio towards him and kissed him on the lips<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I DIDN'T DO THAT, I didn't do it, you're 16, I'm old, I didn't do that\" Julio said panicking, \"Calm down Julio, it's time to get down to business I know you saw my little secret and there's so much food here I'm feeling lazy\" Maria said, before he could respond Maria began speaking again, \"My MASSIVE, GINOURMOUS, OBESE, BBW/SSBBW, whatever the fuck you want to call it Ass, just walked for 20 minutes, up a flight of stairs, I don't want to do physical activity and since I don't have to  hide my secret from you, I'm going to let you feed me\" Maria said with a smile on her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Secret? You mean the fact that you want to be huge?\" Julio said confused, \"Wait you didn't see me swallow that hog whole?\" Maria said immediately covering her mouth \"Um no...\" Julio said, \"That's not possible\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, fuck it the secret is out now, so you're going to feed me, look\" Maria then opened her mouth extremely wide and stuffed a watermelon that was nearby in and swallowed it whole. Julio immediately got an erection he couldn't contain but tried to hide, \"Oh my god\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG my ass, I ain't getting fatter by standing here, I'm going to sit my fat ass down here close to the food, you bring the food before I make you food, do we understand each other\" Maria said threateningly licking her lips while staring at Julio. \"... okay okay, I'll feed you\" Julio then ran off grabbing the nearest tray which happened to be Rice and poured it into Maria's open maw. \"Hmmmm, it's so cute messing with Julio, I've never eaten a human before thought, I wonder what's that like, Julio's nice and I am feeling extra lazy... should I actually eat see if I can eat him or just have him feed me this massive buffet\" Maria thought to herself before opening her mouth to accept another tray from Julio. \"Hey Julio how much food do you think this is\" Maria asked inquisitively, Julio quickly replied running back with a tray of cut Ham and dumping it in her mouth, \"Probably about 3000-3500 pounds give or take\" Julio said before running back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"3000 pounds that would definitely fill me up I think, but now that I joked around with him about eating him, I wonder what it'd be like to eat a human, what should I do\" Maria thought to herself as she accepted another tray filled with Ham and swallowed</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If Maria was paying attention she most definitely would have went with the banquet that was meant to feed over a thousand people. Instead while Julio was talking a puddle of drool was forming between her cleavage as she looked at the 2 loaded vans by the dumpster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Julio was explaining a wind picked up and blew the leftover van food smell towards the growing teen causing her greed to overwhelm her senses and more importantly logic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria barely responded as she started speed waddling towards the vans, \u201cthe vans, I want to finish them off.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulio stared at the massive teen moving at an incomprehensible speed, he actually had to do a light jog to keep up and she was already at the back door of the van trying to open the still locked door as he squeezed between her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u201dMove back so I can open the door gordita\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria stepped her bulk back slightly so Julio could fully open the doors. To her disappointment the Van was mostly full but not as full as the van she was driving. Still between 100-200 pounds of leftovers. Julio didn\u2019t bother with chairs this time not that Maria would have noticed, she plopped herself onto her belly as close to the van as possible and told Julio to slide the remaining food within arm reach of the enormous girl. He quickly did as he was told and by the time everything was within reaching distance she had already tore open a container filled with queso and was gulping it down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the van cramped the older employee accidentally stepped into the queso with his right leg and he tried to get out of the van. His foot was stuck as Maria sucked up the queso so focused on her feasting the failed to realize Julio\u2019s foot was stuffed into her mouth and she was slowly swallowing the older mans calf. Julio in a panicked state managed to slip off his shoe as it entered the black hole that was Maria and pulled his leg out of the greedy latinas mouth just in time to not join the queso into her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe crossed himself terrified and praised the lord as he quickly got out and around Maria being forced to step on her fat as he left the back of the 1st van. Maria either didn\u2019t notice or was too engrossed in her feasting to feel Julio literally walk on her to get out of the van. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Julio minus his right shoe safely out of the van he took in the monstrosity that was Maria. Her Belly was literally wedged underneath the bumper of the van and was firmly on the ground as it was stuck underneath the vehicle by a a few feet. Her head was half way up between the top of the van and the bottom as her gut forced her upwards. She was at this point literally taller laying on her belly than she was standing up.  Before it was her hips but now her belly was wider than the back of the van as Maria grew larger and the food pile grew smaller at an alarming rate. Her ass literally towered over the top of the van her belly was so stuffed and growing and she wasn\u2019t slowing down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulio wanted to enjoy the show as a proud FA but he knew Maria would be done soon and cursed his perverted thoughts as he realized Maria was just a teenager as he moved along to the 2nd van to open the back and start unloading. As he unloaded he texted Juan his coworker and told him to bring the truck he loaded to with food too throw out and then clock out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Maria\u2019s 1st van\u2019s stock was rapidly depleting. She realized despite the gross plastic and metallic taste it was much faster to just swallow the containers whole so that\u2019s exactly what she was doing. Who cares what\u2019s inside as long as it\u2019s food she thought as the containers disappeared and Maria belly encroached on more and more of the inside of the van. By the time she was done Julio was done unloading the 2nd van and Juan had parked the 3rd van. She put her arms on both sides of the van as she rocked back and forth rocking the van with her as she pushed her way back on her backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwe thanks Julio\u201d she said winking and blowing him a kiss causing the older fat admirer to blush as he got to work on the 3rd full truck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only had he unloaded the 2nd van he put everything within reaching distance. This go around Maria decided because now Julio could see her but more importantly metal and plastic are disgusting: she ate the leftovers without finishing the containers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe visibly grew, her fat wobbling, her bra snapping, her shirt doing nothing to cover the gargantuan belly as her sleeves ripped to let her waist sized upper arms burst through. Along with her size growing more rapidly her eating was becoming more efficient as the 2nd pile disappeared faster despite her having more constraint when it came to finishing food (and containers). This vans contents finished faster than the 1st now that she didn\u2019t have to reach inside a van and had an open space to fill her all consuming belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Julio watched in awe as he finished unloading the 3rd truck just in time to see Maria slurp down the last container filled with spaghetti. And toss it behind her with a loud metal *clank*.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Julio who stared wide eyed trying to hide his erection and grinned to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey big boy\u201d she said staring him up and down with a mischievous grin, \u201cI\u2019m gonna open wide and I want you to unload everything in me\u201d she said provocatively. Julio looked around nervously as he caught the double meaning behind her words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth then opened wide and he could clearly see her esophagus as she just pointed a finger towards her mouth and said feed me. He quickly obliged stuffing everything into her mouth, pouring whatever random product was placed in the van directly into her mouth as she swallowed and begged for more. Soon enough an immense Maria and a very tired Julio sat in the parking lot as she swallowed the last container filled with flan and let lose a massive burp very satisfied with herself as she grinned and rubbed the part of her belly she could touch. Even fitting in the back of the van would be a struggle for the 500+ pound teen filled with 1000+ plus pounds of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulio exhausted just asked \u201cwhat\u2019s next\u201d as Maria made a toothy grin as her phone vibrated and she whipped it out of her pocket. <br>\r\n       </span></div></div>",

Maria was starting to wonder to herself what the special occasion was until she was brought back to reality with an annoying screech<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But MAMI, Maria is just going to get fatter and won't be able to move, Ella ya es muy gorda\" her little sister Gabriella said to her mother, \"Did you hear her stomach, it sounded like theirs a gran monstruo in their\" she wined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because I ate the monster under your bed thank you very much\" Maria shouted as she remembered the ice cream behind her neck and moved her head so the ice cream would fall next to her on the couch, \"You'll be next if you don't shut your mouth\" she said as she made biting motions towards her little sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MAMI\" Gabriella screamed as she ran towards her mother and clung on to her apron, \"Gabriella is saying she's going to eat me, you heard her! Stop feeding her she's a fat monster\" she said as she held on even tighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Callate, the both of you\" she said as she got Gabriella to let go so she could pull even more empanadas out of the over. \"Maria apologize immediately for saying you're going to eat your sister and Gabriella apologize for calling your sister a monster... INMEDIATAMENTE!\"- she screamed as both of the sisters didn't want to budge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" Maria said as she grabbed the ice cream off of the couch and pulled a spoon from her massive cleavage, \" I'm sorry runt, I'm not going to eat you... yet\" she winked as she stared at her sister and stuck her tongue out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MAMI\" Gabriella screamed, \"CALLATE, I'm cooking and your father will be hear any minute, go set the dinner table\" Florencia said as she prepared and added the finishing touches on some other dishes. Gabriella just mumbled to herself and accepted defeat as she went to set the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria looked on with a smile as she started eating her ice cream to calm her rumbling stomach until her dinner and take out was prepared. She scooped the ice cream into her mouth as if she hadn't eaten for days, she was excited imagining all the food she was about to put into her massive belly. While most women her size would have double or even triple bellies Maria's stomach was just one massive honey colored dome of a belly. Her breast were in the HHH range, but that was last time she was sized 5 months ago and her bras were already starting to get tight and she was so wide that she nearly touched both ends of the love seat sofa that was meant to fit 3 normal sized people. Her ass stuck out behind her like 2 beach balls were put into her leggings and she would of been pear shaped like her mother if it wasn't for her massive belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maria started day dreaming about the massive feast she was about to have, her stomach started rumbling again. Damn, the ice cream wasn't enough, I hope Papi comes home soon so I can eat Maria thought to herself, and on cue her father came in with 4 large bags of Juan's Take Out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father set the bags down on the dining room table and gave his wife a kiss and then picked up Gabriella and gave her a kiss before turning his attention to Maria who was still seated on the couch. He walked over to Maria, \"mi peque\u00f1a princesa\", he said as he gave his older fatter daughter a kiss on her chubby cheek. \"How was my baby girl day\" he asked seeming oblivious to the fact that his daughter was a spoiled 500+ pound woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was tough\" Maria said, \"Gabriella called me a monster and I didn't get anyone to show me how to drive and now I'm so hungry, I feel like I'm wasting away\" she said while giving her father the puppy dog eyes she knew would get him to give her whatever she wants<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"QUE ESTO, Gabriella did you call your sister a monster? You aren't getting any dessert mija,  not until you learn your lesson\" He said turning his eyes to Gabriella <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Papi, Maria said she was going to eat me, I swear!\" Gabriella replied devastated that she wasn't going to get dessert, \"It's not fair, maria ya es un culo gorda\" She said in anger<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria just looked on and smiled as she saw her little sister dig herself even deeper into the already deep hole she was in.<br>\r\n\"WHAT DID YOU SAY, that's it no dessert OR empanadas, and que est\u00e1 recibiendo una paliza\" he said with anger in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No papi, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it\" Gabriella said but it was too late, her father just pointed at her and she came too him. He then took his belt off, bent her over her knee and spanked her 3 times with his belt. \"I'm sorry mija, I didn't want to do this but you have to be respectful of your family, now go to the dinner table while I get the rest of the food from my car\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 2 trips back to the car their was a total of 12 bags of Juan's takeout and a kitchen filled to the brim with Maria's favorite foods. It looked like there was more food here than at her quinceanera. She smiled as she thought about how much food she was about to eat. Maria slowly rose from the couch and made her way too the dinner table where she sat on her double wide enforced chair next to Gabriella who was giving her the evil eye. As soon as the family finished giving grace Maria was off to the races. While Maria was stuffing her face with anything and everything that was within her reach her father started to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're 15 now and we wanted to give you what would make you happiest before we told you the news\" He said while looking at his wife Florencia.<br>\r\nOh shit, I knew it was too good to be true, there had to be a catch, Maria thought as she finished the last of her 1st dozen empanadas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're 15 now Maria, that means\"</span></div></div>",

Before she ran up as she passed her sister who was giving her the evil eye she whispered, \" Love you gorda, have fun with your job fatass\" and quickly ran as Maria reached to try to grab her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a growing girl angelita, you're only going to get bigger, you're only 15 mija, you have to look for a job\" her mother said. \"Tu mama es correct, we had a long talk and decided you need to learn the value of a dollar, at your quincea\u00f1era you ate over $500 worth of food that was suppose to feed all the guest, we had to get more food to keep the party supplied and even then you kept eating\" her father reluctantly said with a sad look on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But papi, I'm a growing girl, I need to eat! and it was MY Quincea\u00f1era, I can do whatever I want, I'm a woman now, if I want to eat I will!! And there's nothing you or mom can do about it\" Maria said as she stuffed a tamale in her mouth whole and reached for more food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not saying that angelita\" her mother replied as her daughter kept reaching for more food, \"we want you to eat and be happy and healthy, you will always be mi princesita, and tu mami's angelita but you're a woman now and you have to get a job\" he said as he looked at his daughter start chugging on a gallon of Horchata. \"And look sweetie\" her mother said in a quiet tone, \"me and your papi have decided if you can keep a job for 6 months we will buy you your own van that you can use to drive, doesn't that make you happy baby?\"<br>\r\n\"NO! she said as she started eating directly from the pot of refried beans, after depleting some tortillas, \"I'm a princess, I shouldn't have to work, I WANT MY CAR NOW, if you wanted me happy you wouldn't make me get a stupid job\" she said right before stuffing spoonful after spoonful of beans in her mouth \"Where will I even work? I don't know any where to apply\" she said in between mouthfuls<br>\r\n\"Don't worry sweetie, you'll get your car after you work, and me and your mother have leads, me and your mom both know people who work and own restaurants and bakeries across the city, it'll be easy getting you a job sweetie\" her father said as Maria kept eating and glaring at her parents. \"We got you este comida y bebida so you would take the news better because we know you love eating, there's more food in the kitchen too angelita\" her mother chimed in. <br>\r\nMaria set the pot to the side after finishing the pot of refried beans in only 5 minutes that would normally feed the family and started reaching for more empanadas and tamales. She was fuming on the inside and wanted to punish her parents in the only way she knew how, \"Do you really want to make me happy\" she said looking at her parents after setting the full plate of a dozen empanadas and dozen tamales in front of her. <br>\r\n\"of course mija\" her father said, \"anything to make mi anjelita happy\" her mother replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THEN GET OUT AND LET ME EAT EVERTHING, I hate both of you for torturing me like this\" she said while stuffing a whole tamale and empanada in her mouth. <br>\r\n\"That's no way to--\" her mother started saying before her father grabbed her and started whispering to her, \"She's angry, she doesn't mean it, we should let her go\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\", she whispered back, \"I've been slaving all day in the kitchen and you spent over $100 on Juan's, she shouldn't speak to us like that\"<br>\r\n\"We need to give her space, our mija is growing and becoming a woman, let's leave her too eat and watch a novella en la sala\" he said as they both looked at their daughter who was stuffing whole empanadas and tamales in her mouth and reaching for more. \"Okay\" Florencia whispered back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll leave you to eat princess, your mother will take you too look for a job tomorrow, is there anything you want before we go to our room and leave you?\" her father said. \"Yeah\" Maria replied with a mouthful of food, bring the carne asada, flautas, and barbacoa to the table, and you said this food was for me so leave your plates, I'll eat whatever you didn't eat\" she said just as she brought the last tamale to her mouth and stuffed it in her mouth whole. Before reaching for a pot of rice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay sweetie, eat to your hearts content, we'll find you a job tomorrow\" and with that both of Maria's parents as they went to the kitchen and took some of the empty plates away and set down more food. They then walked upstairs and made there way to the bedroom. \"our little girl is becoming a woman\" her father said to Florencia, \"I know, she's becoming more and more of a woman each and every day\" she replied and with that they were in their bedrooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was still furious and eating food in record time. She finished the pot of rice in only 5 minutes, started stuffing multiple tortillas in her mouth and went through a plate in less than 2 minutes. She was angry and when she's angry she likes to eat. As she worked her way through more and more of the food on the table her shirt started to cover less and less of her massive apron of a belly. She reached for the pitcher of horchata in the middle of the table and chugged it down in less than a minute. She stopped using utensils and got up from her chair and made her way around the dinner table stuffing everything and everything in her mouth. Flautas, Sour Cream, Salsa, Rice, Barbacoa, Enchildas, it didn't matter what it was or how big of a mess it made, if it was edible it was going in her belly. After eating everything on the table, she took her chair and made her way too the kitchen where 9 bags of Juan's was sitting on one of the counters and her mothers cooking was everywhere else. Some would say what happened was impossible, but never underestimate a hungry Maria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued on going through bag after bag of Juan's only taking breaks to chug soda or burp. She went through all 9 bags in about an hour and a half whenever she saw her mother appear downstairs with Gabriella. They looked on as Maria swallowed the crumbs of some chips that were in the last bag. <br>\r\nHer sister stood there wide-eyed at the vision of Gluttony that was Maria. Maria's shirt didn't cover any of her belly anymore and looked more like a make-shift bra, her bra snapped about 20 minutes ago, and even her leggings looked tighter than they did before she started her angry feast. <br>\r\n\"Maria angelita, is everything okay\" her mother said and Maria immediately replied, \"GET OUT, I'M EATING, THIS FOOD IS FOR ME AND ME ONLY\" she shouted as her mother had a shocked look on her face. Maria then saw Gabriella reach for a small piece of flan that was sitting on the counter by where the Juan's bag used to be before they found their new home in Maria's growing belly. Maria with lighting fast reflexes you wouldn't expect from a women her size slapped Gabriella's hand and shouted, \"And if you touch any of my food, you'll become food too you little runt\" which caused Gabriella to run behind her mother for support as tears started swelling up in her eyes. <br>\r\n\"See mom, Maria want's to eat me\" she said to her mother, \"Don't worry sweetie, she's just angry because of the bad news, she won't eat you, now let's take you to your amigas house for the sleepover\" and with that her mom and Gabriella were away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was still fuming and even though full a long time ago made it her mission to eat everything and anything she saw. Burritos went down in 2 bites, soups were chugged, even the bones on the whole roasted chicken wouldn't be spared as Maria was too lazy to pick the meat off and just ate the pieces whole bone and all. Maria was still angry at the prospect of the job and even when she ate all the food her mother spent all day cooking she decided to empty the pantries and fridge as well. By the time everything was done 5 hours had passed and on the kitchen floor say a full and satisfied Maria who had long ripped her shirt completely off as well as tear her leggings, her double enforced chair had been destroyed by the even more massive woman and Maria lay on the floor half-naked with a bean bag sized belly resting between her now larger legs. With all the food in the hous in her, she thought. I guess I'll be getting a car out of this, and I got a feast in that was more food than I ate at my Quincea\u00f1era. Time to go sleep in my room. </span></div></div>",

The nearly completely naked teen had managed to bring her beanbag belly and all to her room which was thankfully downstairs but got stuck in the doorframe. No matter how much she pushed and pulled she couldn't get her overstuffed body into her already widened bedroom frame. So she did what every good Daddy's girl would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa!! Help!\" She screamed with a smirk on her face knowing her father would come down to see his little princess only in underwear stuck in a doorframe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Un momento my pequena\" he shouted as he ran down the stairs and looked in disgust at his over sized daughter who was only in her underwear stuck in the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dios mio\" he said as he crossed himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Papa, I'm stuck I need a push!\" Maria said putting on the most innocent voice she could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dad just looked at her and reluctantly sighed. He got behind his over grown daughter and after a few shoves and his shoulder sinking deeper into his little gorditas near naked buttom she got through the splintering doorframe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gracias Papa\" Maria said as she noticed her little sisters rabbit hopping around on her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry mija, I'll fix your door tomorrow and make sure it's even wider so this will never happen again!\" He said not only for her but for him so he's never have to sink into his own daughters culo again. And with Maria safely inside he shut the door behind her and went back upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit was hopping around while Maria lay on her overstuffed belly making a conscious decision to just sleep on her belly instead of her bed. But she wanted to punish he little sister for trying to eat her Flan so she also decided she was going to eat her pet rabbit. With lighting fast reflexes Maria snatched the rabbit by its ears as soon as it got within reach! Before swallowing she remembered she had her cell phone in her cleavage and decided to make a little video for her precious sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held the rabbit in one hand and started recording, \"you see all this belly, all this woman\" she said doing her best to get her whole body into the frame, \"this is all food in the house, but te gorda hermana is still hungry\" she then put her pet rabbit in the frame, \"in fact I'm never full and your bunny looks yummy so it's going on my belly too\" with that she swallowed the rabbit on camera and then got a close up of her wide open and empty mouth. She than began to rub her belly saying \"I'm still hungry, next time it's going to be you!\" With that she fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother just got home after finding a job for Maria at the Marquez family bakery. The Marquez family were good family friends and were mainly wholesellers so the bakery front didn't matter as much to them. They said Maria could start tomorrow morning! She was excited to tell Maria when she opened the door to her room and had her jaw drop. \"Dios mio\" she whispered under her breath while crossing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Necessitando comprara Ropa ahora\" she whispered to herself as she closed the door and left the house to get her new clothes before the stores close. I know she thinks if she got big enough she wouldn't have to work but she will be sadly mistaken her mother thought as she rushed out the door to get the biggest sizes possible. </span></div></div>",

So when Maria woke up not really hungry but trying to get out of work she screamed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mami, Papi, tienes hambre mucho!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father knowing his little princess too well and pampering his 1st daughter yelled back, \"don't worry mi gordita, yo preparo desayunar, 1st your mother will help dress you for work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh shit work Maria thought smiling, \"but I don't have any clothes that fit papi\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because you ate my rabbit you fatass!\" Screamed her little sister as she ran downstairs trying to show her parents the video Maria sent her last night. But Maria was smart and sent it on snapchat so when she tried to pull it up she couldn't get it open! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say such silly things mija just because you can't take care of your pets\" her father said scolding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother ignored the little sister as she walked into her fat daughters room to see her massive breast over flowing her bra and her ass eating up her brand new panties turning them into a g-string. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo compro ropa\" she said, \"let's see if they fit our little growing girl\" and with that the mother of the incredible lazy latina to Maria's surprise stretched a pair of black leggings completely over Maria's enlarged assets, she then handed Maria what looked like a bed sheet but was actually a top to go with the leggings. Everything fit to Maria and her mothers surprise. All of a sudden as they finished putting everything on her father screamed for mom<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help me finish breakfast, our working girl needs to eat before she works!\" And with that her mom left her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDammit Maria thought to herself as she used her incredible genetics to haul her fatvass into a standing position and head out her bedroom, she then thought to herself; I wonder if I can out eat these clothes with breakfast?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was snapped out of her thought when she found her enlarged frame stuck in the doorway again.<br>\r\n\"Mommm, Daaaad, I can't go to work I'm stuck again\" she screamed faking panic as her parents rushed to finish enough breakfast to feed a normal family plus relatives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father screamed. \" Gabrielle, go help your sister\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But dad\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW\" he screamed with more force as he shredding some cheese on top of 10 pounds of hash browns that were solely meant for his \"little\" princess'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria just had a devilish grin as Gabrielle pulled with all her might and for her work had a now 550-600 pound girl that was her sister completely surround her with fat. Maria just smiled as she engulfed her sister and then let out a sinister laugh as she thought of how she was going to mess with her hermana <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting herself off just enough for Gabrielle's eyes to be uncovered but mouth still stifled by her fat she whispered, \"and down you go, you ready for a kiss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerror were in the little sisters eyes as Maria with surprising ease completely inhaled her little sister up to her shoulders before her mom came into the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria quickly before her mom could notice released her sister and the mother only saw Maria getting off her sister and giving her a kiss on the forehead. Gabrielle just screamed \"mooooom\" who quickly shushed her and sent her to her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just finished breakfast honey, come eat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite not being hungry Maria sighed in disappointment, despite pounds of bacon, chorizo, eggs and potatoes she still complained it wasn't enough. Her parents rushed her and despite having what normal families would consider a thanksgiving dinner she finished her food in 10 minutes just in time to go out and catch her tio julios van outside waiting! Her parents walked her out and then shit the door, to their amazement the clothes actually fit but they knew they wouldn't fit for long so they got ready to go shopping... again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile walking to the van her uncle waived and told her to wait while he turned around the so they'd be facing the right way. While she was waiting for him to reverse a stray dog walked up to her to get let. She tried shooing it but then noticed her sister staring out the window upstairs and smiled. She picked the dog up by its scruff, stared right at her sister and swallowed the medium dog whole causing her sister to quickly run from the window just in time for her uncle to pull up non the wiser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got in the front seat her thigh overflowing the passenger front seat and completely covering one of her uncles thighes. Her belly nearly reached the window and the van started leaning heavily on the passenger side but her tio acted liked nothing was out of the norm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You excited for work\" he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, I'm just hungry, I didn't get to eat much\" she said with a smile as her uncle agreed and they left for Maria's 1st day on the \"job\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The factory was huge, dozens if not over 100 cars were parked in the parking lot. There was a bus that took employees from one part of the factory to the next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything looked and felt new but most amazing of all was the smell which instantly made her hungry again. Her uncle drove off cursing himself for feeding his \"little niece\" and made a mental note to have her dad pay him back. She walked to the front desk and saw 2 300 pound women manning the reception area. Maria looked around the clean room and saw pictures everywhere of the Marquez family everywhere, from humble beginnings in Mexico to the largest privately owned bakery in North America and she would be working there! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked up with confidence and announced herself to the receptionist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maria Santiago, I'm here to meet with Miguel Marquez\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionists just stated rudely as they called the CEO and to their surprise he told them to let her in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little Maria in haven't seen you since you were up to my knees now look at you, you're a woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was about to respond when her stomach let out a loud growl which for the 1st time ever in her life caused her to turn red and blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiguel just laughed, \"you're a growing woman, you need to eat tongrow big and strong and luckily for you I have plenty of food here for you\" he laughed as he shook Maria's massive belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to give you the tour but would you like to eat 1st?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria thought this over, it's pretty important to know where everything is so she could eventually figure out how to get food straight off the line, but she was hungry and Mr .

After 10 minutes of awkward small talk and loud belly rumbles they arrived at the defective product room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiguel pulled a key from the keychain attached to his belt and opened up the double doors to an enormous room. The room was way bigger than her home and stacked up to the top with tons of goodies. It was like a warehouse in a factory stacked full with goods they were going to throw away! Not that Maria would let that happen, if she could finish every piece of food in here she would!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery baked good imaginable from normal bread, tortillas, cookies, cakes, conchas and even naan was somewhere in this warehouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Miguel said they make everything here he really meant everything. Everything was organized based on if it were sweet or savory and too Maria's surprise there was even a refrigerated section that contained flan and other refrigerated desserts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyper-obese beyond ssbbw Latina drooled at the site completely forgetting about her feast from the night before or credit card maxing breakfast and walked into the room straight towards the white bread without waiting for permission or Mr. Marquez's explanation. She immediately tore into the white bread quickly finishing the 1st of a seemingly endless supply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you see these aren't bad, just not market quality, usually missing something that makes the markets not want them.\" Miguel said looking to see where Maria had gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around and too his surprise the bottom heavy teenager had apparently finished  2 loaves based on the wrappers on the ground and wasstarting a 3rd. 'Dios m\u00edo' was all he thought as he grabbed Maria's shoulder shocking the obese girl who frightened face was evident as Miguel saw her swallow a whole loaf in one go. Her whole body shamed and quivered as she quickly turned to face the owner and CEO of this amazing factory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maria, before you fill yourself we also make dips, jams and all sorts of stuff which is kept in this area so you don't have to eat everything plain. We also have plenty of drinks over here in this area when you get thirsty. Looking at you, you must have skipped breakfast, never skip a meal or you'll be starving and wasting away. Eat as much as you like and then you can text me when you're full and ready\" Miguel sympathetically said as he pointed out where the drinks and other items were kept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Full and ready ya right' thought the greedy teen, \"yes I have your number, I got it from m\u00ed papa, I'll text you when I've eaten enough! Thank you so much Miguel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry mija, and you're getting paid on the clock so don't think this will effect your hours. But I must be getting back, I'll see you soon mija\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Miguel left Maria walked down the aisle and swallowed a 10 pack of tortillas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I've hit the jack pot baby, mom thought she was so smart buying these new clothes well jokes on her I'm going to eat myself out of them, stupid bitch making me get a job. I'll eat her after my stupid little sister' she thought with a maniacal grin as she stuffed some conchas into her open maw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I adore that cute mini skirt. That would look absolutely divine with that top I just bought.\" Alexia said watching the models walk down the runway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as usual for the 520 pound beauty teen, she realized that she had finished off her milkshakes. Narrowing her eyes as she stared down into the emptied cups, an irritated grin formed on her thin face.  Alexia had become livid as she still hungered for food and fiercely loathed running out of food while watching tv especially a fashion show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vein on her forehead bulged as she shrieked out to her servant \"Liza!!! More food Now!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn walked in Liza a 21 year old woman with a long black ponytail who now weighs 240 pounds due to Alexia's insistence that she join her in snacks. Liza was a college student in need of income and came across Alexia's affluent family who offered her a job as a maid to their only  daughter with a very generous income. Without hesitation, Liza happily took the job, little did she know how demanding their daughter was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's some fast food I had delivered a few minutes ago Ms Alexia.\" Liza walked in pushing a cart, bearing several bags each filled to the brim with unhealthy fried foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh how exquisite.\" Alexia declared with a pleased demeanor quickly grabbing a bag. \"Please join me Liza, I could use some company.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the greasy foods from the bags and finding the odor somewhat overwhelming and void of an appetite, joining a glutton in a feast seemed unappealing to Liza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh um well I have other work to do Ms Alexia so I....\"Liza ceased her excuse as she saw the infuriated glare Alexia emitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I SAID join me!\" Alexia growled holding a burger up to Liza's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes ms Alexia\" replied an unenthusiastic Liza taking a bite of the burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis happened all the time, Alexia would desire companionship and insist someone join her and since she would constantly eat mounds of unhealthy foods, her 'friend' would end up joining her in a gluttonous meal. Liza experienced this first hand, starting the job as a 115 pound woman, Liza ended up more than doubling her weight to appease the ravenous teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Liza look at that dress! wouldn't it look splendid on me. Oh look at how the colors compliment each other. Oh isn't this delicious.\" Alexia said with mouthfuls of food and pointing at the tv with her flabby arm, visibly jiggling. </span></div></div>",

Not that they were health or fashion freaks- both had grown up in near starvation, and never acquired much of a normal appetite. Despite this, during the pregnancy, her mother suddenly couldn't eat enough. Food vanished down her seemingly endless stomach, only to be joined by impossible amounts more. But the strangest part is, she gained but 10 pounds during the pregnancy- only a few more than the child itself could explain. And the child wasn't even particularly large; in fact, she was on the small side, weighing only 6 and 1/2 pounds at birth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the birth, her mother lost her appetite and returned to normal eating habits. And so did Sharon, leaving no trace of her gluttonous beginnings. In high school however, Sharon decided it was time for a change. After eighth grade, she no longer wanted to follow the crowd- and she had the metabolism to defy them to an incredible degree. Over that summer, she gained over 100 pounds, and she wasn't satisfied with that. She didn't stop until reaching the weight of 500 pounds following the summer before her junior year, and at last she began to stop gaining. She settled at that weight because she still retained a remarkable degree of mobility up to that point, and didn't want to jeopardize it, as well as she no longer wanted to spend half of her free time eating- after all, this is high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe date is December 13th, a Monday. This is the last week before Christmas break, and barely a month after her seventeenth birthday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does her true story begin?</span></div></div>",

Not because of her phone's incessant vibrating, no doubt her ex boyfriend Frank, and not because of the starchy new sheets. It wasn't because the bed wasn't hers, and certainly not the low hum of the ceiling fan. It was her partner, Vivian Ratchford, that was keeping her up. Not because of the television that she <i>insisted</i> on keeping tuned to Comedy Central even as she slept, not because of her constant snoring or even her habit of hogging the blankets. No, something... different... had kept Stacy Gosnell up until the wee hours of the morning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes travelled over to the sleeping ball of fat beside her, lips curling in disgust as the dome rose and fell heavilly; God, she was disgusting. Being so fat, even declared morbidly obese at such a young age, had to be embarassing. Not for Vivian, Stacy didn't give two shits about this fat cunt. It had to be embarassing for her to be seen with such a cow! But she had to admit, licking this fatty's walls was much better than sharing an apartment with her jackoff ex-boyfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, the slender harlot slipped from underneath the covers to visit the facilities; upsetting the suprisingly light slumber of the heavyset hieffer. In a husky voice, Vivian declared, \"And just where do you think you're going?\" as she struggled to roll over onto her side. Stacy felt dinner crawl back up her throat as she watched Vivian's layers of fat squish against eachother in her attempt to face her, \"Oh nowhere, baby.\" Stacy stammered, \"Just- uh, going to the bathroom!\" But Stacy knew that was not the case; for this hulking ball of blubber had just laid out her battle cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian shook her head, patting beside her engorged mammaries, \"Oh, but I thought we could have another go.\" she said seductively, \"You know I love being on top.\" Unfortunately, Stacy knew all too well about Vivian's preference in regards to sexual position. She shivered slightly at the thought of being suffocated yet again by all that blubber. \"B-B-But Vivian, we just did it, like, eight hours ago!\" she whined as she flopped her arms to her side, \"I'm exhausted!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpecting a rational response from Vivian was like expecting lit dynamite to fire confetti; it didn't happen very often. \"Okay, fine.\" the bloated heiress said calmly, upsetting her nervous bedmate. \"R-Really, you're not gonna blow up at me like yesterday?\" Vivian ignored her question as she shifted back to her slumbering position, \"You can just pack your shit and get out then, you scrawny bitch.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy was appalled! Vivian was so fat, so <i>disgustingly</i> fat, yet she acted like she didn't even need her! Like- Like she was so easilly replacable! \"Y-You don't mean that.\" forgetting her trip to the bathroom, Stacy attempted to reason with her main source of income, \"You can't seriously mean-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I mean it.\" Vivian said calmly, struggling past her fat neck to look back at her now ex-girlfriend, \"I'm getting tired of girls anyway, maybe I'll look up my old boyfriend.\" she yawns. Stacy was far from convinced, \"Oh, I'll bet!\" she stammered, far too afraid of losing moochee to sound too intimidating, \"I'll bet, you'll be wailing your lonely ass off after a week without me!\" Vivian, unphased, imitated snoring, \"You're a bitch, you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really wanna stay?\" Vivian turns to her, \"You REALLY wanna stay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I do!\" Stacy hollers, fully convinced that she's been kicked out and whatever follows is just filler, \"So, let's hear it Vi, what can I do to stay with you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wicked, devious smile crossed Vivian's tripley chinned face. This girl was desperate, willing to do <i>anything</i>. This was gonna be fun....</span></div></div>",

She, in truth, didn't even <i>like</i> girls that much, it was just for shelter! Now she was gonna have to get fat for an even fatter member of the same gender? No way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vivian, you've gotta be kidding me!\" she whined, \"What about this nice, sexy body?\" she struck a quick pose for judgement, \"Do you really want me to ruin all <i>this</i> for nothing?!\" Vivan licked her lips as Stacy turned, eyes turning hazy in lusty desire. \"Don't turn if you aren't coming back to bed.\" she mumbled, nostrils flaring slightly. \"My point, you really want me to bury under flab ?\" Stacy said, carrying herself in a much more confident manner now that she had a bargaining angle against weight gain, \"And how am I supposed to feed <i>you</i> if I'm too busy feeding <i>myself</i>, that wouldn't work out very well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all hope of bargaining with the hard-set Vivian Ratchford was long gone, for she had set her mind to Stacy gaining an obscene amount of weight.

There wasn't much she could do; other than listen to Vivian. And that meant gaining weight for this spoiled, bitchy blob. Maybe until she was a blob herself.... \"S-So how much?\" Stacy whimpered as she sat down beside Vivian's engorged body, \"How much weight 'til I can stay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian's devious smiled returned to her yet again, \"Oh don't worry honey-buns, I'll tell you when to stop.\" she fondled one of Stacy's small breasts with her fat hand. \"Mmmm... for now, you can make yourself useful; lift up my big ol' belly.\" Stacy shuddered in disgust as the morbidly obese teen shifted her bulk, \"You know what to do.\"</span></div></div>",

When she awoke, bleary-eyed and exhausted from barely two hours of sleep, she was surprised to see that Vivian, who usually only got out of her bed to go to the bathroom or get more food, had gotten out of bed well ahead of Stacey. What the hell was going on? Stacey pulled herself out of bed, and as if on cue, Vivian's husky voice yelled \"Stacey! Get your scrawny ass in here!\" from the dining room. (At least that made sense, of course the fat pig was in her favorite room in the house.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacey staggered into the dining room, still shaking off the shroud of slumber, and was confronted by one of Vivian's standard arrays of disgustingly unhealthy foods: At least two trays of brownies, three boxes of toaster pastries, half of a chocolate cake, a bag of chips, and three unnecessarily large burgers from one of the greasy dives Vivian made herself a regular customer of before Stacey came along and solved that pesky \"leaving-the-house\" problem for her forever. But what surprised Stacey wasn't the vile array of food on the overburdened table (By an eyeball estimate, this was how much Vivian ate for dinner). No, it was the fact that Vivian was not actively tearing into it that caught Stacey off guard. In fact, where the hell was Vivian? She could have sworn that her voice was coming fr-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian's fat, greasy hand clamped down on Stacey's shoulder, sending shivers down the smaller girl's spine. \"Get your ass in that chair, and start eating,\" Vivian ordered. \"Don't stop until you can't fit another scrap in your stomach.\" Vivian forcibly shoved Stacey into the chair in front of the table. \"Call for me when you can't eat anything else.\" With that, Vivian waddled off into the living room, where she probably had a similar looking feast set up (Stacey wouldn't put it past the fat hog, anyway), leaving Stacey to her own devices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she knew it was for her, just looking at the absurd pile of food in front of her made her sick to her stomach. Dear God, she had to eat all of this? Reminding herself that not eating would get her kicked out of the apartment, Stacey fought down the rising nausea in her stomach and began working through the vile feast in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian knew full and well that Stacey didn't have a chance in hell of eating all of that; that was more than Vivian ate in a meal (not by much, but the point still stands)! No, the real point of that feast was to test Stacey's capacity. The amount of food Stacey could cram into her stomach to begin with would determine how quickly her weight would increase. With that in mind, Vivian got started on the feast that she, indeed, had set up in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 20 minutes later, as Vivian finished off her second obnoxiously large burger, she heard moans of pain from the dining room. \"Guess Stacey hit her limit.\", she said to nobody in particular. With no small effort, Vivian lifted her ponderous bulk out of her chair, noting with some satisfaction the groans the chair made as she shifted her weight. Panting for breath (It had been a while since the last time she had pulled herself out of a sitting position unassisted), Vivian waddled into the kitchen, beholding Stacey, still moaning in pain, trying desperately to process her meal. Stacey's stomach stuck out several inches further than the norm, but gravity had not yet begun to force her stomach downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian turned to look and see just how much of the feast was left, and felt...</span></div></div>",

No doubt her return to the waking world would be sounded as always with an earth-shattering belch and the disgusting noises of indulgence and thus ruining Stacy's morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoffee mug in hand, Stacy stepped into the kitchen and turned the stove onto pre-heat as she slowly procured everything needed for a Vi-sized pancake menagerie.

For example, plates shouldn't be stacked on top of one another because -say they were- syrup and butter would drench the bottoms of the plate; which meant more time spent at the sink cleaning dishes <i>and</i> re-buttering and syruping Vivian's breakfast. Within moments, a thick blanket of cakes hot off the griddle, drowned in maple syrup, covered the entire tray and thensome. Each plate held around four cakes each, Erin's more complicated ones at the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think you can give me a hand?\" Erin grunted as she pulled the tray from the countertop, bearing the great weight that was her new roommate's breakfast<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, I'm not going anywhere near there if I don't have to.\" Stacy raised her hands in defense as she made way for Erin's load, \"I will, however, be more than happy to get her door for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Stace.\" Erin grumbled as she awkwardly heaved the load to the door, \"What are you gonna do while I'm in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Start on seconds, I guess.\" Stacy said begrudgingly, \"Told you, Erin, she's a real slave-driver.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the door shut behind the bodacious brunette as she struggled to support the syrupy mess in her hands.

In fact they became so close that they fell in love and got married in the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother thing you should know about Amy is that she's from a coastal town in California that's pretty popular during Spring break and Summer. It was a couple of nights before spring break Amy was playing WOW with Maximus Oberun and were chatting and Maximus was saying that he and a couple of his friends were coming to Amy's town for Spring break and wanted to meet Amy in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe agreed and they both logged off. Amy sat on her bed and look at herself in the mirror and saw a big problem.

What if he thought she was disgusting slob? What if she humiliated herself in public?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE!!!\" yelled Amy.

She'd be lonely without her Erika, and Erika could have been anywhere, getting into something other than food and her silly WOW game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStudying her daughter, Marion wondered if she wasn't feeding Erika enough- she looked a little thin, if such a thing could be said about a 720 lbs, immobile teenager, with rolls upon rolls of fat masking every appendage. Erika's body was bursting with fat- from her blimp face- chubby cheeks that dwarfed and squished her petite up-turned nose with a cute triple-chin (that was threatening to eat up her entire chubby neck), down to her plump small feet and chubby piggies. But, of course, her most prominent feature was her humongous- never empty- belly, that stretched past her chubby knees to hang down, and curved around her obese body as ginormous love handles that hung around her thighs, like saddle bags.  Noticing her plump (okay, extremely plump) princess was nearly done with her giant feast, Marion ran off to bring course two around for her chubby-wubby Erika.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-/-/-/-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika let out a large burp that shook her body- sending waves through her overstuffed flesh. She had just finished a meal fit for a king- though she didn't know this... To her, that was just a snack. Wondering what her mom had in store for her next, she absently grabbed a box of cookies from her bedside table, her fat fingers struggling to open the cookie bag. Already ready to cry out in hunger- despite it only having been minutes since her last  bite of food, Erika finally opened the stubborn cookie bag and began to shovel them in her mouth, two, three, even four cookies at a time as she gulped them down. Despite not having full movement in her fat arms- which were larger than most girl's her age's thighs, Erika finished them all in record time and began her next conquest to fill her black-home like tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! Food!\" She barked out as her fat fingers felt another box on her bedside table, this time a giant box of chocolate Bon-bons. Opening it, she began to it them at a rapid pace, covering herself in chocolate- which added to the crumbs and stains she already had but had not noticed, being far too busy glutting out on her feast and snacks.</span></div></div>",

However, she never was able to be as proud of it to be as outgoing as her mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother who being obese herself, made her money first as a plus size model, but then partnered with her father to form their own business to sell fashion, furniture and other special item plus sizes people needed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slept in a night gown, that her mother made for her. However, the size of her belly, was still obvious, as it expand out before her and down to her mid thighs, and would have dominated her figure if it wasn't for her hips and ass that were gargantuan rolling expanses for fat. Even her arms and legs were enormous flabby tree trunks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly interrupted her with a reminder that was starving and that breakfast was ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What made Ashley different from the rest was that instead of enjoying eating, she was addicted to the point where she would not eat any less than what she has before. Over the years, Ashley slowly ate more and more throughout the years, from the daily regulated 2,000 calories, to 3,000, then 4,000, and so on. Because of this Ashley weighed over 300 pounds just at the age of 13 years old, the same weight most of her family is that are in their 40's. Due to her weight, Ashley did not go to high school where she would of had lots of challenges getting to classes and the possibility of being made fun of, but instead took high school classes online from the comfort of her home, while gorging constantly on food. Unlike Ashley, John and Sarah, her parents, have always feared Ashley's health, and never condoned on Ashley's massive weight at such a young age, but had no way of controlling her eating. When Ashley's parents tried to limit Ashley to the food amount she would normally eat, Ashley would go to a greater distance by going to all you can eat buffets and sneaking food out of the cabinets to feed her lust for food and adding of fat to her body.<br>\r\n          At 550 pounds and the age of 15, Ashley was now the largest of her family, and she loved it, but the weight didn't come without its disadvantages. For one, her ability to stand has decreased with what takes most people her age barely a second to stand takes Ashley alone around half a minute of shifting her massive self back and forth until gravity is able to finally help with what muscles normally do. Another thing that has become harder to do is walking, after taking the time needed just to stand in order to walk, Ashley now has to shift herself slightly more than usual due to her legs being spread more apart from her fat causing her to waddle and instead of walking average distances, Ashley can only walk from one side of the house to another until her breathing becomes labored and her heart is beating out of her chest and she needs to rest for longer than she walked. Due to her lacking ability to walk far distances, she can no longer go to she originally went to, but that doesn't mean she pick up a few admirers during her time there that secretly brought her food when her parents were not there. When it came to furniture, Ashley needed a special made steel bed in order to sustain her weight, which unlike a common wooden one would of broke as if it was a twig and can only sit on a reinforced couch where she spends most of her time.<br>\r\n          <br>\r\nDo you want to read more?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alexandra Summers walked up the steps of the gargantuan house before her. Taking a moment to make sure her attire was prim and proper, she reached out and pressed the doorbell, hearing it chime within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex, as she generally was referred to, had answered a rather questionable ad in the paper. Posted by one John Smith, requesting a live-in caretaker/nurse, with discretion a must. They even went so far as to mention signing an NDA agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt certainly seemed suspicious, and John Smith certainly sounded like a fake name. Regardless, Alex had called the provided number right away. The former nurse had been unemployed for the last 8 months, and her finances were getting rather tight. And even if it proved to be another dead-end, hopefully it'd be good for a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, she certainly didn't laugh when she heard what her wage would be. She'd arranged a face-to-face interview with John and his wife Sarah almost immediately. She was a little surprised when she met them, as they didn't look like axe murderers or drug dealers. They were awfully tight lipped about the full nature of the assignment, but the money was good, and even included a cash advance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what little they'd given her, she knew that the couple was looking for a caretaker for their daughter, Ashley. They seemed hesitant to go into too many details, but stated that she was bed-bound and incapable of moving on her own, and needed someone to do everything for her that she couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a nutshell, everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex had tried to pry a little, but the Smith's were tight lipped regarding what medical condition had led their child to becoming immobile. She was a little leery about signing on without all the details (after all, what if Ashley required special care that she couldn't offer?), but the money was simply too good. Shaking both Mr. and Mrs. Smith's hands, she'd been hired that afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, here she was, at the Smith family home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Geez, this place is huge. I think their garage is bigger then my apartment,\"</i> Alex thought as she waited by the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have too long to wait. The door opened, revealing a fairly short woman. She looked to be in her early twenties, though Alex knew she was actually in her early forties. Her platinum blonde hair was naturally wavy, and was long enough to reach the small of her back. She clearly spent a lot of time in the gym, giving her body a tight, fit look, and Alex could just make out the edges of a couple of tattoos hidden under her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her most impressive feature by far was her breasts. They were clearly fake, and given their bounce, Alex suspected silicon over saline. Her cup size had to at least be an F or a G, and with her tiny frame, they looked absolutely massive on her. Why she wanted her boobs to be that big would be a query for another time, as the woman looked up. Seeing who it was, she gave a smile that could have outshone the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex! Glad you found the place! Wasn't too much trouble, I hope.\" Sarah Smith welcomed their new caretaker in with a broad sweep of her arms. Despite her... shall we say, interesting appearance, Alex felt she'd have been hard pressed to say she'd ever met a kinder, more genuine person than Mrs. Smith. Her new boss just had a way of making you feel welcome and at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"And other things for the boys, I suspect,\"</i> Alex thought. <i>\"I'll bet every teenager for a hundred miles has more then a few fantasies involving her...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just follow me to John's office,\" Sarah said, leading the way down the hall. She continued, \"He's sorry he couldn't be here today. Something came up at work, and he had to head down right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah turned into a fairly large room. Between the desk, the computer, the filing cabinets and the bookcases, this was clearly the office. Grabbing some paperwork that was already prepared and set on the desk, she quickly laid it out in three bundles. Passing her new caretaker a pen, she said, \"Just initial there, and there, and sign and print there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex quickly filled in the aforementioned spots, and Sarah signed and dated the document on the last sheet. \"There! All done! I'm very glad to have you on-board.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to be here,\" Alex said. \"Now that that's over and done with, can you tell me all the details about my charge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's normally bright face showed a slight grimace which Alex just managed to catch. \"Honestly, it's probably easier if I just show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** *** ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, do try not to stare too much. Ashley is used to me and her father, but she was pretty shy before her condition left her bed bound, and no one except us has set eyes on her since that day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women were making their way down a long, wide hallway. Art work and plants decorated the large space at regular intervals, and the sound of their footsteps was masked by the lush red carpet throughout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the nature of her condition?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah Smith slowed her pace, and shortly after came to a halt. She took a deep breath then leaned back against a wall, arms crossed under her giga-bust. \"Look, the truth is, my daughter is... big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, really big. Fat, I mean. Really, really, <b>really</b> fat.\" Sarah even went the extra mile with her hand gestures, just to try and indicate how big she truly is. \"She was always on the bigger side. Just a chubby, cute little girl. But when the other kids started to outgrow their puppy fat, hers stuck around. Other kids would play at recess, and she'd go down to the cafeteria and score a free meal. Even at a young age, she'd ask for seconds with dinner, and always wanted desserts. Plural.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she was ten, she could out-eat me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she was twelve, she could out-eat <i>John</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was already pretty fat by the time she hit Middle School, but once puberty kicked in, it was like a switch got flipped. Her appetite soared, and she was stuffing her face near constantly. Her weight sky rocketed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe'd been concerned before, of course, but we tried to put it out of our minds. We didn't want to make Ashley self-conscious by making a big deal out of her weight, and we convinced ourselves that she'd drop it, or at least plateau, once puberty hit. When the opposite happened, well, we panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe tried talking with her, reasoning with her, taking her to therapy sessions at an eating disorder clinic. When that failed, we tried to force her to diet and exercise, but she resisted. Buying and eating a 20 piece bucket of chicken after school, binging on burgers on the weekends, eating a couple pies at lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter what we did, her problem only got worse and worse. Her classmates were merciless, though if anything, that only seemed to make her eat <i>more</i>. When she outgrew her third uniform in a month, she couldn't bear the thought of how they'd react to her getting so fat, so fast. And so, we dropped her out and started homeschooling her. That was probably a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin six months, Ashley could barely walk, and within a year, she couldn't even stand up without help. And just before her 17th birthday, she got too heavy for anyone to move, and she's been bedridden ever since. That was just over two years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked, it took Alex a moment to take all that in. \"Jesus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got her on a maintenance diet now so she doesn't gain anymore. Or, you know, at least slower.\" Sarah rubbed the back of her neck. \"I mean, we've never counted the calories to check. With how much she needs to eat in a day, it's hard to cut her off completely. We tried to limit her to a 2,000 calories per day diet, but it didn't work. Her belly was just so noisy, and my baby had tears flowing down her face from the pain of being so hungry, so we had to move back up at least some of the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah once again began to make her way down the hall, and Alex followed suit. Sarah continued, \"So that's where you come in. I'll be heading back to work soon, and my Ashley is far too fa-big! to do anything on her own. She'll need you to clean her, fetch things for her, bathe her, quite honestly everything. And she has a strict diet, though she's always hungry, so she'll probably try to convince you to give her extra. Obviously, don't give in; we're trying to get her to lose weight, not gain more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two finally came to an extra-wide wet of French doors. Sarah visibly swallowed at this point. \"The rest of the details can wait until later. Now, if you would, please brace yourself Miss Summers. And do try not to stare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex felt like a fish out of water, and could only nod. <i>\"Oh, Alexandra, what have you gotten yourself into this time...\"</i></span></div></div>",

It certainly wasn't a belch that could blow out windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRPPPPPPPP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Jesus!\"</i> Alex crinkled her nose in disgust. <i>\"I think I felt the spray from over here.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice inside sounded more then slightly embarrassed at such a grandiose example of bad timing. \"R-really? Right n-now? Oh God, why did I...? Mom, I can't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked over her shoulder at Alex. \"Sorry, just give me a moment,\" she said as she slipped between the doors and closed them behind her. Alex could just make out the sounds of voices within, though she couldn't tell what was being said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about five or ten minutes, the door opened again. Sarah peeked out and said, \"She said she's good to meet you now. Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex nodded, and Sarah opened the doors wide, revealing the room's sole occupant. And what an occupant. Alex had thought she was ready for to see just how big her gigantic charge was, but she was still taken aback by just how huge she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was spread out over what had to be the largest and most overbuilt hospital bed Alex had ever set her eyes on. This \"bedroom,\" if it could be called that, was positively huge, so it was saying something that this bed still occupied a significant portion of this room. There was a gigantic 70\" plasma-screen TV on the wall, with an episode of something currently paused on screen. There was also a large set of glass doors opening up to the backyard, with the curtains currently open to let in some natural light. Looking out the doors, Alex saw there was no fear of anyone seeing the semi-exposed fatty, as the fence was too high and tight to allow passer-by's any sort of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was, in a word, a blob. Every aspect of her body was engorged in an impossibly thick layer of jiggly lard. Even with her bed tilted forward, the 19 year old could scarcely see over her towering, sprawling belly. The impossibly huge organ stretched past her knees and further to her sides then her fat-encumbered arms could reach. Her gut was divided into four gargantuan rolls, with a large crease running down the middle. Her belly button was buried so deep in her blubber that it was effectively invisible, and each roll was criss-crossed with a labyrinth of stretch marks and cellulite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts were gigantic, flabby things, drooping heavily under their own weight. They ran far to her sides as their scale and gravity did their work, and they were accompanied by a pair of huge rolls under her arms, thrusting her limbs upwards. It was a testament to the size of her belly that her boobs couldn't succeed in their run to the floor, instead resting atop her gut and rising into her field of view like a pair of semi-deflated beach balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms hadn't been spared any of the fat that assaulted the rest of her over stuffed body. Her upper arms were quite probably twice the size of Alex's thighs, and had gotten so large that they'd developed their own drooping rolls. Continuing using her legs as a comparison, Ashley's forearms were considerably larger around then her new caretaker's calves, and even her hands and fingers looked distinctly pudgy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove her puffy shoulders, her thick neck was hidden by multiple large chins. Her cheeks were the size of softballs, leaving her plump, pink lips half hidden in their smothering embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, all of her enormity somehow managed to pale in comparison to her lower half. Her ass and hips were so large that they spread well past even her titanic belly, coming within scant inches of the edge of her massive bed. Her thighs were girthy as a pair of barrels, and were calves weren't far behind, forcing her legs almost comically far apart. Her gargantuan leg fat was broken into numerous, crushing rolls, and much like her hands, even her now-useless feet had rounded out with blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs befitted her mother's description of shy, Ashley had yet to look her new caretaker in the face. She'd clearly just been eating, as her belly was covered with crumbs and small spatters of sauce. Her Mom had clearly wiped her face, and Ashley was moving the crumbs and spots of sauce to her mouth, adding more individual calories to her vastly oversized form. It had clearly been a meatball sub, as a meatball had fallen from the sandwich and rolled down her body, ending up lodged out of her paltry reach between two rolls on her side and leaving a trail of grease and marinara to mark its passing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex briefly forgot herself as she took in this massive Hutt of a human being and her cascading rolls of blubber, but quickly regained her composure. \"Hi, I'm Alex! It's a pleasure to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise,\" Ashley whispered without looking up. Her belly let out a low, rumbling growl, and Ashley grimaced and let out a small, nearly imperceptible whimper. She tried to reach the stuck meatball with a grunt, but failed to shift even the smallest of her lardy rolls. She looked at her mother with sad, almost desperate eyes. \"M-mom...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah let out a small sigh, and passed the meatball to her planetary daughter. She quickly stuffed the meatball into her clearly bottomless maw, swallowing it after only a token amount of chewing. Another bass rumble followed in the aftermath, and Ashley looked longingly at her now-empty wrapper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreempting the inevitable question, Sarah said, \"Not now, sweetie. You know you don't get more until 2. Anyway, I need to head downtown for a bit, so I'll leave you two to get acquainted. We'll show you your room and go over the final details once John and I are back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** *** ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah headed out, leaving the tub of lard and her nurse alone. Alex grabbed some cleaning supplies from the pantry set aside for the purpose, and started cleaning her cavernous charge. After working in silence for the moment, Alex decided to try and crack the ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, can you tell me about yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley answered a bit quietly. \"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know, what do you do for fun, what interests you, things like that,\" Alex said as she pushed apart a couple of her larger rolls. She kept a solid poker face and hid her vague disgust as she swabbed out the gigantic young woman's sweaty folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I watch TV, play video games, eat whenever they let me.\" Ashley winced as her belly rumbled again. \"Which isn't often enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your Mom and Dad are just worried about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley sounded a little bitter as she answered. \"Why's that? Are they worried I'll get fat?\" She smacked her belly to emphasize her point, sending a wet ripple through her colossal amount of jiggly blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex felt the conversation quickly getting out of her control as her charge began to answer more confidently. \"They're just trying to keep you from gaining anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please. That ship sailed when I outgrew the circus Fat Lady in middle school. The last time I got weighed, I was 974 pounds, and it took six people to move me. And that was last November. Mom seems convinced I've lost weight, but I know better. I've been measuring my rolls with my fingers, and they're still getting bigger.\" Ashley's rant was interrupted by another echoing growl from her hopelessly over stretched stomach, and she let out a loud whimper as it did. She sounded less confident as she said, \"L-look, c-can you please get me something to eat? Anything, please. I'm absolutely <i>starving</i>. I'm allowed to eat again at 2, and it's almost quarter too, so that's close enough. It's Friday anyway. I'm allowed a cheat day on Friday. I'm so hungry. Please, I need something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" Alex said as Ashley whimpered once more. <i>\"Her Mom was pretty blunt about not feeding her off the schedule. She said Ashley would try to get extra food, and she was fairly emphatic about not giving in to her demands. Ashley's already so unbelievably fat; it's not like she needs anymore. Hell, she really needs to lose some weight...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, if she's telling the truth, she's already over a thousand pounds and still getting bigger, even with her Mom's diet. And she looks like she's in a lot of pain right now. Maybe she's being serious? And if the only result of this so-called diet is her discomfort, is there any point in sticking to it? It's obvious she's not losing any weight on it, and I should be able to hide the evidence of her snack pretty easily...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut is it worth risking my job? The Smith's are paying me ridiculously well for this. Is it really a good idea to risk my livelihood to help Jabba grow another chin? Though to be honest, how much fatter could she possibly get? Well, if anyone could get fatter then this, it'll probably be Ashley. Wait, didn't Sarah say she had a schedule for her daughter somewhere? What to do...?\"</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Isabella grabbed the last slice of pizza from the box and scarfed the warm slice down in a few big bites. Licking the grease off her fingers, she closed the empty box beside her and moved it to the empty stack. Opening the full one underneath, she took a moment to savor the smell of an extra large pepperoni, extra meat and extra cheese, on a cheese stuffed crust, naturally. Smiling, she leaned over to grab a slice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan watched with morbid fascination as her room mate continued her feast. The two friends had met in the dorms their first year, and hit it off splendidly. And so, when their time on campus was up, they decided to seek an off campus apartment together. Izzie had been a nearly perfect room mate, all in all. She was fairly neat and tidy, always paid her rent on time, was never drunk or obnoxious at terrible hours. There was really only one thing wrong as far as Megan could see it, and that was Izzie's weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, to be fair, Isabella had been large (really large) since Megan had first met her. She found out part way through that first year that Izzie had paid for not one, but two meal plans, one for each of the campus dining halls, and had purposefully rearranged her schedule so that she could eat six meals a day. When confronted about this, Izzie had said three meals wasn't enough; she was just starving all the time. Her enormous overeating had maintained her round physique quite well throughout her first year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince moving in together, it seemed that she was eating even more. Any moment she wasn't on campus (and given how many of her courses she was taking online, that was quite a lot of time), she was sitting on their couch in her bra and panties eating, just like she was now. And not only was she eating more, the quality of the food had gotten worse. At least with the dorm meals, she at least had to eat some vegetables and other healthy items. Now was a far different story, as it was nearly all take out- pizza, chinese, burgers, fried chicken, you name it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it's not like she was going out to get it herself and accidentally get some exercise that way. Rather, since she was far too fat to drive herself anywhere, she instead ordered delivery in huge quantities, sometimes requiring the poor driver to make multiple trips. She always paid for her stuff by credit card, leaving Megan to conclude that her parents had to be footing the bill for that one. Izzie was also receiving huge care packages from home, packed to the brim with cookies and other sweets. Izzie was always willing to offer her some, and they had tasted really good, but Megan was quite certain the cookies contained a pound of sugar and butter EACH.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe constant presence of fast food and sweets, and a generous room mate who loved to share with her friend, had had a negative effect on Megan's waistline. She had gained almost forty pounds in the short time they'd been living together, much of it in her belly and bust. However, next to Isabella, she looked down right anorexic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzie's face and neck were plumped by her endless feasting. Her cheeks were round and dimpled, and she had a bloated second chin, as well as a third that had been growing ever since they moved in together. All her facial fat jiggled as her jaw moved, which given she was always either chewing or talking, was all the time. Her neck was thick and soft, with a roll developing on the back just above her shoulders, though it was often hidden behind her hair. Isabella held a unique record with Megan, being the only woman she'd seen so fat that her neck had stretch marks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shoulders were packed with blubber, and her upper arms were easily the size of hams, the fat rolls nearly making her elbows invisible. Her forearms had to be as big around as Megan's calves, and all this conspired to make her hands seem diminutive. Her arms jiggled energetically whenever she moved them, and given they were constantly shoveling food into her mouth, that was all the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bosoms were massive spheres of fat, barely held in check by her long-suffering bra, which was currently digging deep grooves into her shoulder fat. It was clear from the amount of flesh pushing out from the top and sides that Izzie had outgrown yet another bra. The weight of each breast had to be tremendous, but luckily, she had help supporting them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly was a massive platform of flab upon which her upper body rested. Large rolls under her armpits gave her heavy arms a place to rest, and her tummy stretched out to her knees, giving her breasts the perfect platform to perch on. Her gut had been divided into three massive rolls when they moved in together, and Megan had watched those three rolls grow wider and wider, and eventually be joined by a fourth. The sheer expanse of her belly meant Isabella had to arrange her food to her left and right, since bending forward for something was right out. Her love handles and back rolls were absolutely huge, and they were constantly being squished and bent as Izzie leaned over to grab more handfuls of food, and transfer the now empty boxes to her garbage table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor as big as her belly was, it was dwarfed by her lower half. Her ass was simply enormous, easily sticking out a couple feet or more, and wide enough that it still protruded past her belly's width by a good eight inches per side. When they moved in, her butt had easily covered two couch cushions. Now it nearly covered three, and it wouldn't be too much longer before Isabella would fill up an entire couch by herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thighs were bigger around then Megan's newly filled out waist by quite a margin. Her knees couldn't be anywhere near each other, and were more then half hidden by flab. Her calves started out enormous where they met the overfed Latino's knees, but thinned out as they ran down towards her feet. Her feet, like her hands, had gained little to no weight, and looked almost too small for such a fat woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere really was no other way to describe it. Isabella was not a big woman, nor was she a large woman. Rather, she was a hugely, unbelievably, massively FAT woman, and she was only getting fatter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is where Izzie's weight was really starting to become a factor. It was quite clear that she was having more and more trouble moving on her own. She was finding it difficult to rise from the couch after a particularly big stuffing without assistance, an event that was becoming more and more frequent. If Megan was around, Izzie would often ask her to grab her something from the kitchen or bring her takeout from the door, just to avoid having to get up herself. Her gigantic thighs and ass meant she could master at best a slow waddle. Her footsteps were slow and very, very heavy, and the short walk from the couch to her bedroom often required multiple rest breaks, and left her panting like she'd ran a marathon. Her increased size also meant that, despite Izzie's natural neatness and willingness to help around the house, she found even doing the most basic of chores nearly impossible. It was nothing short of a herculean effort that she managed to stay caught up on her garbage, though again, Megan was having to help out more and more with that. Megan was really starting to worry her friend was going to become immobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also the damages to the furniture to consider. Isabella had already crushed one couch under her gargantuan tush, and as there was some rather alarming creaking noises coming from this one, there'd be another soon to follow. She'd already been blacklisted from the dining room, having destroyed three of their chairs, two of them while sitting on both simultaneously. Her bed was the most recent victim of this plump princess, collapsing under her as she laid down for bed last week. As the two roomies split the cost of all damages, all of this had put additional strain on Megan's finances, which were already suffering from having to re-buy her wardrobe three times so far this year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was another cause for concern. Megan's own weight was beginning to climb, slowly at first, but rapidly gaining speed. Some quick math showed she was currently gaining three pounds a week, which was rather alarming. Her appetite was also growing. Where before she'd eat her three squares a day and be good, now she often found herself hitting up the vending machines between classes. Also, she was more and more often going back for seconds. Izzie's eating habits seemed to be rubbing off, and she didn't like it. And if Izzie wound up immobile, and Megan became her caretaker (she was a nursing student, after all), odds were distressingly good that eventually Megan would join her in Eternal Flab-dom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, there was the final problem. Namely, Megan liked watching her eat. Like, a lot. She had spent a lot of time pushing such thoughts to the side, but watching Izzie stuff herself to the brim, seeing her dimpled smile as her jiggling fat grew bigger each day, hearing her coo as she bit into something particularly delectable, knowing each day was the skinniest she'd ever be again... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, Megan was really starting to worry about herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd caved into these urges on occasion, buying a large cake for Izzie while on her way back from class a couple of times. She was also an avid baker, and had often prepared home made goods for her growing friend. Granted, some of this had always wound up on Megan's waistline, as Izzie insisted on sharing, but the young Latino had easily eaten the lion's share, sometimes right off of Megan's own fork. Megan was ashamed at how much her friend's worsening physical condition turned her on, and the things she'd done because of that. She was training to be a nurse, she was supposed to help people! Not make them fatter for her own pleasure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA decidedly unladylike burp came from Isabella. Giggling, she grabbed another slice of pizza, bringing her total to three finished pizzas in a sitting. Megan knew something had to happen, and soon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Megan felt like she didn't have much of a choice. She had to confront Izzie about her burgeoning weight, and soon, before the girl turned into a living ball of immobile fat. <i>Assuming I'm not already too late,</i> Megan thought, watching as Izzie ate her final slice of pizza in two massive bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir apartment was an open concept loft, with only the bedrooms and bathrooms behind closed doors. The wide open spaces afforded a great deal of movement room for her gargantuan room mate. Megan wondered if that had been the primary reason Izzie liked this apartment best out of all the ones they'd looked at. Megan had been washing dishes in the kitchen, keeping an eye on her room mate's trembling form from afar. Putting the dish towel over her shoulder, she made her way over to their sitting area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan was currently wearing a yellow sun dress, which had been a few sizes too big when she got it due to a shipping error. This had turned out to be a lucky break, as it was one of the few things in Megan's wardrobe that she could still squeeze her larger form into. Even with the short walk to Isabella's throne, she was uncomfortably aware of how much more her body was moving compared to a few months ago, each shuddering step sending ripples through her newly fattened frame. Her belly was protruding just past her bust, and she knew if she took her dress off, it would be divided into two rolls, even while standing up. Her bust had taken their fair share of fat as well, bringing her up to a DD cup size. While the size increase was nice (there had to be some benefit to getting fat, after all), her breasts had started to sag under their growing weight, leaving Megan relying on her bras to give her the perky bust line she wanted. The rest of her body hadn't kept up with those two, but she was still aware of a layer of softness under her skin, moving slightly with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan couldn't believe she'd outgrown another set of clothes. She'd only purchased them two weeks ago! How fat was she getting!? Megan dreaded the thought of having to buy new clothes again; she wasn't sure how many more times her wallet could take the hit. A treacherous voice in the back of her mind said, <i>you know, if you just bought stretchy clothes, and a size or two above you, then you could wear them for longer.</i> Megan silenced that thought almost as soon as she had it. If that was the way she decided to approach this, then she might as well give up and join Izzie on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella, meanwhile, was happy as a pig in mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pizzas had been extra tasty today (stuffed crust was a really good call), and she rubbed her belly with her clean hand while licking the grease off the fingers of her other hand, cooing all the while. Though she had no hope of seeing her hand past her enormous boobs, she could feel how small it was on her belly. She stuck her hand between two rolls, feeling her burgeoning flesh cover it completely. She lifted the roll, feeling just how heavy it was, certain that it felt even heavier then yesterday. She felt her way down her belly, counting her rolls, smiling at the fourth roll that was forming just underneath her boobs. What had started as a small fold under her bust when she and Megan moved in was now nearly two inches around, and very soon would be too big for her hand to grab in its entirety, just like the rest of her belly rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzie smiled, and she brought both her hands under the second roll from the top. Again, her hands were completely hidden under what felt like a platter of fat, and it took more effort then she would have given it credit for to move the trembling flesh. Lifting it as high as she could (which really wasn't all that high), she dropped it, watching the jiggling ripples flow through her enormously fattened frame. The young woman giggled, a light, airy sound like the tinkling of a bell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzie leaned to the left, squishing her lardy rolls even further as she grabbed the empty pizza box. Leaning to the right to add it to her garbage table, her right sides' opulent deposits of fat were given the same treatment. The couch creaked under Isabella's shifting bulk, though she barely made notice of it. She had more important things on her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNamely a large bucket of double deep fried chicken. Now, for most of us, the sheer quantity of food Isabella was putting away would be unthinkable. One of those extra large pizzas was meant to feed a small family, and she'd just spotted off three. Isabella, however, was not most of us. She seemed completely immune to getting full, only growing slightly less hungry as she stuffed her cavernous maw. And the chicken smelled so good. The rumbling in her stomach sealed the deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella leaned over to grab her bucket of chicken, and promptly encountered a rather sizable problem; namely, herself. You see, when Izzie had arranged her table of food, she'd put the pizzas closest towards her on the couch, and the chicken on the other side, away from her seat. Now, she'd been doing this for quite some time, as her considerable girth would attest to, but she hadn't been taking into consideration just how BIG she was getting. As her hips and booty grew and grew, she found herself moving more towards the center of the couch. Also, her belly and back rolls had been steadily getting thicker and protruded further each day. The underside of her arms had developed massive rolls of their own, while her upper arms had piled on a significant amount of fat as well, and were now bigger then her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this taken together, combined with weeks of ignoring how she could just barely reach the chicken bucket with her finger tips, meant only one thing: Isabella was actually too fat to reach her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly let out an irritated growl at this unforeseen delay. Isabella REALLY wanted to eat her bucket of chicken, but a few more attempts made it clear she wasn't going to get it from a sitting position. She let out a small \"hmmph\" in the back of her throat. She really did not want to have to stand up to get her food, as it was such a labor intensive and time consuming task. Her growling belly, however, made any alternative where she wasn't eating the chicken completely unthinkable. Just as she was beginning to start the process of standing up, Izzie spied her friend and room mate Megan coming over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan's gain was fairly obvious to Izzie, her belly and bust jiggling considerably as she walked. She'd outgrown her clothes a couple time at least, and Izzie wondered why Megan hadn't bought anything with some stretch to it. Her BFF's appetite had certainly increased dramatically since they'd moved in together. The girl that had once been satisfied with one single patty burger for supper now needed two doubles and some fries to accomplish the same. She was also baking all the time, and Izzie would watch as Megan would taste sample after sample, essentially needing to make two cakes instead of one due to all the taste tests she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If she's going to eat like that, she really should just accept the fact that she's going to get fat,</i> Isabella thought, totally aware of the irony of someone her size calling someone else \"fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, her timing couldn't have been more perfect. Smiling, she said, \"Hey Meg! Want to watch a movie and order Chinese? It'll be my treat! Also, could I get you to pass me my chicken? I can't quite reach it from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan looked Isabella over as the dark haired woman offered plans for tonight. If anything, she looked even bigger this close. Her shuddering layers of lard sprawled across one another, and her ass, for lack of a better term, oozed over the couch, leaving it almost completely covered by the young woman's veritable sea of flesh. Her bust jiggled slightly with each breath she took, and a loud rumble echoed from her bottomless belly, demanding even more fatty foods to expand its Empire of Fat even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yes, Isabella was massively fat, there was no question about that. It was completely clear to Megan that if she didn't do something, Izzie was just going to keep going as she is and eventually disappear into her rolls. But what to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne part of her wanted to confront Izzie about her weight, her and now. The nurse in her knew it wasn't healthy being her size, or gaining as quickly as she is. Izzie is basically living off grease, and Megan was pretty sure she sweat Crisco. The part of her that was a good friend also didn't want to see her BFF eat herself to death. And the selfish part of her reasoned that, if Izzie would start watching what she eats and losing weight, there'd be far less fattening foods around for Megan to eat, stopping and reversing her own weight gain. Megan did feel a little guilty at that thought, and wondered if thinking that made her a terrible friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other part of her wanted to wait to confront Izzie tomorrow, and have a good night tonight. Chinese food sounded amazing, even if her waistline would suffer for it. And she'd baked a couple of pies and a platter of cookies earlier in the day. It'd be a shame if they had to go to waste. Again, the part of her that was a good friend chimed in. Izzie seemed to really enjoy eating and getting fatter. Did Megan have a right to tell her she was too fat? Or was not telling Izzie making her an enabler of her friend's unchecked weight gain and the problems it pertained? She didn't want her friend to have a sea of health problems on top of an oceanic ass. She could barely walk as it is; what would the future hold if this wasn't stopped?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe selfish, lustful part of her gave its own two cents. Megan knew just how massive an order Isabella got when she ordered Chinese food, and the thought of watching her consume every last fatty, sugary morsel, along with a pie or two and several cookies, adding inches to her bloated waistline? Megan was nearly drooling at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made her decision. \"Izzie,...\"</span></div></div>",

Grab an action film, if you wouldn't mind,\" she said as she pulled her cell from the right cup of her bra with some difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do,\" Megan answered as she passed her elephantine roomie her large bucket of chicken. Wasting no time, Isabella pulled out a drum stick with a grin as she dialed the Chinese place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Megan walked away, she was mentally screaming at herself. <i>You selfish, evil woman! I can't believe you did that! She doesn't need to eat more, she needs to eat less! A LOT less! She's already so fat, but you just couldn't resist, could you!? You just had to make her fatter! You just had to see her scarf down box after box of Chinese take out, watching her massive, fat body jiggle as she eats, see her lard-filled cheeks puff out as she slurps plum sauce coated noodles down by the pound, watch her chins expand as she swallows bite after bite after bite, just filling her gigantic belly with an entire hog's worth of sweet and sour pork, then, when she thinks she's done, bring over dessert, and feed her two whole pies, one bite at a time, straight from your fingers, and then, as she's gasping from just how full she is, you break out the platter of cookies! Oh, she'll say no, but she's too fat and too hungry and way too spoiled to get away! And you'll feed her each and every one, rubbing her belly to help her find the room! And then, you'll keep doing that again and again and again, and watch your beautiful little piggy get fatter and fatt-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistracted as she was, Megan stubbed her toe quite painfully on one of the kitchen chairs, letting out a loud yelp. Izzie nearly choked on an absolutely huge piece of chicken in her haste to swallow it and ask, \"Meg! Are you okay!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Fine! Just stubbed my toe!\" Meg grimaced as she held the injured foot that shook her out of a self-chastisement turned bizarre fantasy. <i>Oh my God, what is wrong with me!? I think I need serious help!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan checked her foot to make sure nothing was broken. Confirming nothing was injured outside of her pride, Megan stepped around the furniture this time and went to their movie rack. She began scanning the movies as she heard Izzie finally get through to the restaurant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more swallowing a large bite of chicken to clear her mouth, Isabella said. \"Hello, I'd like to place an order for delivery. Credit Card. The address is..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeg searched through the movies, trying to find an action-comedy. She needed something to scratch her funny bone as well as feed Izzie's need for action. <i>Oh God, why \"feed\" and \"action\"...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I get the dinner for 10...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>For ten!? Jesus Christ!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"2 extra boxes of wushu pork...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeg's hand shook as it moved along the shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, hold on a sec... Hey Megan! Do you want any wonton soup!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, four bowls of wonton soup...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait, what!?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A triple order of spring rolls, a jumbo box of jumbo sized shrimp...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan wasn't even looking at the shelf anymore, and her hands were frozen in space as she stared at the middle distance, imagination in overdrive. Her breathing was beginning to get rather erratic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hold on another second... Megan! Do you want any egg rolls!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan, shocked from her impromptu fantasy, answered, \"Uh... sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, better make it ten egg rolls...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan's heart almost skipped a beat as she resumed searching through the shelves. As she grabbed a couple movies, she thought,<i>I know she can eat a lot, but there's no way anyone could eat this much!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... and do you guy's have any cheesecake? Great, throw one of those in for me. No, not a slice. The entire cake. Yes, that's right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan lost her grip on the movies in hands and they fell clattering to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I think that's everything. Okay, sounds good. Great! Thanks! Bye!\" Isabella hung up the phone. Replacing it in her bra, she called to her BFF, \"Food will be here in 45 minutes!\" Hands free, Izzie began to scarf down her chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan picked the dropped movies off the floor, her hands still shaking. Her mind was full of thoughts of her ravenous roomie, and just how full she was about to be. And a belly that full would soon be turned to more fat on her frame, more rolls, bigger ones, even more lard on her already over expanded body... How heavy would she be after she was done? There's no way she'd be able to walk by herself. No, she'd need her friend to help her up, and she'd have to put her arm around Megan's shoulders, wrapping her in her huge layers of warm, pillowy fat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan bit her lower lip to keep from making a rather undignified sound. She looked at Isabella from across the room. If anything, she looked even fatter now than she did before. Meg felt herself overwhelmed with lust, but also a sense of fear. <i>I've really got to get this under control. For both our sakes.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing another piece of chicken, Isabella grabbed another meaty morsel from the bucket. She'd long ago perfected her technique to get all the meat off the bone with a single bite, and her tummy growled happily. <i>Perfect. I'll finish this off and digest for thirty, then I'll be ready for supper. I sure hope I ordered enough. Meg's got a long way to go before she can eat as much as me, but she's eating more all the time...</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rapidly finishing all her fried chicken, Izzie belched happily and relaxed for a moment, hands resting proudly on one of her massive rolls. She felt her stomach bubble a \"thank you\" as the huge amount of chicken pushed itself in, finding room along with the three massive pizzas, the huge sacks of cookies and chips, two gallons of ice cream, the jugs of milkshake and soda, over 52 boneless bbq wings, and the 12 large breakfast sausage burritos, stacks of pancakes, and well over a side of bacon. All the greasy savory meats and sauces hadn't sat very well with her milkshakes and heavy-cream dairy drinks, but Izzie had confidence in her stomach's ability to bubble its way through any digestive overload she gave it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing contentedly, a thought struck her. <i>I wonder how much weight I've piled on in the past two weeks. I've really been overeating  like nobody's business. I should check out the damage I've done to myself.</i> She giggled softly at the thought and began the onerous process of sloshing her mammoth body up from the couch. Try as she might, she couldn't, but it didn't take more than a moment to have Megan notice and run over. \"Hey Izz don't strain yourself. I'll help.\" The roommate firmly grabbed Izzie's doughy forearms and counted. \"1...2...3...heave!\" and between the two, she finally tottered to her feet, the contents of her stomach churning with the unexpected movement, jostling a rich belch right into Megan's face.<br>\r\nIzzie covered her mouth, mortified \"omigosh I'm so sorry Megs...I did NOT see that one coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no don't worry about it. Happens to the best of us....\" Megan stammered out, a peculiar look on her face. \"smells like fried chicken!\" The two shared a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Megan, you can let go of my arms now. I'm pretty sure I won't tip over...for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Yes. Sorry.\" Megan blushed scarlet and bobbled her way into the kitchen. \"You want some cookies? I'm almost done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!! Hold up, I gotta go check something,\" Izzie called out before beginning her ponderous waddle toward the bathroom scale, her arms swinging out to keep up the momentum of moving her gargantuan body. Every heavy footfall produced a quiet, sickly *glurp* as the shock disturbed the slowly digesting sludge of her day's gluttony. These noises were a guilty pleasure of Izzie's, as they were an aural reminder of just how much she could eat, and just how hard her poor stomach had to work to handle everything she glutted into herself. Sometimes when she was alone and utterly overstuffed she would lightly rock her turgidly swollen gut back and forth to purposefully create the bubbling sloshing for herself, and sometimes even purposefully eat badly mixing food to increase her feeling of bloatedness and to challenge her stomach even more. The thought made Izzie moan softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally at the bathroom, the massively obese girl panted with the exertion of moving her mass, and gingerly stepped on the automatic large scale. Izzie clearly couldn't see the number past her mammoth body, but after a few seconds, a robotic female voice coldly called out \"<b>You Weigh Five-Hundred and Eight-Teen pounds.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spoken number echoed from the tiled bathroom throughout the loft. A second later Izzie heard a catastrophic crash coming from the kitchen quickly followed by an \"I'm ok! I'm ok! Some of the cookies might not be though!\" from a breathless Megan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it. I'll eat them anyway. I'm not picky!\" Izzie called back gaily, dizzy with happiness. <i>Talk about catastrophic gluttony. Eighteen pounds in two weeks! That's like...over a pound a day!</i> Izzie snickered softly to herself as she rubbed her blubbery arms over the massive rolls of her gut. <i>Maybe with some more effort I can get to an even 20 pounds every two weeks! What a thought! I'm growing like crazy. I'm sure my stomach can handle even more reckless overeating. It hasn't failed me yet!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzie turned to face the wide body-length mirror on the opposite wall, grinning because even though it was promised \"double wide\" she still couldn't see the true size of her girth. Taking a critical look, it was clear that, consistent with the trend of the past two months, her belly was getting the vast majority of her extra poundage. Izzie didn't know how much her ass was growing, but since it passed a certain level of enormity, it was difficult to tell how much bigger it was just by eyeballing it. But it was clear her huge gut was hanging lower, her rolls were thicker, and it was sticking further and further out with each successive weigh-in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis pleased Izzie very much. As much as she loved her gargantuan ass, she wanted her belly to equal and then surpass it in dimensions. Right now it was only huge, but someday soon she imagined it blowing past the truly enormous, and in her fantasies she saw fat fill in all of her stacked rolls and her gut becoming a single massive stretchmarked wobbling mountain of heavy, overstuffed blubber. <i>Maybe someday</i> Izzie thought dreamily, hands gently patting her gut. <i>Maybe someday sooner than I think if I keep upping my gluttony and my stomach keeps handling all the greasy rich garbage I dump into myself. The trashier the better! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought back to her original plan of digesting for a while and chuckled to herself. <i>I don't need any time to digest. In fact I think I need to keep eating, and FAST. </i>She swiped her phone from her bra and thumbed through her UberEats app to the local McDonalds, only a mile away. Smiling wickedly, she keyed in an order for 18 grand macs one for each pound of her gain, and enough disgustingly greasy fries to fill a bucket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Delivery in 15 minutes</b> displayed the app. <i>Mm yes. New plan.</i> She thought. <i>Stuff myself with Megan's cookies for 15 minutes. Then see if I can devour all this new fast food in a half hour. Then the real feast begins! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about the Chinese feast she ordered sparked another lightbulb in her head and soon: \"Yeah hi there. I just put in a order at your place, right? Great. I have a few changes if that's possible. Ok so, I asked for one cheesecake. We need two more. Yes the whole cake. Also, make it thirty egg-rolls, and add a catering tray of crab rangoon. Can you do that? Excellent. Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzie laughed her light tinkling laugh and waddled out into the common area toward her couch where plates of Megan's cookies were already ready to be eaten, and a gallon of whole milk ready to wash them down. Some of the cookies were clearly in worse shape from falling on the floor, and Megan was still scarlet with embarassment. Gratefully lowering her body onto the couch, the tortured furniture groaning with the effort of supporting such a large pile of blubber, Izzie immediately began double-fisting three cookies in each hand, devouring them with reckless abandon and moaning at the over-rich flavor, her multiple chins and arm blubber wobbling like crazy. It was clear Megan had used incredible amounts of butter and sugar, just the way Izzie liked it. Bulldozing through the rich goodies at a speed that surprised even Izzie, she finished in record time and, one hand placed gingerly on her belly, began chugging the gallon of milk, her throat muscles working overtime to pump ever more creamy liquid into her stomach at ever faster rates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing with a triumphant belch punctuated by an unexpected hiccup that caused Izzie's eyes to go wide and both hands to cover her mouth, the massive girl sat back on the couch, breathing heavily at the effort of glutting herself so fast. Both hands gave her visibly more bloated belly happy pats. \"HIC! Phew!! Man those were GOOD. Megs you almost outdo my own mother in how rich those cookies are...a good snack. Megs? Yoohoo!!\" she waved her arms in front of Megan's stunned face \"Earth to Megan! HIC!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...that was the fastest I've seen anyone eat anything...\" Megan managed to finally push out. \"...And I've been rooming with YOU for over a year...It was just incredible...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzie giggled: \"heheheHIC! Oh that? That was nothing. Just you wait until the real food arrives. You better snatch your portion quickly or all of it will end up riiiight here.\" She patted her belly for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't possibly handle all of what you ordered, even if I did let you. You'd pop.\" Megan finally voiced the thought she'd had since Izzie's order. \"I think this is the first night we'll have leftovers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh is it? We'll just see about that.\" Izzie loved a challenge, especially a gluttonous one. \"Don't underestimate what this puppy is capable of handling. HIC! I might even surprise myself tonight.\" She winked at Megan. \"It's not like I don't have a LOT of training, hehehe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Unbelievable. She really thinks she can take it,</i> Megan thought. <i>Well if she can, at least I see a chance to lose some of this weight. All I have to do is eat slowly.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>NO! shouted Megan's other side You can lose your weight WITHOUT pushing Izzie into complete immobility. Just because she wants to stuff herself to bursting doesn't mean you should just LET her!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ahh, but what fun it would be to watch. Megan's libido crooned. Let her go as hog wild as she wants, and just enjoy every growing, jiggling, bloated bit.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan's continued internal crisis was interrupted by a buzz coming from Izzie's bra. \"Oooh can you get the door? I think that's my McDonalds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got McDonalds?\" Megan's eyes widened at the groaning bags she saw the driver carry from the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah. Why not? It's not like it'll ruin my appetite.\"</span></div></div>",

Megan popped in another, but if she were being honest, she barely paid attention to the dubious plot or muscle-car antics of \u201cFurious 8\u201d. Instead she had been watching spellbound at the performance of her huge roommate. Despite telling herself to hold back, Megan had had three full plates of food, and on top of a quarter of a cheesecake, was uncomfortably bloated, but now, as the second movie hit the credits, Izzie was still going strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust over 4 hours had passed, and the gargantuan Latina had steadily gorged, glutted and guzzled her way through the vast majority of the mountainous feast. It wasn\u2019t the voracious, over the top gluttony that Megan had seen when Izzie had packed away her cookies, but a steady, continuous glut. Her eyes might have been glued to the screen, but both hands were active, steadily shoveling platter after platter, burger after burger, and piece of cake after piece of cake, down Izzie\u2019s greedy maw into the seemingly bottomless pit of her hungry stomach, which seemingly called endlessly for more feeding and more indulgence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the credits rolled, Megan watched with interest as Izzie took the last piece of cheesecake and pushed it resolutely into her large mouth with both hands, her fat cheeks swelling out to resemble a hamster\u2019s. Chewing for a few moments, Izzie placed steadying hands on her gut and swallowed heavily, the entire bulging mouthful dumping into her stomach at once, and triggering a large hiccup: \u201cHYELP! Whew!\u201d Izzie slumped back on the creaking couch, licked her fingers and placed them proudly atop her mammoth gut. \u201cNow THAT is what I call a good dinner\u2026.*HYELP* So rich!\u201d She reached down and picked up a half-empty two-liter bottle of pepsi, unscrewed the cap, and upended it into her mouth, her throat greedily making massive swallows to suck the sugary soft drink into her gut as fast as possible. Finishing rapidly, she erupted into another indulgent hiccup, followed by a massive belch as she gently tossed the bottle on top of the mountain of trash and proudly rubbed the turgid flanks of her boiling gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer indulgence had caused her massive stomach to swell and bloat to an obscene state, filling in the four massive rolls of blubber to create a huge, jiggling, audibly bubbling vastly overglutted water-balloon of a belly. Izzie\u2019s breath came in light-ragged gasps as her stomach pushed her lungs to a fraction of their normal allotted space, but she momentarily closed her eyes and enjoyed the feeling of such a huge pile of fatty food churn and roil away within the strained depths of her stomach. <i>I can\u2019t wait till it gets this big without me glutting myself close to bursting.</i> Izzie thought greedily. Opening one eye at Megan, \u201cHYELP! So didja enjoy the show, Megs? URRRRP. Somethin\u2019 else, huh? heheheHYICELP!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I honestly think that is the most I have ever seen anyone eat in one sitting. Ever.\u201d Megan said slowly, her eyes not leaving Izzie\u2019s mountain of a belly. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve watched a lot of internet\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeheheHICC! Toldja my stomach could handle it\u2026HYELP!!\u201d Izzie proudly gave the huge bubbling mass some proud pats. \u201cI don\u2019t know URP!

Getting up for a LONG while\u2026*glorpHELP!*\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat brought Megan back to earth and to a question that had been nagging her for a week now. \u201cSay Izz, that reminds me. Don\u2019t you think your indulgence is...a bit much? Even for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa caught on, huh?\u201d Izzie responded. Megan nodded. The massive Latina scratched her chin. \u201cYou know\u2026ELP! My birthday is in \u2018bout two weeks\u2026HYICC!\u201d Megan nodded again. \u201cWell this year\u2026HYELP!

The amount of food she serves me\u2026HICURRRP\u2026is mindboggling even for me.\u201d Izzie smirked at a memory, \u201cWhy, at my Quincea\u00f1era, she made so much grub\u2026*glorp* that I ate myself out of TWO dresses\u2026HELP!!\u201d She rubbed the top of her superswollen gut. \u201cIf ya don\u2019t want me to explode, I gotta get ready\u2026HYELP!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you just refuse the food after you feel like you\u2019ve had enough?\u201d Megan leaned forward, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzie shot her a look. \u201cURP. Two problems with that. One, you do NOT refuse food from mi Abuela\u2026HYELP! Two, it\u2019s me. I\u2019ll eat anything in sight.

To be able to handle what she might throw at me\u2026HYELP!\u201d Izzie pressed down on the top of her gut, the churning feasts gurgling at the pressure, and jostling a belch. \u201cURRRRP! I know it doesn\u2019t look it but\u2026HYELP! Even I\u2019m not bottomless\u2026.HIC.

Her lust had decisively won out and in a kind of haze, Megan managed to croak \u201cI\u2026I can help ya out if it\u2019s so much work\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHYELP! Oh you would?

He was incredibly thin as he rarely ate the food he made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of Morgan and Lucina's parents were in the military so they weren't home to make Lucina lose weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now it was the summer so Lucina didn't have to take Morgan to school.

After eating Morgan's cooking one too many times she now weighs two hundred pounds. She has short white hair. She used to be quiet and timid but after gaining weight she has gained some confidence but she still has some of her pre-fat traits<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKjelle: Has short teal hair, used to be a major athlete but now weighs 250 pounds. Is somewhat of a tomboy, her and her mother have arguments regarding her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevera: Has long red hair in two pony tails. Acts somewhat like a tsundere but enjoys messing around with people she's friendly with. Is also 200 pounds</span></div></div>",

The din of freshmen moving into Prestonwood\u2019s dormitories mingled with sweet birdsong. However within Room 112, there was only one series of noises that had been repeating themselves for more than an hour:<br>\r\n\u201c*rustle*<br>\r\n*chomp* or *crunch*<br>\r\n*gulp*<br>\r\n*slurp*\u201d<br>\r\nPunctuated by an occasional throaty belch or a light giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa Clarke was lounging luxuriously on an reinforced loveseat on her side of the room that was totally taken up by her immensity. Smiling in satisfaction at her handiwork, she tossed aside a pound bag of M&amp;Ms, her third in the course of 15 minutes, adding to the significant pile of soda bottles, family-size bags of chips, candies, bags of pepperidge farm soft baked cookies, and the occasional box of king-size candy bars, now only filled with wrappers that her eager fat fingers had torn apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the next bag of goodies, Alyssa took a moment to grab at a 3/4 full bottle of Fanta and upend the opening of the bottle into her mouth, the throat muscles buried in her many chins pumping lazily as the carbonated sugary beverage poured into her stomach. Finishing with an indulgent belch, the rapidity of her drinking caused an unexpected hiccup to escape too, causing Alyssa's sparkling dark eyes to widen in surprise:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Hyicc!!!* Oo whoops! Hehehe*hyic!*\u201d The titanic dark brown girl was amused at her body's reaction. Sighing as she leaned back against the cushions of her loveseat, she nonetheless diligently began stuffing more large soft-baked cookies into her mouth with greedy bites. Stacking the cookies four at a time ensured the bag soon emptied and joined its comrades in the \u201cfinished\u201d pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Alyssa brushed the crumbs off her substantial chest and gluttonously picked out pieces that fell into the cleavage of her melon-sized breasts, and contentedly rested her hands briefly on the vast shelf of her huge belly, the surface slightly tight from this most recent \u201csnacking\u201d, on top of two very substantial meals earlier in the day. Giving its vast mass some conceited pats, the huge freshman wondered briefly what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier in the day her father and three burly brothers had moved her luggage into Prestonwood, half of which must have been snacks to survive for perhaps a few days. In the hour or so since they had kissed Alyssa goodbye, however, she had made an significant dent in her snack supply, and Alyssa seriously doubted the rest would hold out by the end of tomorrow. Despite all these piles of fatty junk, Alyssa was far from satisfied, at least mentally. The bustle of moving into her very own place and the thought of her first taste of independence excited her. So did the reputation of the dining facilities at Prestonwood. And when Alyssa Clarke was excited, she ate. And eating excited her still further. For her, it was a virtuous cycle that all but guaranteed her weight continuously climbed upward, usually at a steady clip at home, but the potential of Prestonwood to kick it into high gear caused Alyssa to unconsciously lick her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat decided it. Time to eat. Faranis hall was one of three that contained a cafeteria attached to it, and by the luck of the draw, the entry was only twenty or so feet from Room 112. Grunting with exertion, Alyssa ponderously lifted her 502 pound body...no...507 as of this morning Alyssa thought smugly. She luxuriantly stretched, tank top riding up even further across the vast, somewhat distended surface of her belly. The shirt was intentionally too small. For all the overeating Alyssa did, she was determined that its decadent, blubbery consequences were not to go unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStifling another hiccup, Alyssa grinned wickedly, hands proudly placed atop her gut, \u201c*hic* I\u2019ll meet my roommate later. Let's see if that welcome buffet can handle my appetite\u201d. Jiggling gloriously, the massive teen waddled out of her room, led by the delicious scents just around the corner...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had diligently shoved a literal mountain of rich, heavy calorific food into her cavernous stomach, grossly distending it and bloating her belly to an even more ridiculous and unwieldy size. But Alyssa was pleased as punch. This kind of reckless gluttony is what she lived for, and she basked in some of the shocked stares shot her way as they saw the enormous girl prepare for another massive course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning not only with a small pile of triple stacked bacon cheeseburgers, but also an creation of her own: four stacked sausage pizza slices, numerous pieces of bacon and even more cheeseburger parties in between each slice, slathered in creamy ranch dressing, Alyssa gratefully plopped her engorged body onto the creaking chair and opened her mouth wide to receive the pizza monstrosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is quite the concoction you have there. Wouldn't be surprised if the calorie count is enough for an entire day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice belonged to an girl and was curiously congenial in tone. Alyssa looked up to behold a rather tall skinny blonde with wavy shoulder length hair nicely coiffed, green eyes, a button nose upon which perched small glasses. There was an odd sparkle to her eyes and a playful smile tugging at the corners of her pert mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa blew out a belch behind her hand and smiled widely, \u201c*rrrp* why thank ya so much! It's one of my own creations! I c\u2019n be very clever in devising ways to get as much delicious grub as possible inta this stomach.\u201d She took a massive bite, cheeks bulging, and leaned backward so the blonde could get a better view of just how enormous her gut was, one hand placed proudly on its flank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl giggled gaily: \u201cSo I can see! You must be verrry clever indeed!\u201d She extended her hand \u201cname's Sandra Bandier. Field hockey team recruit. I do believe we are roommates. It's a pleasure!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa made another massive bite and took the hand with the one resting on her belly: \u201c*gulp* I'm Alyssa Clarke. *chomp* Glutton extraordinaire. Hehehe. Always great to meet new friends! How did you come to that conclusion?\u201d She took another large bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSimple! Who else here could possibly leave a small mountain of empty snack and candy containers.\u201d Sandra looked around. \u201cthere are some big appetites here, especially from upperclassmen, but no freshman holds a candle to you.\u201d Sandra sat down next to Alyssa, clearing a space among the stacks of plates and resting her chin on her palms. \u201cShoot, Aly didja really eat all this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra's warm demeanor and the recognition of her immensity made Alyssa beam with pride. Shoving the rest of her pizza creation into her mouth with both hands, she immediately reached for two burgers with both hands, even before swallowing the latest bite: \u201cOomph..yesh! You bet I did! *gulp* And there's plenty *chomp* more ta stuff into this stomach of mine. *gulp*. I gotta feeling *mmph* this is gonna be a really FILLING year *hyic!!*\u201d Finishing the burgers with eager speed, Alyssa again leaned back to show herself off, both hands giving the enormity of her belly a quick succession of playful pats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell damn I'm sure it will be if this is only your first day,\u201d Sandra remarked, \u201cYou're certainly not going to be a boring roommate, that's for sure! I like excitement. Pretty soon I'm gonna hafta roll you outta our room, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*gulp...hyic!\u201d that's the *burp* plan!!\u201d Alyssa responded passionately while double fishing massive burgers from the steadily shrinking pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra blinked, \u201cI meant that kiddingly but you're dead serious about that, aren't you. About purposely getting bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cbigger\u2019n the biggest senior here by the end of the year!\u201d Alyssa responded, beaming. Better to have this conversation with her roommate now. She'd have put two and two together soon enough, Alyssa thought. It's not like I hide what I am. \u201cI know this place's reputation. Wanna put it to the test...*hyic!*\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShiiiiit,\u201d breathed Sandra, \u201cyou sure have ambitions. I've seen some seniors at welcome check-in. Ya got your work cut out for you.\u201d She gave her roommate's vast belly a playful pat. \u201cYa wanna put this place to the test? Or your stomach?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Alyssa's turn to blink. She almost never had such a positive interaction outside her family. Responses varied from stunned shock (which she relished) to abject disgust (which was occasionally upsetting). This was something altogether different, and Alyssa was finding herself liking this spunky, cheerful blonde more by the second. Giggling at Sandra's touch, Alyssa polished off the rest of the burgers: \u201chehehehe *hyiccc!!!* why not both? Ooof look you made me finish all this in record time!\u201d Alyssa's stomach quietly bubbled its input.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh noo we can't have that, can we?\u201d Sandra cried, and leapt up. \u201cI'll do the rounds for ya. Can't have my roommate wasting away on me. That is...if you want more. Ya look pretty full as is.\u201d Sandra cast a wary eye on Alyssa's heavily swollen gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa snorted and gave her belly a rough jiggle with both hands, transfixing Sarah with its wobbling waves of blubber. \u201cI've never let a minor event like feeling full stop me from eating more...*hyicc*...I toldja there's a lot left ta glut inta m'self.\u201d She winked at Sandra. \u201cYou'll get to see what this peachy lil\u2019 sack can really do!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright! That's the spirit!\u201d Sandra laughed and bounded away to the servery.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This meant that she ferried the same huge portions to Alyssa at a significantly faster rate than previously. Not one to back down from an opportunity like this, Alyssa challenged herself to finish the platters Sandra brought before she returned with new ones. The inevitable result was significantly greater volumes of only the richest and most calorific food flooded past Alyssa's eager maw and into the seemingly bottomless pit of her gluttonous stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not until the cafeteria began changing for dinner service that the dynamic duo stop for an breather. Sandra plopped down a tray and sunk into a chair \u201cWhewwww. Goodness who knew one could get a workout like this? No gym for me today thanks to you, Aly...Aly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally given a break, Alyssa slowly slumped back with a loud husky hiccup, her superglutted stomach turgidly boiling at the movement. \u201c*HYELP!!! Oh goshhh...now THAT was real eatin\u2019...*HYELP*!!\u201d Her tank top had pushed up to covering only a quarter of her immense belly, the rest of the massive mountain of caramel blubber exposed for all to see. Despite her stupefying fullness and food-induced stupor, Alyssa could feel the shocked expressions and stares fixed on her engorged belly, and reveled in them. She knew they couldn't believe the sheer volume that Alyssa had gorged into her stomach. That she hadn't made herself sick, and was handling it all with apparent glee. Alyssa glowed with pride as she felt all her gluttony bubble and churn within her. Both arms lay limply to her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her head to fix Sandra with a sloppy, smug grin: \u201cgosh Sandra...ya rrreally know how...*HYELP*...ta keep a girl well fed...oooff...thisss ish one happy stummickk...*BELCH*. Mannn...and thisss is only the first day! *HYIELP!!* Isss gon\u2019 be a riiich year!\u201d She weakly gave her belly some prideful pats and a small jiggle, the digestion glopping grossly and the disturbance jostling out another loud hiccup. \u201c*HELP!!!*\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra whistled: \u201cYa weren't kidding about being a \u201cglutton extraordinaire\u201d. That was all kinds of incredible. I had a hard time keeping up with you sometimes.\u201d She smiled brightly \u201cKeep this up and I don't doubt you'll meet your goal.

She knows that she is beautiful and if people think she is gross then her natural charm soon changes their minds. Always willing to strut her stuff both and an off the dance floor, sometimes to the dismay of onlookers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixe has shoulder length blond hair, which she would often style to frame her deceptively thin face. Her eyes are naturally narrowed slightly, giving her a naturally sultry gaze, weaponry by her emerald green eyes. Her lips are plump and she loves to show them off with different lipsticks. However given her larger size she has developed a slight double chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has never let her size  slow her down, in fact the bigger she got the more she felt she could accomplish. Trixie is a bottom heavy gal, her legs and thighs are thick like tree trunks, holding up her prized feature, her butt. She had always had a big bottom, but at her current weight it is monstrous, two titanic cheeks that she is never afraid to flaunt. Her mid section had become sizeable lately, with her belly slowly catching up with her lower half. Her breasts are her least dominant feature, but due to her weight are still quite sizeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixe was always the live of the party, at least she was in her head (and that is what counts).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to her love of partying she would often wake up with fuzzy memories and a hangover.

She had picked him up last night at her friends party and she did have a fun night with him. She was nude and satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could not recall his name though. Trixie raised her hefty arm as she slammed her alarm clock (it was not helping her hangover), the impact had a rippling effect on her gelatinous body. With that out the way her mind returned to the man still slumbering next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It began with a C\" she thought, turning to face her guest. This is itself was quite the effort as her tremendous weight made such movements quite a chore. \"Craig? Charlie? No, no not them\". After much shifting and jiggling she was on her side facing the man. He was very thin, comically so compared to the behemoth beauty he now shared a bed with. She tenderly caressed his chest, he had a sort of lean muscular build.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie licked her plump lips, preparing for her favourite part of her drunken encounters. You see she knew that although there are men out there who would love her 500 lbs frame and worship her like the goddess she is, there are many who found her undesirable. But the latter would often end up spending the night anyway, bets with friends or simply drinking too much are often the most most common reasons for a man to exit his comfort zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Trixie had a sure fire way to find out what kind of guy she had picked up by the next morning. She leaned in and began to kiss him, the mystery man began to stir, like so many others before him. The kiss grew in passion, her partner now returning to the waking world. But as she practised many times before she slammed her weight on top of him. Her oceans of fat engulfed the tiny man. Her whole body wobbled, not least of which was her butt, now sticking in the air on full display. She covered him like a blanket of pure fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was the moment of truth, she broke the kiss, though not before giving him a quick lick, to discover the look on his face was that of .......</span></div></div>",

His world, as of this moment is dominated by a behemoth and try as he might he could not prevent his facial expressions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking above him, his view was that of a beautiful woman, her cheeks slightly rounded but judging by this feature alone one would not guess that there was a mammoth body attached. Speaking of which, he was currently being crushed. His entire frame was swallowed by her blubber. She was heavy, so heavy he was struggling to breathe. But this was just the tip of the over fed ice berg. This encounter being first thing in the morning after a rather active evening, the mystery woman was covered in sweat. This made her jiggly fat, a smiley, sticky feel. Finally, the nail in the coffin, he could feel her stomach growl. A vibration that seemed to shack his entire being. He had to get out here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like an eternity, trapped beneath this whale of a woman. But in reality it was just a few moments. During which he could smell her alcohol tinged morning breath, her lips being only a few inches from his face (he knew his breath was probably not much better though). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixie had practised this many times. She knew exactly how long to wait before continuing her little game. \"Speechless I see\", she breathed, maintaining her seductive allure. It was obvious that he was not into her, at least not while her was sober, so she moved onto the next stage of her plan. \"I am going to use the little girls room sweetie\" she winked, before leaning in to kiss his cheek. \"Don't go anywhere\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she began the task of getting up. Never easy for someone her size. She shifted from side to size building momentum to flip herself onto her back. Her body quaking in an seemingly endless wave, on occasion some part of her fat body slap against her slim bedmate. Once on her back she shifted round and begun to stand. Arms out stretched she pushed forward letting her body weight do the work, presenting her mountainous rear end to her guest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce stood she proceeded towards the bathroom. Waddling in such a manner to shake her hip as much as possible, she putting on a show after all. On the way in she saw his underwear thrown on the floor, she kicked it into the bathroom ahead of her. As she reached the door she turned sideways, as the door could not quite handle her huge hind quarters. Finally she winked at him before closing the door, finally remembering his name \"Carl\", she knew it was a \"C\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl lay there recovering from that onslaught, watched what he assumed was meant to be a sexy display. As soon as the bathroom door shut, he scrabbled out of her bed and frantically gathered his clothes. He knew his underwear was long gone, to his knowledge she simply could not see them due to her girth. He cursed under his breath as jumped into his pants and made a mad dash toward the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrixe conducted her business in the bathroom as usual, listening to the commotion. She found this was the best way to deal with the morning after, it let the undesirable guys flee with a bit of dignity, while those who truly appreciated her beauty found the show quite enticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was sure he had left, she exited the bathroom. She found that he had left via the front door, so she had to re-apply some of her locks, but all in all this encounter was pretty painless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis underwear was now clasped in her hand, she proceeded to fold them. Returning to her room she approached her draws, opening the third draw down. Inside is a collection of men's underwear. They are sorted by type, and these dark blue, tight fit boxers are now safely added to the collection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There\", she announced to herself with pride. \"Now what should I do?\"</span></div></div>",

She continued to look stunned up at the behemoth of a woman on top of her slender but curvy body. Trixie couldn't help but let out a girlish giggle of amusement at the startled expression on her guest's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly mistaking the huge woman's laugh for one of malice, the woman below her began screaming in panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's not very nice is it?\" Trixie pouted. \"I give you the gift of sleeping with me and all my beautiful curves, and this is what I get?\" Her words did nothing to quell the yells beneath her hovering flesh. Clearly the girl was too terrified to bother listening. How rude. \"Well, we can't have you waking the whole world up, can we?\" Trixie's eyes lit up. \"But I know how to fix that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slender woman's screams were suddenly cut off as Trixie wrapped her own plump lips around her guest's mouth and began to kiss the woman deeply, shoving her thick tongue down her throat. The mystery woman tried to continue shouting, but the only thing should could do was scream into Trixie's cavernous mouth, reducing them to barely audible muffled yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Trixie's bountiful flesh having settled back atop the woman, burying her again underneath a blanket of fat, she reached her arms up to Trixie's shoulders and pushed, in a pointless attempt to lift the enormous woman off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heavy woman just laughed into the kiss in response, something that further unsettled the slim woman. Without breaking the smothering kiss, Trixie grabbed her guest's hands and pulled them down until they were resting on the spheres of fat that were her mountainous ass cheeks. As expected the hands tried to leave their new home, but Trixie kept a firm grip, instead using them to rub in a successful effort to further stimulate her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn protest, the woman began to kick and flail her comparatively tiny body around. All the thrashing violently rocked the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmmm,\" Trixie moaned into the woman's mouth, as the girl's efforts also kept the gargantuan woman rocking and rubbing along her slender body, the oceans of fat wobbling. The bed creaked with the vigorous motions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for a couple of minutes until the smaller woman eventually gave up. Clearly there was no way she was ever going to pry the huge beast of a woman off of her. As her limbs settled, the enormous woman got the message and released the forceful kiss, both women taking gulps of air. Though they had both been able to breathe through their nose, it was still a relief to be able to breathe unhindered through the mouth again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Trixie addressed the smaller woman with an annoyed glint in her eyes. \"You were very rude to me.\" Her frown then transitioned into a playful smile. \"You will need to be punished for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smaller woman's eyes widened in fear once again, wondering to herself when this torture would end, and how she ever put herself in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'll give you a choice which part of my body I'll bury you under.\" Trixie smirked. As the slender woman opened her mouth to protest, Trixie shot her hand forward with unbelievable speed for her size, and placed a finger against her lips to shush her. \"But if you don't choose, or protest in any way, I'll make the decision for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich part of her huge body does Trixie bury her guest under?</span></div></div>",

Six hundred and forty pounds of beautiful.  But, it never hurts to build on beauty, to plump to perfection, to improve on immensity.\" Wendy giggled, making her massive rolls shake provocatively. It was her turn to smirk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's this food? I'm hungry to get started now,\" Wendy said, firmly. \"You want to improve on my immensity?\" As she turned, she saw the eager longing on Chad's face and elsewhere. \"Well, someone's a little eager to indulge my fat appetites.

Wendy huffed as she waddled over to the massive chair, her nose drinking in the rich aromas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the table sat four big cakes, one chocolate, one vanilla, one cheesecake, one carrot.  A hamper of fresh, warm bread rolls sat beside a chafing dish piled high with french fries.  Another chafing dish kept a variety of breaded fried chicken pieces warm.  Another contained a rich, meat lasagna, oozing cheese. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy looked at the meal  and thought she's arrived in heaven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All for you.\" spoke Chad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's not enough, there's meat pies and apple pies at the ready,\" a waiter in formal uniform gravely intoned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChad's earlier comment about heart attacks and diabetes flitted across the top of Wendy's mind, then was lost again, as glutttony took over.

What sat on the table was a miracle to behold. <br>\r\n4 chocolate cakes with chocolate icing, 6 servings of French fries, deep fried, and a grand total of 72 Chicken strips. She looked at it as though the whole width and breadth of heaven had descended before her. \"All for you.\" spoke Chad. \"Oh, and don't you worry. This isn't just a one-time thing. Expect this, every meal, every day.\" Wendy thought that if she didn't have a heart attack by the end of the month, she'd have one right here, right now. She dove in, not even using forks for the cake. She dug the cakes out with her fingers, feeling the sugar rush through her system, powering her on. Her stomach prepared for the 30,000+ calorie meal, expanding and expanding as she ate all four cakes. She alternated between them and the mounds of fries, consuming the salt-laden potato sticks. Chad's words from earlier rang in her brain. \"I'm talking about heart attacks, diabetes, all sorts of things like that.\" It felt odd, but she didn't care anymore. At a time, she would have tried to lose all of this for convenience's sake. But at this point, she equivocated it to being a race to the bucket, to see how fast she could kick it, or how she would. Or, how long it would take. This ran through her mind as she jammed the Chicken strips down her throat, from 72, down to 65, decreasing drastically with each bite. Eventually, as the strips ran dry, she dove into the last remaining challenge; The mountain of fries. The fries being small, she simply gulped them down in droves. The last few fries left her exhausted, she simply fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe woke up in the next few hours, and was greeted by another such miracle; A cheesecake, an entire turkey, and 6 burgers. She tore into them as well, eating them and gulping them down the same way. After she finished this stuffing, she had gone right back to sleep.

This was rather fortunate, as she was amazingly thirsty.  She gave her right foot a shake to bring it awake, it seeming to have fallen asleep.  She sighed and opened the refrigerator, grabbing some of the Pepsis and opening one of them and sipping on it for a while to alleviate the dryness. She got up with the use of the bars installed near the cieling, and waddled slowly to the bathroom located right next to her room, the door actually inside her room. <i>This guy's got plans</i>, thought Wendy, as she saw the extremely large toilet, and shower so wide it could fit a party of eight people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat down to urinate, the thoughts began drifting in her head. She felt in no way inclined to feel guilty about her weight. In a way, she was coming to terms with her own mortality. Just the other day, she actively acknowledged she was, in a way, committing suicide by food. She was always a fat child, and her grandmother didn't help by feeding her 24/7. She came to terms with her weight when she tried to exercise one day in college, back on the day when she discovered she hit 400 pounds, but she couldn't go 15 seconds without almost dying, just doing some basic crunches. After that, she dived into her dirge of gluttony that set her on the path of 700 pounds. She shook her right foot again, and got up, flushing the massive toilet, and she took her shower, and in this shower, she came to terms, with a simple thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I will die soon. But I will die doing something that I love doing. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a reassurance, and with this, she could keep going ahead with the plan. Her mind turned no longer to the fact that she was dying. She looked at the joys that would lead to her death. The feasting, the laziness, the pure and unlimited gluttony.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she got out of the shower, Chad stood outside after she put on the loose, almost tent-sized garment and the elastic-waistbanded pants. \"Hello, my little feedee. I cooked you breakfast, one fit for a queen.\" Wendy giggled, sending waves of fat tidal-waving down her stomach. \"Okay, my executioner-by-food. I'm ready.\" She waddled slowly, Chad kept pace with her. She saw the table laid out; Two pounds of bacon, 20 Biscuits with ham, eggs, and bacon, 26 Sausages, 4 fried goose eggs, and the crown of the meal, a 5-deep stack of 6 diameter pancakes,each weighing 100 grams, with butter drizzling down the tower of the massive pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah, I might be dying.  But I'll enjoy this death.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dug through the meal with determination, but Chad had other business. Unbeknownst to his little feedee, he had set up a video camera in her room, and he was monitoring her. He had feared this would come. The thirst, the urination need, the numbness, and his readings all indicated one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis feedee's death had already started in the developing diabetes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew this would happen, but he wondered when. His massive splurge of sugar the last night had to have been the nail in an ever-building coffin of sugar and carbs. But his feeder determination built around it. He had to keep going with the feeding, Sugar or no sugar. The head of his massive cooking staff approached him. \"Morning, sir. What do you have prepared for lunch?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to make this choice now. He had to think about this, to speed her gain, but kill her faster, or to find an alternate way of gaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he spoke. \"She'll have..\"</span></div></div>",

He knew that, with a limited time on this earth, he should show her all the love and affection she deserved, As such, he made precise calculations. The two combined meals of 30,000+ calories yesterday, combing with this meal of at least 25,000 calories gave him confidence that she'd put more weight on in these two days than any normal person ever had in a month. And as such, he knew exactly what was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table had been cleared of the mountainous meal, such a great, overwhelming meal. Even this massive blue garment showed effects. Suddenly, she heard a  <u><b>Crrrrrrack</b></u>! The chair was torn asunder by the pressure of the 700 pound woman sitting on it, the woman landing flat on her back on the padded chair. Chad mounted her and the exhausted woman sat back, and chad had his pleasure. \"Well..Seems like we're gonna do a bit more than eat here...\" The morbidly obese woman laid back and let her feeder do the work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after this parade of pleasure, Wendy dug into the new meal. All in all, it totalled up to about another 30,000 calories in her, and as every other calorie in her life, it all went unburnt, for the most part. Wendy's eyes began blurring and she began seeing spots. Chad walked up, holding a syringe. \"Dearie, I have something to tell you..\" Wendy waved her hand. \"I...I know. I've been expecting it for a while now, just inject me.\" Chad rolled up her massive blue garment, surprisingly with ease, as it contained less and less of her whale-like figure. He injected her with the insulin, and then spoke. \"C'mon, dear. Let's see how much you weigh.\" The pair waddled to the massive room, in the middle of which was a freight-like scale. \"Get on it, dearie.\" Wendy waddled on. The scale showed up: 800 pounds. 100 pounds in the span of about two days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChad and wendy both shared a smile; They had done good work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the months pressed on, Wendy developed more and more health complications.

She disregarded the High blood pressure and ate salt with wild abandon, only really paying attention, yet still somewhat disregarding the dietary problems, relying on heavy doses of Insulin to delay a sugar coma.

Her table extended all the way down the rest of the massive hospital bed, and the breakfast was laid out; 10 stacks of 5 of the massive pancakes, all with massive slabs of butter, 6 pounds of bacon, and 5 scrambled eggs. The morbidly obese woman plowed through the meal, while Chad watched on through the cameras. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had figured out he ought to go whole hog on this, disregarding medical conditions. If he was going to kill this woman, he was going to kill her, and he might as well get it over with. He expected wendy to die any day now, so he had a custom-sized coffin crafted, and a custom-sized grave plot prepared.  As wendy dug through them, he had her heart rate constantly monitored, the woman now slowly getting too fat to speak in a constant sentance without panting every few sentances. It was a complete miracle that she had not died yet, and her promise of death coming on soon became more and more real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreakfast hadn't finished with the 30,000 calories she had already taken in: After being put on a respirator, Wendy was fed another three pounds of bacon, and then breakfast had ceased, lunch already prepared.</span></div></div>",

Wendy, with her typical gusto, dug into the fattening meal, as Chad watched her. <i>Any time now</i>, he thought to himself. He began weaning himself off the grief. He knew exactly what he was doing when he found Wendy, and he knew he would kill this girl. He had no right to cry now; He had done plenty of that when he found out that Wendy had diabetes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had no clue it would be this soon, but this was the fattest he had ever gotten a girl. With each day's gain, including today, he felt a form of pride that he had gotten a girl this fat. This would go in the record books, but he began shutting himself up about the fact. No, he wouldn't put her in the freak show pages. He'd keep her a secret, his own personal fat girl. Maybe one day he'd have one fatter than her. But not any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe I could even take a girl from being skinny to getting this fat. </i> That thought excited Chad. Especially if such a girl would start off athletic and healthy, and he'd end up killing her the same way he had killed Wendy. He previously had trouble coming to terms with the fact that he was, indirectly, a murderer. But at this point, he had gotten past this, and got a form of odd sexual arousement out of killing women with obesity. Especially Heart Attacks, previously he had paid hospitals discreetly for tapes of obese patients who died on tape of a myocardial infarction, and he would use them as a sick form of porn. He now had to waste no money paying hospitals for these; He could get the experience himself. But today, he wanted one thing in particular; If he could keep his personal butterball alive until supper, he'd be able to take her as she died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy was still eating lunch as suppertime rolled around. Chad nodded to the attendants waiting outside her room with the massive amount of food. He would keep her eating, today she would literally eat to death.</span></div></div>",

She had eaten the most one day in college when she ate a 50,000 calorie meal in one sitting during her visit to the Heart Attack Grill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had eaten another such meal on a dare when going to a pizza place renowned for their massive pizzas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in all of her fatty-laden life, Wendy had never seen a meal this {b<i>}massive</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attendants brought in a massive amount of food: 30 heaping plates of Chicken Carbonara with cheese drizzled on top,  65 plates of Chicken Alfredo, and 125 whopping plates of Pasta Primavera. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy braced herself; She was eating for her life. Or her death, rather. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChad had prepared himself for this last ride as he watched Wendy deny all plates and forks and use her oceanous, wobbling arms to simply pick up the various pastas and shove them down her massive mouth. The amount of food going in would make a fitness instructor die of fright, and any celebrity in hollywood swear off food alltogether. Chad had done his math on this one, but this was nowhere near done. He would take out wendy in a bang, and the widened door suited the next treat, which literally rumbled through the halls. But he wanted to wait to introduce Wendy's end until after she finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy had no time to stop to breathe, or pause for drink; She ate uncontrolled, almost to her suicide. She had eaten record-breaking meals this week alone, and as it was about to crown off, she wondered how many calories she was taking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that she had any regrets; She simply wanted to know how many calories she ate. She didn't know why, but she had a feeling deep down in her massive gut, that this was her last day on this earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSHe laid back in her hospital bed, as a loud 'RRRRRRIP!' tore the table off the wall; It was her unmeasurably overstuffed stomach that ended the table, and as she panted and sweated all over the bed, they brought in the masterpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh good lord</i>, thought wendy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHey had brought in a cake as tall as she was; 5'6, all chocolate, and it measured in at 300,000 calories.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInevitably, Wendy had finished the cake; At points they literally had to pour the cake onto her, but the insulin injector did not come out. Her eyes were starry and she began having a headache. Chad had entered the room, as the attendants shut the door and locked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChad stripped naked, and wendy panted, and after two minutes, she spoke as she caught her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You..*Pant* *Wheeze* Want..*Pant* One...*Wheeze*..Last..*Pant* Ride?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChad simply nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Things had changed completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days after that, Chad noticed her diabetes started to become more severe. Her body was becoming less able to produce insulin, but somehow, Wendy plowed into the food placed in front of her every day. The girl had also developed an irregular heartbeat, which was the result of what he thinks was a heart attack she'd already suffered, but just wasn't sure. When he'd believed it to be happening was the day she was more gluttonous than ever, demanding even more food, piling anything placed in front of her in her month, wanting to forget the pain she was experiencing from her collapsing chest cavity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy had grown completely immobile a long time ago. The once 800 pound girl had gained 300 pounds since then, nailing her down to the bed at 1100 pounds. Her belly rested far out in front of her, and her meaty thighs helped to keep her pinned down. She laid on her back, but occasionally, she liked to be rolled over to rest on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChad had noticed in the last day to two, she'd been complaining about not being able to make anything come out her gigantic rear. \"She must be incontinent now. She'll eventually have to go. It's gotta come out sometime.\" He put that thought on a shelf in his head, and wheeled a large cart out of the kitchen, followed by his army of servants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Chad finally passed the last room before where she was, he heard her rip a loud fart. Clearly, today she'd finally let loose, or she was just getting gassier because of it. He wheeled in the first cart, and the servants took over from there. They unloaded the food all in front of her, and she began scooping it all into her greedy mouth, leaving nothing to spare. Chad went around her bed to check her monitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls heart rate was now steady over 115 bpm, and he knew with each day, it would grow and grow. \"No turning back now.\" he thought to himself. He injected her with insulin, and a chemical cocktail of other things to keep her going pain free, and let her go to work. The mornings meal consisted of 100 pancakes, at least 10 pounds of bacon (with grease saved for drinking), 5 pounds of sausages, and a large bowl of hash browns. It was enough to get her through breakfast, while the chefs prepped for lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach gurgled. She quickened her pace, shoving more and more in her mouth, almost to the point of not being able to swallow. She was now sweating profusely, and her monitor showed an increase in her heart rate, steadily climbing above 130 bpm. \"Wendy, what's wrong? Are you alright? What's going on?\" </span></div></div>",

The overwhelmingly obese girl, however, couldn't prevent herself from caving to the massive hunger pangs ripping through her only cavernous stomach. Sighing, and hoping her boss would forgive her, Wendy resolved to giver her stomach a 'proper' breakfast and pulled into a McDonalds Drive-Thru and ordered two huge sacks of breakfast goodies, pulling into the parking lot, she ate with fierce abandon, and soon all of it was safely packed into her huge gut, which was slightly more bloated than before. Sighing happily, Wendy stifled a belch and started her car once again, driving across the street to Burger King and ordering the equivalent there. Then to Wendy\u2019s. Then to Krispy Kreme, and finally to Dunkin Donuts, where she, with difficulty, polished off three dozen donuts and a large bag of breakfast sandwiches. Now broke, stuffed, and her car awash in boxes, bags, and wrappers, Wendy unabashedly hiccupped and blearily patted the top of her now significantly engorged gut, which had bloated out to make steering difficult. This was how she liked herself, satisfied to the point of stupidity, full beyond reckoning, and able to feel the small mountain of food bubble away in her gigantic gut. giving herself a few minutes to digest, she smiled: \u201cHIC! Ah, now that\u2019s better...URP! Nothing like a...HIC...nice BIG breakfast...HIC...to start my day. Oooh...HIC!! I wonder what they got left over...URP...at the restaurant...HIC...hehehe no wonder I\u2019m getting so huge...HIC...\u201d <br>\r\nIt was true. Over the past 6 months, the already huge Wendy had undergone an even more accelerated weight-gain, especially in her magnificent belly, which now was the most prominent part of her huge body and embodied a huge towering mountain of quaking, wobbling, often supergorged blubber. If there were two things that defined Wendy Sanders, it was that she was immensely lazy, and she loved to eat, and never really STOP eating, and drinking. Every night was a haze of alcohol-fueled gluttony that left her more often than not comatosely passed out on her couch, unbelievably gorged and incredibly drunk. Wendy resolved herself to live life to its fullest and she would happily define herself as a glutton and a huge hedonist, her pleasures just happened to be eating impossible amounts of food, and drinking impossible amounts of beer. The fact that she actually liked the incredible weight of her gargantuan gut just made it all the easier to eternally feed herself. Now ready to go, Wendy sighed happily and with difficulty steered her way to the diner in which she worked.<br>\r\n\tIt took her a little while to get herself there though, for as full as she was, she couldn\u2019t help stopping here and there along the way to indulge in more fatty treats and breakfast goodies, so much so that steering honestly became a problem and Wendy nearly lost control of the steering wheel to the unstoppable tide of her blubbery belly. Finally creaking into the parking lot, Wendy hiccupped again and struggled for at least 10 minutes to haul her giant fat body out of her car, which groaned gratefully with relief. At last out, Wendy brushed the crumbs off her blouse, hiccupped again and swayed for a moment, adapting to the new weight from the mountain of food inside her huge gut: \u201cHICC!! Oof what a weight....HIC...Let\u2019s hope Work is exciting...\u201d and waddled off into the restaurant.</span></div></div>",

This was actually becauase Helen wanted to make sure that there was someone fatter than her, and took a malicious interest in seeing Wendy\u2019s massive size only increase with her time at the diner. However, today Wendy saw a new face at her post, a college girl, from the looks of it, slim, slender, with hefty tits well on display in her low-cut shirt.

You\u2019ll be keeping your same salary.\u201d She smiled ingratiatingly. Wendy blinked a few times, stunned at what she heard, and didn\u2019t even bother to stifle the hiccup that gave away her swollen state.<br>\r\n\t\u201cHICCC...wait...so you\u2019re basically paying me to stuff my face? Do you actually mean it?\u201d Wendy\u2019s greedy mind whirred with excitement. The portions at Helen\u2019s diner were huge, and many normal customers didn\u2019t even finish half without feeling stuffed. The fact that all that leftover food from a full day of many, many customers would be funneled into her stomach was dizzyingly exciting, and Wendy began massaging the bloated top-shelf of her giant gut in eagerness.<br>\r\n\tHelen smiled: \u201cOf course I mean it. You\u2019d better get to it, the first set of breakfast customers are finishing their meals,\u201d and indicated to a group of about 12 people pushing away their platters. Wendy giggled happily and rapidly shuffled off, while Helen grinned wickedly: I wonder how long it\u2019ll be till the pig can\u2019t move that stupidly fat gut of hers. Of course, Wendy didn\u2019t see this, and had waddled into the kitchens, her mouth already stuffed with bacon from a bussed plate. Seating herself comfortably out of view of the guests, Wendy giggled like a child on Christmas morning and began her day of feasting.</span></div></div>",

What a day it was, completely saturated with massive mountains of leftover food that avalanched into Wendy\u2019s titanic stomach. Even for a veteran glutton such as Wendy, this was totally beyond anything she had ever experienced, but she adapted manfully. By 9PM, she was plopped on the floor on her massive ass, her shirt completely rolled up displaying her astronomically swollen and overstuffed blubbery belly in all its magnificent glory. Wendy was so jam-packed with food, she could barely even think, but was greedy as ever, shovelling her umpteenth plate of triple-fried french fries and chocolate cake into her stomach, giggling stupidly. As far as she was concerned, she had somehow landed the jackpot that all gluttons wish for, being paid to stuff herself, and whether her body liked it or not, she was going to take advantage of it until she could literally not cram one more bite of delicious food into her exploding stomach. Wendy finished her last dessert (for now) when Marissa walked in, and despite her general unflappability, had to gasp in shock at how much bigger Wendy had glutted herself.<br>\r\n\tWendy woozily looked up, her hands perched contentedly the top swell of her mammoth gut: \u201cHICCC HICCC HICCC HILLP!!! Holy crap what a day...HIC...God I love my new job...HICCC. hehehe...HILP...hehehe I can feel all that food...HIICCC sloshing around inside...HICC my stomach...URRP...oooff it\u2019s so rich...HILP!!\u201d Wendy drunkenly patted her gut proudly and took yet another large plate of leftovers and funneled it into her eager mouth, exploding into another rich hiccup.<br>\r\n\tMarissa blinked confusedly: \u201cWendy...I...I don\u2019t know what to say. I don\u2019t know how you haven\u2019t exploded yet. I hope for your sake you don\u2019t get sick or indigestion. How are you going to keep this up?\u201d<br>\r\n\tThrough a mouthful of food, Wendy snorted derisively and roughly slapped her supergorged belly, sending waves of blubber and bubbling squelches with every impact: \u201cHIC HILP!! Don\u2019t worry, skinny. I\u2019ve been overeating my entire...HIC HILP life...I know how to put it away...HIC URRRP!! My stomach can basically...HIC...handle anything I shove into it...HIC HILP...I know what I\u2019m doing...HILP...now can you pass me that...HIC...platter of cheese potatoes? HILPP!!!\u201d Marissa laughed genially and did so, also shepherding a pitcher of beer for Wendy to enjoy. The two women smiled and Wendy knew she had found a new friend. After another 5 massive plates, and fiinally finished, Wendy ever-so-slowly rolled, her gluttony bubbling and sloshing loudly inside of her, onto her hugely overinflated stomach and stood up, stumbling to the back door.<br>\r\n\tMarissa, concerned, offered to drive her inebriated and engorged coworker home, an offer gratefully accepted. Accented with hiccup-rich phrases, Marissa learned from Wendy that she was currently living alone in a double apartment, and so the two resolved to become roommates. Seeing that Wendy would be spending the foreseeable future gorged out of her wits, she\u2019d need someone to drive her to and from work, and Marissa, newly moved into the area, needed a conveniently close place to live. The fact that Marissa seemed to almost slavishly admire Wendy\u2019s gargantuan size would make things even easier.<br>\r\n\tWendy finally got home, and it was all she could do to drag herself to the couch, not negelecting to grab a stack of pastries and a growler of beer. Crashing down with a gigantic *GLOOOSH GURGLE*, she giggled greedily as she filled her mouth with twinkies, ho-hos, mass-produced fudge, and calorific beer and reflectively patted her huge belly now crushing her fat-stuffed legs. If she continued this for ANY period of time, her weight would absolutely skyrocket, but in her food-stuffed mind\u2019s rationale, it was an price totally worth paying. Hiccupping richly and contentedly patting her supergorged stomach, she slowly dozed off dreaming of food, food and more food!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The alarm clock sounded its shrill song of the morning, but a few seconds after, a fat-stuffed hand with sausage-fingers fumbled for the snooze button. Wendy lay lounging in bed comfortably warm, and still comfortably gorged, until Marissa called coaxingly: \u201cWENDY! Come on! We gotta go to the diner so you can clock in some bonus hours!\u201d It was a Saturday, and Wendy wasn\u2019t on duty, but she often went and did her \u2018work\u2019 anyway to earn overtime. Grumbling miserably, but still wanting food, Wendy slowly dumped her gargantuan body out of her bed, onto the floor with a great *SLOP GLOOOSH*, punctuated by a rich hiccup. Fridays were often the busiest days at the diner, and so Wendy was still quite stuffed from her day of eating, but that certainly wouldn\u2019t stop her from gorging more. The month had indeed passed in a flood of food, drink and mountains of new blubber. Already a massive 630 pounds when she started her new job at the Diner, Wendy had simply ballooned, gaining over 100 pounds in such a short period of time, the majority of that weight piling itself on her truly mammoth, gargantuan, titanic belly. With Marissa happily taking care of most everything, Wendy only had to focus all her energies on eating as much as she possibly could and cramming as much as possible into her stomach, a job that Wendy took to like a fish to water. Nevertheless, Wendy still grumbled at having to move her incredibly difficult body from her comfortable bed. Hiccupping again, she dragged herself on her hugely swollen belly to a reinforced bar and slowly dragged her massively heavy body up onto her relatively pathetic legs. <br>\r\nStill complaining, Wendy, unsteadily patted her mammoth belly and slowly wobbled herself into the kitchen, crashed down on the floor on her giant ass, and cheerfully greeted Marissa: \u201cHICCC...\u2019morning Marissa honey...HIC HIC...thanks for getting me up...HIC...can you get me some breakfast...HICC before we go? HIC...my little belly\u2019s HUNGRY...HILP!!\u201d Wendy giggled and immediately snatched a platter of fudge and promptly stuffed all of it into her eager mouth. <br>\r\n\tMarissa, though used to this consumption, had to admit this pre-work gluttony was new: \u201cUhm...Wendy, you know that if we leave now, within 15 minutes you\u2019ll have more food than you could possibly dream of? I\u2019m just worried that if you eat a full meal now, you\u2019ll not be able to handle everything that\u2019s dumped into your stomach, especially after last night.\u201d It was true, as last night was possibly the most Wendy had ever stuffed into herself, and by the end of the night even Wendy admitted she could barely keep all of her day\u2019s glutting down into her huge, cavernous, gut. Yet, somehow she did, and somehow Marissa coaxed her to roll home, but if Wendy was still this gorged after a full night\u2019s sleep, there was no saying what would happen today. Still, if anyone could do it, Marissa reasoned, it would be Wendy and her amazing stomach.<br>\r\nWendy laughed genially at Marissa\u2019s worry and belched richly, her eyes glinting greedily: \u201cUURRRP! You\u2019re adorable, Skinny...HIC...to worry about me....HIC...like that...HILP!!! I know how stuffed I am now...HICC...but I know I can...HIC...take anything they throw at me...HIC HIC...I know...HIC...my stomach can handle anything...HIC...even after a proper breakfast. I want to make today...URP...a day to truly remember!\u201d Wendy patted her gorged gut eagerly, and Marissa had no choice but to agree, and soon Wendy was stuffing herself on all sorts of pastries, danishes, pancakes, waffles, and other breakfast goodies that Marissa whipped together out of the refrigerator. Finally, after a long and massive gorge, satiated for now, Wendy greedily hiccupped and slowly, with her busty friend supporting as much weight as she could bear, stumbled her way to the car and made the short journey to Helen\u2019s Diner. Dumping herself out of Marissa\u2019s van, Wendy ponderously made her wobbly way to the diner\u2019s back door, and disappeared, promising Marissa to call when she was finished. Silently wishing her friend the best, Marissa drove off and waited to see the results.<br>\r\nWendy waddled in and was promptly faced with a huge pile of leftover plates, and a wickedly grinning Helen: \u201cHello Wendy dear, I hope you brought your appetite, cuz today we\u2019re even BUSIER than yesterday! I\u2019ll need you to pack it away double time for me, can you handle that?\u201d<br>\r\nWendy could only beam ecstatically, richly belch and give her standard reply: \u201cUURRP. Helen don\u2019t you worry...HIC...you can count...HIC...on me...I can handle ANYTHING!\u201d And with that she collapsed down with an SQUELCH and began glutting with ferocity, spreading her legs so her mammoth belly could spread across the floor and bloat larger and larger with impunity without crushing her tree-trunk legs. Despite her already swollen and stuffed state, the Glutton in Wendy drove her to higher and higher feats of excess, and she challenged herself to outdo yesterday\u2019s record, even while filled with the huge breakfast she just ingested. Thus inspired, Wendy ate and ate and ate and ate and ATE, and massive quantities of greasy, succulent, fatty food slammed into her already engorged gut, exploding it in size and heaviness, a sensation that only caused Wendy to giggle woozily and continue eating with even more aggressiveness. Food, glorious food! greasy flavors mixed with savoury and clashed with sweet, and all were crammed into the giant vat of Wendy\u2019s stomach, which slopped, bubbled, and mixed them all into a toxic mixture of fattening goodness guaranteed to overload her already titanic body with more pounds of delicious, soft, heavy lard. So focused on eating was Wendy that she did not notice that hte plates she received were fully overloaded with food, not the half-eaten plates that would typically come in from customers. Indeed, Helen had decided to accelerate Wendy\u2019s poundage and the diner was actually closed to customers on Saturday, but the entire kitchen staff was in and employed in solely cooking massive meal after massive meal for their gargantuan employee. However, if Wendy knew, she\u2019d probably be even more overjoyed that she and her incredible stomach could handle such a massive volume of food.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At about 7:30 in the evening, Marissa began to worry about Wendy\u2019s whereabouts, as she got not one phone call from either her or Helen, as she usually did. Just as she was going to drive over to the diner to see for herself, she heard an incredibly drunk giggle followed by an incredibly massive hiccup, the jingling of the lock, and Wendy\u2019s call: HIC HILP...HICC HILLLPP!!!!! MARISS...HIC...A!!! I\u2019m.....HIC HILP!! BAAACKKK....HILP!!\u201d Wendy sloshed into her apartment and collapsed with a giant *GLOOSH* onto her titanic gut and started to drag herself toward a shocked Marissa. \u201cWHUTT a day...HILP!! NEVER have I EVER...HICC...seen such EATINGS...HILLP HILP!!! Everything...HICC was well...HIC HILP...made...and impossible...HILP...to resist...I\u2019ve...HILP...been gorging...HIC...glutting...stuffing...HIC and feasting...HILP so much....HIC...I\u2019ve lost track...URP of how much is bubbling and churning inside me...HIC...only that I...HIC HILP...NEVER, EVER...HIC HIC HILP!! have been SO HUGELY CRAMMED...HILLP with delicious FOOD...HIC HILP! OH it was RICH, Marissa...RI-ACHH...HIILLLLPP!!\u201d With that Wendy flung herself onto her back in one, concerted violent motion that caused her body to explode in giant bubbling and boiling of struggling digestion, and all at once exposed how massively the day\u2019s eatings had swollen her already titanic belly. Gasping at the massive weight of her gluttony sloshing on top of her, Wendy nevertheless hiccupped richly and propped her head against a wall, one of her hands listlessly draped on the upper part of her exploding belly, a stupidly contented smile plastered on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarissa at this point could only laugh at her friend\u2019s mammoth gluttony and incredible size and tease her: \u201cWell you\u2019ve really done it now, Wendy. You can barely move your massive gut of yours, you\u2019ve stuffed too much into it. You should be ashamed of yourself. It\u2019d serve you right if you split apart right here, or at least had a massive attack of acute indigestion.\u201d Marissa folded her arms across her impressive bosom and gave Wendy a mock-fierce look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this, Wendy only snickered contentedly and casually smacked her mountainous belly a few times: \u201cHILLPP!!! HAH Fat chance...HIC HIC HILP!! My stomach can handle ANYTHING...HIC HIC I dump into it...and this time I truly believe it...HIC HIC HILP!! HIC HILP!!! I just...HIC...kept eating...HIC...eating...HIC...eating...HIC..and EATING and I could just keep cramming it down...HILLP!!! My belly just gets bigger...HILP!! Fatter...HILP!! and more HUGE!!!! UUURRPPP!!! And I\u2019m ok with that...hehehehe...HILP!!\u201d With that Wendy gently sqeezed some of her enormous mountins of blubber that filled her entire torso to bursting  and jiggled her titanic gluttony around and then catatonically allowed her arms to limply fall to her sides in utter contentment. <br>\r\n\tMarissa was thinking, though: \u201cSay, Wendy, don\u2019t you think there\u2019s something suspicious about Helen paying you gorge yourself to incapacity every day? Especially today, since if the Diner was open, why wasn\u2019t I called to work as Hostess? Did you notice anything in particular about today?\u201d<br>\r\nWendy blinked woozily and tried to shift upright to peer inquisitively at Marissa, her colossal belly churning and bubbling with the effort, which caused Wendy to place steadying hands on the giant vat of her gut. Marissa\u2019s face swam into view just over the mounding swell of her mammoth belly. After a few moments, Wendy hiccupped massively, and gently patted the expansive upper shelf of her stomach, settling back down into her prone position with a gurgle: \u201cHIILLLPPP!!! If that\u2019s so...HIC then Hooray for me and my belly..HILLP!!\u201d she remarked dryly. \u201cIf Helen wants to stuff me...HICC HILP...until...HILP...I become the goodyear blimp...HIC HILP!! then that\u2019s...URRP...just FINE...HIC HIC HILP with me...HICHILP!! I\u2019m content...HIC...to keep stuffing...HIC and gorging...URRRP HILP!! my stomach...HIC...until I prove...HICC to myself...HILP HILP that it CAN\u2019T...HILP handle ANYTHING...hehehe...URPhe!\u201d Marissa shrugged, for as long as it was fine with Wendy to play into Helen\u2019s fatty game, then it was fine with her. Wendy richly hiccupped and murmured: \u201cHILP!! this HAS been a day HILLP!\u201d and bubbled over back onto her overstuffed stomach for a digestive rest, calling out \u201cHILLP!! Wake me for Brunch...HIC...Marissa!!! URRRPPP\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From her freshman to senior years in high school she had done nothing other than party, spread rumors, and sleep with boys of all kinds; never making time to study and just cruising by on her good looks. But of course, \u201cCaptain of the Cheer Squad\u201d doesn\u2019t get one very far in the career world, and without any experience in the work force it was pretty hard for the new graduate to find a good job. Or, rather it was hard for her to find a well paying job, which was her only discretion; she absolutely refused to touch those nasty, greasy burgers down at Nasty Greasy Burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne roommate led to another as her limited funds quickly dried up; first her parents\u2019 house, then the coffee shop guy, who preceded her dad\u2019s secretary and who in turn was followed by the sexy Greek guy at BarStucks. But after coming across her old friend and former cheerleader Hannah Jones on Palster, Claire had found herself a long term roomie who was more than willing to share her dorm with her former captain while she studied at college. But unlike Hannah, Claire didn\u2019t need to go college because she was going pull her crap together any day now. Or, at least that\u2019s what she\u2019d been saying for the last five years now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that time, Claire Spittz had fallen from grace; severely. Slowly but surely, weekend partying with her old friends and going out on expensive dates had caught up to her within the first few months; thanks to her inability to afford a gym membership. After having ballooned up a few sizes thanks to generous dates and lots of booze, Claire found herself alone during the day without even Hannah to keep her company. This meant lots of TV watching and Fay\u2019s potato chips in front of the couch. Soon enough, the cr\u00e8me of the crop had fallen through the cracks, growing larger and larger as she grew lazier and lazier. Hannah had often come home to Claire\u2019s engorged and bloated body passed out early on the couch after a hard day of the munchies and eating up the electric bill. Life as a professional freeloader must have been so hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, just like any other day, Claire had successfully accomplished nothing in her spare time other than taking up space and snagging the number one spot on the leader boards for Hollow 3. She adjusted her headset, moving the microphone on her F-Box controller to better allow another salty handful of Cheesee\u2019s into her fat mouth. She moved one fleshy arm to grab her Big Gulp, awkwardly maneuvering the straw passed her crumb-covered lips to take a huge slurp of her soda. She let out a relaxed exhale, content with herself and all of her laziness. Expertly, with one plump hand, she blasted her main competition right out of the water. She pumped her doughy arm, flab squishing against itself in her euphoria, \u201cWHOO!!\u201d Claire cried victoriously as she wobbled a small victory dance from her seated position, \u201cTake THAT Pinstriper, Sexygrrl22 just beat yo\u2019 ASS!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire reached into the box beside her as she waited for her competition to respawn, taking out one of the many plastic-wrapped chocolate cakes and started to tear at the packaging, \u201cI think this calls for another victory cake, boys!\u201d the morbidly obese victor cheered as she crammed the entire thing into her mouth. \u201cOh come on!\u201d one of her opponents whined, \u201cYou\u2019ve had like, twenty of those since we started!\u201d another cried. \u201cOh be men about it, you all just got beat by a girl!\u201d Claire taunted the losers, still shuffling slightly on her couch. \u201cAh don\u2019t let this fat bitch get you down,\u201d one disgruntled player said, \u201cI saw her at Mal-Mart the other day, trust me we\u2019re the real winners here.\u201d Everyone started to laugh at her, something that pushed Claire into arguing the best she could, \u201cHey, shut up you loser!\u201d she whined unintelligibly, \u201cYou\u2019re just jealous that I\u2019m number one!\u201d Between the snorts and giggles, someone managed to pipe, \u201cNumber one fat ass, maybe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUGH!!\u201d she didn\u2019t have to take this kind of abuse, one pudgy thumb pushed the center button on her controller and she shut off the system. She crossed her meaty arms over her billowing belly and huffed, changing the television back to cable. Where did guys get off treating her like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelaxing from her gaming stance, Claire\u2019s many hind rolls fell to the back of the couch as she struggled to lift up her legs, shifting into a much more comfortable position. Her sweats, barely able to hold the jiggling cargo already stuffed into them, immediately ripped at the enhanced pressure. \u201cCrap.\u201d She grunted, pausing from throwing an undeserved victory cake into her maw but doing little about it. Actually, Claire rather liked the breeze on her wide wobbling thigh after a long hard day of gaming had overheated it. \u201cHey, Claire?\u201d Hannah\u2019s voice calls from her room, \u201cCould you come here for a sec?\u201d Claire was quick to respond with, \u201cUgh, you know very well that I can\u2019t!\u201d she strokes her belly out of habit, pampering the instrument that had driven her to her new lifestyle, \u201cI just made leader on Hollow 3!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah paused, \u201cIt\u2019s kinda important!\u201d she sounded angry, not that Claire really cared, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just come here!\u201d the more rotund roommate whined lazily, \u201cOh come on, I\u2019ve seen you get up to grab yogurt all the time!\u201d Hannah barks, the door slamming as she storms down the hallway. Claire\u2019s immense middle jiggled slightly with Hannah\u2019s stomping about, \u201cHey, could you keep it down?!\u201d she barked, \u201cYou\u2019re making me wobble!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClaire.\u201d Hannah barked, now standing directly between the jumbo cheerleader and MVT, \u201cWe really need to talk\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

She was now mentally comparing the pro's and cons of continuing to live here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't just keep sitting around and letting me support you\" Hannah continued, a little calmer, \"You are eating me out of house and home\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire remained quite, visibly unhappy at the thought of working but quite. She knew arguing back would be a waste of energy so she let Hannah continue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All you do all day is eat and sleep\" Hannah was starting to lay on this tired old lecture, \"and before you say anything else, walking to the door for take out and playing video games does not count as a valid exception\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like she read her mind, Claire felt her self shrink slightly into the fold of her neck fat. Hannah really did know her. Claire had begun to subconsciously began to play with her belly out of comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Claire, I like you, I always have\", the skinny friend put her hand to her head, rubbing her temples to calm down, \"but you really need to help me out. I don't know if I am going to make rent some months, because of the amount of food I gotta buy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't need to say it. Claire knew why she needed to buy extra food, she was the reason. It was painfully obvious and she felt something, a slight pang of humanity. She felt guilty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Hannah\", Claire finally piped up, \"I will try to bring in a little extra cash, I hate it when you get mad like this. Just leave it with me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs selfish as Claire was she was telling the truth. Hannah was the closest thing she had to a best friend, and she has never really asked anything of Claire. So it was only right to get a job, but what? Who would hire a tub of lard like Claire?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah seemingly satisfied with the result of her outburst left the room, somewhat stunned by how easy that was. Claire on the other hand was heaving her mass up out of her seated position. Her body bounced, wobbled and jiggled as she manoeuvred her hulking body out of her seat and waddled towards her computer. Her belly bounced out her shirt and the rip in her pants only widened. But Claire powered through, her folds rippling violently on her short waddle until she reached her destination. At this point she was red in the face and more than happy to plant her behemoth bottom on her extra wide computer chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire then took to the internet, opening a search engine and looked up phrases such as \"Jobs for fat girls\" and \"Ways to make money with no work\". Eventually she came across something very interesting. She found a few websites in which larger women made money by making videos. This seemed perfect, she could be like the fat lady on her screen, sitting and eating, and still get paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got a little bit excited, rubbing her belly once more. But now she had a conundrum, how should she start?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire continued her game of Hollow 3. These idiot teammates were getting her heart-rate up, hunched over on the couch with her several rolls accentuated the sides of her gargantuan gut. She had to restrain herself - she was at risk of being downranked because of these fools. She had to take a moment to angrily scarf down a bag of Cheesees. With some dedicated focus, she leaned in towards her T.V, fixating her attention on every little pixel, too focused to even eat more snacks. Focus down that one, he was their main damage dealer. He's down, now their healer - down, and the rest fell like sticks. One more push and victory came across her screen. She spoke up at the end, as she rubbed her back, which was chronically aching from her massively obese torso and her poor posture. \"Man, my back hurts from carrying these guys. GG.\" A few salty insults flew - \"Fuck you, bitch, get off the console!\" She tuned the rest out - she had long learned from gaming to take pleasure in these insults. It was a sign she was doing well. She leaned back against the couch - shit, her back really did hurt. She drowned any possible thought on why that was with some Fay's chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, she opened her laptop. She had struggled through the process of setting up her website, the interface being so clunky - but she managed to set up an account with FeeDeeMe, an up-and-coming feeder site with a few other models. She had agreed to the contract - from every video, profits were split 60-40 - the website took 40 percent of the profits. A nasty and frankly unfair rate, and Claire didn't stop grumbling for a while at it - but it was this or a personal clip site, and she figured she could do more with the resources of an organized network that might even help with her online presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the fateful fact - she would have to film a first video to begin monetization. But what to go for? She COULD try to just talk about how fat she wanted to get - a nice, low-effort alternative - but she wanted to go all-out for this. This was her nice, easy future, after all. That involved a big stuffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, she thought about calling Hannah and waiting for her to get home with the stuff - but no, that would involve getting her involved - she'd ask questions, judge her, and she wanted to go ahead and film NOW. So she did the main reasonable thing. She dialed up from DoorSprint, the food delivery service, and ordered up a stromboli, a large pepperoni pizza, some garlic knots - make that STUFFED garlic knots, Mondino's knew how to make those well - and some cannolis, couldn't miss those. The total of sixty-seven bucks and seven cents made her cringe - hopefully she'd make more than her money's worth from this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a ping of thought requiring her first to get up - She folded her laptop after paying for the heftily priced order, left it atop the coffee table, and shuffled forward. The couch groaned as her 500 pound heft taxed the frame of the sorry piece of furniture. The massive woman then leaned forward, using her blubbery arms to propel her somewhat upward while using what little of her muscular strength remained to perform basic functions. Even this simple task was difficult - it was the most intensive part of any day. She carefully then hefted her torso upward, trusting her lardy legs to hold her up. They did as requested - partly supported by the mass of fat coating the atrophying muscle that performed the task. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eventually waddled and huffed her way to her room and searched for her old trusty BunoVista 258 camcorder and its microphone mount - she had bought it a while back when she had a fairly sizable Spaz streaming channel for Hollow - that is, before she got banned for a few unfortunate comments on stream. Squeezing her massive frame through the threshold, she felt her love handles and saddlebags roughly impact and pinch through the threshold - she fit, for now. She passed her queen sized bed and went towards her four-foot beige dresser. She bent down - a task her knees popped and protested at - and opened the third drawer down, finding the camera. She'd used it to film a few sexy videos back when she was some 300, 350 pounds lighter, and left them for some of her more attractive roommates. She did remember that the sexy greek guy did, in fact, give her some - and that was when she was getting towards 300. She briefly pondered where he was now - obviously, he was down with fatter women, and that could be useful to put on the pounds for the online crowd. She then turned and picked up her tripod - sitting just below it - then leaned on the dresser and pulled her mass upward. This task accomplished, she took a moment to breathe. She resisted the temptation to sit on her bed - she knew she'd never get up, her lungs burned from the intense task of getting up once, twice, and them waddling to her room left her lungs taxed. Her face was sweaty - but she dedicated herself to the task of moving back towards the den. She set up the tripod at an angle from the front door, not visible easily to those standing, but easily able to see them. She then mounted the camera to it, and hit 'Record.' She spoke after waddling backward and waving a bingo-wing-laced arm at the camera. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heyyy guyyysss~,\" she panted, \"ClaireBBW here, with my first video.\" She gasped for a breath and spoke up. \"My takeout should arrive any second here, I ordered a LOT of stuff from a pizza place, because I'm..\" she giggled nervously, and tossed a roll. \"A big, blubbery, fat girl, who just wants to get fatter..\" She took a gasp, \"And fatter.. I'm already huge, obviously. I'm so fat that I could barely pull my camera stuff..\" Another gasp, \"My heart... Is racing...\" She thought, in the moment. She couldn't think about any way to showcase that to the camera - she realized, she could waddle closer to the protruding microphone. The extendable microphone was such a useful feature! She pressed the microphone close to her breast, felt the fuzz of the microphone on her clammy, sweaty breast as her heart beat out of her chest and her lungs struggled to pull air and then distribute it through her vast body. There was a pang of awkwardness - this was a weird thing to be doing. At this exact moment, she heard the doorbell ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped and spoke, \"Ooh, my food.\" She wobbled towards the door and opened it. She opened the door to see a somewhat pudgy, bespectacled black deliveryman with a beard. The young man had at his feet a veritable pile of food that tempted Claire to immediately take it and eat it. \"Hii!~\" spoke the mammoth of a woman. The man's face remained poker-ish for a moment, but cracked ever so slightly - his brows raised by a hair's breadth, then settled - as if his train of thought ran - <i>Jesus, this woman is fat,</i> and then, <i>Oh, obviously, she's ordered this much food, probably just for her alone.</i> \"Yeah,\" he spoke in a fairly high tone, \"Uhh, I've got a pep and bacon stromboli, large pep pizza, garlic knots and cannolis, for you?\" His voice betrayed his thoughts more - he intoned upward at the end. \"Yeahh,\" said Claire, \"A girl needs to keep her figure up,\" She jiggled a roll at the delivery man. His brows raised, his eyes widened and his pupils shrank, his brows raised in shock. He chuckled, obviously nervously, and then handed her the food. \"Uhh, here you go.\" Claire handed him 8 dollars beforehand, \"Oh, uh, your tip.\" He nodded gratefully as he handed her the food afterward, \"Thanks, enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire took the mound of food and settled it on the table, moved a bit closer to the door from the kitchen which was due to the left of the door, Claire's room being a straight shot and to the right down a hallway. Claire began speaking in panted tones as she opened the containers, \"So, you can tell he was pretty uneasy at the sight of me,\" She gestured to her huge body, \"Obviously, because I'm such a whale.\" She proceeded to dig in - ooh, the stromboli was so cheesy, and the bacon added a beautiful crunch. The pizza was so deliciously greasy, and she continued on eating - the whole meal being wonderfully greasy, cheesy, and fattening. She felt herself getting fatter by the moment, her gut began to become distended. She had finished her stromboli, a fairly large thing of about a foot and a few inches wide, and half of her garlic knots, as well as a few slices of the pizza, when she began to fill up. This was a lot, even for her. But she had an impetus now - she had to eat for her supper, like an Ourobouros fulfilling its own purpose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, she ate on - towards the end, she felt the pangs of pain shooting through her stomach as she finished the last cannoli. She yelped in pain. \"Ouwwww! Ouwhhhh...\" She could barely breathe, her stomach was packed tight, insanely tight. She stared at it in horror - was her girth already going to be her end? \"Ohgod... I overdndn't..\" Every panting breath felt like a gasp, every single one a fight against her packed gut which sat easily at 80 inches empty, but it had to be 90 now, at least. It felt like 100. She couldn't even think about getting up. She could barely stay conscious - especially after those cannolis. She simply passed right out on the table - a little power nap, let the food digest.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Claire.\"<br>\r\n\"CLAIRE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire Spittz was finally awoken by the shrill yelling of her thinner, strawberry blonde roommate, Hannah. Claire jolted awake and rubbed her aching stomach, \"Ouwwww... Hey, Han.\" Hannah groaned. \"I'm used to you slumming it in the couch like that, but can you at least throw away take-out if you order in like this? Plus, you're on the table - if you're gonna eat this much, at least do it on the couch!\" Hannah began turning around when she saw a red light. She turned and saw the camera and looked quizzically into it. \"What's with the camera?\" Claire rubbed her eyes - god, she was thirsty. \"Uh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was dumbstruck. What was she going to tell her roommate? She found a job eating herself fatter? That would make her sound loony, and worse, risk herself being kicked out. She had to cook up a lie, and cook it up quick. \"Uhhh, I was filming a <i>mukbang.</i>\" Claire had heard of the genre of online video - and it might be a good cover story. Hannah raised her eyebrows, \"A what?\" Claire began filling her in, \"A mukbang, it's basically where you..\" She took a moment to pant, take a breath,  \"...eat on camera and talk to the viewers like they're there with you.\" Hannah looked, confused and slightly disgusted, at the camera. \"Uhhh... Okay. It's still recording, want me to shut it off?\" Claire nodded, and spoke. \"Uh, yeah... Yeah...\" Then, mercifully, Hannah ticked the camera off, as it stopped recording. Hannah spoke up, \"I'll take out the boxes, you look tired - hope this makes you some money.\" Claire waved her hand, \"Yeah, yeah, I remember our talk. I think it will.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Hannah handily picked up all the boxes and hauled them downstairs. Hannah had gone. That was DAMN close. She was within a pinch of revealing herself to a whole new battery of awkwardness that she wasn't ready for. Now she had to get up - a hard task, made even harder by her still fairly taut gut. She struggled to back the chair up, and managed to plant her feet firmly on the ground. She was somewhat dizzy from the backward slide and she began trying to stand up, using the lean and heave technique - but there was a whole lot to heave. She knew if she let herself fall backward, she'd break the chair, and she was not ready, so she dedicated herself to going upward. Her poor legs were fighting this, but she did it - stumbling forward for a moment, but catching herself - the table had been adjusted right against some moulding and it held against her slight onslaught. That was even closer - Hannah was not a stranger to such accidents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wobbling whale then thudded her way to the sink - she grabbed a glass of water and chugged nearly the whole thing - still not enough, she grabbed another glass and turned about. Her back was killing her, still in chronic pain from her ever-soaring weight, but she was feeling a little better with some water. She took the video out of her camcorder, and began processing it into her computer. She killed some time playing some more matches of Hollow, and she had a very satisfying game - down to the last second, but someone on the enemy team managed to barely clutch the game. She couldn't even be mad at the skill everyone displayed, and the game left her feeling far, far better. Even better was when she slid over, and saw that her video had uploaded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there was work to be done, and she was a little rusty - she cut out the long stretch of her being passed out, obviously, and she cut some of the unnecessary pauses out - but when all was said and done, there was about an hour of footage. FeeDeeMe suggested a few options after she had finished uploading - $2 a minute, making the grand video about $120, or $3 a minute, making it about $180. Claire DID want people to buy it in fairly large amounts - so she chose the first option. She then cut up the eating and the deliveryman interaction into two additional videos, which sold for about $20 and $80 respectively, for shorter and cheaper options. She watched a few more videos, then rolled over and then repeated the chore of getting up, wobbling to her bed, and went to sleep. Only the next day would tell how her video had done.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire could be quite a hard sleeper, but some things occasionally broke that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while back, that was her mom's yelling on school days, afterward it would be her roommates waking her up for whatever job she had tried and failed to float around. She was usually even able to out-sleep alarms and isolated phone vibrations. This morning, however, something was way off. FeeDeeMe automatically e-mailed her for each purchase of her material - and the phone was vibrating off the hook - enough to wake the slumbering behemoth. She elbowed her way deeper into her mattress, then to her side facing the nightstand where her phone charged. It had a whole row of notifications, all of them from FeeDeeMe - notifications of customers buying her clips! There were about ten people who, overnight, had bought her $120 clip, and roughly another fifteen who had bought her $80 clip or her $20, split about 5-10. Accounting for the site taking about 540 from her profits, she had made about $1260 from clip sales - and she had already gotten two emails, asking for a subscription- based service with a flat fee a month. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit...\" said Claire. She was gobsmacked - this was just night one, and she had already made enough to pay the next month's rent from her end, some $800 with $460 left over. Claire's new Chirpr account for her ClaireBBW persona had accumulated some 300 followers, and her teaser shots already had some 100 likes per pic - and more followers were coming in every few minutes, to the point where she had to turn off the notifications. She was truly on her way - but now the hard part hit her. She would have to manage her schedule, and come up with thoughts for new videos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire rolled off her bed and lumbered towards the kitchen. She rubbed at her back - the pain wasn't as bad this morning, but it tended to get worse as the day went on. She had to grab a few pastries for her morning - they tended to be around for her own convenience, and her growing addiction to sugar made it less of an indulgence and more of a medication. She scarfed a few packages down - packages meant to be spread out over a few uses - and then brought a few of her choice treats to the couch for some good old fashioned planning, and then some Hollow 3. So, what would she do next? The stuffing was obviously popular - but when given the choice, there was some audience for her voyeur and humiliation based content. The humiliation content might involve some movement outside the house - quite an issue. On the other end, stuffing would risk oversaturating her page with stuffings - especially if it were the same old italian food. She would have to vary it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, she continued eating herself larger. She couldn't shake the feeling that something was starting to be wrong, with the constant back aches at least. Additionally, she was starting to feel the pull of her sugar addiction, but she wasn't quite sick of sugar - she was simply becoming aware she was being more and more addicted to not just all food, but addicted to sugary foods in particular. Even as she was finishing up drawing up some brainstorming, she consumed a 2-pack of cookies as easy as breathing - which itself was a laborous task for her as her heft increased. But this concern was drowned by more food and more gaming - she was getting nice and high in the ranks for Hollow 3, but as a result her games were getting more difficult - she had to learn more and more new tips and tricks to stay on her edge. She played so long that she barely noticed when Hannah got home. \"Oh, Han, I got some news for you - check your PartnerPay.\" The thin strawberry blonde drew out her phone and checked - \"Oh, you've got the month's rent from your half! Thanks - so that muck-bang or whatever makes you some money, huh?\" Claire nodded - trying to conceal her deception. \"Yep. I get to eat on camera and just make money from it.\" Hannah chuckled, \"I shoulda figured you'd find a way to do it - wish I could do that.\" Claire raised an eyebrow, \"Well, I might need some help sooner or later with filming - I might need a hand with setting up the camera and such.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah nodded, \"Well, I'll keep that in mind! Maybe next time you're filming on a weekend, or on a morning before I head to work.\" Claire nodded cautiously. She just realized that if Claire ever did take her up on her offer, her deception might be discovered - a potential bridge to be crossed later, IF Hannah were ever to help her out. For now, she was busy queuing up for ranked in Hollow 3. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah came home later that day.</span></div></div>",

She was already so hard-worked - she had fans to interact with on Chirpr, custom orders to take and note down - it was a lot of work to eat so much. But the money that was rolling in! In the week since she'd put up that first clip, she had made nearly $2,000 more in sales. But the success wouldn't last if she didn't continue with similar energy - she had to keep filming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFilming meant moving around, setting things up - a task that was already becoming nigh impossible due to her continuously fattening body. Her gut continued to burst forth from her tops, which had never truly fit her right after 400 pounds. Her shorts were becoming engulfed in the fatness of her legs, her thighs keeping the fabric drum-tight. Her breasts had been blown up a little by her gains, but not close to the beating her lower half had taken. Her mobility and fitness was taking such a beating that she could barely set up a camera - she obviously needed some help. She had to bite the sour apple and ask Hannah one weekend, turning to her as she sat at the dinner table. \"Hey, Han - would you be down to help me film tomorrow?\" Hannah nodded, \"Sure! I don't got nothin' to do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day went by as it normally did - Claire played some games of Hollow 3, responded to some customers - apparently the site was having an issue processing payments from some regional banks. Not wanting to be played, she proceeded with caution and told them that she would love to make sure they got their video as soon as the site's processing was done. Claire had frustratingly had to go to the bathroom more these days - a problem that cost her at least one game. She had a modicum of self-respect left, but it was genuniely exhausting, going to the bathroom so frequently. She was considering bringing it up at her next doctor's appointment for Disability, which was coming up in the next month. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day of action came about, and Hannah was kind enough to lay out the massive spread of Chinese takeout that Claire had ordered. It didn't fail to stun her - \"Jeez, Claire, this is a lot of food. Plenty of filming.\" Claire smiled and spoke up, \"I know - thank you for setting everything up.\" Hannah laid out two plates, and Claire took her two seats - she needed two for her growing rear. Hannah spoke up, \"How do you want it set up?\" Claire hummed and spoke up, \"Like, there -\" She pointed at a point forward and left of the ball of blubber - an angle that would both get her face eating the food, but get a fair profile shot of her vastness. Hannah spoke up, \"You sure? The angle from here isn't the most flattering.\" Claire waved her hand, \"It's fine, It's fine. It, uh... It makes it more genuine.\" Hannah goggled at this, but held the camera firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red light went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heyy, guys. ClaireBBW here, I've got another big, big stuffing, just for you.\" Hannah stayed behind the camera - but immediately, things seemed off. She had taken some time to look for Claire's mukbang channel, but she couldn't find it. The language was different than anything any of the normal channels used - she outright called it a stuffing. It got weirder for Hannah as Claire jiggled her bottom belly roll, and spoke, \"As you can see, I've really packed on a few pounds. I'm due for a weigh-in anytime soon - I can't wait to see how much I am now. I think, last I checked just before I got filming, I was like 508, 509.\" It was becoming obvious now - Claire was talking about her weight openly - a subject that Hannah tread so ever lightly on. Every inch of her skin was crawling at this realization, and she could not get away from the thought that especially at Claire's size, the last thing she needed was to stuff herself for money. This thought became louder as Claire continued eating, her face continually orgasmic at the first few bites, then settling down as she stuck in for the long haul of eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Hannah dutifully kept filming, she did want Claire to be able to pay her rent - but she couldn't shake the moral quandry she was having. After a fair, long time, Claire sat back, rubbing her belly, moaning - not in as much pain as she was the first time, but still wincing at the fullness of her stomach after eating the hoard of food. Claire spoke up, \"Uh, Hannah...\" She took a few shallow breaths, \"Could you..Shuthecam'raoff..\" Hannah did as asked, but spoke up after. \"You didn't tell me you were doing this stuff. I don't know if I can be comfortable with this.\" Claire shook her head sluggishly and spoke up, \"Oh... C'mon Han... I pay rent...\" Hannah grimaced, \"I get that, and I'm thankful you do now, but I don't know how much more I can help you with this.\" Claire looked quizzically at her, her eyelids struggling not to shut. \"Wh.. Wh'd'ya mean?\" Hannah rested two fingers against her temple. \"You can barely set up a camera, I always hear you talk about how much pain you're in...You've moved around less and less... I'm worried about you, Claire. I'm worried you're eating your way into your grave if you keep on with this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA kesselschlacht of emotions assailed Claire. On one hand, she was terrified - she knew subconsciously her health was deteriorating by the week. She had been getting worried about her increasing addiction to sugar, and this paired with her longstanding subconscious fears about her weight. These pre-existing fears paired with what Hannah was saying to create a terrifying meld of truth - Claire's brain raced at this thought - <i>God, is she right? Is this going to kill me?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, a rejection formed - how dare Hannah talk about her like this? It was obvious to the paranoia of being ridiculed for her weight that Hannah must be talking about her to her friends! How obese and how much of a hog she was - who was this bitch to talk about her like that? This paired with a denial, a flat denial which tempered the flash of anger - Hannah was just worried - too worried. Claire was fine, wasn't she? She wasn't dead, she was still able to move - she moved around too much in her own opinion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of these, though came together somewhere deep and dark in Claire's soul - a tiny part of her that said, <i>Yes, this is going to kill me - and that makes it even hotter.</i> All of these emotions left Claire stunned as Hannah went on, \"I've seen how much sweet stuff you've been eating, and how you're always tired - you're always thirsty - you're always even more hungry. Babe, you're not even thirty yet - you're over 500 pounds, and you've obviously got Diabetes, or something wrong with you - Let me help you. I'll pay more of your rent if you work on your health, work on your weight.\" The last part actually drew Claire, and set up reliable opposition for her fattening urges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire had to make a decision - either reject Hannah's advice and continue gaining, regardless of the costs, or listen to Hannah and try to lose some weight.<br>\r\n*Author's Warning - the story will likely get more morbid from here. Continue only if you are into the darker sides of weight gain.*</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The blubbery whale that was Claire Spittz proceeded along the path of gaining weight. <br>\r\nHer filming sessions continued to annoy her, as Hannah no longer had the will to help her after her impudent outburst around a month ago. Hannah still talked to Claire, but she seemed to have a constant look of sadness on her face when looking at her friend. Claire still couldn't get why her friend had just up and abandoned her! Whatever, she thought to herself over her second large bag of Goldfish that day, I'll gain without her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd gain without her Claire did. She was putting the same effort into gaining weight that most people put into losing it - logging her intake with nearly scientific precision, and weighed in at the end of every week on Friday mornings. Her weight had skyrocketed - going from around 509 to 517, then to 525, and now, she stood at 535. The insanely rapid gains were especially hitting her hips and gut, which now grew by at least five inches - around 85-90 empty, and easily 110 when stuffed. Her legs seemed to begin to merge together, like a solid wall of fat, when put together, upon which Claire's belly tenouously began to hang on the precipice of her overtaxed knees, which themselves sprouted fat rolls at the division between her cankles and her vast, fat thighs. All of this had the result of making Claire explode in all directions. Her old clothes from the past years were completely unwearable \u2013 she had ordered some clothes from Roarid, a double-plus size company just for women her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was beginning to notice more problems, problems that would come up shortly at her doctor's appointment. For one, what Hannah had ascribed, likely ignorantly, to Diabetes was getting worse and worse - she became thirstier and felt like endless waves of pins and needles assailed her feet. Even sitting down, her heart beat like an over-excited drum against her chest - and any physical activity, such as setting up the camera, left her nigh-incapacitated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried not to think about it as she ate some pasta on camera - pausing only briefly to rub at a sharp pain in her chest. Likely indigestion, the morbidly obese woman told herself. She had read several articles that people could be healthy at any size! She was becoming increasingly interested in this - the idea that she was just fine. She wasn't feeling the best physically, sure, but that didn't matter! She felt as good about her body as she ever did - absolutely turned on by every single pound she put on. She filmed quite a few masturbation videos between stuffings, but even that was becoming harder with her skyrocketing weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite any health spooks, she continued rolling in the money - she was even able to buy a few conveniences around the place, like a dishwasher, and a handcart to help wheel out the hordes of takeout boxes she had ordered to gain, since Hannah was having no part in feeding Claire's self-destructive gaining. Her fat had begun to take on a role as a \"moneymaker\" - a provider not just for itself, but for her and Hannah. Hannah even had to admit that the hedonistic lifestyle that Claire had taken on was doing well for her, at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this had the side effect of making Claire feel like she had to focus down on the filming and eating \u2013 she found herself playing less Hollow 3 for the sheer volume of food she had to intake, for the constant filming she had to do. This fed into a cycle of eating more food out of stress, and the eating of food out of stress gave her less time to play Hollow \u2013 leading to more stress eating. She was playing the game less and less, and eating and napping more and more. She began to do almost literally nothing but eat, sleep, and film the process. She had even began streaming hours of herself live, repeating this process \u2013 a lucrative trade in and of itself, bringing in a good extra $200 a week on slow weeks \u2013 usually going above $1000. Hannah had no clue just how much not only Claire but Claire's bank account was ballooning as a result of her new dedication to stuffing her face.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finally, the day of the appointment came around for Claire. She had to secure transportation in the form of Hannah taking a day off work to get her there - \u201cCertainly,\u201d she had responded to Claire's request, \u201cAnything for you \u2013 especially if it gets you to the Doctor's.\u201d  Claire frowned at this \u2013 she had heard Hannah's nagging about her health endlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst part was, Claire was starting to get worried herself. In the days leading up to the appointment, her chest pains had gotten worse, and she had begun feeling inappropriately sleepy \u2013 sometimes in the middle of stuffings. At least for the sake of her stuffings, she had to do something to hold off these seemingly random symptoms. Hannah drove Claire to the medical center, a vast complex of round curves bounded by glass and steel. The sun glinted off of the glass exterior on the towers and centers of this medical complex. A part of Claire noted that if she were to have some issue, at least she wouldn't have to go TERRIBLY far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah helped the huge woman out of the bed of her truck \u2013 far too large for the cab \u2013 and then to the lobby. The morbidly obese woman was a sight \u2013 even among the fat patients in the lobby, she was by FAR the widest and the roundest, particularly accentuated in her wheelchair she used to get out of parking lots as she stood up from it. She could feel the eyes on her \u2013 and it turned her on, to a degree. The knowledge that she had become such a fatass that she was drawing immense judgement in this hospital waiting room. Hannah helped Claire wobble to the check-in desk. \u201cName?\u201d the thin, latina assistant spoke up. She began eyeing up Claire, as she spoke, \u201cClaire Spittz \u2013 here for my check-up, part of my Disability.\u201d The latina assistant deftly avoided rolling her eyes as she thought, Ah, yes, the disability of being a morbidly obese hog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair looked around for seats \u2013 but the only ones available in 90 percent of the lobby had steel armrests between each seat, absolutely not an option for the barely mobile ball of fat that was Claire Spittz. They looked around and found what had to be the most humiliating row of seats \u2013 a row of seats for the disabled that had no armrests. The label was 'Disabled,' but it honestly ought to have just been an obese stick figure \u2013 most folks in wheelchairs could simply park against the wall. Claire sat down \u2013 she proudly noted to herself that she began to fill out not one, but both seats that she sat on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the mocha-skinned assistant called out her name, \u201cClaire Spittz, doctor Akavian will see you now.\u201d Claire then followed the route she did whenever she had to go to this place \u2013 down the hall, open the door, turn right \u2013 stop to catch a breath, that one was a new addition, and then proceed until a door was reached that read '116.' She opened the door and began moving through it, but halted halfway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoly, fucking, shit, i'm stuck in the door of my doctor because I'm so fucking fat, thought Claire. This was a master class in embarassment and humiliation, and it was only the beginning. Hannah helped push Claire through \u2013 grunting, \u201cJeez, Claire, you think the Doctor notices you've gained weight?\u201d Claire giggled and spoke up, \u201cI'unno, have I... Put on some.. weight, doctor A?\u201d Akavian, the leathery Caucasian physician with brown hair and hazel eyes, shook his head at the morbidly obese woman as he helped pull her through. \u201cThis is not funny, Claire. Step on the scale \u2013 we need to see this first.\u201d Claire already knew what it would say \u2013 541.8 pounds. Akavian chimed out, \u201cFive hundred and two point six pounds.\u201d Ooh, a bit heavier today, thought Claire. Akavian ran through his usual battery of tests \u2013 blood pressure, of course with the extra large cuff for Claire's jiggly, fat arm, calipers, measuring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkavian finished, and then asked, \u201cSo, before I talk about your numbers, let me ask if anything is wrong.\u201d Claire spoke up, \u201cUh, I've been feeling, like, numbness in my feet \u2013 I've been really thirsty recently, and my chest has been hurting.\u201d She began to feel a pang of sleepiness, but tried to fight it off, swatting it away, but not before it scored a yawn. Akavian tisked, and spoke up. \u201cThen I'll definitely need some bloodwork done \u2013 just as a formality, because I'm almost certain you are a diabetic by this point.\u201d Akavian began writing a battery of things down, then turned with a grim, sad face to Claire. \u201cSo, I do not need to tell you that you have gained weight \u2013 it is obvious to us both. Your other numbers are terrible \u2013 your blood pressure is one hundred and fifty two over one hundred \u2013 and your last test showed one hundred and forty nine over ninety eight. Your blood pressure has shot up, and your body fat percentage has shot up as well \u2013 you're ballooning.\u201d Claire kept her face pinned on the tan Georgian as he spoke his next sentence, as he let it drip with emotion. \u201cJudging by what I already have, you are in dire straits with your health. And it will only get worse with your bloodwork.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went through the usual song and dance with Claire \u2013 she looked away, he pricked blood from her \u2013 but she barely felt it now through her fat \u2013 and he inserted the blood into a new spectrometer of advanced design which saved hours of medical testing and was able to give near-instant results. As they came back, Akavian sighed and spoke up. \u201cI know if I ask you what you eat, you will lie to me \u2013 you always have, Claire. So I will come out and say it \u2013 judging by your bloodwork, I can safely diagnose you with Diabetes type two, and high cholesterol. Judging by some of the results here, we'd need to scan for it, but I can also fairly close to developing Atherosclerotic heart disease, if you don't already have it.\u201d He sighed, rubbed his hands in his face, and turned to Claire. He spoke bluntly as he wrote a perscription. \u201cIf you continue eating like you are eating, you are going to be dead before you are thirty. So either listen to me, or write your will \u2013 I'm going to give you a meal plan and an exercise plan.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's face filled with shock. Akavian had been dissapointed before, but this was something new \u2013 she heard genuine warning in this leathery, aging man's voice. She was terrified for what lay ahead of her \u2013 was death truly so close for her? She was only twenty \u2013 three, there must be some mistake \u2013 she voiced as much, \u201cHow can that be? I'm not even twenty-five!\u201d Akavian took off his glasses and spoke up, \u201cIt's because you've gotten so fat, Claire. You're eating yourself into an early grave.\u201d There were those words again, carbon copies of what Hannah had said. Claire was terrified of this \u2013 she had only wanted to let loose, she hadn't intended to eat herself to death! She had just intended to take the easiest way out of Hannah's conundrum! She had to get out of this, she had to lose some weight, or she would die!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut like a thief, there crept in that voice again \u2013 Isn't it so sexy, the fact that you've eaten yourself nearly to death? How hot would it be if you went all the way? How hot would it be if you ate yourself to death because you're such a pig? She could barely believe that these words were in her brain, but there was something oddly alluring to them \u2013 something she began to feel. There was no way she could lose this weight, and this voice played on the logic that instead of expensive, crushingly expensive Weight Loss Surgery, she ought instead to eat herself the rest of the way into her grave. There was that odd, morbid allure to the idea of eating herself to death. What did these forbidden things feel like? What did it feel like to be so fat that one could barely live? What did it feel like to be so obese that you died? Was it as alluring as her deepest, darkest desires said they were? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That took too much effort. She had always eaten like this! She had always been this lazy! The doctor was probably peddling bullshit, her conscious mind thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer subconscious, of course, was far more honest with herself. The doctor was telling the truth and she could feel it with every pound added. Her insulin made her feel slightly better from the diabetes, but she refused to let off of her highly processed diet, which she did not shrink at all. Her chest pains still continued on, giving her periodic pangs of doom - but as of yet, the hand of Obesity had not yet come to claim her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe regaled her audience in detail with the details of her physical declines, and her doctor's diagnoses. She shocked herself as she let slip, \"And, to be honest.. it turns me on. The idea that I'm getting too fat to stay alive. The idea that I'm literally such a fat pig that I'm eating myself to death.\" She jiggled her stomach as she personally took in those words. <i>This thing is going to kill me, and I don't care</i>, her thoughts decisively stated. The voice of reason which had thus far driven her was relegated to a tiny thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy far, this was the tiniest thing about her - her sense of reason in regards to food. Her gut became too large and heavy for her to mount it atop her knees - perpetually forced to keep her legs apart for the great girth that was her huge stomach. If her gut's circumference were to be drawn on the ground, four, perhaps five people, could stand within it, and there would still be empty space on the periphery. Her thighs were thickening by the day, and her breasts were finally being fairly hit by her gains, as they still sat atop her massive stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had the income now to cover the whole of the apartment's rent, and feed herself - fortunate, as Hannah began to threaten to leave as she continued gorging herself. Hannah grew more frustrated, more angry with her. This came to be perfectly clear one day as Hannah came home in the middle of one of Claire's binges, one of the days after the Doctor's appointment. She raised her arms in anger, shaking them. \"What the FUCK are you doing!? Didn't doctor A tell you that you are literally dying because of this!?\" Claire shrugged and spoke, \"Yeah.\" \"Then why the FUCK are you you still stuffing your face! Jesus, you're still filming this shit!\" she screamed. She could no longer hold back, and launched viciously into a long tirade, \"And you wonder why you have fucking Diabetes! You wonder why you always feel like your heart's trying to quit, because it fucking is, because you're eating like a whale! You're going to die before <b>THIRTY,</b> Claire! Don't you fucking get that? Don't you <b>care?</b> Claire spoke tersely, \"We all fucking die sometime, I'm just doing what I want. You act like you're fucking immortal...\" she paused, taking a gasp, Hannah seized on the moment, \"You can barely actually finish your fucking sentences because you're being crushed by your fat! Jesus Christ! I can barely take it anymore!\" Claire continued eating through tears, she spoke up, \"Leaveme..thefuck...alone..\" Hannah stormed to her room, \"I will! I'm going to fucking leave your big, fat ass here alone!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire began suspecting in the days after this clash that Hannah's threats weren't entirely empty. She noticed more things dissapearing into Hannah's room - the things that she remembered Hannah originally brought. Inevitably, there came the day Hannah spoke up - packed boxes littering her room. She presented Claire a piece of paper. Claire squinted through the fat that coated her face and began actually obscuring her vision, reading the words, \"How to write a last will.\" The morbid desires in the pit of Claire's fat self became aroused - Hannah was confronting her with the dark truth that only a friend could present with absolute, blunt honesty. This was not a sterile doctor - this was her strawberry-blonde, thin friend with a wan, concerned, nearly tearful face, handing her what amounted to her last request of Claire. She spoke up, \"Please... If you're going to keep eating like this... At least write your will...And think about-\" She paused, sobbing, \"...About funeral arrangements..\" Claire's face was stunned. She could see a vision now - and she spoke up in true pity of Hannah, \"I'll write it.\" Hannah tearfully embraced her friend like she would embrace a dying woman. With that, the strawberry blonde wheeled her boxes out, and the last Hannah saw of her was her thin outline against the light of the door to the outside.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course, no-one in nearly any context could now compare to Claire Spittz in size, but in most other contexts, the woman would be a fairly fat one with her considerable bingo wings and her fat thighs, to say nothing of her 30-inch belly. \"Thanks, Denise,\" said the perpetually breathless Claire. The massive, blubbery woman had long since followed Hannah's advice - her old friend had provided at least a template for one - and had a will written. The document struck a certain something inside of Claire - she was aware of her own mortality, but the fact that she was now absolutely immobile added a lot of inertia to the voice that dominated her, telling that her death by obesity was inevitable - there was no preventing it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe certainly  was getting closer to the final days - her chest pains were getting worse, and her doctor had to up her blood pressure medication by the very next appointment before the end of the year. Of course she didn't return home for the holidays - she already had enough chastisement about her weight when she was a svelte 300 pounds, or even when she was as 'tiny' as Denise. The last time she weighed in on her Doctor's cattle scale - a weigh-in that made her feel like an absolute whale - she was 655 pounds. In under two years, this 25-year old woman had eaten herself into a category of obesity that few people ever achieve, and had accrued the health results of such - her triglycerides and cholesterol had raised by a few dozen miligrams between her visits, and x-rays had revealed to her the face of her killer - the negative space between the walls of plaque resembled a narrow one-way street, but as with many such streets, traffic was two-ways through this route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered when the heart attack would come - it would certainly be more merciful than the endless days of eating herself into what she hoped was not a diabetic coma, filming the stuffings with Denise's help. She was truly a lovely feeder, and a kindly nurse - she helped administer Claire's medicine. Her encouragement was the sweetest poison a dying obese girl could ever want. She was at least partially  responsible for the past 55 pounds. She also had begun introducing weight-gain shakes into Claire's diet - sugar-free, as too much sugar would outright kill the living embodiment of obesity that was Claire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night, Claire polished off one such shake. Her massive gut hung over the edge of the couch, supported upward by her fat knees. Almost all clothes had stopped fitting her, so she was permanently either naked or in a hospital gown. Her chest pains had come to her after taking her medicine - her dosage must be too low again, she'd have to ask her doctor about that at the next appointment. She was then hit with a splitting headache, however - she groaned in pain - a response that only elicited some belly rubbing from Denise - \"Yeahhh, your belly must hurt pretty bad, piggy..\" Claire waved off at her, holding at her heart - damn, it was jackhammering away in there! She tried to get some breath, calm down - was this a heart attack? She spoke up, through very shallow gasps - \"Can't.. Breathe... Heart... Racing...\" Denise spoke up, \"You're in a hypertensive episode, here, here, here...\" she urgently reached for Claire's red pill bottle. Thankfully, her doctors knew that this kind of thing was likely in a woman like Claire who showed no signs of wanting to do anything to reduce her chance of this happening - so they gave her a bottle of Nitroprussides, to a keep Claire alive until she got to a hospital. Denise opened the cap and retrieved one of the high-strength pills. In the meantime, Claire's eyes were wide open, like a fish's eyes - she felt every second go by like an eon, This was life, and it seemed to be fading to her. This would be her world, the last she saw of it, maybe - these walls, the food, the pills that Denise shoved into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next she saw was her industrial-strength bed and the paramedics wheeling in equipment. \"HR stable - as stable as it's going to get. BP stable - we've got her.\" A dominant woman with dark tan skin spoke up, \"Stay a little longer, keep an eye out for stroke.\" Claire had survived her hypertensive episode, at least for now - though it turned Claire on a tad that they had to bring the equipment to her, because she was literally too fat to leave her apartment. She noticed Denise subversively filming the whole encounter - wires on her chest, paramedics attending to her, Claire laying in a gurney special-designed for the obese that she still felt squeeze her love handles. This clip would make bank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd make bank it did, as nearly everything she produced made these days. She was becoming a superstar among feedist communities and especially the more morbid corners of them. She had anonymous patrons helping to pay off any medical bills, pay for more food - towards the end of october, an anonymous patron even paid for a remodel of her apartment for wider doors. This was especially a help as the year ground on - as Claire learned literally nothing from the hypertensive episode, winding her way up to 688 by her next weigh-in. Her size was becoming absolutely stunning - the largest object in nearly any room. Denise got no smaller either, and if anything her own feeding began to plump her up by proxy. Her second chin, previously just barely peeking over her chin, began to droop lower as her arms and belly took more of the gains. She began weighing herself - and she was surprised to see 262, the last she had seen, she was 233. On one hand, she was aroused by this exact kind of thing - but then, she looked at Claire. Claire's literal whole-hog embracement of the morbidity of fat fetishism had left little of her independence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman now had oxygen hooked up to her, barely able to breathe through the ever-increasing weight on her frame, and everything had to be industrial-strengthened to sustain her crippling weight.  She required daily washing by Denise, something that helped stem further growth on the other fat woman's part. During one such bath, she spoke up, \"Thank you, Denise - thank you for all of this.\" She took a gasp after the sentence, as her oxygen tank had to be off for washing. \"Oh, no problem. I love helping cuties like you get bigger.\" Claire sighed and spoke, \"Uh, I don't know how much bigger i'll be getting - not that you're not feeding me enough, but I think it's just time.\" Denise was shocked, \"Time for what?\" Claire panted and spoke, \"I don't know how much longer I can just take the pain. Joint pain every day, my back is killing me just for being alive, my health is in the toilet, and every other second my heart's threatening to quit. I might sign a DNR.\" Denise was saddened. It was like being with a blue whale - a creature of massive size and such rarity, but its mortality saddened her - she still could not quite grasp Claire's sexual attraction to such morbid measures. A Do Not Resuscitate was a concrete order - the next time anything goes wrong, that would be Claire's time. Denise spoke up, \"Claire, no, you've got so much bigger to go.\" Claire shook her head, and spoke. \"I don't know about that.\" She took another gasp, \"It's just getting to be so much, to be alive and be this fat, and this unhealthy. I'm still sound of mind, so I could sign it myself - I've just got the one favor to ask of you.\" Denise sighed and asked, \"What is it?\" Claire spoke with solemn finality, \"Keep the camera on me. I've got it in my will that any future income from my clips goes to you, and it's probably really fucked up, but the dudes that are into morbid stuff will buy the shit out of that clip, me finally dying from my obesity.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise pondered, then spoke. Whether Claire's eventual passing scared her out of obesity or further into it, the extra money wouldn't hurt. \"Of course.\" After the bath, the two performed a surreal task- fitting Claire for her coffin. With all measurements taken, she perused a few choices. \"Ooh, I like the marbled look on that one - it's unique, and it's got that brass trim to it.\" Denise nodded, \"Yeah - that looks great. You'll look beautiful in it.\" Eventually the time came - the doctor sadly sat across from Claire in her apartment as he watched the great hulking mass of fat sign the document guaranteeing her own death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now a question of when Claire would die, and whether Denise would follow her footsteps, or whether Denise would end the cycle and prevent her own death, which Claire could not do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was, of course, only a matter of time until the butterball that was Claire Spittz died. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had eaten away the prime of her youth, and eaten herself into a state of horrid health that usually only comes from years of gradual abuse of one's health. Denise sat and admired the glorious fatness of her partner as she ate through a buffet tray of fried chicken. She rubbed at her chest like normal, and continued eating for the camera. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pause. A tenseness of her face, she rubbed her chest again, the rub turned to a clutch. She moaned in pain, her eyes shutting tightly, her teeth clenched in anguish. \"Ouhhnnngh.... God~...\" She tried to draw breath to ease the obvious pain, but the sharp hissing breaths did nothing to follow up on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.. This is it... Denise, this is it.. I ate myself to death,\" said Claire, hoarsely. Denise rubbed her massive, meaty shank of a shoulder as the ocean of fat that was Claire Spittz leaned back into the couch, clasping at her heart with both hands now, the arms laden with fat to the point that they looked like two pillows that now clutched at her chest. Her head swam in an invisible body of water, as if she tried to keep herself afloat in such, rubbing back against the couch as her chest rose and fell, rose and fell. \"Fuck...Fuck... Fuck..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one of the most characteristic ways of coping with imminent death, Claire Spittz defiantly bit into a chicken breast. Suddenly her eyes went as wide as beach balls, and she fell forward, off the couch, and onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise came about to her - her last few breaths came about - and then the huge, obese form of Claire Spittz was no longer inhabited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ambulance came - as usual, they had to use the widened door to get Claire out, even on her double-wide gurney. This time, the paramedics looked somberly at the body of the massive, obese woman. \"Damn it, she's so young, too,\" said a paramedic of near-eastern origin. A fairly hefty co-worker nodded and spoke up, \"Yeah... Damn shame. Sorry for your loss.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise was saddened - but also deeply aroused by this occurrance - an arousal that continued on to Claire's funeral. The fact that this living hog was able to eat herself to death before thirty was satisfying to her morbid desires - that she needed help with every little thing. Denise was more than happy to provide this help - as well as help finishing anything Claire had passed out while eating, and could not finish herself - a more common occurrance towards the end of the fat woman's life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire barely fit in her coffin. The weight she had gained in the last month of her life meant that the morticians literally had to cram her into her coffin, and she filled every inch of the nearly piano-case sized thing. A forklift beeped along, sticking its forks under the casket. Hannah and Denise were some of the only two in attendance - no one else was willing to come. Her family had long since abandoned her due to her rampant gluttony, and these two were the only friends Claire had left.  Hannah was sobbing deeply, leaning into Denise, whose heft now easily surapassed 300 pounds in her black dress, packed to bursting - just like Claire's coffin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe  beautiful, massive item was lowered into the pit dug for it, and then the forklift backed away. The headstone read - \"Claire Spittz - 1990-2019 - A happy woman who lived life on her terms.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arousal was mixed with the sadness of the passing of such a kind woman - the death of one so young - but to a cause so sexual for Denise, so deeply arousing that she had to hold herself back from masturbation by the graveside. How every inch of Claire's rolling fat had to be nearly vaccuum-packed into her huge coffin, the size of the thing and the weight of that contained which left her without the honor of pallbearers - the sheer sexual energy of this moment was  real for Denise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Hannah, however, this moment was an utmost tragedy. She had done everything in her power to help Claire live - to help her survive her own desire to eat to self-destruction. But her works were for nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost fittingly, the funeral concluded at a buffet. Both Denise and Hannah ate like hogs - plate after plate of chinese food which packed their plates to bursting. \"This feels wrong,\" said Hannah, finishing her fifteenth crab rangoon. \"Why,\" asked Denise through a mouth of eggroll which she promptly swallowed, \"It's what she would have wanted. Plus, I'm starving.\" Hannah refused to question it further. She meekly accepted it - food did, after all, find a way of making her feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inheritance money was a godsend to the two women. Hannah was already doing fairly well for herself thanks to her work ethic, but the money gave the two the ability to outright purchase a townhouse in the center of town. They rented the upper floors out, and lived in the bottom two floors. The facade of the building was a classic Victorian thing, and its spiral-capped towers that formed its fourth story were perfect for studying, reading, looking around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with both women being driven towards eating more, Hannah trying to \"save\" Denise was out of the question. The only question was if they could avoid Claire's fate.</span></div></div>",

It was a favored pastime of theirs - going to the little French restaurants and coming back, wine-drunk. It helped them get over the untimely yet all-too-expected death of the super-obese Claire. \"Oh, yeah, that one next to the little pizza place. They have a beautiful meat lovers' there.\" Hannah's mind still tried to tell her, \"Slow down.\" But the eating helped take her mind off of Claire, off of the death of her friend. She accepted it as a mechanism. <i>I'm still thin</i>, she told herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, in the months since Claire's death, that was becoming less and less true. Just as Denise continued glutting herself as a social and sexual maneuver, Hannah continued glutting herself as a coping mechanism and a way to know Denise better. Hannah's weight had increased from an average build to a blubbery one - her breasts enlarged as did her thighs, and her middle, always slightly puffy, began to expand more permanently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How about you? What's your job?\" Denise sheepishly spoke, \"Uh, daytime, I work at the Big B station on 17. But between you and me, I sell smut videos online to make the rent.\" Hannah had to lecture herself internally, and spoke the words she knew she should say rather than what she thought, \"Hey, good on you for making some extra money.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise's figure had been ballooning beside Hannah's.  She didn't quite eat as much as she did when Claire was still alive, finishing whole levels of buffet trays by herself, but she still ate enough to pile on pounds. She was going from the low 300's to above 330 these days as she ate out - and in - with Hannah. Her second chin began to grow into a neckload of fat that dangled increasingly out. She wasn't blind to her own gain, but she was increasingly aware of Hannah's. And it aroused her fairly well. She carried it well, for now, but what would she look like beyond 150? What would she look like beyond 200? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenise, however, became a bit more scared as the days went by and her weight soared. Beyond the usual breathlessness that life over 250 pounds brings, she began to feel her heart palpitate at any minor exertion. She could barely move without being scared she was going to have a heart attack. She was sexually attracted to the morbidity of others, but when reminded that her own fat put her at risk, she began to falter. At the same time, it was still so sexy to her! She was such a butterball that her 2X shirts that had fit her fine a while before Claire's funeral were now unforgivably tight. Her 3X's were an immensely sexual reminder of her size, and she took just as much pleasure in hearing Hannah's offhand complaints about her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, damnit, these pants fit me last week. Did you wash these on cold?\" <i>No, babe, these didn't shrink in the laundry,</i> she thought to herself, <i>you're just a greedy little piggy.</i> \"Uh, no, I think I put them on hot.\" Of course, Hannah remained wonderfully unaware of her gains. </span></div></div>",

In a normal environment, it ought to be a time to lay foundations, to lay down roots - to get going with your life. It ought not be a time to guard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Claire Spittz, at that moment, it was like staring into an abyss. As she breathlessly waddled out of the doctor's office, the little insidous voice of her darkest desires faded away as her eyes watered. All she could do was look at her vast body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach inch of fat was no longer cute padding or an indifferent companion. Tears began to roll down her fat-laden face as she was helped into her wheelchair, Hannah wheeling her out. She was helped into the truck bed, but all she could do was stare at her vast body. A normal woman's body was somewhere below the ocean of fat that seemed to stretch out in every direction, from every part of her body. She felt her heart thudding against her chest from the non-exertion that was getting into a truck bed. Not even thirty, and she was staring death in the face, all because of her obesity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fuckin' dying, Steph,\" she moaned as she plopped on the couch, \"I'm fuckin' twenty-five and I'm fuckin' dying...\" Hannah cuddled the seemingly endless rolls of fat. \"Girl.. Girl... Shhh. You got this. We can fix it.\"  Claire wept into Hannah's thinner shoulder, \"How, fuckin' how? I'm huge, I'm a whale, I'm a blob of fat, I can't even step on a fucking treadmill or I'll fucking <b>break it!</b>\" Hannah let her weep, \"I got you, I got you... We'll just follow the doctor's meal plan, and I swear, you'll fix it in no time...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Claire, the crying was theraputic - and even more healing was the reassurance by Hannah. She had recieved excoriating criticism for her soaring weight throughout her life - but never the kind of hope and confidence that Hannah was providing her. She was feeling genuinely inspired, and she spoke through a sniffle, \"Y-You really think I can l-l-lose this weight?\" Hannah nodded and spoke with fierce confidence, \"Hell yes! You can do anything if you put your mind to it - and I'll be right there with you!\" Claire hugged Hannah tightly - she felt like she was being smothered by the mass that was Claire Spittz, but after what she had just been told by her doctor, she didn't want to say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept holding on - mortal fear began to set in, and she spoke hoarsely, \"Claire.. Uh... Can't breathe..\" Claire let off and chuckled, \"Well, guess that's another reason to lose weight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question of how to exercise was a daunting one for a woman as huge as Claire. A lot of aerobic exercise was dangerous for a woman who was a house away from heart disease, who already lived with high blood pressure - but somewhere had to be a starting point. Claire checked her purse for her insulin pen -  it was odd for her, carrying this around. Hannah called from the foyer, \"You ready Claire?\" Claire turned about, \"Yep, got my Insulin and my pocketbook.\" They pulled towards the great glass edifice of the local mall - with all its signs and corporate logos, cohorts of teenagers milling around the parking lot, who all seemed to gawk at the ball of lard rumbling across the parking lot on her two legs. The short jaunt from the truck had already begun to tax Claire's lungs, Hannah kept her by the arm - \"Come on, girl, you can do it. You can do it. Keep walkin'.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like an eternity. Her fat legs could only stride so far, her heart was pounding towards her ribs, and it was getting painful. Her lungs burnt with the exertion. But it was so close. She had to keep going. Oh, god, her heart was pounding so hard - the last time it pounded this hard was the last time she tried to run - an exertion which literally caused her to collapse. But she was almost there. Come on, she could almost see it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air conditioning cooled her sweat-laden forehead, giving her a rush of comfort, a rush of delight. She had done it. She had walked out of the parking lot. But sweet jesus, her lungs still burned, and her heart was still pounding like a jackhammer - she was staying alert for the tell-tale signs - no pain in her left arm. \"Han, please, I gotta stop..\" Hannah turned and nodded, taking her to a nearby bench. The pair sat down - Claire took deep, gasping breaths. Slowly her lungs seemed to burn less - her heart slowed to a somewhat normal pace. She could suddenly hear something over the din of the crowd, said at a tone where it was seemingly assumed that she couldn't hear them - \"Damn, did she walk through the parking lot? She's that tired just from that?\" She lowered her head in shame as she heard the reply, \"Yeah - that ain't healthy, she's gotta watch out or she's gonna keel over and die.\"  Hannah could tell and she shot daggerlike gazes over Claire's shoulder at a man and a woman - a somewhat chubby man and a trim, lean woman. \"Don't listen to them, girl - let's go get some workout gear.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were so many choices. Tight, constricting clothes that fit her with drum tightness. There were stylish ones that Hannah was looking at - they flattered her as she stepped out in a flattering pair of black leggings that accentuated her large ass and her round, shapely thighs and a green, skintight tank with a pink sports bra underneath that peeked out at her shoulders slightly. Claire hyped her up, \"Dayuum, girl, you are a fucking snack!\" Hannah chuckled and spoke up - \"You'll look like one too here once we find something for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they looked for something for Claire. But all the stylish options were gone in Claire's size. 3X, 4X - nothing higher than a 4X. Claire was feeling both worn-down and beat-down, mentally and physically from the exertion of walking around the store for minutes on end and finding nothing. She picked out a 4X - pair of leggings and a full shirt - maybe she could wear it when she had gotten smaller?  She waddled awkwardly into the dressing room and pulled off her vast, tent-like 5XL shirt and her pants. Here she was, in full blubbery obesity. Her form disgusted her now - its irregular bumps, her rolls, her seemingly endless fat that took up the entire mirror - some of her love handles were missing from the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a mixed thing in the back of her mind though - part of her old residual sexual attachment stuck to the idea that she was still sexy in this form - but another, planted by Hannah, imagining the fat stripped away - imagining a future self, free of high blood pressure, liberated from the fat that was robbing her of her mobility. She felt some determination as she pulled on the drum-tight shirt. She pulled and tugged, and barely got the leggings up her ass, but there was no way they were going to go over her giant gut. It seemed to also repel the shirt  at first - turning it into a glorified crop top, her huge gut sticking out. Claire pulled it down, but it looked even worse - every roll was on display, every inch of her globular torso was still visible through the form-fitting cloth that felt choking at the breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled out and Hannah spoke up, smiling broadly, \"Dammmn, girl, that's a whole look!\" Claire felt a rush of happiness and slapped her own ass - a resounding, meaty <b>SMACK</b> sounded through the store - eyes turned to Claire. The pair changed back into their normal clothes in a rush - as rushed as Claire Spittz could be - and bought them. The pricetag was in the hundreds - but it wasn't even necessarily a pair of clothes - it was a promise to herself, a promise that she could rescue herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there came the bane of this promise -the growl of her belly. \"Can we grab some food,\" asked the fat woman. \"Sure thing,\" said Hannah, \"I was feeling peckish myself.\" The two split up to their various establishment. Claire stood in thought. She thought about following Hannah to the health food restaurant - but that wouldn't be enough food! She still needed some food, her appetite wouldn't go away! She waddled over to the pizza restaurant. How much did she want? A slice? Two slices? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man came up and asked her, \"Yeah, hun, what can I get?\" Without thinking, Claire said, \"Yeah, can I get a pepperoni pizza?\" The man nodded and grabbed a ready-to-bake pizza, seemingly prepared for this. She didn't think about this until she carried it back and Hannah looked at her, puzzled. \"Uh - girl, is that on your diet?\" Claire sighed and sat down. \"Well, I've already got it.\" Hannah sighed and spoke, \"Girl, you gotta watch out. You can't just get a whole pizza anymore.\" Claire ate into her Pizza, her eyes cast sadly into the greasy food. She felt the food entering her - almost felt it go to her arteries. She recognized and spoke up, \"Damn it, why can't I eat normally?\" Hannah rubbed her back and spoke up, \"You'll be fine - just get back on the wagon next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pizza incident proved to be a harbinger of difficulties to come. While Hannah stressed that she could come back from a binge like this, she still felt like a failure after the affair.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For all the sweatiness it induced in her, her exercise regimen had brought Claire out of the apartment more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had begun to see the world again - and she had to admit, some days she had missed it. The beauty of the trees in bloom in late spring, the birds chirping, the pleasant warmth without being an oppressive heat that summer brought. It was worth her walks around the neighborhood. She had started small - first, down the road and back - that was an endeavor equal to the Mall. But she kept doing it, and her aerobic capacity increased. She felt like she could survive a brief walk from a middle-row park, an affair that would have nearly killed her before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her walks gave her access to Billy Dee's Gas Station. She had stopped at Billy Dee's before for food, and it was, in fact, a favorite haunt of hers. The best part was the in-house kitchen, where the most unhealthy treats possible were fried up - especially her favored Chicken Strips with a large order of Loaded French Fries - replete with sour cream, cheese and bacon. It was always her favorite part of going on a walk - and a part that, strictly speaking, she wasn't supposed to do, seeing as her walks came an hour after lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah had set it up to where she cooked a good mix of food she was comfortable with eating and foods that were good for her - macaroni and cheese plus a grilled pork-chop, a salad with some light dressing and some pan-fried chicken. She was, in theory, <i>supposed</i> to be at a deficit of 1,000 calories a day, accounting for her exercise. Hannah even accounted for some of Claire's favorite snacks in the diet - her salty gaming fuel. What she didn't count on was Claire abusing her ability to walk to set back her dieting progress. Her added mobility, thankfully, was keeping her at a stalemate in her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it still frustrated her. She would try to stop herself from stopping at Billy Dee's - and one day she had decided to walk the other way, towards Genemont street. Her joints ached, and her belly grumbled. <i>Son of a bitch,</i> she thought, <i>can I just ignore you for one damn afternoon?</i> She paced up, past the house with no fence - the corner was coming up. She was starting to feel beat by the struggle that was walking at above 500 pounds, even with some added lung capacity - but she had begun to crest the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe insidious smell of pizza drifted into her nose - from just to her right. She trodded on - her mind trying to get her to stop, but she just couldn't. She found herself wandering, sweaty and exhausted, into the wooden interior of Maggiano's. A bald italian man waved at her from behind the kitchen counter, \"Hello! Sit anywhere, be with you.\" Damn it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ordered a meat lover's stromboli and an order of garlic knots. The Italian man chuckled heartily, \"Good, good! We love to make sure you' not hungry when you leave, have that out for you.\" Claire internally griped with herself - <i>Seriously? There just so happens to be more food this way? What the fuck?</i><br>\r\nThe stromboli came - it was a huge thing, and the garlic knots were deliciously covered in parmesan. Each bite was juicy, meaty goodness - cheese flowing in her mouth, the marinara dip heaven... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had finished the stuff, took her insulin shot, paid for it and was on her way back out. She'd find her way back in to the point where Maggiano would have her order ready for her by the time she got there - sometimes he threw in some extras. And this increased calorie payload tipped the scales a bit further against Claire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire, you've <b>gained</b> three pounds.\" Claire sighed and slouched her shoulders. She had begun to lose her ardor in the fight against her obesity. \" Babe, please be honest with me. Where do you go on your walks?\" Claire shook her head, \"I don't know, I just go around the block a bit and then I come back.\" Hannah sighed. She was doing everything she could to help Claire lose weight and save her life. She couldn't afford to use the kid-gloves - it was time for some brutal honesty, \"Babe, I calculate your calories and everything. You should be at a 1000 calorie deficit, even with your snacks. 1000 calories don't just come out of nowhere. You're killing yourself, girl - you can't keep doing this shit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire broke out in a sob and moaned out in self-directed agony, \"I knowww~! I just can't fucking ignore it! My stomach keeps growling, every time I'm on one of those walks! I can't just stay away, and it's everywhere! Everywhere I go, there's j'st s'ch....gh....\" She paused, taking gasping breaths through her tears. Hannah comforted her. \"Look, girl, I know, it's hard. But it's your life we're talking about. I care about you, and it's not like it's far away, if you just give up...\" She placed a hand on Claire's eternally-racing heart, \"If you give up, your fat's going to kill you. You can't stop - it's going to be hard, but you can push through it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire knew Hannah was right. And she began doing just that - at first she tried to ignore her stomach, then she just kept her mouth occupied - gum, mints - anything that kept her from stopping and eating at Maggiano's and Billy Dee's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf nothing got in the way, she was on the right track.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a week since she had been able to stop eating at Maggiano's and Billy Dee's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weight had been falling off at record speed - some 23 pounds in a week. Granted, most of that was water weight, but it felt great to Claire! She was on her way back to taking back her life. In this stage, she was becoming that much more happy that Hannah was not forcing her onto some ultra-strict diet where her old favorites were off limits. She still had pizza, mac and cheese, cookies, and chips - but they factored into her calorie count, she was simply on a budget of calories. She was thankful that these foods were not off-limits - behind some metaphorical set of bars. It made her feel human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, some nights, she felt more adventurous than ever - asking specifically for some peas instead of mac and cheese, a salad with more vegetables in it - she was probing her boundaries, exploring new foods. She was increasingly happy and satisfied with life. In addition, she grew more adventurous with her exercise - helped along by her increasing aerobic capabilities. That Tuesday, she determined to round the whole block, some two miles of walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stride was improved as the fat had come off and her lungs improved - carrying her further with each step. She had her earbuds in - listening through the thin cord to the fast-paced music that set her on her rapid stride, proud step after proud step. Onward, past the corner and past Maggiano's, into more alien territory. There were somewhat unfamiliar houses - unfamiliar stretches of sidewalk she had not walked before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she had improved her capabilities, she was still getting tired - sweaty, distracted by her music, and not paying attention to the concrete, she missed a sudden, uneven break in the concrete that she had not yet trod - a one inch tall crack one could not simply push their foot past - but Claire still could not see her feet, let alone look ahead of her in such a manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when she tried to take the next step, her left foot tried to press rapidly against the crack she could not see past the vastness of fat that had not yet burned in her determination. However, instead of standing pressing her foot against the crack, her torso was already leading into the expected next step - she felt herself falling. She had tried to steady herself against it, but her 500 pounds of heft had too much momentum. She fell for what felt like ages, screaming in terror at the unexpected tumble. She fell to the right - thankfully towards the grass - but the stiffness of her right leg in trying to steady her sideways fall played against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Claire knew, she was on the ground, on the grass, and there was an intense, constant, horrible pain in her right ankle. She heard herself screaming in pain before she could even consciously make the sound. She grasped at the ankle and cradled it - she saw there was some blood and a break in the skin - something white was sticking out of her ankle, and she couldn't feel her hands on her own ankle. Neighbors came pouring out, and in no time, an ambulance had arrived - a whole team of paramedics rushed out of the ambulance. She could almost hear one say - \"Help me pick her up, there's no way I can do that alone.\" One, Two, Three - the four hefted her onto a gurney. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ambulance ride wasn't the worst part - the constant worrying, feeling her heart race worryingly at the pain and anxiety of the fracture. The EKG was beeping off the charts. \"Watch that HR - keep the defib ready, she might go into arrest,\" spoke the red-haired paramedic man tending her broken ankle. Surely enough, she felt a tingle in her right arm - She spoke up, \"Oh, god... Ahh.. \" Her heart pounded hard against her chest, feeling more and more restricted. \"That's it, that's it, correct it,\" spoke the man. Before his sentence was finished, the paddles were over Claire's chest - hovered over - \"Clear,\" a hard and electrifying zap. \"Corrected.\" She felt her heart calm after the intense pain of the defibrillator. A genuine heart attack had just happened to her - granted, as part of a bone fracture - but it was still the kind of deathly danger that she had incurred against herself by her gluttony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was told as much by her doctors in the hospital as the bone was splinted and nursed - \"Miss Spitz, if you were thinner, I am certain you would not have had that heart attack on the way here - and at worst this would be a sprain.\" Eventually, however, she was allowed home. Her right foot below the knee was in a great, black cast and she was instructed to not move it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah lovingly helped her in on her wheelchair - \"Girl, I am so sorry! I'm gonna make sure you get better from this,\" caressing Claire's shoulder. Claire couldn't help but feel that she had fucked herself up - she had let herself get so fat that she couldn't even lose the weight if she had tried. Hannah, out of pity, asked, \"What do you want for supper? Nothing's off limits.\" Claire thought, sighed, and spoke - \"Can we get something from Billy Dee's?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that mode of thought dominated Hannah's treatment of Claire. She felt horrible - she had encouraged Claire to exercise, and now she had suffered a horrible injury as a result - her friend deserved whatever would make her comfortable. Unfortunately, what made her comfortable was food - and plenty of it. Hannah's kind nature was being used to enable Claire's gluttony. Slowly but surely, the instruments that had fattened Claire began returning - pizza, Billy Dee's, fattening homecooked meals made by Hannah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe result was that the twenty pounds came back on by the end of the next month. With no way to move, Claire could not burn almost a single calorie consumed, and her BMR was not up to the task of burning the thousands and thousands of calories Hannah was letting her consume. Claire's weight began to balloon as the months rolled on, and her drive to lose weight was gone.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The weight loss that had begun the year became more and more a distant memory as Claire ate away at her frustrations and filled her days with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery meal was a binge that drowned her anger at being unable to lose the weight that was threatening her life and keeping her a husk of a person. Bacon, pastries, and other fattening foods in the morning - Hannah drank at her large mug of coffee, she frequently had to wake up early to cook these big breakfasts for Claire. But she was happy to do it - her friend was on the tail-end of healing her leg. Finally she turned about, her arms jiggled as she carried the tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah's access to the food she was using to help make Claire feel better wasn't without its own effects. Her previously slim body was growing fatter - the bacon, the eggs, the lunches out at work, the fattening food she shared with Claire, it began to show on her body. Her arms had grown from slender little things to being broader and softer, her waist had increased by some five inches - a little belly accompanied by the beginnings of love handles began to emerge where once was a slim torso. Her thin legs now blossomed outward into chubby thighs. She was, of course, far from Claire's increased size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's gut, already huge, had rolled out exponentially. At her normal seated position, it now easily overran her mid-thighs and approached her knees, a great wave of fat that encircled and coated every inch of her torso. Her breasts rolled out and sat atop of her great, obese gut, heaving constantly with shallow breaths kept down by her ever-soaring weight. She frequently rubbed at her chest nowadays, which she did before speaking to Hannah, \"Thanks, Han.\" Her chest pains had been coming back in a bad way after the end of her diet and exercise program. It wasn't helped by constant, salty meals such as this. The grease of the bacon slid down her throat, chased by salty potatoes and eggs, and pastries that, strictly speaking, weren't supposed to be eaten by a diabetic like her. It was obvious that her weight was exploding at an unprecedented rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the meal finished, Claire spoke up as she injected her insulin into her stomach and took her pills, \"My cast is due to come off soon.\" Hannah spoke up, \"Good! It'll help you get around easier.\" She got up, prepared for her workday. \"I've got to go to work. Take care!\" Claire waved a hefty arm at Hannah, \"G'bye! Take care!\" Something in the back of Hannah's mind was telling her that this was wrong - but her sympathy was beginning to be replaced by an apathy - <i>If she wants to lose the weight, she'd tell me. Besides, I haven't eaten this good in a while.</i> Hannah had taken care of her finances - her car was paid, her  insurance was going well, and she had a hefty warchest. She figured she could indulge for a little while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's weight, however, had ballooned at a runaway rate as a result of this relative hedonism on Hannah's part. Her daily calorie intake easily exceeded 6000 each day, and over the past four months, she had blown up like a human balloon. She had given up on either actively gaining or actively losing weight, just accepting what was happening to her. She was less eating for the morbid sexual pleasure that she previously got, and now more eating to kill time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime was certainly starting to run out. Her next doctor's appointment made that clear. The georgian was gobsmacked, \"Claire, you have not been keeping up with your diet. If you had stayed on it over the course of your injury, you should be easily at 500, but you're at the entire opposite end. She stepped on the cattle scale. It flashed a stunning number - 622 pounds. Her blood pressure was up to a near constant 159, and her medicine wasn't high enough in dosage. \"You are out-eating our medicine, your cholesterol is reaching dangerous numbers. So, I'm sorry.\" Claire was confused, \"What?\" The doctor continued, \"I'm sorry, but if you do not listen to our medical advice and continue eating yourself to death, I am going to have to drop you as a patient. I can't bear to keep seeing you come here, bigger, fatter, unhealthier each time. The next time I see you, you're going to be on a metal slab, and you're going to be dead from a heart attack.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire reacted as usual - by eating her emotions. How she reacted next would decide her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire had already judged that she was too fat to lose weight. The Georgian dropping her as a patient was the last straw, and Claire's binge didn't just go on that night - it carried on for days afterward. Pizza, fried chicken, pasta, masses of junk - some days, all of them in a procession of gut-busting, clothes-ripping furor. She ate and ate as her mind figured, <i>If I'm a dead woman, I might as well enjoy myself. I'm hopeless.</i> She <b>felt</b> herself getting fatter, <b>felt</b> her gut rolling further outward with each meal, her stomach seemed to expand with each one. Her binges seemed to increase by at least one plate each week. Her days devolved into endless stretches of eating herself silly, broken up only by insulin injections that, at times, didn't feel like enough - sometimes her vision was still blurry, and of course she sated the tiredness by simply passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt dinner, one night, Hannah sat down across from her. Claire looked at her, disheartened, \"Han, don't.\" Hannah shrugged and spoke, \"Why not? I figure binges can be social activities.\" The two of them on a table packed to every single centimeter with dishes and plates. Hannah ate, but couldn't keep up with the rate and volume of Claire's consumption. After one mere party plate of General Tso's and one box of chinese donuts. She rubbed her taut gut, which developed more into a belly - her love handles began to mature across her sides, her arms went from ever so slightly chubby to being full-on fat, just short of having bingo wing folds of fat drape from below her arms. \"Ouwwww...\" Claire giggled through her limited lung capacity, \"You got a ways to go, girl.\" Hannah seemed to pass out into a food coma right there, while Claire kept on eating. At that point, Hannah had ordered too much food  - she had larger eyes than her stomach could support. Even <i>Claire</i> struggled to finish, and her gut stuck out tautly over her knees. She could barely bring herself to inject her insulin, and couldn't even take her pills before she passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe woke up with her heart continuously pounding as her body struggled to process the weight of food. She laid there in terror for a long time - was this it? Did her gluttony finally do her in? She didn't feel the telltale tingle - nor did she feel dizzy. Her heart kept on pounding, and she rubbed at her pained chest - but she didn't feel it getting any worse. It must have been okay - for now. She chided herself internally - <i>I'm such a fucking whale, I've eaten myself into this position, what the hell is wrong with me?</i> But she reminded herself, <i>I'm too fat to lose this weight. I'm doomed, only thing left to do is to try to enjoy myself.</i> She began to feel a simple pleasure in expanding her capacity to eat. It was the joy of painting a fence - in a more self-destructive manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the fence was surely being painted. Not only did her stomach expand itself, but the rest of her seemed to flood outward in a flood of fat. Her binging took her to easily at least 2000 calories a meal. Three times a day, with another 1500 in snacks, meant that she was easily putting on some 11 pounds a week - and with Hannah attempting to keep pace, she was easily putting on some 6 herself. By the end of the month, Claire had put on some 40 extra pounds. Of course, Claire's health only began to get worse from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to feel the after-effects of her relentless eating as she felt a burning chest pain after nearly every meal. But she could barely move now - and she was certain no other doctor would accept a patient like her - she was, after all, too fat to be treated. She ate through the pain - every session of burning chest pain being accompanied by Claire awaiting a tingle in the arm - which seemed not to come, not yet. It seemed as though the anticipation of the thing was going to be worse than the actual instance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Claire waited for her heart to give out, other things began to give out.</span></div></div>",

At times, it can play tricks on a person. Sensation drives people, in many ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is the lack of sensation that can be particularly unsettling. And it unsettled Claire more and more that her right leg had been tingling and numb for a while now. She remembered the tingling of her leg as one of the first warning signs of her diabetic symptoms. But she could only get so much insulin - and her doctors had dropped her - it would be a while before she could get more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started one day when she was feeling quite tired after a binge - normal, food comas were one of her favorite things about eating. She began to pull a blanket up - but it felt strangely heavy on her right leg - almost as if it was weighted to keep the leg pressed to the floor. She felt her right leg tingle all over - she figured it would go away. But ignoring the problem only led to it getting worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe great pillar of folds, fat, and lard that was Clarie Spittz's right leg had dark folds in between - a natural consequence of her diabetic skin issues. However, more and more, Hannah gazed at this leg with growing concern. She had tried to wash the leg, but one particular spot continued getting worse. \"Claire, is your right leg alright?\" Claire shrugged and spoke, \"Uh, I think so. It doesn't hurt.\" Hannah examined the leg closer - especially this problem spot of eternally dark skin. One of her folds around her knees stank to the high heavens - Hannah gagged, physically repelled. Claire's heart sped up - faster than normal, which was an already exhausting tempo, as she realized this was more than a temporary issue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire, this isn't good,\" spoke  Hannah. \"We need to go to the emergency room. I think something's REALLY wrong with your leg.\" Claire had, once again, to be lifted up onto a gurney - a double-wide one - and wheeled out of the apartment. Even on this double-wide gurney, Claire looked packed into the wheeled bed. The already - generous belt, stretched by the hands of the paramedics, strained - \"Jan, get me the extender, please?\" Claire could only lay there and think, <i>My god, I've gotten nearly too fat even for the fucking gurney.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride to the hospital was one of an endless attempt at sanitization of the fold. The blonde paramedic woman spoke, \"Rob, how much antiseptic to we have? This might be gangrenous, or really close to it.\" The man came over and examined Claire's leg closely. He asked, \"Are you a diabetic, ma'am?\" She nodded, her face as pale as death. Her breath became more and more shallow - she felt a tell-tale tingle in her right arm. Her chest pain got worse - her heart felt like a belt was stretching around it - \"We've got Blue, get the defib,\" shouted the man. Almost immediately the blonde had the whining paddles in her hands. \"Clear!\" she shouted, and the corrective shock calmed Claire's heart - forcing it out out of its panicked tremor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the hospital, Claire faced the face-masked surgeon. \"Ma'am, it's gangrenous. I deeply apologize - but it has to go.\" Claire trembled weakly in recognition of what this meant. She took a look at her great, lardy, filthy right leg. \"M-My leg? M... M...\" She began sobbing. The surgeon nodded, \"I'm sorry, I really am, but it's this, or you die very, very slowly and painfully from the gangrene. We can't let it spread - it's thankfully just the ankle that will go - it's literally minutes otherwise. We have to cut now.\" Claire sloppily signed the paper - she laid back and let the anesthesia do its work. \"One.. Two...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlackness. What felt like a bare moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she came to, she heard more talk - and felt EKG monitors on her chest. \"Procedure went well.. Keep her on the EKG, just in case - she's had one, and Infarctions like to come in groups.\" Claire's eyes turned to her right leg. It felt un-earthly that, below her slabs of meat that were her thighs, no longer were there folds of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, there was now nothing below her right knee. As the surgeon had said, the lower leg was gone. \"Ah. You're awake. Everything went well - surgery went fine, we're going to keep you under monitoring for any more heart attacks. We'll be keeping you on a liquid diet for a while - and we'll be transitioning you to an appropriate diet afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese words were like death to Claire. She had JUST been eating literally anything she'd wanted. Now she was being put on a diet by force - she had to physically repress a groan. \"I know, it's no fun,\" said the doctor, \"But it's necessary.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah came to visit her shortly afterward. \"Hey, girl. You feeling alright?\" Claire shook her head, \"I don't have a fucking right foot anymore, Han. I feel like shit.\" Hannah shook her head and patted Claire on her shoulder. \"Is there anything I can do to make you feel better?\" </span></div></div>",

Her legs took firmer shape and had begun to shrink backward - her thighs were still crowded with fat, but she could <i>feel</i> them move easier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost encouragingly, her great ocean-like gut, while still heavy with fat, had finally begun to recede backward by inches. More of the world directly below her became visible - she was more easily able to see where she was walking, objects she was at risk of stepping on - more helpful with the increased mobility that her fat loss brought with it. It was an interesting kind of momentum - she had finally been able to break her long lethargy on her weight. It was no longer some vast beast that held her down in one place, that trapped her and suffocated her. She was fighting back and it gave her a special kind of empowerment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah had taken notice and regularly showed her pride in Claire's progress, shown as one day she put on her green workout shirt - managing to actually stretch it over her lessened gut, \"Wow, holy shit, it fits you now!\" Claire beamed with pride, \"Yeah... We're makin' some headway, girl, I won't let that damn thing kill me.\" Hannah patted her shoulder. \"I know what this calls for!\" Claire rolled her shoulders - they hurt far less now, and her walking had improved her posture. She stood up straighter now - and her back was hurting less and less with each pound lost. \"What's that?\" She asked, turning to see Hannah get something out of the refrigerator. It was brownie batter, \"Sugar-free brownie time!\" Claire bounced with joy, \"Eee! Yes! You know how to treat a girl right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah soon was pulling a tray of brownies out. Part of her thought that this might encourage a bad streak in Claire - over-'rewarding' herself - but she fought this. <i>She's doing well</i>, Hannah thought. <i>If I don't reward that, she'll stop losing weight</i>. She cut the brownies up as Claire began the process of standing - a far shorter thing now than it was when she was heavier. She was ever-more ready and happy to see her next weigh-in as she waddled towards the brownie pan. Hannah had just finished when she looked over - \"Oh my god, you're up.\" Claire strutted comically - \"I can walk now, bi-atch! Flexing on 'em!\" She formed a check-mark with her left arm and ducked her head into it - Hannah sighed at the dabbing woman, \"Oh my god, Clarie.\" The woman chuckled as she picked up a brownie, munching on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, this was good! The sugar-free ones seemed to be even sweeter than the sugar-made brownies. The chocolate was rich, the flour was thick - it was so delicious. A deeper part of her hoped for such 'rewards' more frequently, but her reigning reason-focused part of her brain slapped down the idea - <i>I'm just now beginning to lose the weight, I can't go back on myself now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Hannah called in Claire, \"Claire, it's time - let's check how well you've done.\" The still blubbery woman stepped onto the scale, anxious for the numbers that would come up. How much had she lost in the span of four months, the winter having turned into spring?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four Hundred and Ninety Eight Pounds,\" read out the voice of the scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire could scarcely believe it - she had managed to lose over fifty pounds! Granted, some twenty of that was water weight - but the rest was real fat, she was below 500 for the first time in recent years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether she could stay below 500, however, would be seen, as a roadblock would come before the shrinking woman.</span></div></div>",

She felt prouder of herself than ever, more confident - she was still sweating like a hog in a desert, but she would have literally dropped dead had she attempted this a few months before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shrinking stomach no longer impeded her movement to the degree it did before - holding perkily above her now more versatile thighs, which were still considerably bloated with fat - but were shrinking with each passing week. Her face even began to feel less fat - her cheeks began to retreat from her view, her fold of neck fat climbed back towards her chin. She felt the weight coming off, and it made her feel alive - not to mention how the diet and exercise had improved her health to a point she could feel and measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer next medical appointment showed drastically reduced numbers - her blood pressure was normal, her blood sugar was in a good range, her cholesterol was lowering, and she could feel her overall health improving beyond these numbers. Her chest no longer had random pains, she no longer felt randomly faint - her posture had improved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she had also gotten a letter a few weeks back that her disability was being revoked due to her marked weight loss - and she would have to find employment. Her job hunt had carried her to various interviews - including to this fairly bog-standard Doranko printing company, a squat one-story building that had the logo placard out front - the name of the company on a half orange-half royal blue background, the orange pointing upward towards the sun under which Claire waddled at a moderate pace, dressed in a black button-down shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made sure it was tucked into her pants - leaving it fairly tight, the buttons twisting slightly to the side in their struggle to hold back the still-considerable bulk of Claire, which at last weigh-in was somewhere still around 488. She entered the glory of the air-conditioned building with its businesspeople hustling and bustling about. The carpeted patterns led her forward to the desk, where a short, thin, mid-aged woman with brown haired- bob-cut and a wrinkled face looked at her up and down - she had applied online and recieved an e-mail, but it was obvious that the morbidly obese form of Claire was not what she was expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spoke with a falsetto of her normally mid-to-low ranged voice, \"Hiii! You must be miss Spittz, right?\" Claire nodded and spoke, \"Yes ma'am, that's me, I applied for that assistant printer position.\" The woman extended her hand and spoke, \"Well, I'm Jean Grondon, nice to meet you miss Spittz,\" she then looked curtly about and spoke, \"Uh, go ahead and follow me into my office.\" Claire followed her as she opened the wooden waist-high gate that Claire walked towards. She was thankful for her weight loss - it was hard to squeeze through, even at her reduced size - her large hips chafed against the posts. Mrs. Grondon took note, as her face had grown slightly less welcoming and a bit unsettled by something - asking, \"Do you need help?\" Claire, red-faced, spoke, \"Uh - no, I'm good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey wandered into the office, and Jean sat in her office chair - Claire took a seat in her chair, but it was horrifically constricting - it felt like the wood closed in on every single inch of her ass, and the armrests choked her torso in place. \"So, what motivates you to work here for Doranko?\" Claire spoke, taking a breath through the choking constraint of wood, \"Uh, mainly, I've just recently lost my disability - I was disabled from working, by, uh..\" she awkwardly paused, and spoke up, \"My weight, I was too heavy to work - I've started to lose weight, I lost my disability, and I'm looking for some gainful employment.\" It was prophetic that she would pick that phrase. The rest of the interview panned out - she could work a full work-week of 5 days a week, 8 hours a day. \"Well, thank you, miss Spittz, I'll let you know about my decision within the next two weeks. She stood up and extended her hand. Most awkwardly, Claire stood up with the chair still stuck to her, shaking the woman's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire, thankfully, managed to get the job - a speedy reply was hers by the next two days, and she had her uniform of a white button-down, special ordered in her size -  4XL, and it fit her just perfectly - not too loose, not too tight. It was a point of pride - what was not was the daily fight with the tightness of the employee gate. Her co-workers stood about and greeted her - a tall, lanky teenager with blonde hair and white, tanned skin. \"Hey,\" he said, \"You're the new employee? I'm Rick.\" Alongside him stood a brunette woman with some weight to her about Claire's height - some 160 pounds, with a slight gut, arms padded by fat, and thick thighs. \"Hey, Claire - I'm Dana.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey showed her the ropes of the trade. The main work areas were the central area behind the front desk, the worker's offices were in a room behind this area with a window's view of customers, and the main printing room to the right from the perspective of the customer. Claire had expected a fair amount of walking with this job - walking papers back and forth, ensuring covers were correctly put on, binding books. However, the three managed to share work fairly well - Rick would frequently be managing tasks in the central area, and Dana was usually at the front desk. It was Claire's job to make sure that print jobs ran correctly - and for this, she had to sit in front of the printer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat first workday's lunchtime came shortly, and Dana turned to Claire - \"Hey, Claire, I'm gonna run to Zheng's for lunch. Want anything?\" Claire thought. She didn't want to be that person, so she spoke, \"Eh, get me the Chicken Lo Mein and a side order of Crab Rangoon.\" It was her old stand-by from Zheng's. Dana nodded, \"Sure thing. I'll grab myself one while I'm at it. Want anything, Rick?\" Rick shrugged and spoke up in his usual nonchalant tone, \"Eh, already got my lunch packed. Thanks though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food came in the hands of chubby Dana, she set them in the back in the common table. Jean came out and spoke up, \"You guys taking your lunch? I can cover.\" Claire spoke up, \"Yep, thanks, miss Grondon!\" The group sat down and munched on their chinese - and Rick ate his leftover pasta. Dana spoke through a mouthful of Rangoon, \"You came in clutch with the suggestion, Claire, I love the rangoon, but I usually stay away from them.\" Claire chuckled, \"Yeah, they're so good, right?\" Dana spoke up, \"Mm. Oh. By the way, if you want some dessert after this, the snacks don't bring much in - we've got some snack stuff back there, it's allotted right to us, so it's free,\" she gestured behind her to a table with an array of candy bars, salty snacks, cookies, and a coffee machine. \"Ooh!\" Exclaimed Claire, \"Thanks,\" she said, reaching over and grabbing a candy bar. Dana waved it off, \"No problem. I need someone to remove the temptation for me - I'm trying to chill out on that stuff.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs lunch wrapped up, Claire injected her insulin, grabbed some chips, and watched the jobs print. She had little better to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Claire's exercise dropped from what was, for her, a record to damn near nothing. However, routines are stubborn things - and Hannah did not think to adjust Claire's calorie intake. Her semi-active nature had formerly kept her weight off - burning some 500-800, sometimes even 1000 extra calories a day - calories that  were compensated for by her snack allotment at home. But her change of routine had forced Hannah to change up - switch out to simpler, high-calorie ingredient breakfasts that were quicker to prepare. Claire's lunches were once again packed with high-calorie, cheap, fast food, and she idly snacked at more sweets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effects slowly became apparent. Her work clothes became tighter and tighter, Hannah had less time to help her monitor her weight, and work for Hannah began picking up at the same time - and so more and more nights, Hannah ordered in. The dominoes were falling to crush Claire's diet dead, and her receding gut began its descent once more, creeping back into the path of her more and more unused thighs, which themselves were growing outwards. Her hips were growing wider, and each day she had a harder and harder struggle with the employee gate, each time deriving a longer stare from Jean. </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire's gains, though slow, had begun to affect her office life. Her gains were slow, at least, compared to her intentional gains during her camgirl days. She was putting on some one, one and a half pounds a week - over the past two months, she had put on nearly ten pounds, and it began to show that she was nearly back to 500. Her blue uniform was straining, nearly skin-tight. When she particularly gorged herself with Dana at lunch, gaps of flesh could be seen poking through the struggling, side-turning buttons which were on the verge of constantly snapping out, leaving her half-naked in the printing office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana herself had not been immune to the fattening food she ate with Claire. The obese woman's bad habits were spreading to the impressionable young brunette, and she had been made to request an upsize - she officially now wore an XL shirt. \"Claire, girl, you're making me into a pig - if I have to go to 2XL, it's on you.\" Claire giggled and oinked jokingly. By the way Jean was staring at her, though, she thought it wasn't a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFairly frequently, Claire could feel eyes on her in the office due to her increasing size, including Jean. The mid-aged woman was always giving her a stare-down, especially when Claire was having a nice, big lunch, or snacking on the job. It was the classic, <i>you're getting fat and you know you should be eating a salad instead</i>, type of stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOften, Claire had approached the gate with the idea that it was too small - until she was able to squeeze through it, albeit with some effort. She assumed the same was true today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled forward, stepped  up, and pushed the gate forward - opening it. She stepped forward, felt the familiar squeeze of the wood. But today was different. The squeeze had become increasingly tight, but today she tried to continue forward - and simply could not force her way through the normally temporary halt. She tried to pull herself backward for another attempt, but her love handles were wedged too firmly in. A wave of embarrassment struck her, and she felt the eyes of the whole building on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waved over at Dana, \"Hey, girl, mind helping?\" Dana waddled over - her step had become more impeded by her increasing thigh fat - and awkwardly pulled herself over the front desk. Puffing from this athletic exertion, she shoved on Claire's great back fat, a wall that was lodged in the entry gate. She shoved and heaved, but to no avail. \"Jean! Claire's stuck, I'm gonna need some help!\" Jean came out, and she had one of the sourest looks that Claire had ever seen her with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hopped the thin wooden wall next to the gate and shoved with Dana, and spoke up, \"After this, I'm gonna need to talk to you in my office, Claire.\" Claire could only think what would be said - but there was no escaping it, the strength of the two were able to free the great mass of whale-like blubber from the trap. Dana stepped aside and took a breath - the very pudgy woman was red-faced and sweaty from the exertion, leaving Jean's dagger-like nails shoving Claire through her office door. There was a brief moment of being lodged, but Jean pushed again and stopped Claire from being stuck again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire pulled herself into a chair dragged from the corner. It was not dissimilar to some of the disabled chairs she had been made to sit in due to her larger size. Jean sat herself across from Claire as she shut the door, and glared at her for a moment. It was the kind of no-nonsense look a parent practices at a child who has annoyed them. She opened her mouth and spoke, \"Claire, to be frank, you've been dedicated to your work here, but it's been hindered lately.\" She took a moment and let her finished sentence hang in the air, resuming, \"Your weight gain has been noticeable.  Your standard issue uniform is already in the largest size we issue, and you are on the verge of busting out of it. Jean poked a finger through an exposed flesh gap in the already-struggling shirt, Hannah had been able to cook a big breakfast this morning, and Claire had indulged herself. She now regretted it as Jean spoke up, \"And as far as that gate incident is concerned, it should be a wake-up call. It should be a wake-up call that every time, you're barely able to squeeze through. But I've seen you eating yourself silly every lunch-time, and I'm getting concerned about you.\" Jean looked down her nose at Claire. Claire didn't dare to speak up as Jean resumed, \"Your physical when you started said you already have high blood pressure, diabetes, the beginnings of heart disease. I hired you under the impression that I wouldn't have to up-size much, as you've been on a weight-loss streak before this. I don't want to have to up-size this whole office just for you - so either lose some weight, or the improvements are coming out of your pay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire felt powerless at the might of this domineering woman. It was like she was back in middle school, and all she could say was, \"Yes ma'am.\" She stood up from the humiliatingly huge chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah herself was becoming more aware of Claire's returning gains. \"You're fallin' off the wagon, girlie,\" she said that evening as Claire ate into a dish of pasta. \"You're the one orderin' the takeout,\" said Claire. It was true, and it was showing on Hannah as well. She was beginning to look like a slightly smaller Dana - her trim, slim torso had thickened - just so, to the point just before she developed a potbelly. She was thick - and dangerously close to fat, just lacking the gut by a few pounds. \"I know - I guess I wasn't in a wagon to fall off of - so I guess that makes the two of us that ought to cut this out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat weekend, Claire renewed her commitment to lose weight - but Hannah spoke, \"I'll start Monday, I swear.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After that immense humiliation, Claire got right back onto the wagon. She swapped out with Rick - the skinny teen was happy to get her lazy position, and Jean seemed to nod with approval at this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana, of course, kept on gaining. The next three months brought a bigger and bigger Dana - she had blown up to somewhere over 200 pounds, and her XL was looking more and more pressed to keep up its position. \"Claire, come on, I'm packin' on the pounds here. Help me get rid of some of this temptation,\" Dana would exhort at lunchtime. But Claire held her ground, \"Nah, I'm trying to not get stuck in the gate again. Besides, you're nowhere near as big as I am. You've got some wiggle room.\" Jean began taking Dana's place in helping to supply Claire some meals - she would occasionally find a granola bar to snack on, a caesar salad with a \"Keep up the Good Work\" sticky note attached. Some month ago, this would have been an annoying, passive-aggressive assault. Now, it was a genuine, helpful measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay by day, there was less of a fight to get through the wooden gate. Her gut receded towards its former position at the start of her job - her shirt breathed easier as the jiggling gut jiggled further back - further than at the start of her job some months ago. The shirt even began to seem baggy on some days. Claire felt proud of herself - she was ignoring temptation! She was actively choosing now to vary up her food consumption - more vegetable-based suppers, more salad lunches provided by helpful Jean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same could certainly not be said of Hannah. Claire's already - engorging - friend continued getting nearly exponentially larger over the next few months. She seemed to keep pace with Dana - eating fattening, big, supper after fattening, big, supper. The formerly thin friend was now blowing up above her zaftig form, her thighs and breasts taking a dutiful amount of the weight before it inevitably turned her pudgy belly into an outright gut with full-blown love - handles. Claire didn't dare say anything, though - she knew Hannah wouldn't nag Claire about what she ate unless it was becoming a real problem. And it wasn't a problem with Hannah, so far as Claire knew. She was just enjoying herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's weight kept falling by the month - some 9 pounds the first month, then another 10, then, another 9 - it was stunning for Claire to be dropping so much weight, some 30 pounds backing her away from 500 again, and lowering her down to some 465 pounds. She still wore her 4X button-up - but she had to request for a down-size in her pants, and Jean was noticing. \"Girl, you're doing so great! You're losing so much weight, how much are you down to right now?\" Claire hummed and spoke, \"Uh, four-sixty-five.\" Jean gave her a high-five, \"YESS! Girrl, you're doing so great!\" It was somewhat jarring to have a woman that was sounding her death knell a few months ago now trumpeting her as the picture of health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mounting momentum was huge. Claire was able to keep herself full on a diet - something she had never thought possible, and she still fit in her favorite foods. An occasional slice of pizza - some mac and cheese - some dessert. Her blood sugar numbers had been normal for a while, and her heart no longer pounded out of her chest. She had the hope that, if she kept this up, her Diabetes might go into outright remission - she was making a physical impact not just on her waistline, but on her health. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer amount of control that she now had over herself was stunning, even to her some days. She had even gotten back into gaming - she used the energy she normally used to snack to focus on the game. Damn, though, was she rusty. Shit, She should have been able to dodge that one! It had that extra amount of joy, though - it was like the first time, all over again. She still did snack occasionally - but she began focusing on lighter, lower-calorie snacks - small granola bars, small fruits - nuts - hardly over 250 calories a day on snacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, Claire Spittz was seeing that weight loss, for her, was about getting into a pattern. And that pattern was starting to be set in stone. It would take a serious obstacle to overcome the momentum she was building.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Claire, you want any of this cheesecake,\" inquired Dana. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire pondered it for a moment. Her office friend had been ballooning up another fifteen pounds and it was becoming increasingly noticed by both her and Jean. \"Uh, sure,\" she said, breaking her usual rule to not accept her fattening treats. For the past few months, Claire had kept up her momentum and even began experimenting with recipes that balanced filling and healthy - seeing how much she could fill herself for as few calories as possible. It had a positive effect on her waist, being able to get herself below some 2,500 calories a day. Her weight had kept its steady decline from 465 to, now, 440. Her shirts finally began to decrease in size, back down to a somewhat tight but workable 3X. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the month was now almost November, and Halloween had passed. With November came the glut of unbought store candies, and Dana could not eat all of them. And so, Claire began eating a few more sweets here and there - rarely more than 100 calories' worth at first. But then Jean began complaining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's just so much damn candy around, and I hate waste. Feel free to help yourself, Claire,\" she had said just a day before this incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire thought little of it, but the cheesecakes and holiday sweets built up a good 500 calories. On top of it, as November rolled along, Jean had begun ordering in more catered lunches. \"Our productivity has never been higher and Corporate has graciously provided this catered buffet lunch.\" Claire's slim 500 deficit was now annihilated, and her snacking only increased during the holidays. In the back of her mind, she felt a voice saying, \"This isn't right. You'll put all the weight back on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she silenced this voice - \"Oh, come on, don't be such a food nazi. It's just for the holidays.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, through november, she had a steady 500 calorie surplus going - one that increased as Christmas approached. She stopped weighing herself - she'd assess the damage after the holidays anyhow. The pounds built back up, and she switched back into her 4x for comfort. And at this junction, Dana indulged her worst excesses - ordering in for pizza and fast food for the whole office frequently, and Claire was more than happy to oblige. It was a treat! She was doing really well! On top of this, the sugar-free sweets accumulated from gifts from Jean, gifts from Dana (generous ones) and gifts from Hannah. 500 calories became quickly some 1,500 calories each week, leading up to Christmas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean had begun to put on some weight also - her slim figure began to build, among other curves, a bulge at her waist. Rick was bulking up a bit, though he looked less fat and more muscular. Dana was getting outright fat, and her weight had gone from the low 200's towards the mid 200's. Her button-up was getting tighter and her pants were falling down, shoved downward by her middle-heavy bulk, no longer a pot-belly but rapidly evolving into a thicker slab of fat. Claire's own belly was returning to a prior prominence she hadn't seen since September. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristmas, the whole week and the week of New Years', was the week of wanton indulgence. Claire, especially, ate ravenously. God, I needed this, she thought as she scarfed down entire pizzas for lunch, Dana trying to keep pace. Hannah cooked rich, calorie-high meals as holiday treats, her own thicker waistline turning into an increasing potbelly. Everyone seemed to be fattening for the winter. With this regime of increased, indulgent eating, Claire returned to her old regime of snacking. Easily going over 2,500 calorie surpluses daily, her 4X was frequently tight with an over-stuffed potbelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew Years' Eve saw Claire and Hannah drinking the night away at the apartment.  Hannah drunkenly spoke to Claire, \"Y'kn'w... Claire... I've been gettin' pretty FAT recently. My resolution is... t....\" She gurgled as she hummed, then spoke, \"T'get fatter.\" The two cackled in their state. Claire spoke up, \"Same here... I ... I've gotten fat again... guess I\"m just, going back, back, to, uh, five million or where'v'r I was..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah's eyes could catch the sheer damage the holidays had done on Claire's figure. While Hannah had gotten a little chubby over the holidays, Claire was getting outright FAT. From November to New Years', she had put on some 30 pounds with her overindulgence. Her gut was looking at her old levels, if a few inches shorter. Her 4X was looking packed to bursting in the apartment, and she was wearing one of her old pairs of pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah drunkenly thought, <i>Man, she really is getting fat.</i> She then thought, <i>So am I. What if I let go too?</i> For Hannah, this was a drunken thought forgotten by the morning's hangover. The reality of Claire's immense setback was still very tangible in every pound she had put back on. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That next morning, Claire's whole body ached. She could barely get out of bed from the pounding in her head, her eyes nearly too bleary to percieve the whitewashed ceiling above her. It was a damned hard night she had on New Year's, and her morning was equally hard on her body. She tried to shut her eyes and go to sleep, but the migraine resulting from the night of debauchery kept her awake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis led to her trying to do anything to keep her mind off her aching head, and this led to a stark realization. For the first time in months, she had a good, long time to look at herself in bed. It was January 1st, the day of renewed resolutions, that famous jumping-off point for weight loss. And Claire Spittz recognized something - her gut, laying down, stood a lot taller and a lot thicker than she remembered. That drove her out of bed, to her bathroom. Oh, fuck, it didn't go away. Her whole body shook and jiggled with fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow far have I gone, thought the woman, as she stood on the cold metal of the scale. The numbers drifted. 469, then 478 - a flash that made her heart drop - then a thankful sink in numbers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't far enough. It stopped at 473.6. She had put on over 30 pounds in the span of 2 months, and was under two short months away from being right back where she started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cradled her immensity. How the hell could a person let go that hard? She must have lost her mind, though she remembered that she ate far more that holiday season than she normally did. The road back was simple enough to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah was still asleep - taking the day off as a hangover cure. But Claire figured that if she stayed in, she'd just eat the day away in boredom. She couldn't risk that. She had to be at work. She hadn't packed a lunch the night before, and she had no time to make one - she ate a container of yogurt and drank a cup of coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so her walk began. God almighty, this was a lot harder than she remembered. Her fat jiggled with intensity as she thundered along the sidewalk. Her thunder thighs rebelled against the tightness of her work pants, and her previously slimming torso now even partially filled up her 4X, revealing the lower part of her gut near her pants. Her heart raced at the unexpected exertion, pumping through the accumulated plaque of years of bodily neglect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she got to work, she approached the dreaded gate. Thud, thud, thud. \"Hey, Claire,\" spoke Jean. \"Thanks for coming in. Dana is taking a \"sick day,\" she put in air quotes, \"and Rick has school. You've got the ship.\" By her gaze, it was clear to Claire that she was approaching the size of the metaphorical ship. Ever closer to the gate, and Claire forgot to suck in her gut. She felt the tightness of the wood, and felt wedged as she approached the exit. She swore under her labored breath and gripped the two sides, shoving and sucking as she popped free. Jean's foot tapped against the carpet - a clear sign of dissaproval. \"Guess I'm not the only one who put it on over the holidays, huh?\" Claire giggled nervously, \"Uh, yeah, heh. I've put a lot on over the holidays. I'm gonna try to get some of it off over this next year.\" Jean nodded. \"Yep. I feel you. I've put a lot on myself, and I've gotta tame this gut.\" She poked her own meager bulge, but it was obviously a dig at Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was easily active during the office day, and worked up a good sweat regularly. Of course, it was with unexpected tasks - walking from her office to the front desk, from the front desk to the printer, then formatting - doing the work of the whole office got her heart racing, and got her to sweat up a fair bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time lunch came around and she got some food at a nearby burger place, she couldn't help but recognize that she still had a hard time eating \"clean.\" Her triple-patty burger and fries were far from a \"diet friendly meal\" but she was hungry, damnit. The paradoxical thing is that from all the binging over the holidays, by the time she got back to the office, her stomach requested some tribute again, grumbling. She was appalled at her own gluttony. <i>What, you still want food?</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held off as she could. Truly, she did. But the spare snacks called to her. Jean was off running an errand, or more likely, off buying wine and going home for the day. Nobody was around, the later afternoon was always something of a slow period at this store. Just a small bite would do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small bite turned into finishing the remaining pretzel bites in the waste inventory, and the licorice, and the caramel bites. A good 1000 calories later, she waddled out of the store, having clocked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving home,drenched in sweat, Hannah turned to her. \"Girl, you still went to work today?\" Claire nodded breathlessly. Hannah shook her head. \"I know I don't have a lot of ground to stand on,\" she patted her own potbelly, \"But I think you overdid it on the holidays. We've got to kick this stuff.\" Claire nodded. \"Got anything healthy for dinner, then?\" She changed into her casual clothes. \"Uh... would it be a bad example if I told you I already ordered from Rico's Tacos?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire cackled and then sighed. \"Well, looks like I won't be the only one getting fat.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over the course of January, Claire continued to battle against the habits that she'd relearned during the holidays with middling results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the one hand she was very much aware of what was happening, in the sense that she knew that she was backsliding on her diet. She would begin every day with a set goal of staying within her 2500 calorie goal, with a reasonable 500 calorie buffer to help ease her back into her healthy habits. She had known going in that getting back into the groove of her diet was going to be hard, but the simple fact of the matter was that her meals didn't satisfy her like they used to. After incrementally increasing her daily caloric intake, even if she never piqued her old heights, it had become hard to convince herself that she was full from her diet-approved planned meals. It almost felt like there was no way that she was ever going to stop after a salad ever again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire <i>tried</i> to be good, she really did! But her whatever willpower she'd accrued during her initial slimming had been kneecapped by Hannah cooking all that rich food over the holiday, or Jean and her new habit of keeping candy around the workplace, or Dana and her ability to guilt Claire into sitting down for a nice big lunch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was she kidding\u2014Claire <i>knew</i> it was her own fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody was going to lose her weight for her, and she had to stop blaming other people for her own inability to stand up to temptation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just... after putting on <i>another</i> fifteen pounds in a month was a lot. She was back up to 492lbs after having done <i>so</i> good in her weight loss journey. It was hard for her to accept that she'd slid back so far...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire, this is the third time that I've warned you this week.\" Jean raised her eyebrows imperatively, \"The dress code around here is <i>not</i> optional.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am.\" Claire huffed, her head rolling, \"I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire had officially gotten too fat for one of her cutest button-ups. It was pastel blue with pretty flowers on it, and she'd been so excited that she could squeeze into it back when she had been losing weight. She had <i>hoped</i> that in wearing it she could subconsciously psyche herself out from eating too much today, but no. One wrong move and not only had a button flown off of her thick slab of fupa cut into deep by her bottoms, but it had also ripped along the shoulders. Now her fleshy back meat was on display as it baked over her tank top like bread over twine. What was supposed to be a slimming tip had just shown anyone that got behind her just how fucking big her back boobs were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to let it slide <i>one last time,</i> Claire.\" Jean warned with an authoritative finger-point, \"Next time it's going in the logbook.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, not the logbook. Fuck that stupid binder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll...\" <i>try not to be so fucking fat that I pop out of my clothes</i>, \"...do my best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, I'll see you on the floor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean said it with a forced, managerial smile that creased a little less than it used to. The added weight in her face had smoothed out the wrinkles some. As January came to a close she'd yet to lose any weight either and had in fact looked to have put on a couple of pounds since the year started. It wasn't much, but Claire at least felt a little vindicated in knowing that she wasn't the only one with dietary troubles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo contrast, Claire was often too wrapped up in her own dietary issues to concern herself too much with Hannah's. Why should she have been? Her own weight problem was far more pressing, and in fact potentially life-threatening. Her roommate's slow crawl up the scale had only dawned upon Claire in small doses, usually when getting good looks at her chubbing physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince her declaration of kicking junk food out of her life, directly citing it as a delayed New Year's Resolution, Hannah had managed to accomplish very little in that regard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire would often come home to find her roommate hastily throwing out paper baggies and wrappers from burger joints and cheap Tex Mex restaurants, eager to pretend like she hadn't spent most of her time at home sitting on the couch and ordering food to the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth was that Hannah had been skinny for almost all of her life\u2014she'd never really had to diet, though she had exercised moderately regularly until recently. In a similar situation to Claire's, it was just <i>hard</i> going back to eating rabbit food. She was happy to support her roommate's slimming regimen though, for all the good it seemed to do. Even though she <i>wanted</i> to slim down, her desire proved impotent in the face of the new habits she'd built up over the course of the past few months. Add onto that, now she was sneaking food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Claire!\" Hannah said breathlessly as she trash can lid still teetered on its axis, \"Good day at work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you tell me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire began to toddle in a circle until her vast, exposed canvas of backfat faced her roommate. She had been forced to endure her whole day like that\u2014the jacket that Jean had promised her was far too fucking small to fit over her meaty forearms, let alone her broad fleshy shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I'm sorry hun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just fucking figures.\" Claire grumbled as she toddled towards the couch, \"Look, fuck my diet, I could really use some fucking pizza. And booze. And then probably some more pizza. Are you down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pizza?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah touched her stomach tentatively, still fit to burst after a monster-sized burrito from Rico's Tacos that she had literally just polished off. She had pledged to be a good, responsible friend to Claire in hopes of helping her slim back down, so how in the world could she have told her that she just got done shotgunning a burrito as thick around as her arm?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... sure, Claire.\" Hannah smiled awkwardly, \"I mean... one cheat day a month isn't gonna kill you, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shit,</i> Hannah swore inwardly,<i> poor choice of words.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, you're right...\" Claire said after a moment's hesitation, completely mistaking Hannah's guilty dismissal as advice, \"I shouldn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right...\" Hannah veered back on track, \"Because... something something, can't control how people act\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can control how I react to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire plopped down on the couch, making the whole apartment quake. She leaned her head back on the back of the couch, bemoaning that she had even brought it up. Now she couldn't order pizza without looking like a quitter. She fucking knew that she shouldn't, but goddammit her life was a living hell! She'd been trying to lose weight, and she was almost back up to five hundred fucking pounds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dieting sucks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah plunked down next to her roommate, hand on her full belly as it pooched outwards.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Winter led into Spring, Claire was finding <i>some</i> success in her efforts to slim down\u2014though it was still a long road ahead of her, she was well on her way to being back down to where she was before the holidays.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had started to shrink down her meals, just barely managing to keep them under the three thousand calorie limit that she'd set for herself. She had had every intention of getting back under twenty five hundred eventually, but making the transition permanently meant giving up a series of small yogurts that helped get her through the day. She had done her best to enjoy a walk once or twice a week (occasionally bi-weekly) to pile on top of the little bits of walking that left her exhausted after work. Spooked by her slip back towards the big five-double-oh, a tiny seven pounds and some change before she hit 500, it had helped her to ease back into the healthy lifestyle that she'd been cultivating before the marathon run that had been Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas... plus pretty much <i>all</i> of January.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire had managed to drag herself back down to 470 over the Spring, kicking and screaming the whole way down. It wasn't quite where she was in September, but it was still an impressive loss. More than twenty-five pounds over the course of three months added up to just a little over eight pounds a month! Was it a little disheartening to know that it had taken her three months to get rid of what she'd gained over January? Yes. But it had come with an extra ten pounds off <i>and</i> put her below where she was at the start of the year by three pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich meant that, for the first time in a <i>long</i> time, she was probably the only one in her small social circle who could say that she was skinnier than she was when this year began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, how do you manage to lose <i>any</i> weight around here?\" Dana asked, scrunching her face at Claire's smaller figure, \"I'm <i>dyinggggg</i> to lose weight over here and it's just falling off you, girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire really, <i>really</i> didn't want to point out that for all of Dana's whining about her weight, she still brought big, fattening lunches with rich desserts. Presumably, by the rate of her gain and the spread of her butt across her office chair, Dana didn't just eat like this at work. On the few occasions that the two of them had ventured out together to a restaurant after hours, Dana always ordered and ate like a pig. It was no wonder that she had only continued to pack it on roughly at the speed with which Claire was slimming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you know if it's here I'm gonna eat it...\" Dana laid a hand on her thick slab of stomach, bigger and heavier after another three months of indulgence, \"And I'm <i>soooo</i> full...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire never really thought that she'd ever get to a place in her life where the thought of cheesecake wouldn't tempt her. Who didn't get tempted? But, as her diet instructor and her doctors had told her, it wasn't that we <i>experienced</i> temptation, it was that we <i>faced</i> it. And Claire had gotten pretty good at turning down temptation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry hun.\" Claire said proudly, much to Dana's disgruntlement, \"I've been real good lately, and I don't want to risk it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Uuuuugh</i> you're no fun.\" Dana groaned, \"Maybe I can pawn it off on the boss lady...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother groan as she braced herself to stand up from her office chaire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm <i>never</i> gonna lose this weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you could start by not bringing so much food to lunch?\" Claire offered in a way that probably came across as a little snotty, \"It'd be a good start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean... I <i>guess</i>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Jean's office door closed, the sight of their pot-bellied boss came into Dana's peripheral. As the year had gone on, Jean hadn't managed to lose any weight either. Little notes of encouragement and granola bars had slowly disappeared, though her excitement towards Claire's renewed weight loss had returned even in the midst of her budding unhealthy habits and her own chubbing physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah wadded up the burger paper and tossed it into the bin, missing by a country mile as the little wax ball joined the others around the base of the trash can. A monster belch shook their flat as Hannah nestled back sleepily into her seat on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the year had started, her company had rolled out a new <i>remote workstation</i> initiative. It was supposed to be so that they could create more jobs without crowding their workspace, but the results were pretty janky at best. Hannah experienced plenty of site crashes and communication errors, and her bosses didn't have much to tell her other than \"hang in there, we're working on it\". It was frustrating for sure, but Hannah had found ways to manage. It sure as hell beat going into the office every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the upside, this meant that Hannah could lay around in her pajamas all day. She had reduced her commute by a full half an hour, making it the time it took to roll out of bed, brush her teeth, and plop down on the couch with her company-provided laptop. Occasionally she'd make breakfast, but lately she'd gotten into the habit of ordering in\u2014a little note in the memo line that said \"SEND TEXT. DON'T BUZZ. AT WORK.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo contrast Claire's impressive (if small) bounce back, Hannah had only gotten lazier since January. All throughout February and March she had been failing against her own impulses to cook and eat huge rich dishes, unable to stop herself from ordering takeout on those days when she couldn't quite muster up the energy to cook for herself, and she hadn't so much as set foot in the gym since last year. All throughout April though, she'd become a real homebody; when given the option to lay around in sweatpants and comfy clothes, Hannah practically jumped at the chance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut beneath those flop clothes, Hannah's figure was quickly fattening up. Her stomach was spreading wider, nestling in the plushness of her thighs as they thickened with every bite. Her chubby arms and chest were starting to ripen, her double chin now a permanent fixture on her increasingly round face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's not like I have a problem or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's just a little holiday weight. I'll shake it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least I'm not as big as Claire...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah had made a habit of justifying her indulgences; it had started coming without prompt now, even as she loosened the drawstring on her comfiest pair of sweats. Even as her weight climbed nearer by the day to two hundred. With a playfully dismissive squeeze of her fleshy white tum, she told herself that it was nothing that she couldn't work off, and continued to snack her way through the workday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, as long as she picked up her mess before Claire got home, nobody would know.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The summer had come and gone - no longer schoolgirls, it was spent like many working people spent their summers - passing the time at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Claire, it was an odd experience - she began going beyond sticking to her routine and began branching out, trying healthy foods she hadn't thought she would like. Chinese, barbecue, southwestern dishes that kept her palette varied and her waistline shrinking. Low-calorie and high-flavor, and it kept her stomach satisfied. She found that the real secret, however, was to satisfy her cravings when she did crave fatty food- and when it was sated, to get back on board. She planned around this, in fact, and it grew to improve her weight loss. She had gone from 470 at the outset of June to some 430 pounds - she could scarcely believe how small she was getting. She dreamt some days that she could see her toes without leaning, in brief glimpses that were VERY encouraging to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of this, she had finally begun to reach a weight where movement became easier, and she began to move more. The massive mounds of jiggling fat ever so slowly began to recede, and her pastel-blue button-up had not only come back, but it had begun to become genuinely loose. \"Girl, that thing's getting baggy on you. You gotta get it downsized.\" Claire smiled slightly, but she could see that Dana had continued to balloon up. Jean's normal nagging, however, was laxing as the mid-aged woman grew fatter alongside Dana, her thighs taking the next round of blows and her arms getting softer. Dana's form, however, had done all it could to distribute its fat evenly and it was inevitable that the next round of gains would impact her gut. Her red blouse grew tighter and tighter, and it rose and fell with Dana's shallow breath as her lungs became oppressed by the layers of fat that now surrounded her no longer chubby, but genuninely <i>obese</i> form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, hon! You know, I've found that it's all about calories in, calories out.\" Dana took the hint and sighed, \"I hate calorie counting, girl. And I can't do any of that fad diet shit either - I tried keto for, like, a day before I broke down and ate a bunch of cake.\" Dana's sweet tooth seemed to have some warning signs attached to it - she became thirstier and thirstier, and not reading the warning flags, Dana slaked her thirst with sweet drinks. Claire had been the victim of Diabetes for a little while now, and she hated to see Dana start to go down the same road. \"You got to watch out, girlie. I'm a diabetic too, and I don't want to see you go the same way.\" Dana frowned. \"Girl, you're getting so judgey. I know, I shouldn't be drinking all this soda, but it's my business.\" Claire felt ashamed, and apologized - \"Sorry, sorry. I know, I don't mean to be a bitch. I worry about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah also grew at home, with less of Claire's judgement. She ordered more and more take-out, and cooked less and less. The task, when necessary, began falling to Claire, who felt that it was her job. Claire did what she could to make overtures to Hannah. \"I'm gonna make some pasta, want some,Han?\" Hannah frequently shook her head, \"Nah. Already ordered a pizza for myself.\" Claire spoke a neutral, \"A'ight. Where from?\" \"Mama Noon's, that place on Sheridan.\" Claire cooed, \"Ooh! I love their calzones.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire began to feel mentally worn down. While she was making this journey, nobody was joining her. Everyone around her was putting on weight, not losing it. She felt somewhat out of place as she slimmed down. This was the last barrier to what she felt could be a major breakthrough, one that could carry her down to a level of slimness she had never been to, but being isolated in her goals was dragging her down. Either she had to accept this or try to change her situation.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Autumn season brought upon a time of renewed introspection for Claire as she struggled to stay motivated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn sticking with her diet, Claire had managed to shed an additional twenty pounds in the two months that had passed since August. Averaging around ten pounds lost in a month, her results were impressive for someone who had two years ago been waddling down a diabetic death row. Her doctors were proud of her, her parents (when they spoke, which was rarely) were proud of her and, most importantly, Claire was proud of herself! Her uphill battle with weight loss had begun to level\u2014she had lost fifteen pounds over the course of September, putting her at a positively svelte (for her) four hundred and five pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while the results were impressive, her chest swelling with pride every time her digital scale's readout was heard, Claire had never felt less supported since this whole endeavor had started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good for you\u2014Walnut milk is supposed to be super great for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why did you get whole?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah's lips wrapped around the little green straw, slurping up the thick mixture inside. Ever since Pumpkin Spice had come back into season at Starbucks, Hannah had been ordering it constantly either to the apartment or during her \"field trips\" to the coffee shop during her working hours. The Trenta cup sloshed with rich frappuccino blend, easily as tall as Hannah's head and dwarfing her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just think it tastes better is all.\" Hannah responded absently, \"Besides, it's just one coffee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That thing's the size of your head.\" Claire laughed cautiously, \"That's like... six coffees.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, next time I'll just get soy.\" Hannah's answer was placative and denial-laden, \"But it's <i>really</i> smarter for me to get the big size... you know, with how often I come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire sucked through her teeth as Hannah wobbled ahead to claim their seat. Even beneath her new winter wardrobe, it was clear that Hannah had put on a worrying amount of weight since this time last year. Claire sucked at numbers (having weighed nearly six hundred pounds at one point, Claire's sense of scale was way off for \"normal\" sizes) but she could say confidently that Hannah had passed two hundred pounds at some point not too long ago. The thick milky love handles that bulged over her sides, blending and rolling into a fleshy gut that bulged over the waistbands of every bottom, pants, or pair of jeans that she squeezed herself into were testament enough to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's more, Hannah's daily amounts of exercise had fallen to abysmal levels ever since they had assigned her to the remote position that she so adamantly enjoyed. She sat down in the seat across from Claire with a heavy, appreciative sigh as if <i>she</i> had been the one lugging around all of Claire's extra padding. Her winter hairstyle and the roundness of her cheeks, combined with the pale shade that she had lightened to as she'd settled into her zero-commute lifestyle, really put the nails into the coffin for Claire...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I was thinking about going to the gym tomorrow after work?\" Claire said rather abruptly, letting her single grande latte cool in her hands, \"Do you maybe want to come with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My membership ran out.\" Hannah made a face as she slurped on her high-calorie concoction, \"Besides, I've got work tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said after work.\" Claire said in a way that she hoped wasn't too short, \"You know, around six, seven?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah slurped her drink a little longer than last time, as if she were biding her time in order to come up with a good excuse. She had never been negative regarding Claire's weight loss even as her own steadily rose and rose, but as she'd gotten lazier and more accustomed to eating what she wanted and whenever she wanted it, Hannah had become far less passionate about being an <i>actual</i> member of Claire's weight loss support circle. She had been content to be a cheerleader, but when it came time to take Claire up on her requests for physical support, she had been content to sit on the sidelines and slurp. And munch. And chew. And swallow and scarf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, maybe.\" Hannah said weakly...</span></div></div>",

Upon arrival, Claire just sort of sighed as Hannah's attention was drawn immediately to the smorgasbord of snacks offered behind the counter. She had asked, without realizing it, if Claire had wanted any popcorn, before quickly adding \"...you know, no butter, no salt, all that crap.\", almost as an afterthought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be truthful, Claire <i>had</i> been thinking about it. But upon hearing Hannah's blatantly self-interested proposal, her feelings had been too hurt to take her friend up on her offer. \"All that crap\" was serious business to Claire, and hearing it said so dismissively stung more than a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks.\" Claire said simply, sternly, before continuing her trek forward, \"I'm gonna go get us seats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay! Are you sure?\" Hannah's voice was twinged with desperation, \"My treat? Something small maybe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah, if you want something, get something.\" Claire said with a small shake of her head, \"Just because I'm not eating doesn't mean that you can't get something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>If</i> you're hungry.\" she quickly added as a deliberate, not all that subtle jab at Hannah's expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's doctors had spent so much time coaching her about knowing the difference between being hungry and wanting food. It was something that she struggled with even now. Years of glutting herself shamelessly had instilled in her a desire to eat almost constantly. It had been tamed, but not done away with entirely. Even after extensive coaching, she still fought the urge to eat her boredom away, and her self-control got dangerously melty in the face of her favorite foods. Somehow she suspected that Hannah could use a refresher course on when to know if she was actually hungry or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that being said, it fell flat on Hannah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of popcorn in the air, the bubbling fizz of the soda jerk, and the <i>plunk-plunk</i> of candy being shaken in cardboard boxes\u2014why <b>wouldn't</b> she have been hungry?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just gonna get something small.\" Hannah could tell that she had stepped in it somewhere throughout this conversation, but she wasn't quite sure how or in what way, \"Get us good seats?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That next day, Claire got back to work after an enjoyable night out with Hannah. That entire time walking to her job, it had been an ordeal of worrying about Hannah's ever-increasing gain. Hannah had to be approaching, what, 250 pounds? Compared to the thin woman she knew this time last year, Hannah had truly blown up at a dizzying pace. Claire always thought that on this kind of a journey, Hannah would be the support column, when now she was the foil to Claire's gains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, Claire still occasionally indulged with Hannah on a dine-out meal now and then. She just kept to her routine otherwise. At times, she thought about how much she'd enjoy gorging with Hannah, but she checked herself - she also thought about how reliant she was on her meds, even while losing weight. Granted, her dosages had been moved downward and downward. These thoughts were what occupied her head as she walked through the wooden gate with little struggle - still a hint of it, but barely a milisecond of pulling herself through the posts that used to damn-near trap her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead of her, already eating her first \"snack\" was Dana. Replacing her normal joyous expression at her normal attitude was a face of pressure and stress, scrunched eyebrows and tight shoulders. Claire could tell this was her stress-eating, a rare occurrance that warranted an approach, with a concerned, \"What's wrong, girl?\" Dana swallowed, her blubbery cheeks previously full of pretzel. Her second chin had been replaced in recent months by a familiar neck flap, thick with fat. Dana's arms and legs were swallowing her already-upsized shirt and pants, but the true terror of her shirt was her ever-increasing breasts and belly, racing outwards. Dana, at around 400 pounds, couldn't help but look at her and think, <i>My god, she's almost my size.</i> Almost 400 pounds or somewhere in the high 300's, compared to the 160 or so when Claire had joined the workplace around 2 or 1 and a half years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana replied, her eyes full of anxiety. \"Claire, I saw the doc the other day... Apparently, I'm, uh... I'm diabetic now..\" She exhaled and inhaled. \"They've got me on the Metformin...\" Claire patted Dana on the shoulder as she comforted herself in the tools of her own destruction. Claire had started to develop a sense - none of her lectures or voiced concerns got results from Hannah. Perhaps if she tried to support her coworker, she could get closer with Dana again - and hopefully, get her to drop some pounds. \"Girl, I'm on that same issue. I've been on insulin for a little bit now, I know how it feels. Feels like your body's rotting before its time.\" Dana looked up with an expression of sympathetic connection. \"Yeah... That's exactly how it feels..\" She sniffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire thought for a moment how to approach the situation. Words could only do so much, but a gesture could do a lot to reproach her to Dana. If it was something like inviting her to the gym, it might come off as another lecture - something Dana would brush off. She knew of one main language with which to communicate with Dana. \"Tell you what, want me to grab lunch today?\" Dana smiled and nodded. \"That'd be great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Claire got on with the workday, glancing Jean as she did so - viewing Jean's expanded form gave her some catharsis. She remembered the hell that her boss had given her for her weight, and karma was being a real bitch to Jean. She wasn't quite where Dana was that summer, but she was getting more than a little overweight. Her nice button-ups grew tighter, and she moved less - meaning less screaming and lectures, most fortunately for Dana. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Claire took a break around 11:30 to go grab something, she thought about how best to get Dana something she'd love. A salad was out of the question - it'd come off like trying to force her on a diet that might paint Claire as the aggressor. Instead, Claire thought it best to get something for Dana that she'd love. After some deliberation, she came back through the door with some styrofoam containers. Dana perked up at what she saw when she opened up the box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sushi! Oh, Claire, you're a saint!\" Claire hugged her back while putting down another third container between the two, \"Aaaand, the crab rangoon.\" Dana kissed Claire's still considerable and blubbery cheeks. \"Oh, bless you, bless you. You're great.\" The two enjoyed the sushi and crab rangoon, connecting over the meal. It was a nice indulgence for Claire. It was at about this point, however, that Claire recognized that she was planning on joining Hannah in her cheat meal that night - and only God knew how many calories that would be. Thankfully, she was figuring the gym would help with burning the excess calories - she was thankful for including that in her routine tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Dana, I'm hitting the Gym after work tonight. Want to join me?\" Dana pondered for a moment and spoke up, \"I never thought I'd say this, but sure.\" Claire smiled, big. \"Great! And don't worry about being left in the dust - it's my first time in a gym since college, the last time I didn't risk breaking any of the machines.\" Even in college, her visit to the gym was a one-time occurrance. Claire was hopeful that her experience here would stick easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter work wrapped up, all that temporarily delayed the two was a brief fight with the gate. Dana spoke up, \"Hey, Claire, mind if we take my car?\" Claire spoke up, \"Oh, sure!\" They waddled towards Dana's sedan, parked in employee parking. It had a black paintjob, with specks of paint hanging off. \"Sorry about the paintjob... I've gotta get it repainted at some point, here.\" Claire chuckled, \"That's why I'm happy I never bothered with cars. Been too big for a while to fit in them, anyways. Kind of a treat for me to ride in anything.\" There was, of course, the requisite pile of junk food wrapperes in Dana's car. \"Lemme clear off the passenger side for ya,\" the woman spoke. Brushing the trash into the foot of the backseat, Claire sat her gym bag in the back and rolled herself into the passenger seat. Despite her weight loss, she was still 400 pounds. She struggled with the seatbelt, trying and struggling to pull the buckle over her still rotund gut. It was a few inches away. Dana spoke up, \"Oh, crap, uh, I can look for a second extender.\" Claire spoke up, her voice wavering due to her effort, \"No, It's fine...\" She sucked in her gut as best as she could, but still could not manage. Mercifully, Dana handed her a secondary extender - \"Here you go.\" Claire took it, but it bruised her ego - she had hoped she could buckle it without an extender.  \"Thanks,\" Claire said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car continued along its path down the 2-lane side of the decently-sized highway. Dana got into the right-hand lane, a bit too close to someone else's bumper for Claire's liking, but Claire held her tongue, unconsciously gripping the hand-grip above and to the right of her. Dana glanced over to the right and pointed, \"Oooh! Captain Horstie's! That's the best seafood buffet in town!\" Claire looked eagerly at the blue-sided building pointed out, with a tall lobster marking the building. She had always seen it in the distance, but eaten there only once or twice. \"Ooh. I think I remember that place. They have GREAT fried oysters.\" At that moment, Claire had a weakness - if Dana so chose, she could exploit this to divert Claire from her fitness-related goal of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mercifully for Claire, Dana didn\u2019t turn on her turn signal - continuing forward to the next intersection. At that point, Claire came back to herself - and was quietly thankful that Dana didn\u2019t take them to the buffet. Claire knew that it would have been impossible to control herself at a place like that - with unlimited access to food, she always savaged a buffet whenever she visited one. She was a MASTER of piling food on her plate. Her mouth still watered slightly as they carried past the great lobster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at a fairly hip-looking building with a great two-way window on the front, tinted to protect the privacy of the clientele, and a slanting roof above the windows that glinted in the dying sunlight. The two waddled in, Dana panting from the short walk. Claire guided the two into the building, to the thin Indian man standing at the receptionist\u2019s counter. \u201cHelloo,\u201d he said in a somewhat thick Minnesotan accent, \u201cWhat can I do fer ya?\u201d Claire spoke up, \u201cUh, one guest pass. I\u2019m just checking in.\u201d The man spoke up, \u201cOokay, what\u2019s the name on yer account?\u201d \u201cSpittz, Claire Spittz. I opened it online yesterday.\u201d The man scrolled, his face focusing on the screen. Finally, he nodded in affirmation, \u201cAhhh. Okay, yeah. Want me to just take it from that card?\u201d Claire nodded, Dana spoke up, \u201cThanks, Claire.\u201d Claire turned to her, speaking. \u201cNo prob!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two carried on into the Locker room, past a trio of muscular men bragging about their deadlift weights. They carried on into the women\u2019s locker room. There were mercifully a select few in the room, a thin pony-tailed bookish looking girl, a chubbier-looking teenage girl who was putting her hoodie on, and a muscular mid-aged woman. The bookish girl briefly glanced at the two, but looked away. The chubbier teen obviously wanted to get out, but had to wait for the 800 pounds of fat to clear the doorway. The muscular-looking old woman and the chubby teen both looked at the pair, and they both, for a moment, wore an expression of awe, their eyes wide for a moment. The muscular woman, however, looked back to ensuring her workout shake was mixed, while the chubby teen girl squeezed past as soon as the big pair had cleared the way. Her expression was more unforgiving, as if staring at the fattest women she had ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire and Dana stripped down to their underwear as they changed into workout clothes, Claire lending Dana a turquoise pair of leggings and a black tank while Claire herself wore a blue tank and some white leggings. Claire didn\u2019t like them, but they were all that were available for her still-large size. They made her legs look enormous - partially because they were, but that didn\u2019t make them feel any better. Claire\u2019s body out of her clothes was a sight to behold - even having lost nearly 100 pounds, she was still mass of fat, a butterball of a woman. It intimidated and partially scared Claire that Dana was barely any skinnier - her arms jiggled with each movement, her great belly rose and fell from the exertion of changing clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two carried on to Cardio, first the elliptical. Claire examined the machine, with a ramp and footpedals linked to two sticks that stood freely of the machine. Her and Dana mounted the machine. She kept the resistance low - with her still underlying health conditions, she didn\u2019t want to tempt fate by pushing herself too hard. She focused on the simple motion - forward, backwards, push, pull, shifting the sticks back and forth. She struggled a bit, but she checked on Dana. Dana was sluggishly, limply pushing on the sticks - struggling with the baseline resistance and height. \u201cYou can, uh\u2026 Bring the resistance down\u2026 Lower\u2026\u201d said Claire. Dana nodded, sweat collecting rapidly on her forehead and dripping down. They tried to keep their faces clear of sweat, but it was difficult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the fat women focused on their machines, a pair of thin mid-aged women gawked from behind them, watching their back-fat jiggle and bounce as their upper backs rose and fell with the exertion of breathe. They couldn\u2019t help but gawk, \u201cGawd, how do you let yourself get that fat?\u201d Others around them looked angrily at the \u2018Karens\u2019 with their short, bob haircuts. Yes, these two were horrifically fat, but they were doing something about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana and Claire could hear none of the humiliating remarks, but they felt watched. They felt eyes on them, but they were too damned tired to care. They went fifteen minutes, and by the end of it, they were drenched in sweat, their chests and guts rising and falling with shallow breaths. Claire\u2019s lungs burned, and Dana felt like she was about to die from the exertion. \u201cOhgod\u2026 Ohgod\u2026\u201d The two cut off their workouts simultaneously, and wiped down the machines with the last of their strength. They waddled breathlessly over to the nearby benches and sat. The benches groaned - Claire thought she heard a \u2018pop,\u2019 but thankfully, the bench held. The two sat with their guts peeking through the bottoms of the workout tanks, their fat arms drenched in sweat like the rest of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of recovery, Claire turned to Dana, \u201cYou want to\u2026 Uh\u2026 Try to lift a bit?\u201d Dana turned to Claire, nodding faintly. \u201cUh.. I\u2019m beat...Mind if we\u2026 head out?\u201d Claire was fine with that - she had just enough breath to waddle back to the car. By the time she got back to the apartment with Hannah\u2019s bulky form, she was happy to partake in the calzone and cannolis that her roomie had bought. She enjoyed her second cheat meal of the day, and was happy that this was not the potentially THIRD cheat meal of the day it could have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the next day, Dana had begun cutting down on her snacks and eating home-packed lunches of healthier fare, mixed in with occasional lunches out that she enjoyed with Claire. The two grew closer with their bond of mutual weight loss.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hannah and Claire had been friends for a long, long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell, Hannah had known Claire back when she was <i>skinny</i>. They had known each other since high school, and had been friendly for a while before moving in together. Granted, the two of them hadn't always been on the best of terms. When Claire started to get really bad, before her weight loss kick, she got to be this lazy brat who just sort of mooched off of Hannah and sat on the couch all day playing video games.But ever since, for about three years, Claire had been working on herself. She'd gotten a job, lost a lot of weight, and started contributing a lot more around the apartment. A lot had changed for Claire and, in her mind, Hannah had been nothing but supportive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo why did it feel like they were just <i>roommates</i> now instead of friends?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah exhaled deeply, stomach flattening into a squishy hill of pale white chub. Grunting and wriggling in her overly reclined seat on the couch, she didn't break eye contact with her Hulu queue to grab the Chips Ahoy! that she'd forgotten to eat with lunch. Settling back down, stomach slowly wobbling to a halt, Hannah sighed again from mild exertion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was because it was the holiday season. For all of the benefits that came with working from home, Hannah actually <i>missed</i> those stupid office parties that they used to throw for her. The food was always great, and her boss usually let them have a little bit to drink if it didn't get too rowdy. Doing insurance stuff over the phone was a lot less fun than when she had friends in the booths across and next to her. It wasn't that she didn't enjoy working from home, it was just... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh, she was <i>lonely</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't talked to any of her coworkers in weeks; some of them months. None of Hannah's family lived in the same state as she did. She didn't really know where she could go to meet new people or... <i>do</i> anything, and none of her pants fit right anymore and she hadn't gone shopping because... because, okay? She had other shit to do. And she wasn't begrudging Claire for going to the gym, but... you know, fuck the gym. She and Hannah had been friends for a long time, and Claire didn't even ask if she wanted to go with her anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah's thick fingers peeled back the cellophane that hid the first few cookies on the second row. Grabbing three at a time, she washed it down with some beer\u2014the good kind. She had forgotten how much she liked beer. Claire had turned into kind of a food nazi lately, so she had to keep it in her room or she'd make that <i>face</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least if Claire were here though, they could watch TV like they used to. Now she was out with her coworker, <i>Dana</i>. Get a fucking room already. For all the shit Claire used to have to say about Dana \"needing to be careful\" and \"starting to worry her\", the fact that they were all buddy-buddy now had started to rub Hannah the wrong way. The beer didn't help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother handful of cookies, a big swig from the can. A monster belch that pierced through the apartment. Hannah pat her fat stomach absently, a chuckle on her breath as she reclined a little further into the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever she and Claire used to have a fight, back before Claire had gotten a job and spent all day on the couch, they would leave these out for each other. Little aluminum apologies. They were both headstrong and stubborn chicks, even back then, so you could bet that neither of them was actually going to say the words \"I'm sorry\". It didn't always work, but more often than not, Hannah (because of course it was Hannah who got apologized to the most) would crack open the cold one and sit down on the couch next to Claire and they'd co-op whatever game she'd been playing for a match or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that had been back when they were in their <i>early</i> twenties. Now they were both in their <i>mid</i> twenties. That was back when Hannah had been working at the office and before Claire had even gotten a job. Back before she was so hung up on this weight loss stuff...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was time for a little aluminum apology? A little throwback to show that Hannah was sorry for... <i>whatever</i> it was that had gotten between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her hazy recollection, two rows of cookies and half a case into the night, it seemed like a good idea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here'sto frenship.\" Hannah chuckled thickly as she slammed the can down on the mail catch, \"Drinkup, girlie.\"</span></div></div>",

Every other weekday, Monday Wednesday and Friday, plus alternating Saturdays and Sundays, they tried to go to the gym and do something \"healthy\". Sometimes it was going to walk around their town's dying mall, sometimes it was a light lunch, and other times it was just going over to Dana's house so that they avoided everything <i>un</i>healthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren't always successful, of course. Claire had enough trouble keeping her own appetite under control, and Dana didn't have the experience of having lost one hundred and fifty pounds to taper her more greedy tendencies. They were both big girls who liked to eat, and getting them together wasn't always conducive to a healthy lifestyle, but they managed to continue a steady shrinking between them and that was all that mattered. The nights spent pigging out or skipping a day at the gym were vastly outnumbered by the nights that they stayed true to their diet plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Holidays had stalled their weight loss some. Halloween had seen Jean succumbing to hiding \"tricks and treats\" around the office to boost morale, and both had been edible. Dana's mother (a big woman herself, though nowhere near the size of her daughter) had invited them over for Thanksgiving <i>and</i> Christmas. New Year's with Hannah had meant that they had gotten plenty drunk and went on a binge and a bender in the same night. The time of the year that everyone ate the most wasn't lost on two big eaters like Claire and Dana, but the damage had thankfully been minimal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so jealous.\" Dana said longingly, watching Claire do a clumsy turn in her new pink button-up, \"It's not fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire had managed to drop down to 370 at the beginning of the year, evening out at around 375 after a small backslide in February. For the first time in far, <i>far</i> too long, Claire was well under 400 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer efforts at losing weight had finally started to show in her face. No longer chubby-cheeked and jowly, Claire had gotten back down to merely round-faced and double-chinned. Her blonde hair tied back in a ponytail, you could see her ears from head-on now, instead of them being eclipsed by the fullness of her face. It was this that she was most proud of, after Jean pointed it out offhandedly, but the rest of her losses weren't to be ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire had receded on the x and z axis, her stomach shrinking further back into her figure. Her ass had, unfortunately, not lost at the same rate that her breasts had, but her upper arms were getting smaller! She was experiencing things that she hadn't thought about, like her fingers getting less stubby and the fat around her feet slimming enough to put her in a different shoe size. Every day, Claire felt a difference as she maneuvered her steadily shrinking body with a growing deft and ease.The gate had even stopped giving her trouble!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on, don't be like that.\" Claire tut-tutted, \"You're back under 400!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I'm still at like 390.\" Dana rolled her eyes and shifted (loudly) in her seat, \"How did <i>you</i> wind up as the skinny one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because <i>I</i> don't take extra cheat days.\" Claire stuck her tongue out, \"You've gotta start cleaning out your car if you don't want me to catch on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I drive <i>right by</i> like six fast food places on my way home.\" Dana harrumphed, \"Let's see <i>you</i> turn down a Cheesy Gordita Crunch seven days in a row.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them laughed, only to hush themselves like schoolgirls when they saw Jean's office door open. The sight of their fat-bottomed boss waddling out onto the floor brought out further giggling between them, no matter how hard they tried to suppress it. As much as Claire was all about losing weight, the amount of pleasure that she had taken in her boss steadily blowing up over the years had increased as she had become increasingly pearshaped. Jean's saddlebag thighs and fat legs filled the bottom half of her pantsuit to capacity with squishy seas of subcutaneous fat, jutting out behind her like a tray as she wobbled belly-first into the office at large was a guilty pleasure if Claire had ever known one. Some days, when she'd felt that Jean was being especially bitchy, she looked forward to <i>this</i> part of lunch more than the actual meal part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies.\" she said curtly, nodding her head (double chin creasing noticeably)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy your lunch, bosslady!\" Dana called out with just a <i>hint</i> of wickedness, \"We'll be here when you get back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older woman smirked at her employee's barely innocuous comment. Any and all encouragement and criticism that Claire had faced about her weight had slowly begun to disappear as her formerly fit boss had learned what life was like on the other side of plus-size, plumping up to what had to have been at least two hundred and fifty pounds since Claire had started working under her just a few short years ago. Claire would have been lying if she said that she didn't appreciate the irony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But <i>will all of her buttons be?</i>\" Dana snickered as soon as she was out of earshot, \"That's the question!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're <i>horrible</i>.\" Claire laughed, swatting at her friend's pillowy arm fat, \"Don't be like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you weren't thinking the exact same thing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire and Dana continued to gossip and giggle over their mild lunches, packed (mostly) in accordance with their weight loss plans. It was hard work losing weight, but between the two of them, they were having more success than just about anyone else that they knew...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At first, Claire thought it was a fluke. She thought it was a trick of the angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she leaned back, she figured she could properly see the tips of her toes over her increasingly shrunken belly which by the day she could barely believe was her own. Her old clothes with so many X\u2019s in the XL\u2019s that you could barely count were far too baggy to consider wearing even as comfy shirts. She was approaching the point where even her clothes from the first of her weight loss, in the mid-to-lower 400\u2019s were starting to reach that point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a moment to walk towards the bathroom - her thighs were starting to slim to the point where her trademark waddle, though still present to a degree, was starting to lessen to a walk. She stood on her scale and listened for the readout. With how busy her schedule had been, she hadn\u2019t weighed in for a few weeks, but she felt herself losing weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThree Hundred and Forty Nine Pounds,\u201d the monotone scale announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was beside herself - she was in the lower end of the three hundred range for the first time since high school. She was starting to feel movement become a comparative breeze - she felt herself lighten in her everyday movements, how fast it was to get up now that she was sub-350.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same could not be said for Hannah. She had been on the couch for a while now. She was eating another breakfast of cereal and a cinnamon bun\u2026 plus a cookie to go with her coffee. It seemed that every bit of mobility Claire had been losing, Hannah had been gaining. It was inconceivable that barely a few years ago, she had been the slim, healthy one in the apartment. Her gut extended further and further out, her limbs becoming burdened with seemingly every pound that Claire was losing. <br>\r\nHannah had truly become just another roommate - she almost never spoke with Claire these days except on odd occasions where they ate together, and it was usually for small, everyday topics - what was in the fridge, how work was going, how their love lives were going. The former friends were now live-in strangers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new weight made Hannah\u2019s life harder in everyday scenarios - climbing up the stairs to their apartment became damn near unbearable. The older building had no elevator- something that forced slimming Claire to adapt and gave Hannah great consternation. More and more, Hannah ordered from grocery-delivery services, and she moved even less than she formerly had to - responding to the results of her lethargy with more lethargy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire grew more startled as the weeks went by - Hannah was officially fatter than her, and she had NEVER not been the fattest one in nearly any room. It was an odd experience, psychologically, to recognize that Hannah was now the \u2018fatter\u2019 one in the apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah\u2019s ever-soaring weight would push her to endeavor for new friends. She had thought that Claire would be her friend as she gained weight - who would have thought that the fat cow that was Claire Spittz would actually stick with a diet? Who would have thought that the woman who had literally zero willpower would have actually developed the will to resist binging on food every day, 24 hours a day, who would have thought that she would have, at the same time Hannah had chosen to let go, made a life-changing decision to lose weight? It would be blatantly wrong to state that, mentally, Hannah grew more <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively, she thought of trying to join Claire on her weight loss. She felt herself getting more sluggish and heavier and more immense by the day, every hour was one spent getting fatter than Claire. Hannah could prove that she was superior in willpower. Though more friendly about it in earlier days, she increasingly fantasized about these earlier days - where she was the thin, slim, healthy one issuing the lectures to obese, on-the-verge-of-death Claire. She partially wanted to restore this - to bring Claire back to where she <b>should</b> be, if this endeavour failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, why not just focus on that NOW? If it was the issue of restoring balance to her world, it was important enough to expend the effort to try to correct her universe - to make Claire the fat, lazy cow she envisioned her to be.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hannah's car hummed along as she spoke up, \"So, what are we gonna do here at the gym?\" Claire thought, and spoke, \"Uh, I was thinking some cardio, some lifting. You good with that?\" Hannah shrugged and spoke, \"Uh, yeah, sounds good. Take it easy on the cardio - I'm a little out of form.\" Claire wanted to jab there, but she had figured that her just-renewing relationship with Hannah was not something to test this early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation itself had been something of a shock to Claire - she offered it as the usual courtesy, \"Hey, heading to the gym - want to come?\" It was a happy surprise that Hannah was coming. She was hopeful that on her healthy journey, she'd take her friends with her. Lonesomeness had nearly been the death of her diet and a danger to her health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah, herself, had been hopeful she would be able to better her health. Walking through the lobby to the locker room, she felt ready to hopefully burn out her bitterness through the motions of exercise, along with her newfound pounds. Her great legs shook and jiggled in comparison to the now slightly smaller Claire, her gut shook and swayed. Hannah noticed her mass as she pulled on her impromptu exercise clothes - some grey sweatpants drawn up tight and a loose black shirt. She couldn't help but balefully notice that Claire wore well-fitting leggings and a nice tank top that complemented her still obese, but shrinking form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat inane power decided that Claire should be the one to lose weight, and for Hannah to gain it? For HER to get this fat? She knew it was wrong to be so angry - her internal monologue continued as Claire led them to the ellipticals. Pull the sticks, push them, pull the sticks, push them - then another bout - <i>That stuck-up whale, she thinks she's in control. She thinks she's better than me. She's flaunting her success and my failure.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Hannah attempted to expel her bitterness - <i>Claire's getting healthy. I've wanted this for years, I just stumbled. It's a common journey,</i> her nicer side said. <i>God,</i> her overall consciousness thought, <i>this elliptical makes my lungs burn!</i> She was so out of breath! God, had it even been five minutes? Her cellulite-ridden blubber flew like sails packed with butter in a hurricane, jiggling and billowing! She glanced at Claire - the fat woman was still struggling, but far less - her lungs were getting used to the exertion, if Hannah's eyes weren't lying to her, she was jiggling less than her - firmness was starting to sprout in the midst of her movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Come on. Keep going. You can beat that fat whale,</i> her bitterness rasped. Her lungs had a different opinion on the matter entirely, and her legs were aching from the intense action. Her esophagus seared with heat and she felt her stomach turning over from the exertion, it took all the control in her body to stop herself from vomiting. She slowed to a crawl to gain her breath back - she could not stop or she'd be admitting defeat to the one who ought to be fatter than her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least Dana was doing about as badly as her. Dana was slowing, slowing, slowing - no, she was just raising the elevation on her elliptical. Damn it. It was too much to hope that the newcomer would be as out-of-shape as Hannah. If anything, though, Hannah was just barely smaller than Dana. That gave her some solace. The pig was getting too much self-control - maybe this one would be an easier target if Hannah wanted to get back at Claire? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, Claire and Dana stepped off their treadmills. They had worked FAR more intensely than Hannah, that could not be denied, but Hannah claimed it as a mental victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blubbery trio stopped at the water fountain, gulping down the soothing clear fluid as they sat on a bench. \"So, uh, Hannah, you did pretty...good back there,\" said Dana. Hannah put on a smile as Dana spoke, \"Awwh! Thanks, I'm amazed I didn't pass out, it's been a while since i've been in a gym.\" Dana replied, \"Yeah - before Claire started taking me, I hadn't gone to a gym since high school.\" <i>I can see how that went,</i> thought Hannah as she considered Dana's still immense form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they moved to squats. \"Jah, das glutes,\" spoke Claire in a cheesy German accent. She mounted the bar on her still fat-padded shoulders. A considerable 120 was on the bars as she stepped back from the rack and brought her butt down inches from her heels, then rose. Two more repetitions and her form began to shake, sending her still - blubbery thighs jiggling, her stomach quivered after a few more repetitions, when she finally put the bar back up. \"Hooh. Wow, your turn, Dana,\" she said as she stepped back, gulping from her water bottle. <i>Ten reps, I can beat that fatass</i>, thought Hannah. Dana repeated the motions, but lowered the weight to 90 - her form was shaking from the second rep, and she jiggled far more than Claire - still softer of form, and at only eight reps, she put the bar back up. \"Good job, girlie. Get them buns,\" called Claire as she smacked Dana's ass, Dana returning the sisterly gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah stepped up. This was her moment of truth. No need to lower the weight. Claire inquired, \"You know how to do it?\" Hannah gave her a dismissive wave, \"Ah, I used to lift, I'm fine.\" Hannah prayed that she still had SOME of her old muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, her prayers were answered - her form didn't shake. Another rep, her form didn't shake. She felt the weight of the bar press down into her back and transfer down into her gluteus. Come on, she couldn't shake yet. She had to prove she was BETTER. She held her form strong into her third rep. Her fourth rep. God, it burned. But she still had some muscle memory of her old lifting phase just out of college - she kept firm until the sixth rep. She pressed on, eight, nine, ten. Her ass screamed for reprieve and her massive gut, her legs, her arms, jiggled and swung in the force of her action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No fucking way I'm giving up</i>, she thought. She pressed on. Eleven. Twelve. She could do no more - she put the bar back up. \"Ohh. Huh. Still got it, baby!\" A celebratory round of ass-slaps was shared by the three, sending their weary bottoms jiggling along with the tops of their cellulite-filled thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey left that night weary as all sin, exhausted, but exhilarated. Hannah was proud of herself, as was Claire proud of her. \"Girlie, you did so well tonight! You're makin' me jealous.\" Hannah strutted her stuff as best as she could but stumbled - leg day was HELL on her ability to walk. Her legs felt like pure Jell-O, gelatin jiggling and swaying as she barely caught herself on Dana's fat arm. \"Thanks...Yeah, I still got it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn part, she felt proud of herself, but she knew she wouldn't be able to beat her bitterness this easily. It was a consistent thing, and if not drowned out, it would manifest itself. She was certainly proud of her progress at the gym, but it wasn't enough alone to drown her bitterness. She kept up her workouts, but the bitterness continued - it either needed to express itself, or she needed to drown it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hannah's mental conflict came to a boiling point as she sat in the apartment living room. Even looking at Claire working on washing dishes, not getting breathless at all, still provoked the unwelcome outburst of bitterness in her mind - <i>God, look at that fat whale. She's putting on an act, she actually can barely breathe. How can she do it-</i> God, at times, she could barely stand herself! As she became more aware of her own bitterness, she thought counter-thoughts constantly - <i>No, she can breathe just fine. She's getting fit - something I should work harder at. </i> It wasn't enough, the intrusive thoughts were deafening - <i>Even if that's true, the stupid cow has no right to be smaller than me. I'm the thin one. She's the fat one. She's - </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. Enough. Hannah went to the only thing she could think of to do - she went to her snack stash and shut herself away in her room - she would silence these thoughts over the sound of digestion. Family-sized bags of chips that would normally form two snacks made the first part of an epic binge - she consumed it, a whole pack of snickers' candy bars - six bars, gone like the wind - she felt herself filling up, but it wasn't enough. She had to shut it up for the rest of the day - she filled her mouth with more salty snacks, and only truly stopped at the end of this bag when she felt the results almost coming back up. There it was - now she could focus on keeping her food down - swallowing gulps of saliva to quell the incoming nausea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire couldn't help but notice the trend - although Hannah's dedication pushed her harder at the gym, she continued to set herself back - while she and Dana grew thinner, Hannah continued to grow in size - her gut increased in size in massive strides - despite the hundreds of calories burned at the gym, she binged back each one and thousands more. It didn't take a genius either to notice the massive food intake or the results. Hannah's weight absolutely exploded over that week - it seemed impossible but she was putting on nearly 2 pounds <b>every day.</b> Her gut was constantly engorged, she was almost constantly nauseous, and even her <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was impossible for Claire to not say anything, but she had long since figured out that food nazi-ing people didn't work. She spoke to Hannah from the couch as she blew through a party bag of barbecue chips, speaking softly - \"Girl, are you okay?\" Hannah stopped for a moment, looking up at Claire. She sighed and put aside the bag of chips, \"Uh.. Just..eating.\" Claire spoke up, \"I know, and I'm not trying to be an asshole, but... you're kind of.. binging, really hard, and it's been going on for a week, and you're not letting up. What's eating you?\" Hannah held back - \"Oh, just, uh... issues. I'll be fine. I just need to eat a bit more.\" Claire spoke up, pulling her still considerable body to a seat next to the nearly 400 pound woman, \"I don't think you will - the food won't kill whatever you're trying to kill, just bury it. Trust me. I tried that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt re-connected with Hannah. She had almost forgotten that Claire had to have blown up to that size. Part of Hannah's problem was that she couldn't simply imagine Claire as being thinner - it was almost to that bitter part of her mind that the woman was dropped onto the earth as a massive blob. \"I guess... It's just, it's something hard to talk about, and eating to cover it up's easier.\" Claire pushed on - \"Well, if you tell me what it is that's bothering you, I can help you out.\"  Hannah sighed. \"I... It's...\" She couldn't find the words. How do you open up to someone that part of you is bitter that they're getting healthy? How can you just open a door of insecurity, already heavy with psychological weight, and expose something that might be so harmful?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hannah sighed. This would be awkward - but it was the only productive path forward. She respected Claire enough to be honest with her - and she wanted her old friend to help her, if she could. \"It's just, some dark, bitter part of myself couldn't accept that I was getting fatter than you, and it was just so bitter... All I could do to shut it up was to binge, to eat, and shut it up with food.\" Claire smiled and gave her a hug. \"Well, you're recognizing that the bitterness is wrong - and that's all that matters!\" Hannah looked, happily, \"So - you're not angry with me?\" Claire smiled - \"No, not at all. If anything, I'm more than happy enough to help you through this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with those words, the residual bitterness, already assaulted by the deeper recognition of Claire's pre-existing struggles, was banished by Claire's forgiving nature - Claire's willingness to embrace friendship over grudge-holding and anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a real task to focus on the gym and eating better - and it was a genuine struggle for a woman who had gotten used to stuffing her face, 24/7. She struggled with reducing her food intake to reasonable levels - and she had more than one relapse - but her friends were there for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe workout sessions got more intense - more difficult, more rigorous, but the three tackled the task with a new diligence found in their rise from sloth and gluttony. Dana and Hannah had more than a few temporary relapses in terms of dieting, but Claire was there to help them get back on track without judgement and without anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out, some kindness can go a long way in aiding weight loss when the world only confronted one with demand for endless rigor and shaming failure - the group's cellulite-pumped bodies shrunk week by week, month by month, and year by year as the trio pumped iron - even got into running. Claire was the running champion of the group, while Hannah beat all three in weight-lifting. Dana was always more into bodyweight exercises, which even with a slimming form, Claire struggled with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey shrunk to 300, then 200 - then the 100's. After spending months and years of their lives in obesity, they were thin again. For Claire, it was one hell of a mountain she had climbed - and it made her all the more proud of herself and what her body had accomplished. She had gotten off her meds - her body had healed from most of the cumulative damage done to it over years of feasting and gorging. After four long years, Claire's thirties were rung in at 140 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir work ethic in the gym carried over into the office - in no time at all, they rose through the ranks - reaching the regional office. Their stories were one of those uplifting favorites in the office - ones that made their more blubbery co-workers, who, though barely in the 180's, a bit bashful regarding their own efforts. Hannah's own office work got her a nice corner office and a corporate position - with all three making some cash, they bid farewell to the apartment that was the scene of so much binging and so much gluttony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir new houses were gorgeous - Hannah and Claire moved into a two-story blue-sided house in a cozy neighborhood, nestled off a secondary road, close to their jobs. Meanwhile, Dana lived just down the street in a one-story, but still comfortable green-sided ranch-style house. They regularly alternated between each other's homes, but Claire and Hannah's house was good for when they were all sauced and needed a place to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night, they opted to go to Jessica's Bar and Grill instead of the gym. They had all gotten fairly slim - though Claire's belly still had a slight pooch near her belly-button, while Hannah's thighs still carried a hint more fat than Claire's. Dana still carried a slim margin of fat across her body. By no means was any of them fat in any sense of the word anymore, however - they were not even half of their former size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire sighed contentedly as she sipped from her beer - \"Man, it's so crazy. New pads, new jobs, and basically new bodies.\" Dana slurred - \"Issa glow-up.\" Hannah toasted her shot - \"Amen to that,\" and downed her shot. </span></div></div>",

Then again, Sara's usual lunch was a greasy bag of fries and a large burger that contented her large stomach - which grew by the day towards her knees. She asked, \"Had a good day so far?\" Claire nodded happily - \"Mm-hmm, though we've got big plans for tonight.\" Dana chuckled, \"She thinks she can beat my planking record.\" Sara waved a hand, dismissively, \"Ah, all that rabbit food and working out was never for me. I don't know how you guys can do it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire, in what was a new strain of thought for her, thought, <i>Well, I don't know how I could shove grease down my throat, but there you are.</i> She held it back and quietly chastised herself for thinking that - but it really wasn't Sara's place to comment on what she was eating. \"Well, it takes some dedication,\" said Dana. Claire hummed after swallowing a gulp of chicken - \"You know, the working out part is actually pretty fun. You ought to join us.\" Sara shook her head, \"Ah, I'm too fat to work out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire intoned - \"You know, Dana and I used to be over 400 pounds.\" Sara thought and then spoke, \"I'd heard, but I just kinda...can't believe it, looking at you now. Like, it sounds like a different set of people.\" Dana and Claire couldn't help but feel proud. \"Well, believe it or not, we did it. There's nothing that stops you from doing the same thing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara shrugged - \"You know what? I just planned to sit around anyways, why not.\" She chided herself for starting this by making fun of the two's lunch, but she figured that going and doing something with her co-workers would be better than sitting around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire and Dana happily walked out of the office that day, hoping they'd won themselves another convert to the same journey that had taken them so far. That night, they met Sara, whose 50+ inch gut jiggled with each step atop her rotund thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the workout began, she struggled to keep up with Dana's directions - she was out of breath from jumping up and down, her jiggling blubber ached. It couldn't be any more different than how Dana felt - her limbs felt so nimble, she almost began to take it for granted, but deep down, she acknowledged how light she felt when performing the exercises. Burpees especially were her pride - even while she was good at running, Claire was still out of breath a bit faster than her on those. She looked over, almost forgetting poor, fat Sara - who laid on the floor, panting, heaving. \"Oh. Shit.\" She paused her music. The obese woman was on her belly, panting and struggling. \"Yeahhh, Claire, we might wanna do more basics.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara would be one of those they couldn't quite convert - remaining obese to her dying day years ahead of time, a fate that Dana, Hannah, and Claire had avoided by their effort and willpower, not to mention their friendship. They found love in their own time, and they even had children in thinner bodies that expanded slightly - though none of them ever even got above 200, Dana only briefly getting back up to 210 after her second child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spent many years on Earth and spent them happily, and although they'd occasionally put on a few pounds here and there, never again would they achieve the life-threatening heights of gluttony they achieved in their 20's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The weekend came after another week at work, another week of spreadsheets and phone calls and e-mails. They met at Jessica's sitting at their \"usual\" spot, attended to by the southern bartender. \"Hey, the gang's all here. I'll get you them three beers, and yer food orders when I get baick with 'em.\"  Hannah nodded, \"Thanks, Mae.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bartender leaving the trio alone, Dana smiled, turning to Hannah. \"So, ready for me to top your squatting record at the gym next week?\" Hannah chuckled, \"Depends. Ready to lose your burpee record?\" Claire shook her head, \"You ain't beating the burpee record!\" Hannah smirked, replying, \"Watch me, I'll do it.\" Claire sighed, \"I'd order the grilled chicken, but this week, I need a treat.\" Dana nodded, \"I'm with you, girl. I'm thinking the Cheetos burger myself.\" Hannah raised her brows, \"You're actually doing it this time? No joke?\" Dana shook her head, \"No joke, I'm getting it.\" Hannah shrugged and spoke, \"Cause if we're getting the yumms, I'm thinking wings, but you're weird.\" Claire chuckled and spoke, \"Shit, we knew that about Dana for a while.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three laughed heartily as their beers arrived, and they placed their food orders. The bartender avoided commenting on their food - she wasn't the thinnest woman in the world, and god knows, she hated it when people commented about what she ate. She couldn't help but notice this was a bit more 'lax' than these three normally got. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it was no skin off her bones if this became their regular order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat, drinking their beers and chatting. Just before the food arrived, Hannah sighed, \"Man, Monday's gonna suck. Our department's behind on a deadline that's due then, and we're due for a chewing-out.\" Dana groaned, \"Oh, don't remind me of our own. We're behind on our networking, and we're supposed to have this memo to Haradane by Thursday, and we haven't even compiled shit for it yet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey comisserated over their stresses over the fries and burgers. The juicy, greasy treats were delicious to the throats of these much-reduced women. They consumed them with an old ardor that once drove them to obesity, and the bartender saw it. <i>Damn,</i> she thought,<i> I see them much more around here, they'll get to be the size of a house.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alcohol made them lose their inhibitions. More alcohol tended to make them think their stomachs were bottomless - and after a few more beers came a round of appetizers. Drunk and stuffed to the brim, with their previously slim stomachs now bulging with alcohol and food. The rest of Claire's belly came out to meet her remnant spare tire for the moment, and her belly poked out just that much further than anyone else's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stress of the workplace did a number on their dedication to come back to the gym. The next night, they came back. They didn't visit the bar EVERY night, but on select week-nights and as a regular destination on the weekends. Over the next few weeks, the Bartender began to see her prediction come true. Claire's shirt got tighter at the belly again, Dana's body in general began to pad with fat, In general, the group began to grow in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe office began to give them odd glances when they weren't looking - and the gossip machine exploded in the breakroom when they were out. \"Dude - Claire's getting pretty chunky again,\" said their co-worker Haley in a quiet voice as she parted her bleach-blonde hair at the table. The tan latina, Veronica, leaned in and nodded. \"Mm-hmm. She's going to have to bump up to a bigger shirt, and soon. Her buttons are screaming every time I see her.\" Anna confusedly shook her small, brown-haired head, \"Like, I don't get it. I thought they were big on fitness.\" Haley sipped her coffee, speaking, \"Not anymore, I don't think.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio were still somewhat unaware of their own gains. Claire attributed her gains to bad laundry days, and the classic excuse - \"It shrunk in the laundry,\" she'd mumble to herself. She couldn't be getting fat again. Hannah had her suspicions, but she didn't pay much attention to it - it was just bloating, and it would blow over - she hoped. Dana was just too focused on keeping up with her workload and enjoying herself on the weekends - she was blissfully ignorant of her clothes growing ever more snug and ever more tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, this weekend routine, as weeks became a month, and a month became two, led the three to grow increasingly fat. After two months, they had put on quite a few pounds. It was only a matter of time before someone noticed their gains.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They had made admirable progress, and Hannah's had been tackled - which is why she was entrusted with an important task for Dana and Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Dana and Claire finalized the drafting of the Memo, Hannah was driving to grab some drive-in burgers. Thankfully, she hadn't put on so much weight that she was having issues buckling her seatbelt - but she remembered it coming up a bit shorter than usual. Her suspicion was quieted by the sheer idiocy of the people on the road while she drove to pick up the food. \"SIGNAL NEXT TIME YOU CUT ME OFF, YOU FUCKING DICK-WIT!\" she shouted out the window, receiving a proud middle-finger from the driver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered the order as Dana and Claire described it, and repeated the order to the voice-box: \"Yeah - can I get two large Double-Burgers with bacon and cheese, and a large Chicken Sandwich?\" Somehow, her subconscious connected the order to her weight - she knew in the back of her mind that the 'treats' were becoming a habit, first with the bars, and if they weren't careful, so would these fast food visits. However, she felt like she just needed to relax after a stressful week. Sure, she was making plenty of dough, but the office's deadlines made one find coping mechanisms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, it was the gym - but as gym visits began to be increasingly replaced by bar visits, and alcohol calories piled onto the women's waistlines, it was more and more focusing on Jessica's and food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effects of these coping mechanisms was obvious as Hannah met Dana and Claire in the hallway with a big bag of food and a tray of drinks. \"Yasss,\" spoke Claire, \"You're our savior.\" Hannah's thighs and spare tire jiggled as she walked to the break room, as did Claire's belly. While not at its former extent by any means, Claire's stomach was certainly no longer a slight, average-looking pudge as it acquired an extra few inches of fat, blossoming out into a fat torso in general. Dana's whole body bounced as she stepped, her gains more evenly spread, and making her appear marginally slimmer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they entered the break room, the chubby three drew the eyes of Veronica, Haley, and Anna, who gave the group a friendly, \"Oh, heyy, guys! You get that memo sent?\" Claire sat down, taking her drink, \"Yup, it's sent! Just taking our lunch break.\" Haley spoke up as the three withdrew their burgers and fries, \"Huh. Where's your meal-preps?\" Hannah shrugged and spoke, \"We figured we'd grab some burgers for lunch.\" Haley shrugged, \"Suit yourselves. I'd grab some too, but those things are <i>killers</i> on the waist.\" Veronica nodded, and spoke, \"Yeah, I quit eating fast food last year. It helped me drop a few pounds in time for bikini season.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire held back a cringe - she could see the message as she spoke up, \"Yeah... sometimes, you just need a treat, though.\" Dana nodded as she spoke, \"Yeah, compiling those charts was a task and a half, I think I've warranted myself a burger or two.\" Anna spoke up, \"Well, be careful about that stuff. I started thinking like that around Christmas of like, two years ago, and I put on like twenty pounds. I had to work hella hard to lose some weight.\" Haley hummed in affirmation, \"Yeah, lucky you had me to help you along.\" Veronica chuckled and spoke, \"Like you didn't put on a few pounds over christmas yourself, Haley.\" The break room shared a masking laugh, but in reality, the message was hard to miss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire sought to stamp out the roots of it as she spoke, \"Yeah. but I'm pretty sure I'd notice if I was putting on weight like that.\" Anna didn't say anything, as she preferred to wait for Haley to speak. Veronica dared not speak a contrary word to Claire - she wasn't that blunt. However, Haley LIVED for this kind of office drama, whether she was observing it, or especially if she was causing it. On one hand, she wanted to just let Claire's bunch eat themselves into renewed obesity as she spread the word of their new status as the office fatties. On the other, she would love to see how bad of a ripple she could cause by calling Claire fat to her face. How would this twist into her mind? How would she react? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a tense few beats, she spoke up... </span></div></div>",

Just watch out,\" said Haley as she prepared to eat her spaghetti-o's, \"Those pounds can creep on you.\" Hannah, Claire, and Dana ate their fattening burgers and fries as Veronica, Anna, and Haley gave the trio a last few judging glances before resuming polite conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreep on the pounds did. The meal-planned lunches and their ingredients disappeared from Claire, Hannah, and Dana's refrigerators. There was more fridge space opened up for other things, of course: booze, frozen pizzas, ice cream. Hannah and the trio filled their bellies that spring after the burst of activity in early March. They let their denial run its course, even as they upsized their wardrobes from mediums into larges. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coming of summer meant a fair degree of relaxation for the trio. One summer weeknight, Claire, Hannah, and Dana gathered at Claire's for a stayover. They felt more like relaxing in, and reclined as Claire worked the grill, sizzling a few Brats. Dana popped open a beer and clinked it against Hannah's as they laid back in the increasingly taxed lawn chairs. Thankfully, these had a weight tolerance of 300, and the girls had not quite topped that threshold, nor quite gotten that close to it. However, it was fairly sure that each was somewhere just over 200. Claire's stomach had grown from a mere few inches of chub into a returning gut that was a solid potbelly. Hannah's lower half could only sustain so many pounds, and her muffin-top stomach was not nearly as stout as Claire's, which rubbed at the metal of the grill, just so. Dana's face began to retain a fair bit of fat along with the rest of her body, and along with Claire, especially began to regain her double-chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire called, \"Brats are up, girlies!\" She turned with the plate of steaming sausages and took them to the table. Hannah and Dana grunted as they pulled their increased forms up. It was getting clear that these three were beginning to outpace their scant workouts with food as they pulled themselves into plastic chairs and chased hot, juicy sausage with alcohol and potato chips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana swatted at her head, \"Gah, damn mosquitoes!\" Hannah spoke up, \"Yeah, those things are awful. They don't even pay you for your blood!\" Claire chuckled and spoke up. \"Would you let them suck your blood if they handed you their little bug debit card?\" Hannah nodded firmly, \"Hell yeah. Make them bugs pay my bills!\"  The trio continued eating through the sausages, as they munched on the grilled meat, the grease dribbled down their faces and dripping onto the table. One drop managed to drip down onto Claire's double-chin before falling to the table. Their cheeks bloated with sausage and potato chips, washed down with beers below the dimming summer skies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire smiled as she took in the moment. She enjoyed eating good food and drinking beers with her friends. \"Mm,\" she said, finishing her third brat, \"So, I got some good news from the top.\" Hannah and Dana turned to her, eager for the good news. Claire continued, \"So, thanks to our work in March, that memo? Big new acquisition, and our unit's getting a four-person cruise trip, and we're all on it!\" The three hollered in celebration, \"Oh, that's great,\" exclaimed Hannah, \"Do we know who the fourth person?\" Dana spoke up, \"God, I hope it's not Haley. She's so passive-aggressive.\" Claire spoke up. \"I really hope it's Veronica. She's got this vibe that I really gel with.\" Hannah nodded, \"Yeah - Veronica would be a good cruise partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the pits of their stomachs, their denials were becoming more burdened by evidence. They could tell that when they DID get to the gym, their fitness wasn't what it was in January. Their up-sizing wardrobe and the simple physical act of examining themselves and thinking, have my toes always been that hard to see, led them to suspect that they were putting on the pounds. However, the obliviousness was in the back of their minds in the face of the exciting cruise! Cruises meant buffets, and their new economic status afforded them a taste at the lavish nature of a cruise. On top of this, they longed for a chance to return to the buffet. They still abstained from this old hunting ground of theirs for the most part, but a corporate cruise - this was the perfect opportunity to indulge and pig out! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question was whether Haley would be there to pick at their food choices and gossip about their weight behind their backs, or Veronica, whose cool head could give them a partner in gluttony. As they approached the docks, luggage in hand, they saw, on the end of the docks...</span></div></div>",

The weight lifted from her shoulders as, for the first time in a long time, the immense gap between she and her roommate felt minuscule and almost, maybe, surmountable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that being said, she and Claire weren't the same people as they had been when the shoe had been on the other foot. Hannah had squandered her twenties while Claire had spent them blowing up and shedding back down, overcoming enormous odds by beating diabetes and shedding more than three hundred pounds while Hannah managed to find almost every single one. Claire had become a monument of self-discipline who had overcome adversity, while Hannah just sort of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wasted</i>... hers, hadn't she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah's expression darkened as the final embers of the helpful, responsible friend were snuffed out by the powerful weight of denial. Having become so used to justifying her behavior for so long now, it came naturally to Hannah to find some damning fault in Claire's helping hand. Some minor slight that somehow negated the fact that her roommate was reaching out to her, and allowed her to shed the weight of responsibility for her current pitiful state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just fuck off, okay Claire?\" Hannah commanded gruffly, \"You're not my fucking mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah, I just\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you just what?\" Hannah bumped Claire in the chest, sending the smaller woman toddling backwards, \"You think that just because you used to be some colossal fatass that you think you're the Queen of Comfort Food? That you know why I'm so fucking upset?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah, listen\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No <i>you</i> listen!\" Hannah commanded, her heart pounding behind her ears, \"I'll eat <i>whatever</i> I want, <i>whenever</i> I want, and just because you think you're <i>better</i> than me\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that I'm\u2014\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BULL. SHIT.\" Hannah huffed and puffed, her fat face beet red, \"You think that just because you managed to\" here she feigned shock, \"Lose a hundred pounds or whatever, you think that you're top shit. Well <i>I'm sick of it</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire felt a strange feeling rise in the pit of her stomach. It wasn't anger, and it wasn't sadness. The feeling rose to the back of her eyelids, tickling her lips as she felt her eyes grow misty and hot. Her fingertips began to twitch as the fat, blustering hog that Hannah had suddenly snapped into kept bleating at her, screaming until she was hoarse in the throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I had known what a fucking cunt you'd turn out to be, I'd have <i>never, ever</i> offered to help you get your shit together.\" Hannah crowed, \"If it weren't for me, you'd be lying in a landfill somewhere in a triple-wide coffin. Your <i>fat ass</i> would have had a heart attack and <i>died</i>, and I think I might have been happier that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the tears well up in Claire's eyes gave Hannah a sense of enormous power over her roommate. For the first time in forever, Hannah felt... Hannah felt like things were back where they should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her on the top, and Claire on the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only after Claire locked her bedroom door, threw herself onto the bed, and cried into her pillow that she realized what the strange feeling that she felt had been as Hannah had been screaming at her, disparaging her for getting healthy, and practically wishing her oldest friend dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pity. </span></div></div>",

While laying there after the screaming match, Claire thought, briefly, about getting Hannah kicked out, or moving in with Dana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she couldn't do that - along with the pity came compassion - the recognition that Hannah was in a very dark place, and that while she was being an omega-bitch at the moment, she didn't deserve to be alone. Claire knew the depths of lonesomeness, and it was not a pleasant place - it's a place where even food could be a better companion than nothing at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to the moment, that's what Hannah seemed to be filling her time with. More and more food. It was an insane quantity of food she was consuming - what Claire had thought would be an untenable amount of food consumption became a more long-term habit for Hannah. Weeks went on, and the binges only seemed to grow as Hannah's hips and belly rose like dough on some hellish strain of instant yeast. Two pounds a day became something more like two and a half, and every single week saw a gargantuan rate of expansion on Hannah's part. She began to grow so wide that she could barely fit into the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire did what she could to be in the same room as Hannah, but Hannah was obviously never in the mood to talk to Claire. Frequently, when Claire came into the same room, she would respond with a bitter, \"Whaddaya want,\" with an occasional \"piggy\" thrown in as a barb. Claire had learned patience over her journey to lose weight - and it showed in her nearly saint-like manner in ignoring her. Claire was waiting for a new chance to comfort Hannah. She played the long game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut God Almighty, were there some rough days. Some days, Hannah saw Claire as nothing but a strutting pig on two legs - trying to hold herself above her. On some days where she was especially bad off, her perception was literally altered - she would see Claire as several times fatter than she truly was, and herself as several times thinner than she truly was. One night, Claire was focused on a game and the doorbell rang. Hannah waddled to the door, took the pre-paid pizza, and put it down in front of Claire - \"Here, piggy. I know you don't eat anything but pizza. Eat up, fatass.\" Claire calmly replied, \"Thank you, Hannah, but-\" Hannah said, \"Oh, I get it, I get it, you're too busy with your game, gonna have a heart attack if you lean over and eat it. I can feed it to you.\" Claire did what she could to ignore Hannah as she tried to shove the pizza into Claire's mouth as she tried to focus on the moving model on the screen. \"EAT IT! EAT IT, FATASS, YOU'RE NOT ON A DIET OR ANYTHING, ARE YOU! YOU!? DIETING!? NO FUCKIN' WAY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Claire grew angry - she did what she could to remind herself that Hannah was having an episode, but she had an irresistable urge to punch her in the mouth which she managed to surmount.<i> Fuck it</i>, she thought, <i>If it makes her fuck off</i>, she opened her mouth and let Hannah feed her a slice of pizza. She slid it in way too far and way too fast, but Claire managed to bite down and save herself from gagging, chewing briefly and swallowing before Hannah fed her the crust. For a slimming girl, she still had a big bite when she needed to use it. \"Good fatty. Good. Now eat your fuckin' pizza.\" Hannah gave Claire some reprieve by heading to her room, slamming the door and giving a moan from within as she worked to come back to reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire did eat another slice. She had a craving for pizza, and it was fortunate that Hannah had chosen that mode for tonight's episode. It was, however, not at all usually like this when she had her episodes. At times, Claire would be met by a random piece of wrapping paper or cardboard box and a scream, \"FUCK OFF, FATASS! GET OUT OF MY LIVING ROOM!\" The odd thing is, although Claire frequently felt annoyed and wanted to yell back, she maintained her composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah's weight continued to grow exponentially as Claire began to cope with the odd, mercurial nature of her episodes. Every single week she seemed to be able to add another item of food to her binging, and as the month drew to a close, she had grown by well over 80 pounds, brushing up towards the upper 400's from a single month of insane volumes of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's really not healthy,\" said Dana, as Claire updated her between sets at the gym. Dana was crushing it at arm strength, while Claire's more naturally bottom-heavy weight lent itself more to better leg strength. \"Yeah, and it gets hard to keep calm at times,\" Claire stated after drinking from her bottle. \"I'll say,\" said Dana, \"She threw a bottle at you!?\" Claire hummed in affirmation, \"I barely dodged it, thank God for cardio.\" Dana spoke, \"So, how the hell are you going to help her? It seriously sounds like she needs to be committed.\" Claire shook her head, \"No, I don't think she does. Number one those places aren't the place for someone like her, a big old' target range for more abusive personalities, if my cousin's to be believed.\" Dana leaned back, \"I thought you didn't stay in contact with your family?\" Claire shrugged, \"Eh, Cousin Luanne's the exception. She was always on the bigger side, so I could always talk to her, no judgement.\" Claire paused and thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she spoke, \"I'm thinking I'm gonna need to step up my cardio regimen,\" she said. \"My bet is that if I seem like I'm going back to getting fat, or eating that way, she'll see me as less of a threat. I can go from there.\" Dana cringed, \"That sounds really risky, what if you actually relapse?\" Claire spoke, \"That's what the cardio's for - If I can burn off some of what I put on, in the best case scenario, I'll slow down my gain while she gets more friendly with me, work with her to get her back to somewhere more mentally healthy, and maybe then we focus on helping her lose some weight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana thought, \"But what if she just gets more abusive?\" Claire paused in thought, then spoke, \"Well, I guess I'll move in with you then. No point staying with someone who's that toxic if I can't help them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as such, Claire stepped up her cardio regimen in the early weeks of that month. Every day was more time that Hannah was binging her feelings away.On that third day in September, on a Thursday, Claire walked to the door as the bell rang. Hannah scowled at her as Claire opened the door and walked back with a stromboli and some breadsticks, sitting across from Hannah. \"What are you doing,\" the morbidly obese mammoth asked. Claire replied, \"Isn't it obvious? I'm fat, I've gotta eat.\" Hannah was a bit tense, but accepting of it at the moment. \"Good. I'm happy you get it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire did what she could to stave off the pounds - better than Hannah could say, while Claire put on a pound every week, Hannah was putting one on every 5 and a half hours, a pressing rate of 3 a day. At home, Claire kept up a poker face of a girl who'd accepted being fat - sitting around, playing video games and eating with Hannah. Granted, Claire wasn't BINGING, she just ate more fattening foods, and snacked more. The weight did not perceptibly come on, but her weigh-ins did confirm she was slowly putting on some weight, somewhere under a pound each week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her plan was working, to some degree. Hannah was becoming somewhat more jovial, somewhat more accepting of her presence. They began speaking again - joking, laughing occasionally. Although Claire was not very rapidly putting on weight, as Hannah was, Hannah percieved the gain, and her distortion of reality made her percieve Claire as if she was blimping back up. It was comforting to Hannah - things were returning to where they should be! Claire was the fat one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only discomfort with that was that as she came more back towards reality, she came to recognize her massive gains. In the month and week since she had begun binging with no concern for reasonable food intake, she had put on somewhere around 100 pounds. However, her mania focused far less on her as \"the thin one\" and moreso on Claire simply being \"the fat one.\" All that required repairing in this scenario was a recognition of her own status as a fellow fat girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the days coming forward, Hannah's binging happily declined into mere overeating. Granted, it was still a considerable surplus in far excess of what Claire ate, but she wasn't quite eating herself into an early grave anymore, at least not nearly as fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question, however, became more one of initiative. Hannah and Claire spent a good few weeks in their mode - as Claire put on a few pounds, Hannah put on several more. They would glut themselves jointly at home, but Claire would eat modestly at work and spend 2 hours at the gym with Dana every day. The struggle was a subtle one - Hannah tried to encourage Claire's gluttony, Claire tried to encourage Hannah's moderation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt became a war of food sabotage, and a longer game of who could better influence who.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nobody had been more adamant that Hannah needed more friends than Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact was that, despite their drifting apart, Claire had been very aware of Hannah's rapid (and worrying) decline. The former five-hundred pounder had been concerned about Hannah's rapid weight gain, but also to the way that she carried herself. Hannah had, once upon a time, been the picture of confidence and healthy choices. Now that she was spending her time holed up in the apartment, stuffing herself and acting so... well, <i>mean</i> towards everyone, Claire had been the first one to try and intervene. That was why she'd been inviting her to the gym\u2014all in hopes of roping Hannah back to a semblance of the person that she used to be. The one that would encourage Claire, instead of avoid her. The one that would build her up with (sometimes overly optimistic) optimism instead of chipping away with passive-agressive comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana and Hannah had a lot in common, even without their respective weight problems. As Hannah had become more and more sedentary, her outer voice resonated with Dana's inner one. Hannah made jokes during her (rare) goings to the gym about how she'd rather be working through the bottom of boxes and bags than she would through calories, and that really resonated with the fat girl still clamoring at the bars of Dana's psyche.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that they had so much in common, and the fact that she was so worried about Hannah, had been Claire's reasoning for insisting that the two of them get together outside of the gym. Hannah seemed so lonely lately. She hardly left the apartment. And with all of the progress that Dana had made, Claire had thought that it would rub off on Hannah. At least, to a degree\u2014ultimately, nobody was going to get Hannah back into shape but herself. But a good influence was always better than a night on the couch alone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire just hadn't accounted for the fact that, as far as Dana had come, Hannah was that much further gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like honestly, fuck the gym.\" Hannah said with a visceral, greedy bite of fried chicken, \"I get that Claire's trying to help, but she's such a fucking food nazi lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Dana laughed in agreement, albeit a begruding one, as she bit into her fourth leg of the evening. Her conscience weighed heavily on her shoulders, but was allieved by the slick grease that allowed it to travel to the back of her mind. Indulgence had become so rare as she'd steadily worked her way down the scale. A bucket and some biscuits weren't going to kill her, she reasoned\u2014what was the harm in engaging with a little honesty for a change?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, you're not wrong.\" she laughed, \"I'd rather eat chicken than get on that elliptical any day of the week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah laughed to herself, taking a big congratulatory bite of her ill-gotten goods. She had promised herself a little treat after an especially stressful day at work. Well, a mildly irritating one. The fact that Dana had been her guest for the evening gave her as much of a pass for indulgence as she felt that she deserved\u2014and something told her that this fucking hog wasn't going to judge her for shotgunning a bucket of Colonel Sanders' finest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like... okay, I know that this is really shit to say.\" Hannah looked around scandalously, \"But I kind of liked Claire better when she was all \"I'm fat, I don't give a fuck\".\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, <i>right</i>?\" Dana offered, \"Like, she's even starting to get onto me about making fun of Jean now\u2014can you believe that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah took a hearty bite of what felt like the umpteenth leg of the night. She had a good idea of what made Dana tick after a few trips to the gym with her and Claire and, as much as she wanted to get back into shape, it had become increasingly obvious that it was easier said than done. Impotent desires to whip herself back into a slender shape had leant her to the idea that Claire was being unreasonable in her expectations (as ill-definted as they were) for her workout buddies. Something that Dana, with very little provocation, appeared to agree with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Another night passed as Hannah invited Dana over for some Italian food, while Claire was at the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>God, this Alfredo is so good</i>, thought Hannah. She ignored its evident effects over the past week or two of failing to accompany Claire to the gym, which blew up her thighs and belly. She knew subconsciously that she ought to have been working out for her impending effort to bring her roommate back to where she \"belonged.\" She had been dining with Dana for a few nights now, who also had been plumping up in her lower body - straining her pants especially. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe increasing office worker had just swallowed a bite of chicken parmesan as she spoke the words that breathed life into Hannah's plans. \"This stuff is great - I used to get this kinda stuff all the time with Claire before she became a health nazi.\" Hannah suppressed a grin, letting only a smile manifest, \"Yeahh, she really has just been such a buzzkill. You know, you really should get her something - bring it to the office and offer her some, like, hibachi.\" Dana nodded, \"Yeah, but she's really on that diet of hers. Won't she just say no?\" Hannah spoke, \"Like, she could, but what kind of a friend would she be to say no? It's a gift, it'd be kind of a dick move to say no to a gift like that.\" And just like that, Hannah had planted a mine. She could see Dana's acceptance of the concept in her slight smile and a shrug - a shrug of acceptance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plan was put into motion the next day as Dana waddled back into the office after a brief lunch break. Bringing back takeout was nothing new, and Claire hadn't said anything about it to date, she was currently busy with helping Rick bind a print job, which the teen was grateful for. \"Hey, Claire,\" the slimming but still large woman heard as she turned to listen - seeing the form of her larger friend. She hadn't wanted to say anything about her friend's gain and absence from the gym, and largely hadn't except for the earlier days in Hannah and Dana's newfound friendship when they began dodging the gym to stuff their faces. Claire spoke with a wavering voice, \"Is that ... Hibachi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Claire was wavering between lecturing Dana and keeping her mouth shut, Dana heard it as a waver of near surrender - Dana spoke, \"Yup - it's your favorite, shrimp and scallops with the dim sum, and there's one extra for youu~!\" Claire held her tongue - it wasn't her place to lecture her friend, no matter how much she had felt alone over the past two weeks. However, she knew that to keep up her progress - she was back down to an (admittedly somewhat tight) 3XL, and she knew that the only way to maintain her progress was to say what she was about to say: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana gave a puzzled look. This was her friend - she was giving her a gift. \"Come on, girl, don't make me eat both of these things.\" Claire gave a bit of a harder look and spoke with an equal tone, \"I said no thanks, Dana.\" Dana's brows furrowed and she cocked her head back a bit, as if pushed back by the force of Claire's offense. \"Come on, it's a gift. It won't kill you, it's just some hibachi.\" Claire sighed and spoke with a bit of bite in her speech - \"I said no, respect my decision, if need be, eat both of them.\" Dana grumpily spoke, \"You've gotten so much worse about this since you've gone to the gym, you used to at least have a few cheat days with me, but now you barely ever eat with me at all.\" Claire's patience was being tested, but she had to be insistent. This was her health on the line, and the frustration with Dana's inane insistence burst the dam on a bit of her taboo on speaking about her food choice - \"I don't comment on the fact that you stuff your face every day, ever think about that? It's my damn choice, I let you make your <i>bad</i> decisions, let me make my <i>good</i> ones.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana stomped a foot as Rick perked an ear - he was going to keep working through this, but this was the most exciting thing that had happened at the printing office since that 'Karen' had come in last month and demanded to call their CEO. Hopefully this one wouldn't require the help of the police. Dana yelled back, \"You're such a<b> bitch</b>! I'm trying to give you a gift and you basically fat-shame me!? I'm happy with my body, don't be bitter that nobody wants to torture themselves at the fucking gym with you!\"  Claire returned with a salvo of her own, \"You're not <b>happy</b> with your body, you're <b>complacent</b>! You were just getting better, but you do kinda bad at the gym and you just,\" Claire slapped her still-chubby hands on her rotund, but slightly taut thighs, producing a loud smack, \"Gave up! You've stopped giving a shit, you've come in with take-out like every day, and it fucking shows.\" Claire gestured to Dana's fatter lower body - her belly poking out that extra bit, her glutes getting flabbier, her thighs growing closer to each other again. \"You're calling me fat, you fucking bitch,\" yelled Dana, \"You're barely any better!\" She forcefully poked Claire's gut and, though a core of some abs had begun to form below, her gut still jiggled, \"Look at you, you fucking hypocrite! You're barely any thinner than me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick had already begun to step closer, thankfully, as Claire shoved Dana's blubbery form backward, \"Don't fucking touch me!\" Rick stepped between the two - a comparative twig between two butterballs, \"Ladies, stop.\" Jean's door creaked open as the fat manager made a rare appearance out of her office - \"What the hell is going on here?\" Rick spoke up, interrupted immediately, \"I don't care,\" by Jean, \"Stop fucking screaming in my office, and keep your hands off of each other. Focus on your actual job. I thought I gave you guys raises to pay you to do your JOB.\" Claire shamefully nodded as she rubbed her sore gut - sore from being poked by Dana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of that work day was remarkably silent, and when Claire came home, full of rage, practically slamming the door, she turned to Hannah and spoke forcefully, \"Dana's not coming over here tonight, if you wanna hang with her, you'll hafta' go to her place.\" Hannah raised her brows, \"Why?\" Claire spoke, \"She acted like a stupid fucking bitch at work, tried to force-feed me some Hibachi when I clearly told her no, and got upset when I called her out on overeating to get her to fuck off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah frowned, but inside, she was grinning the grin of a Borgiaesque mastermind. She knew that Claire would refuse, but she had no clue it would blow up like this - and it was so in her favor! The effect was just as planned when she showed up with pizza at Dana's - although she had already ordered some, awkwardly enough. \"Just set it on the counter,\" Dana said, resigned to her fat fate for tonight, \"I'm gonna eat everything in front of me anyways.\" Hannah spoke, \"I'm sorry Claire was such a fucking bitch to you today,\" Dana growled as she swallowed some pizza, speaking after, \"That fucking fat bitch tried to call me out for eating, when she's basically a fucking pig herself.\" Hannah joined in, \"Yeah - so self-righteous when she's still so big,\" entirely ignorant of the irony that she was now almost certainly fatter than Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah patted Dana's back, trying to demonstrate some solidarity. She had Dana deep in her pocket - the question now was whether or not she could initiate phase 2 of her plan, to get herself and Dana thinner while Claire got fatter.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>These days, Claire seemed to live on her own planet. It didn't help that Hannah had practically moved into Dana's house now, to Claire's mind, probably eating themselves into a coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the days after her big falling out with Dana, she barely talked to the woman in the office. The contrast grew as Claire kept at her routine while she could, eating her planned meals while Dana ate her takeout. The routine, however, got harder and harder. She was able to sustain a few weeks of working out solo, but it became so dull as time went on. Another day alone. Another day on the same old machines - even switching up her routine wasn't enough. What was strangest was that as her mental motivation to work out became taxed, she felt herself becoming worse at working out. She tried to fight it, but her mental fatigue at her lonesomeness was becoming too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, she just thought - <i>Why bother going if I just keep getting worse?</i> Her gym membership lapsed as the end of the month came and passed, and she didn't bother to renew it yet. With a newly-freed up source of revenue, Claire dug back into eating more takeout - she ordered some sushi from the hibachi restaurant, and she bit into it, pouring soy sauce onto it. The intense flavor hit her all at once - oh, this was great! This was the best! It had been so long since she had bit into some feel-good food like this. She gave in - fuck it, she had some wiggle room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started as a swap of her current routines - from grilled chicken and seasoned kale to fried chicken and french fries - egg whites and pork sausage for two sausages and scrambled eggs with cheese, sometimes with some bacon if she'd gotten up early. Her healthy snacks, however, were what really started adding on the pounds - a small bag of chips, a candy bar here and there, she soon started keeping bags of chips around the apartment in addition to Hannah's still-present snacks that hadn't found their way to Dana's place. It was at the apartment with all that free time that Claire began filling again with food - snacks while she was playing a game, snacks while she was watching television. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surplus calories began to quickly erase Claire's months of work - eating while barely moving around meant that she was putting on a good few pounds every week, and her previously somewhat-tight 3X's became forbiddingly tight. Dana couldn't help but mockingly watch behind Claire's back as the woman who just a few weeks ago was lecturing her about healthy eating consumed a bag of barbecue chips while her fat folds and love handles grew by the day. One day, Claire drank from her diet soda when some buttons popped. Dana stifled a chuckle as the increasingly obese hog bent down and breathlessly picked up the buttons. Dana's mind wandered - why was Claire suddenly so out of breath? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, she recounted it to Hannah in her living room - \"So Claire bust out of her 3X today,\" she cackled over a fried chicken salad. Hannah giggled, \"Oh, sounds like someone's diet isn't going so good.\" \"That's not even the best part,\" said Dana, \"When she bent down to pick up her buttons, she was so out of breath! I swear, I thought she was gasping for breath so hard, it's like she hasn't been to the gym recently!\" Hannah grinned, \"I knew it was a matter of time before that sanctimonious bitch got fatter again.\" Claire's willpower had given out that quickly, and now she was on her way to encouragingly get Dana to eat better. Strangely enough, after the initial pizza binge, it was Dana who got on a diet, and Hannah had joined her. Of course, as two fat women whose friendship had begun in opposition to dieting, they were actually not gaining any weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, to look at Dana and Hannah's \"salads,\" it would be plain why they weren't quite losing weight either. These were thinly-veiled and slightly garnished fried chicken breasts, with creamy and fattening sauce drizzled over a copious amount of the calorie-laden cuisine. It was a start, and it kept them sitting still while Claire tumbled backward. It was plain to Dana that Claire was about her size by the end of that month, and by the end of the next month, Claire had clearly gotten over 400 pounds. The month after brought more gains for the oversized seal that was Claire Spittz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire herself got suspicious as she slid into her 4X's and they began to feel suspiciously tight in a quick matter of time. She knew she was letting herself go, but she became increasingly suspicious of how far she was going, and after some struggle, she got up onto her feet, worn out by the task of standing up, and waddled to the bathroom. Pulling out the glass scale from under the sink, she stood on it as it spoke, \"Four hundred and three point eight pounds.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck..\" muttered Claire, as she shelved the scale. She knew she was putting on some weight, but over 30 pounds in 3 months? How the fuck was this possible? She was out of shape, and that was annoying enough to her, but now she had negated 6 months of fitness in 3 months of gluttony!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one course of action clear to her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She walked to the pantry. Hannah basically lived in Dana's house now, so she had no use for her multitudes of fatty snacks. Claire's brain was begging, <i>Come on, no, don't open the pantry!</i> Claire couldn't listen to it - the revelation was too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo much progress was lost! She was below 400, the thinnest she had been in years! And all because she was a little lonely, she wasted all of that progress. The gym couldn't make her feel good right now, it'd just be a slog, a god-awful drudge. Nothing could make her feel better but her old and dormant friend - binging until her worries were drowned below an ocean of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana's bag of chips dissappeared into Claire's mouth, as did a candy bar. She ate not to taste, but to fill. She felt like she still had more room, after finishing an entire bag of chips and two candy bars - a third bar, a fourth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's stomach was mercifully out of practice and, for the moment, her binge came to a stop. She laid back and passed out in a food coma for the night - but the shame of her failure didn't go away. The shame of now basically being alone did not go away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt work, Dana couldn't help but notice how Claire was exploding out of her clothes every single day! She was living up to how Hannah had revealed her - a living hog who was a brutal mockery of who she was trying to become. Almost nothing that was marked for disposal made it there - as Dana cut back on her snacking a little, Hannah had told her, \"Do you want to be like \"Cholesterol\" Spittz?\" - All of it seemed to go to Claire, every bag, every little thing that had to be thrown away. Claire spent every waking moment either at her computer or eating, with a little time in between to gasp for breath, gather it for her expanding body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer muscles, so recently cultivated to a minor extent, began to atrophy again as she continued ignoring the gym, ignoring nutrition in favor of filling her mouth. Hannah could only grin at Dana's tales of Claire's expanding body. All was beginning to come back to where it should be- Hannah and Dana were going to be the small ones once again, and Claire would be back to her gargantuan size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman herself was playing into every stereotype that Hannah had constructed in her mind - every waking moment was spent shoveling food into her mouth, and every moment at the apartment was spent either napping or playing games. Her beloved console was only slight respite from the nightmare that was recognizing her gluttony and failure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this laziness and binging took a massive toll on Claire's weight.  Her gut shot outwards with every week, every day she grew fatter and fatter as she didn't stop binging, she continued overeating every single day, ignoring the careful calorie targets she had set. Long ago had she abandoned tracking the vast intake of food she put in every day. The last time she had tracked her food at the start of all of this, her app had given her a pop-up, \"You are consuming too many calories. Overconsumption of calories results in weight gain. Consider reducing tomorrow's intake or exercising to compensate for overconsumption.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the 4X's she was wearing began to get tight as the month drew to a close - not unbearably tight, but her stomach grew close to the fabric, it rippled less and became more snug - the next weeks after brought only more tightness, her work clothes became overly tight. Even fat Jean had to comment, \"Claire, you've got to up-size your uniform again. It's getting too small.\" <i>If Jean had to say something</i>, Claire thought, <i>I'm really getting fat.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gut continued surging towards the end of that month - she figured she was putting on some serious pounds, but the doubt that Hannah had planted in her mind told her, \"No - you can't lose this weight. You're too fat.\" The words of her doctors and nutritionists, the trainers she had read from were gone, pushed out by the poisonous seed of doubt. She began to accept it - this was where she had been for most of her life, this was where she was going to go back to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with it came a return to her old medications as her doctors saw her meteoric gain. \"Claire, you were doing so well - what has gotten into you,\" her Georgian physician inquired. She couldn't give him an answer. They recommended therapy to her as she took her old doses again, but not a session was attended. All that she attended was her growing hunger - her desire to bury her shame in food. By the end of the month, she was definitively out of any 4X's, and at the end of the next month, her 5X's fit her just as they had when she had started her weight loss. She was all the way back to where she had been, with a bit more injury to her health and none of the drive to try to prevent more damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough this part of Hannah's plan was reaching fruition, as Claire gained, not all was going well on her own side of Phase 2.</span></div></div>",

She had fattened herself back up, fallen off the wagon. She just had to get back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, it was hard to do with everyone at the gym giving her <i>that look.</i> They looked at her with a sense of incredulity - the woman who had been the talk of the gym's weight-loss circles online had fallen off quite a bit. \"Mm, she's put some back on,\" noted one particular Chatty Cathy - and it caught the ears of Dana and Hannah, who were on the exercise bikes. They panned their heads to see the thundering form of Claire Spittz, waddling into the Gym. She was looking a little winded just from her walk from the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my god, she really has put on some weight,\" said Hannah. She had to see her roommate's incoming attempt at using the treadmill. She had put on so much weight it was rediculous! Her gut jiggled and bounced with every step, far more than Dana remembered. It was a wonder to see the woman sit down and see her belly expand to the size of France, rolling out to a hand's length from her knees. To Hannah's mind, it was a wonder compared to her own form! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the three months since Claire's lapse in judgement, Hannah had started taking Dana to the gym about sometime last month, as well as working on making their \"diet\" a bit healthier. They had shed some 20 pounds of water weight, and it had left them looking a far stretch thinner than Claire - some 40 pounds thinner, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blubbery woman, after a respite, trudged up towards the Treadmill. She looked to her left, scanning her surroundings consciously - Dana and Hannah began to look busy as her eyes cast across their backs. She didn't recognize them and didn't have the time to look any closer as the treadmill sped up. The two turned to look as she put in her earbuds and began walking on the treadmill. The bottom of Claire's gut dangled out of her workout top - one of the 3X clothes she hadn't gotten around to replacing yet. It hugged her oversized belly as it jiggled from side to side, much to Hannah's delight. Her cellulite-covered legs jiggled around below her knees in her 4X shorts, and her love handles escaped the top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Thud, thud, thud.</b> Her steps were so loud against the rolling belt! They were awkward as she tried to keep up with the 3mph pace. Barely 3 minutes in she was sweating badly. \"She's already sweating up a storm,\" said Dana, \"She wasn't this bad the last time we were here together.\" Hannah nodded as she watched the whale trudge forward. Her breath wasn't audible over the stomps produced by her lard-coated legs, but Hannah could see her mouth hanging open, her nostrils pulling air - not quite desperately yet, but at a faster rate than she had thought she would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help but think, <i>God, this pig is so out of shape!</i> Barely four more minutes and she was struggling fairly badly - working to pull air into her lungs as she walked at the comparatively slow pace of 3mph. She wasn't even jogging, and she had only spent seven minutes on the treadmill, but she was struggling to walk a normal, healthy 20 minute mile! Hannah doubted this sow would even make 20 minutes on the treadmill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither did Claire. God almighty, it was so hard! The bouncing of her own blubber left her lungs struggling to keep up as she pounded the belt with her fat feet, shielded only by her shoes. It felt like she was jogging again, she wasn't used to the 3mph pace, and her legs were aching. Another minute crawled by, she had made 8 minutes, and she had not even made half a mile yet. Her throat burned from the constant and desperate gasps she was now making for breath. Her music couldn't drown out her struggling breaths. A ninth minute and she felt like she couldn't go any longer, and she was so, so weary. Her legs wavered and jiggled, stepping irregularly, she leaned so hard on the railings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This lardass is so out of shape she can't even walk 10 minutes without cheating on the treadmill</i>, Hannah thought. Claire got to 10 minutes and immediately stopped on 10:01. She wearily stepped off as Hannah and Dana got back to their workout. Claire spent so long sitting and taking drinks of water that they were impressed to see her step up into the weight area. Hannah couldn't resist the urge to show off to Claire as she spoke up, \"Hey, Claire!\" Claire turned around, mortified to see Hannah - not only smaller than her, but smaller by 30 pounds! \"Heyy, Hannah! Hey, Dana! You guys still go here?\" Hannah nodded, \"Mm-hmm! Good to see you back here - you've been away for a while.\" Claire blushed, \"Yeahh... I kinda fell off the wagon.\" Behind her eyes, which gave off a friendly facade, Hannah thought, <i>That's pretty fucking obvious, tubbo.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, lift a bit with us, Claire,\" encouraged Hannah. Claire couldn't help but feel awkward near the two, \"Eh, sure.\" She waddled up towards the rack situated over a low bench and looked, daunted, at the weights. \"We're doing chest presses. You remember how to do those, right?\" Claire laid down and spoke, \"Walk me through it, just to make sure.\" Hannah smiled as she lifted the weight and held it over Claire's fat-filled mammaries. \"So, just hold it over your nipples, line your hands up with your shoulders..\" Claire's hands shakily gripped the bars near Hannah's hands as Hannah instructed her, \"Then, lower it towards your boobs...Slowly, slowly..\" Claire unsteadily let Hannah guide her motions, nodding, \"...And push it back up, I think I get it again.\" Claire's top had drifted upward to reveal, now, her belly button and a bit above. Hannah let go as she felt a rush of dominance from being so motherly towards the big, bloated Claire. She, of course, had no desire to see her succeed - just flounder and fail so she could revel in the return to normalcy that this began to represent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's fat arms jiggled as she struggled with the second rep - she performed the third with a deteriorating form, the bar wavered a bit. She took some deep breaths as she held the bar above her breasts, lop-sided. Hannah stepped in, and helped hold the bar. \"It's okay. I've got you.\" Claire looked at Hannah and spoke, \"Thanks.\" Inside, Claire felt so humiliated! A short while ago, she was the one leading the way - now it was Hannah! \"If it's okay, I'd like to take a break.\" Hannah hid a smirk and spoke, \"Uh.. sure, alright.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe predictable words, \"I think that's it for tonight - I'll see you later, guys!\" were spoken by Claire, followed only by \"You should hang around at the apartment more, Han.\" Hannah smiled and spoke, \"Oh, definitely.\" That night had completely confirmed everything Hannah's delusions had suspected - Claire was, all along, just a fat, out of shape pig who was now going back to her natural state while Hannah led those who could be saved away from obesity. Of course, Claire could not be saved - she was the fat one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something else about what had just transpired. Hannah's bitterness began to give way to something else - a feeling of control. And she loved it. She loved to dominate, to mandate, especially to a helpless pig like Claire. A lot of that feeling of control came from Claire's size - from ensuring that she remained \"the fat one,\" the slobby, obese hog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The drive over to Claire's apartment made Hannah feel like a triumphing general after the humiliating session at the gym. It was genuinely cathartic to see the health guru that was Claire Spittz struggle and fail with the same activity she so recently lorded over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a surprise for Hannah that next day to see Claire fail to show up at the gym - she looked to be on the verge of death just from the brief workout the other day, one that Hannah could easily replicate four times over, and Dana reported fairly frequently on Claire's deteriorating eating habits. Hannah had enjoyed being with Dana, but she had filled her purpose. It was time to see \"Cholesterol\" Claire Spittz fail in person - see her laze about compared to her \"holier-than-thou\" attitude from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped onto the elevator and set it to the third floor - she wasn't going to walk all those damn stairs! It was conveniently beyond her gaze that she was, for all her bluster, still over 300 pounds. Her gut still impeded her movement, though she could move far easier thanks to her increased exercise - yet the fact still remained, she was quite rotund. Her delusions were a powerful force - one that could not brook such a break in her constructed reality. As a matter of fact, she could likely barely scale the stairs up to Claire's apartment, but all that her mind focused on was the gap in weight between her and Claire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a good two weeks since she had seen Claire at the gym last - and Hannah could scarcely wait to see Claire's current state. The moment of decision - the key in the lock clicked, the lock hadn't changed - the sound of the opening door somewhat was muffled to Claire as she focused on her game. Hannah gazed at the blob of fat that now sat on the couch, focusing in on her character's point of view in the game. Other players fell to her little digital cursor, and the screen of victory soared - replaying her last moment of glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah could care less - she glanced around the apartment while Claire focused on her game. The healthy snacks that Claire kept around were gone, replaced by chips, soda, alcohol, sweets... The piggy was definitely going back to her old ways. It was when Claire turned around and looked that Hannah spoke up, \"Heyy, Claire!\" Claire struggled to her feet, panting a bit as she waddled towards Hannah. \"Heyyy, Han.\" The two hugged lightly, Claire feeling Hannah's blubber rub up against her own. She felt worryingly lighter - and to Hannah, Claire was gloriously larger. It was plain that her sedentary lifestyle was doing its work on her bloated gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was Dana's place,\" inquired Claire dryly as she grabbed a soda, cracking it open and sipping. It was plain that she didn't quite care for Dana - merely Hannah's experience of her apartment. Hannah replied, \"Oh, same old, same old. Been getting work in at the gym, trying to eat right.\" Claire spoke, \"Yeah, you look great, I can tell you've been working hard.\" \"Yeah, I have,\" said Hannah. She couldn't help but throw in a subtle little jab, \"I've been missing you at the gym. Switched memberships or something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her mind, Hannah guessed that the only \"membership\" that Claire had was a pizzeria punch card, stuffing her gut for a free pizza every so often. Claire bashfully scratched the back of her head and spoke, \"U-uh, heh, uh, no, not really, just.... didn't feel like going any more.\" Hannah's face drooped at her mouth - the dissapointment was fairly plain. \"Aw, that's a shame. You were doing so good.\" Claire shrugged, \"Yeah - then I slacked off for a while, and I just don't think I can get back to where I was.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough reassuring Claire with some half-assed words that managed to seem convincing, Hannah couldn't help but think, <i>Damn straight you can't, fatass. Sit back down on that couch and stuff your face.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as if by some magic of the mind, Claire did so, waddling back to the couch and sitting down, grabbing a fist-full of chips and swallowing it. She continued, \"Well, good to have you back around here, Han.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was so good for Hannah to be back around Claire, just to be able to micro-aggress against her, to exist as she slimmed down while Claire blew up in size. She felt SO superior as she saw Claire order in take-out that night, bouncing with every ounce of renewed blubber that was in her body. \"This one's free,\" she proudly proclaimed. <i>Sweet Jesus,</i> thought Hannah, <i>I wasn't bullshitting! She actually has a fucking punch card!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah made sure to eat her baked ziti deliberately, enjoying it while watching Hannah eat her grease-laden meat lover's pizza.  \"How often do you get a free one,\" asked Hannah. Claire turned to her, speaking without having to think - \"Oh, yeah, it's with every five pizzas, or every ten orders. I order in pretty frequently from this place, so I can get like three free ones a month.\" Hannah nodded, \"Huh. Probably saves you a good bit of money.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, Claire was such a disgusting pig. The grease dribbled down her chin, then down the fold of fat that accumulated on her neck - which had grown beyond being a 'double chin.' Hannah motioned with her napkin to her neck - but it was clear what she meant. Claire wiped the grease. \"Thanks,\" she said. Hannah swore she could hear this lardass getting fatter by the minute - she was not content to eat two pieces, three - but she ate the entire pizza, and had a handful of chips with every few pieces! Claire rubbed her stuffed stomach, \"Ahh - that hit the spot.\" Her hand rubbed the higher end of her gut - it was almost poetic to Hannah - an inch or two higher, and it would be on her heart. Hannah saw Claire take her pills, and couldn't help but think about how hard that muscle had to pump to keep this great tub of blubber alive. She was gasping after particularly long sentences, being pressed by her own increasing mass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a damn hard struggle to keep her internal voice a purely internal one as the month rolled to its end. It was plain that every week, Claire slowly expanded, bit by bit. She stayed as lazy as she was a good year ago, doing almost nothing but driving to work - never walking - and eating, every movement became visibly more difficult for the massive woman. It was like seeing a real-time morph of a human being, seeing Claire Spittz destroy her body with obesity. Every month she grew larger, every week Hannah witnessed Claire destroy her health with salt, fat, and sugar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd every other day, Hannah sniped wherever she could. \"You should try this salad, Claire, this dressing kicks ass.\" Claire would always refuse - \"No thanks, I've got this chicken here.\" It was like her palette was going in reverse - abandoning things that she had just gotten acclimated to eating. VERY occasionally, Hannah would push a wee bit - \"Come on, girl, you really should try it. It's good for you.\" At least a few times, Claire put it in her mouth - but her distaste for the leafy greens was clear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear to Hannah: Claire was doomed to be a porcine butterball for the rest of what was left of her life. It was just a matter of enjoying the status quo as she shrank in size. As another two months had passed, Claire had put on another fair chunk of weight. Her work clothes were becoming ever-too tight, and her apartment clothes had gotten tighter as well - Claire had to disappear into her 5X clothes again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her weight was not quite yet done giving her grief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>God, work was getting to be a hassle</i>, thought Claire as she sat in her car. She unbuckled herself from her extended seat belt, which re-emerged from the glove box after  Hannah's carefully crafted plan to fatten her back to her \"rightful\" place had achieved its aim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe routine that got on her nerves always seemed to be the same: she walked into the store and any customers inside gawked at her size. She dwarfed nearly any other employee in the office: Jean had long since halted her weight gain, and she was merely overweight. Granted, she HAD expanded the gate to ensure she didn't have any awkward moments - but she was still not nearly as fat as Claire. Dana herself was losing a fair amount of weight with Hannah, but the clientele noted Claire's eternally increasing weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the expanded gate, it was meant to be comfortable up to 300 pounds. Dana could waddle through it with a fair level of comfort and a wee squeeze. Claire's soaring weight had been making her transit through the gate harder, but as she neared 500 pounds, she found that she had to apply a degree of force to get through the gate - just enough to get past the squeeze of the wooden posts at the moment, but each week, the task became more difficult. Even with a wider gate, the job of getting her fat through the gate was becoming more taxing. What humiliated Claire the most was that this wasn't even as small as the gate she had to use from when she started - yet she was still struggling to get through this damn gate! This was a gate practically designed for an office of fatasses, and she was already becoming too fat for it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer great, wobbling gut jiggled over her upper thighs as she fought the monstrous thing to try and move forward, battering it with her practically conjoined thighs due to how fat they were. Her work pants were still too small while her blue polo workshirt revealed much of her fat. Her pants could not come above her waist, and as such her gut hung out over her belt, practically concealing the buckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana and Claire were still very much so on the outs with each other. Rick never had much to do with either, really, but he found himself talking more to Dana. One topic came up frequently when Claire ran out for her fast food lunches - \"So when is she getting back with the program?\" \"She's not,\" Dana replied, \"She's just been packing on the pounds and I don't know when, or if, she'll stop.\" This particular day, Claire happened to get back just as Dana spoke her second sentence - but she didn't care enough to give that bitch the time of day. She knew she was getting fat, but she couldn't lose weight! She was so out of shape that she'd be mocked for life at the gym for getting so fat again, Hannah and Dana seemed to just shrink at will while she was stuck being an eternal fatass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother fight with the gate. Another fight to keep breathing. God, she was getting so sweaty! She had to sit down. Her chair groaned so loudly, and it was blatant that it would give out any day now. Claire was too tired to care. Dana gave a cringing gaze, and Claire just gave her a sweat-laden glare filled with her frustration. The two met eyes, traded anger through their twin glares of Dana's disgust with Claire's gluttony and sloth, and Claire's anger at Dana's betrayal and deceit. Rick and Dana broke the moment, getting to work on an order. Claire just checked her e-mails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean frustratedly opened her door as Dana and Rick struggled to get a workload bound. \"What is the issue? This was supposed to be ready an hour ago. I'm supposed to call them when it's ready, and they've had to call me, twice.\" Dana spoke, not nearly as winded as one would expect from her still considerably fat figure, \"Uh, trying, but there's so much paper, and they stipulate we've got to have it just so.\" Jean turned, beleagured, to Claire, \"Claire, can you just get up and help them? And don't give me that sigh. You're not getting paid to eat.\" Claire bore Jean's callous snipe, \"J'st gimme a sec...\" the morbidly obese madame spoke. She struggled to her feet against the pounds of fat that weighed her towards the chair, which groaned terrifically as she rose like a leviathan from the deep, jiggling as she managed to pull herself up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing her ascent, Claire ported her mass towards the two struggling co-workers of hers, whose comparative slimness was so exacerbated by the blue uniform. Claire struggled and panted as she arrived at the workspace. She helped hold down the paper, keeping it aligned as she leaned back just enough that her sweat would not land on the precious paper or binding. Dana stared at the paper, grossed out and somewhat horrified by how unfit Claire was. This woman could barely bind a report and walk across a room without sweating an ocean! She was already eating herself into an early grave, her blue workshirt was showing off her vastness as the job finally bound and Rick spoke up, \"Right, label's on there.... Cover pages... Alright, job is bound.\" He turned to the blubbery, sweat-covered form of Claire, speaking half-heartedly, \"Thanks.\" Claire nodded as she waddled back towards her desk. Jean walked away as Claire exhaustedly jiggled towards her computer, \"I'll send the notification,\" she said with a gasp afterwards, as if it were some long sentence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled herself to a seat on the chair, but the overtaxed furniture had begun its signature groan when something snapped off loudly. Claire felt herself sliding back and right, feeling her mass propelling her to the ground rapidly, as she yelled in involuntary terror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA titanic, monstrous <u><b>THUD</b></u> sounded through the whole building, and the office floor shook with Claire's magnitude. Rick almost stumbled as Jean hurried over. \"Jesus, Claire, are you okay?\" Claire gasped, the air in her lungs being forced out by the impact. She was covered in sweat as her chest rose and fell. A pang of pain shot through her chest, sending dread through Claire's mind. Was this humiliation not enough, was she going to have a heart attack, right here? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped and tried to get her air back. All three of her co-workers hurried over to her and inspected her, \"Claire! Claire, are you okay?\" She gasped, no air came down her windpipe. Finally some of the first came back in at the end of one of her long gasps, her chest rose and fell with longer pauses as she finally spoke weakly, \"Think so..\" She could not bring herself to try to stand, but Dana and Rick and Jean grabbed her by her armpit, feeling the atrophied muscle which was buried under layers of fat. They could barely feel any bones as they spoke, \"Come on, let's get you up, big girl.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in their moment of concern, they couldn't help but humiliate Claire. She struggled to help herself up, and Dana couldn't help but think - <i>God, this bitch is so huge.</i> It was easier to move loveseats into her dorm than it was to try to lift Claire Spittz, and this was with the help of two other people! She gritted her teeth and engaged the re-awakened muscles that Hannah had helped train, Claire giving minimal effort to lift herself. Claire continued gasping for breath, transitioning into panting as she came to her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, we're gonna have to replace this chair,\" remarked Jean. Claire couldn't muster a reply, only Dana could. \"Yeah - make sure to get a stronger one.\" Jean shook her head, \"I'll see, but  the better solution,\" she spoke, as she laid a hand on Claire's gut, \"is probably to shed some of this, huh?\" Claire couldn't muster a reply as the three walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Claire's hours, thankfully, were nearly up as she clocked out and waddled out to her car. She held back the tears longer than she thought she could, and the first sobs only came as she reached her door, opening it and sitting down, almost aggressively throwing her weight into the driver's seat. She clutched her face in her hands, crying ugly tears into her hands, moaning in despair. She had fallen so far, and her co-workers could think only to insult and humiliate her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire could only think of the safety of the apartment. She blew a red-light and narrowly dodged the front of a silver sedan, she could barely see through her tears and the fat that had begun to shroud even the peripheries of her vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe parked, got to the elevator, and got up to the apartment, crying all the way. She burst in, Hannah was at work, or the gym, she didn't care - she heard the door shut behind her as she grabbed her food stash. She could do naught but eat it all. Entire family bags of chips fell before the ravenous hunger borne of her tears, share-sized candy bags disappeared into her obese maw. Her blue workshirt was covered in the wetness of tears and sweat. She ate until her tears ran out, she ate until the blue shirt rose to be little better than a covering for her inadequate and dull bra. She ate until she physically could not fit any more food into her gut and she felt her stomach protesting against its fullness. She could not get up if she wanted to, and all she could do was lay on the mound of opened wrappers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was how Hannah found Claire when she came home from work - passed out with her gut stuffed to bursting, literally hanging sideways off the couch by a good few inches, with puffy red eye sockets and a wet, wet workshirt. Hannah, in part, felt just at viewing the sight. This fat blob obviously had someone tell her the truth and she couldn't handle it, so she's eating herself to death again. Typical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut below that, was some pity: even when someone brought her weight up bluntly to her, Claire didn't respond like this. Something went down, BIG TIME at work. But Claire was too deep in a food coma to respond at all. Inside, some part of her bitterness had faded now that Claire was plainly fatter than her and subservient again. Part of her pitied Claire and the circumstances that afflicted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire was certain to cope using food. Hannah, however, was not sure how to react.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hannah did not think that Claire could overeat more than she already did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe already ate three pretty large meals a day with a fair amount of snacking in-between. Of course, as work became more difficult for Claire, her coping mechanism managed to prove Hannah wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one, portion control of any reasonable form went out the window for Claire. Instead of one danish for breakfast, or a moderate-sized breakfast platter, she'd order enough food for two people - pancakes, two orders of bacon, four eggs - nearly a thousand calories, before her day had truly begun. Similar doubling of portions happened at lunch and supper, which were already the greatest source of calories in her day - well over 2000 calories as a baseline<i> per meal</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of this deluge of food, the woman nearly never stopped eating between meals. She couldn't stop, it was a compulsion - snack stashes meant to last a party of people would barely last two days near the black hole of food that was Claire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, her co-workers could not resist commenting - \"Claire, Jesus, you haven't stopped eating since you got in here,\" commented Dana, who began to become outright stunned by the endless parade of snacks that flowed into her former friend's mouth. Claire could barely say anything even if her mouth was not full, or she had breath in her lungs that wasn't being pressed out by the increasing weight of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah could only feel more and more sorry for the woman as she outgrew her humiliatingly large 5X clothes. She could only feel more and more sorry when she could not stand up without the assistance of an industrial-strength cane and her help, gasping from even this assisted task. Claire could not truly walk any distance longer than a dozen steps, or her legs would simply give out. Even the simple walk from the car to her elevator to the apartment left her absolutely demolished and in need of a long rest on her couch, gasping for breath desperately while her clogged arteries struggled to pump oxygenated blood into the vastness of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her muscles were decaying from her lack of activity while her gut soared FAR above 70 inches, and Claire could not sit without spreading her legs to allow the great slab of fat to hang down between her thighs, nearly rubbing every chair she sat on. The pace at which her body filled with lard was astonishing, but not surprising considering her lack of activity and her food intake. Inches seemed to come on every single day as her mammoth form expanded. Her thighs were as wide near the pelvis as a healthy woman's waist, and covered in dimples of cellulite. Her knees became overshadowed by a fold of fat that overhung them, making movement that much more difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah's bitterness began to subside, even as she reduced her weight back down into the mid-200's, a world of difference between her and Claire, somewhere over 300 pounds of difference. She no longer felt righteous indignation at Claire - she felt sorry for the morbidly obese woman who was now eating herself into immobility. Hannah did what she could to take care of Claire - she helped her get up, she went to the store to get what she asked even if she didn't like it - but she made it no secret that she was worried for Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl,\" she said, sitting next to her as she stuffed her face on more snacks, \"You need to stop eating your problems and face them. Otherwise, this couch isn't gonna stay up for much longer.\" Claire took a moment to swallow her food and spoke, \"If I could just talk them away, I'd be thin.\" Hannah shook her head, \"That's not what I mean, but it's a step on the road.\" Claire stared ahead, her chest rising and falling as she took in shallow breaths to try and feed her blubber-bloated form with oxygen.  \"They're too big for anyone to handle - I got mental help to fix my eating problems already, and I already failed them. It'll just happen all over again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah didn't know how to approach this, she just shook her head. \"I'm just worried about you, girl. You're eating yourself out of your life.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire's size, as she grew ever fatter, made movement a task as she soared past the 500 mark and rocketed towards the 600's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made getting through nearly any door a task - even driving her car was becoming more of a task as she had to push her seat almost as far back as it could go - her legs struggled to reach the pedals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered how long she would be able to even come into work. One day late that month, she approached the gate, hoping to be able to get through - and her heft became stuck in the posts. Jean and Dana had to grab her massive love handles and pull for dear life, barely wresting her from the gate. \"Jesus, girl, there we go,\" said Dana. Jean spoke after, \"Claire, my office.\" She sighed - it was time for another lecture from her boss. She breathlessly waddled into the office, squeezing her great love handles through the door as she gasped for air and sat in an armless chair. It was wide, black, and the only one of its kind in Jean's office, and quite plain in its intent - the only chair that this whale could sit in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is getting to be a serious problem. You can't come in through the gate anymore - you are going to have to come in through the supply entrance.\" Claire sighed. It figured - she was becoming so fat she had to haul herself in like cargo - she was dreading having to go the whole distance from the entrance to the office. \"But it's such a long walk, from, the bay to here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean crossed her arms, \"Well, the alternative is to basically knock out the counter so you can come through there, because you can't fit through the gate. It's already big enough for up to, what, 400 pounds?\" Claire sighed as Jean continued, \"And another thing - you're literally starting to outgrow our sizes. 6X is the very biggest that the uniforms come in, and you're obviously not on a diet.\" Claire shrugged, \"So? Just special-order.\" Jean shook her head, \"That's not a possibility. 6X already is so damned hard to get, and the company's not paying for a 7X. And you can't work without a uniform.\" Claire was already effectively at that point - her blue workshirt revealed the bottom of her belly, and she could never actually tuck it in. Without a new shirt, Claire would have eaten herself out of her uniform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's eyes began to tear up. \"But...but I need this job....\" Jean spoke, lowering her voice - which scared Claire. \"Well, you've eaten like that's not the case. You've gotten too fat for the office chairs, and the new one is already showing real signs of wear and tear after, what, a month?\" Claire gulped and did what she could to hold back her tears as her cruel manager went on, \"You're so obese you can't come through an already double-wide gate, you can't bring in the supplies or you'll collapse, and now I have to cajole you to do any binding work or even get a print job.\" Claire pleadingly spoke, \"Just, give me a few more months, and, I...\" Jean cut her off, \"I'm gonna stop you right there - you've had months since your slip-up in weight. You've had months to adapt to the workplace, and we've done everything we can to accommodate your disability, because that's what that fat is, a disability.\" She shook her head as she signed something. Claire sobbed a bit, losing her grip just a tad, as Jean spoke. \"I hope you enjoyed the food. I'm sorry it had to come to this, but you've left us no choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout her job, Claire had nothing left to keep her from sitting at the apartment, gorging herself all day long. Even the relative restraint she had to show at work was gone, and her days devolved into orgies of food and napping. Her gut continued to explode outward as she barely moved at all - many days, she would simply go to sleep on the couch. She gained at a patently ridiculous rate, but her days were quite literally nothing but eating and sleeping. She no longer had the mental fortitude to do really anything else. And as such, in merely 2 months of insane binging, Claire's weight had exploded to superhuman extents - not content with around 10 pounds a month, she looked to be somewhere at or just below 600 now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah realized she would legitimately have to consider how to take care of Claire. The woman could barely move at all if she ever elected to, and she could not even fit in her car at this point, having sold it to help pay rent until her disability returned. One day later that month, Claire complained to her, \"So, I think we're going to have to talk to the landlord about getting the shower fixed and these doors widened - I can't fit in the shower.\" Hannah raised her eyebrows, and realized her conundrum. \"Uh, I don't know if the landlord will agree with that.\" Claire sighed. \"Well, either you'll have to convince him, or we'll have to get a bigger place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an odd realization to understand that Claire was becoming not only too fat for her job, but also for her literal apartment. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For all of her bluster, \"Phase 2\" of Hannah's plan to put things back where she felt that they were supposed to be never really materialized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween herself and Claire, only one of them had proven to possess the willpower necessary to take the hard steps necessary towards any meaningful weight loss. Despite the rocky start, Claire had clawed her way up from rock bottom. Having lost more than three hundred pounds was no accident on her part, and certainly not anything that she could have lucked into\u2014despite, perhaps what Hannah had fooled herself into believing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a good, long while Hannah had held this lofty notion of what happened when she would lose the weight. She would do it better than Claire. Come back at her old skinny self, and really show that bitch who was boss. That she wasn't better than her because, really, <i>anybody</i> could lose weight if they tried hard enough. Claire wasn't <i>special</i>. She was just a fatass who learned to eat right and... fuck, jog regularly. It couldn't have been that hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at the end of the day, Hannah was infinitely more satisfied to posturize these scenarios than she was to actively work towards them. \"When she lost weight\" may as well have been \"when she won the lottery\" or \"when she married a millionaire\"\u2014over time, it just sort of became this fun thing to talk about (fantasize about, really) between friends. Having a friend who was bigger than her did wonders for Hannah's dwindling self-esteem. The slot that had always been there in her adult life, previously occupied by Claire, was now filled in by Dana. And as she worked towards, almost actively, reversing any positive influence that Claire might have had the already enormous woman, Hannah could only slip further down the rungs of the fitness ladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a peculiar way, having Dana around was almost like a permission slip for Hannah to do as she pleased and eat what she wanted. It wasn't like she'd ever get as big as Dana anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire's not here, you can <i>have</i> thirds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I just...\" the round brunette puffed, \"I'm...m'kinda... full...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? Untuck that gut.\" Hannah would snort, \"Nobody's gonna judge you here\u2014Claire's at the gym or whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana always came around to Hannah reasoning, even as it began to decay into self-serving hedonism. After all, the more that her Fat Friend ate, the more that Hannah could stomach that extra bite. Or third helping. Her midnight snacks didn't seem so silly knowing that Dana had (helped her) clear the dinner table that evening, and Dana's mom had never been shy about her feelings towards leftovers. Coming home cradling her gut was a non-issue when she had been given the opportunity to really let her appetite fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares what your boss thinks, Dana?\" Hannah would dismiss her friend's notions quite often, but Jean's light criticisms were especially frequent, \"Who's she got to criticize these days? She can't exactly see her toes either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean...\" Dana would manage, speeding through bags and bags of chips like a stress-eating conductor's car, \"...<i>yeah</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the animosity between Hannah, Dana, and Claire simmered into cool and quiet jealousy for her skinny body, ownership of Dana sort of slid towards Hannah as she offered things more in line with the big girl's interests. Food and displacement of her problems. The company was a good excuse to go all out and order everything on the unofficial takeout menu, so Hannah had her new friend over often. Claire was always cordial with them, if somewhat eager to remove herself from the mountains of temptation that their presence and habit provided. The skinnier Claire got, the less Hannah noticed, because the bigger Dana seemed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna order pizza, do you want some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah.\" Dana rolled her eyes, \"Try to get that cute guy to deliver if you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anything, Hannah was doing Dana a favor. She was practically <i>born</i> to be fat. Claire was just trying to shove her into a skinny little hole where she didn't belong. Dana was much happier hanging out with Hannah. Obviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for every bite that Dana took, Hannah was right beside her. Chomp for chomp, Hannah could match Dana's speed and ferocity when it came to filling up an increasingly roomy gut. The fact of the matter was that Hannah was happy to have someone like Dana around\u2014it made it so much easier to eat carelessly. Greedily. Feverishly. And the more she twisted Dana's arm into accepting her lot in life as a Fat Girl, the more Hannah's self-appointed precedent for herself seemed to fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a strange, self-fulfilling prophecy of co-dependence, but at the end of the day, there was no denying it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire was so lustful of the food that she barely noticed and didn\u2019t even complain when Dana turned on her turn signal, the tick-tick-tick sounding as she turned right and followed the road\u2019s course to the parking lot. It was a task to find a parking spot, but they managed to find one. Some walking was involved, unfortunately for Dana. As they stood in the waiting lobby for their table for two, it finally hit Claire that they SHOULD have been at the gym already. By that time, however, the fat waitress directed them towards their table - Dana ensured they did not get a booth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ah, well,</i> thought Claire, <i>Guess I oughta enjoy it.</i> She ordered a diet coke and got up with Dana. \u201cOoh, they\u2019ve got the lobsters on special tonight!\u201d They went to the bar with the cooked lobster tails, sitting in a bin near great vats of butter and small, 4 ounce cups. The two blimps filled the butter cups to the brim and grabbed 2 lobster tails, mounds of crab legs from the nearby bucket of crab legs, and fried shrimp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a sublime time to be their taste buds. The buttery, juicy lobster sliding down their throats, especially Claire, who had long since tried to forgo such fatty fare. It was almost a sexual experience, precisely because she knew she shouldn\u2019t be doing this. It was so naughty, but so good. Her inhibitions had fled for the night and the two plowed into the food. \u201cSorry for this, but they had the buffet on discount tonight.\u201d Claire shook her head, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I wasn\u2019t stuck on going to the gym anyways.\u201d The first plate disappeared at a dizzying rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they ate, they conversed - \"Good to know that at least Jean isn't showing us up,\" quipped Dana. \"Yeah,\" said Claire, \"She's been getting pretty big lately too. So perfectly ironic, she was such a bitch to us over our weight and now she's packing it on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second plate came on - grilled scallops, fried fish, garlic parmesan potatoes, more butter, and even more crab legs. It was enough to make other people gawk, and it was a far thought that these blimps had intended to be at the gym right now. \u201cJesus,\u201d mumbled one man in the midst of the crowded, noisy dining room, \u201cDon\u2019t these fatasses have any shame?\u201d It was pretty clear that they didn\u2019t - their clothes were becoming packed to bursting, and Dana\u2019s shirt, already struggling, was starting to give up. She gave her shirt some more longevity by letting it ride up, her belly button on her massive gut being revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire had a brief pang of shame enter her head as she did the same - <i>Girl, you\u2019re supposed to be working out right now! What are you doing!?</i> She shushed the intrusive thought with a crab leg, cracking it and extracting it into the cup of butter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly one more plate separated the morbidly obese women from that most sacred part of a buffet meal - the dessert. Thankfully, these two had a MODICUM of awareness of their health conditions - only getting a slice of cake each. That was primarily because they had stuffed their guts to near bursting. After using her emergency insulin pen, Dana drove Claire home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time that Claire was dropped off at the apartment, her gut entered the room before she did, as it formerly had. Hannah was already asleep or in her room, but there was a calzone remaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy no sane standard should Claire have been hungry. But her gut saw food, and it demanded to be fed. Amazed by her own greed in the face of abandoning self-control, at least for one night, Claire tried to resist it - changing into her normal clothes - but she couldn\u2019t hold off forever. Before going to bed, she ate the calzone and two cannolis that had escaped Hannah\u2019s gaping maw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt THAT point, her gut shot painful bursts as she lay prostrate on her bed, so stuffed that she could not move. She could barely breathe, her stomach was so packed with food. She thought she could feel food coming back up, but she battled it back by swallowing her own saliva. She passed out in what she hoped was a food coma rather than a hypoglycemic one. So focused on eating she didn't manage to even close the door to her bedroom, Hannah, getting up for some water, saw Claire, passed out with a belly so taut and large that it almost looked like, in a day, Claire had gone back to 500 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while the gut had receded somewhat as she digested some food overnight, it became clear that a renewed friendship with Dana brought issues to the woman whose weight loss had gone so well up to now. But the loss had been a lonely one. As human beings are social creatures, they require companionship - and Claire became aware that she could fix her weight problems all she wanted, but it would just be a change of body shape if she ditched her friendships for weight loss. Even for the sake of her physical health, it would take a toll on her mental health to be so isolated again. The past fall had been SO hard, and she had felt SO alone as Hannah grew colder and more distant from what she perceived as Claire's preachiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cOh, yeah, it\u2019s so juicy,\u201d mumbled Claire through a mouthful of stromboli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buffet incident had been a good bonding experience with Dana - who now munched on a similar pizza-derived pastry, nodding through the grease and meat-filled goodness. \u201cI told you! It\u2019s just glorious.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were enjoying another lunch of indulgent, calorie-rich food. Claire\u2019s complacency had come shockingly fast compared to her attitude barely an hour before her visit to the crab buffet - figuring that it was a temporary break from her diet. Dana had figured the same - it was a reward for her good work! Granted, she had not even GONE to the gym and her diet was a failure - but she had tried! Wasn\u2019t that worth a reward?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reality, both of them were simply back at their old habits - and Claire was in a bit of a state. Subconsciously, she KNEW she was just back at her old habits of overeating, but she knew that to stay on her old course would mean returning to loneliness. No one texting her, no-one trying to find out how she\u2019s doing - eating was social for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumans being the social creatures they are, Claire and Dana bonded over what they subconsciously knew was a failing of their willpower. For Claire, she quietly recognized it as just another failed diet - granted, this one had been more successful, but it too joined the ranks of the diets past - her three-day attempt at Keto, her fleeting attempt at going vegan that didn\u2019t last a month. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, though, she wasn\u2019t CONSCIOUSLY glutting herself - it was more a fact of life, like breathing, walking, or working. She had consciously eaten far more than she was eating now during her brief stint as a feedee model. She was only just eating a snack.. And lunch\u2026 And sometimes a second lunch... And dinner\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention breakfast, which had been a pleasant surprise for Hannah. Claire thought more and more that she ought to get closer to Hannah again, and it was good for Hannah to talk with Claire, this time as a partner in poundage. \u201cMh. Yes, these croissantwiches are heavenly, Han.\u201d Hannah nodded, \u201cOh, yeah - not to mention the potatoes. This place makes good hash browns, and that\u2019s on this frappe,\u201d she stated, sipping her caramel coffee drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, old problems started returning. Her 4XL clothes she had bought a month ago were starting to get tight - an increasingly common problem at the office as Jean continued her fattening tendency and the tubby two, Dana and Claire returned to their bad habits. Claire\u2019s willpower to resist overeating melted into mild apathy - she started to realize she was putting the weight back on, but she scarcely cared. As a matter of fact, those extra lunches with Dana had started to build up in a big way - By the end of the week, she felt a good bit heavier than she did when she began the week. Each week passed this same way, at the end of each week she felt fatter and fatter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis carried on for a good two months of unchecked gluttony - Hannah even could notice how rapidly the weight was coming back onto Claire - and although she was just under Claire\u2019s size with her own unchecked gluttony, she had started to wonder whether or not Claire would just go on to drop all the weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, even Claire got suspicious as November began. She figured she would have to bump back up to 5X, but even those clothes which she thought would sustain her for her period of overeating were starting to tighten, revealing every fold of fat and riding up frequently to reveal the bottom of her constantly overstuffed belly. She began to worry whether or not she had carried it on too far. She pulled herself up from her bed - an increasingly hard task by the day over the past two months. She waddled, breathlessly, towards the bathroom to step on the dreaded scale - something she had grown to fear as she dove deeper into gluttony. She held her breath and stepped on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe number it announced made her choke for breath - \u201cFour Hundred and Fifty point Eight Zero Pounds.\u201d How could she have put on this much weight this fast? She was already nearly halfway back to where she had started! She now recognized herself - her re-expanded gut, her fattened thighs, her increasing breasts - she recognized, as if all at once - how fat she had let herself get. She thought of surrender entirely on the subject, of leaning into food over the holidays and glutting her grief into silence. Alternatively, her guilt combined with her desire to lose the weight and encouraged her to double down, to restrict herself from temptation. Part of her recognized that such a spartan diet would not be sustainable - but she had been too loose this past time, and had regained a lot of weight. She felt that to just go back on her previous diet would lead to another regression that would take her back to 500, though part of her worried that such a strict diet would lead her to gorge herself even harder when she got too far down.</span></div></div>",

Hannah gasped and then yelled, \u201cHey, speed up next time, maybe you\u2019ll hit us easier!\u201d Claire patted Hannah on her fattened shoulder, \u201cEase up, we made it.\u201d Hannah shook her head, \u201cSome people don\u2019t deserve licenses.\u201d They found their way to a front park - too far back and they wouldn\u2019t make it after the stuffing that awaited them. Waiting for them was a familiar brown-haired, obese figure - Claire waved with happiness and pulled herself out as fast as her obese form could be made to go - \u201cHey, bitch,\u201d she said in a friendly manner to Dana, who chuckled and replied, \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know that they made talking lard.\u201d The two hugged it out, with Claire fake-pounding on Dana\u2019s back. She turned to the side and introduced her, \u201cHannah, this is Dana, she works at the printing place with me.\u201d The two sized each other up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more evenly-balanced gainers, though Hannah\u2019s breasts were a bit larger than Dana\u2019s - giving Dana the appearance of having a larger belly, when hers was barely a few inches larger than Hannah\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana spoke up, \u201cOh, so you\u2019re Claire\u2019s roomie! Nice to meet you,\u201d and extended her hand to shake. Hannah took it - their fat fingers meeting in a friendly handshake, sending their bingo wings jiggling along with their fat forearms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio waddled with decreasing reserves of oxygen to the front desk, meeting the elderly asian woman behind the counter. \u201cHi! How many?\u201d she asked, met with the answer - \u201cThree,\u201d from the breathless Claire. She didn\u2019t need to ask if they wanted a booth - she knew these Americans wouldn\u2019t fit in one. \u201cFollow me to your table,\u201d she spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three waddled, already audibly taking in more breath to compensate for the comparatively short movement of their massive forms, eventually getting to a table a short walk away from the buffet. \u201cEnjoy,\u201d said the woman. In her mind, she couldn\u2019t help but think, God, these three are gonna eat me out of business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio sat and caught their breaths - taking a moment to breathe, a thinner hispanic waitress came up and spoke, \u201cHi. What do we want to drink today?\u201d Claire raised a finger and spoke, \u201cGet me a diet pepsi.\u201d Dana spoke, \u201cA regular pepsi,\u201d as did Hannah, \u201cRegular.\u201d As the waitress waddled away, Dana spoke, \u201cWhat\u2019s up? Back on the diet or something?\u201d Claire shook her head, \u201cNah, I just can\u2019t go back to regular pepsi. It tastes like it\u2019s got soap in it now.\u201d Hannah and Dana shook their heads, as if Claire were a whacko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio went up for their first trip to the buffet - grabbing any number of food items, piling the plates high as mountains. By the time they came back with their loads of food, they began doing a mixture of horking down the food like starving combat troops while occasionally getting their breath back. Inbetween, they occasionally talked - Hannah inquired,\u201cSo, what\u2019s Claire really like at work?\u201d Dana nodded, \u201cOh, she\u2019s nice. She does her work - mans the printer like a pro. I\u2019m usually the one who has to talk to customers, and she mans the snacks - passing some to me every so often when we\u2019re not eating.\u201d Claire slurped down her remaining chow mein, speaking up, \u201cYeah - I\u2019ve done desk duty sometimes, but Dana\u2019s way better at it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother plate, another session of eating ungodly amounts of food. Several trays were bone-dry, and a waiter turned to the kitchen, saying something in Mandarin in an annoyed tone of voice. A customer turned to them - then covertly eyed the tubby trio, then went back to his food. Shortly afterward, some hurried-looking chefs came out with more trays of food, refilling the tubs at the buffet, some eyeing the obese group of women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of women were ignorant of the gawkers as they were so wed to their food, the massive piles of it on their plates. They had already had two massive plates of food that would have filled any reasonable human being up, but these were women who were social eaters - gluttonous ones, at that. They continued their social eating for a third plate of food - this one mercifully smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women ate through this plate and, somehow, had room for dessert. They waddled breathlessly to the buffet for one last trip, their stomachs beginning to poke out of their shirts, their bellies nearly hanging openly, jiggling with each step as they went to grab cakes, cookies, and ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the three were done eating and were on their way out, thanking each other for the good time they\u2019d had out, the employees breathed a sigh of relief that they still had food to distribute to the rest of their customers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah was happy to have met Dana - a personable, friendly woman. Her only misgiving was that she talked too much for her liking. In contrast, Dana thought Hannah was a stone wall - wondering how Claire could be friends with such a quiet girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, the gorging went on - unrestrained, in fact, quite the opposite, Claire and Dana felt an impetus to live it up as much as they could over these holidays, to celebrate the end of their restrictions, no matter how mild compared to other diets, in case they had to get back on the wagon in January. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was far more, however, whether they\u2019d even be able to get onto the wagon, or whether it would crack under their weight. Every passing week the insane amounts of food they were taking in together mounted on their waists, their thighs, their arms, their breasts. They felt themselves getting considerably fatter every week - but it was the holidays, they didn't care, even though they were gaining somewhere close to 10 pounds a week with their vastly increased intake of almost literally endless cookies, pastries, thousands of calories in meals that started to merge into day-long, week-long, month-long eating contests. It would be a question of if they would EVER care enough to stop.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sometimes, when they were all out together, Claire would make jokes about \"what she had done\" by bringing Hannah and Dana together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as Claire had managed to fall in and of as far as her diets and attempts at losing weight were concerned, she had yet to truly give into her carnal desires in the same way that Dana and Hannah had. Over the course of the years that Claire had been struggling at getting into a more reasonable (or at least, less enormous) shape, both of her friends had slowly ballooned to unrecognizable proportions at around the same time. As Claire had shrank, they had grown. And it was because of them that Claire was growing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all made jokes about it, sometimes. That the two of them had saved Claire from \"another night eating salads\" or \"another night being sober\". More prominently, that they had saved her \"from being no fun\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot of jokes were thrown around at Claire's expense when the three of them got together. Little seedlings that ultimately wound up flowering into more and more excuses for her to eat, indulge, and grow. Tiny jabs that would resonate and bounce around in Claire's increasingly crowded mind until they came back out of her mouth as excuses as to why she should have that extra slice. Those extra pieces. All of that pizza. Another lunch. A \"cheat day\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Claire's doctors and counselors had tried to instill into her the fact that nobody could make Claire eat, and that nobody was responsible for her weight (gain or loss) other than herself, Hannah and Dana were twin demons weighing down Claire's shoulders. Keeping her face-down in food and denial. She may have gotten fat all by herself after high school, but Hannah and Dana had become such bad influences that they were leading her right back to it\u2014stroking her by the chins and tempting her with easy ways out of personal accountability and a good time. It wasn't deliberate, neither <i>actively</i> wanted Claire to relapse back to where she had been, but it was so much <i>easier</i> for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah and Dana were making Claire fat, at least as much as that was possible, by becoming worse and worse influences on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Claire had introduced them and more importantly, now that they had hit it off, Hannah and Dana were now becoming a united front against Claire bettering herself. Getting together every now and then with Claire, enabling her worst habits so that they didn't feel so bad about their own, egging her on into eating this and that so that they could indulge as well, they were two girls cut from the same stretchy sweatpants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T'frenship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T'FRANSHAP.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana tilted her head back, killing her fifteenth beer of the night. It settled nicely on top of the bottle of Whiskey that she'd drank. She knew that she'd be sick tomorrow, but she had already planned on calling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wht's<i>fatass</i>gonnado?\" Dana laughed raucously at her boss's expense, \"It'sthefuggin...y'know...Christmas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Hannah nodded sagely, \"Crismus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been in Claire's best interest to stay away tonight. Even as much as she'd given up on herself, she would have had some reservations about how much Hannah and Dana had ordered\u2014if not for the sake of any imaginary claim to diet, then for the sheer logistics and price. Gentle hillsides of pizza boxes, artilleries of sub sandwiches, and oceans of noodles from various Chinese places around the city had been called up to the apartment and promptly devoured by the two supine celebrators. They were in for a night of doing what they did best, and that was <i>eat</i>. With or without Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe might have been getting scolded by her parents for blowing back up again, but there was no denying that the skinny girl deep, deep inside of her would have felt tremendously defeated after an uphill battle like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claireduzzint\u2014\" Hannah belched monstrously, \"Claireduzzint know what she's missing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God I love Claire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" Hannah tittered, pouring herself another glass of whiskey, \"She's so <i>fun</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh I like her cuz...\" Dana struggled to lean even an inch out of her seat, \"...she makes me feel skinny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah guffawed, an ugly drunk laugh that she had picked up somewhere along her slide into who she had become today. Her full chest bounced with her fat cheeks as the rhythm spread to her bingo wings and belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah she's good for that.\" Hannah took too big of a gulp, \"Been makin' mee feel skinny f'r <i>years</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You? Skinny?\" Dana snorted, \"Assa riot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, stop.\" Hannah pouted drunkenly, \"I'm not as fat as Claire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Nobody's</i> as fat as Claire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True.\" Hannah admitted, a slow drunk smile spreading on her face, \"Hey... Dana.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we're, like, friends or whatever...\" Hannah lowered her voice, \"Can I tell you a secret?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuggin' <i>go for it</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like that Claire's stopped trying to lose weight.\" Hannah tittered, \"She's <i>way</i> more fun being a fatass than she ever was when she was dieting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl, fucking <i>same</i>!\" Dana announced triumphantly, \"She actually tried to get me to go to the <i>gym</i> with her! Can you believe that? God, I'm glad Fatass Fun Claire is back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fatass Fun Claire for the fuckin' <i>win</i>, D.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Another big win! God, Claire was back on a roll since she'd gotten back into gaming on the weekends. \"Fuck yeah!\" shouted Hannah, padding Claire's considerable, fat-covered upper back, sending a ripple that shook her under-arm fat rolls that profiled the fat balls that were her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire leaned back to dig her great, blubbery arms into a family-sized bag of potato chips - for her a normal snack-sized bag. Over the end of the holidays and into the remainder of the winter coming, Claire and Hannah virtually shared eating habits - fast food breakfasts, calorie-rich snacks, over-indulgent dinners. It was rarely better at work with Dana, who made second lunches a fact of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe insane calorie consumption contributed to a total relapse in habits - Claire relied on transportation to get anywhere, once again - though she was now not the only one reliant on seatbelt extenders as Hannah and Dana ferried her increasingly porcine form around. It would be a joke to tell anyone that a few months ago, she was dedicated to losing weight and being fairly successful at it. Now, her gut soared outward by the week as the two hauled her around not just to work but to buffets, fattening restaurants which struggled to even accomodate the ballooning woman - even single chairs now struggled to support her, frequently needing 2 chairs to support her increasing heft. She could barely walk as the two fed Claire until she barely noticed herself filling out her old clothes, her 4X clothes going down now to Dana and Hannah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean could barely notice her struggling to even get into work or fit into normal spaces over her own increasing heft, although mercifully, the hated wooden gate conveniently grew to accommodate Jean's increasing size - growing just enough to avoid the old humiliation of getting outright stuck between the posts, but not enough to avoid jabbing Claire's love handles with the metal lock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe printing office grew so amazingly sluggish as the workforce bloated up - poor Rick was in his final semester of high school, and he resented the lazy greed of the obese hogs that populated his office. \"Hey, uh, Claire,\" he spoke to the bloated blimp, who was pre-occupied with making love to a chocolate eclair. \"Clair,\" he impatiently re-stated. The human wad of fat turned towards him, jiggling from all angles. \"Hrmh?\" Rick gestured as he asked, \"Can you go get the print job? It's been there for a minute now, and I've got to handle the binding.\" Claire spoke, \"Uh, I'm taking a break right now.\" Dana pre-emptively spoke, \"Yeah - taking a break,\" to avoid Rick's attention turning to her. Rick sighed, \"Then get off your break and get the print job.\" Claire offendedly turned to him. \"Huughh.. Fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer obesity was almost impressive as she hefted her 500+ pound form up from her industrial-strength office chair. She already began panting as she waddled towards the printer room. Ten steps, twenty, all taken against her huge gut that was contained just so by her old clothing, a containment that grew unsteady with each passing day, each passing hour. Claire's vision grew blurred by sweat as she leaned over the printer, grabbing the warm printer paper and lumbering back over towards Rick with the paper. Her struggle against her own physical weight in attempting to move became a literal fight against her own form. She was practically gasping for air by the time she handed the paper to Rick, who snatched the job from her hands. He had already bound the job by the time he realized the mistake - the paper was dotted from header to footer by sweat, thicker than a cheetah's coat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe restrained himself - he was still but a teen worker and these people were somehow his superiors, although they had almost never done anything more stressful than walking around, which actually seemed like an increasing risk to Claire. The personification of obesity sat in her chair, rubbing at her chest and wheezing as she caught her breath from the taxing burden of walking barely forty steps. She looked to Rick to practically be on the edge of a heart attack just from a walk that should barely take anything out of anyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew he shouldn't give a damn anyways, it was a minimum-wage job he worked to pay for his phone bill and pay for his used car. He had done a good job since he started working here, and he had gotten more than one raise from Jean for practically being the whole office while the three fat women basically ate for a living. But it personally annoyed him that he had to haul these oinkers around on his back. It seemed to him that they were owed a karmic kick in their house-sized asses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire could not have been more oblivious as she was due for a girl's night out to a local steakhouse. Cue the usual waddle in, as Claire used a cane to support her immense weight. \"Ehhh, back in my day, we had canes made of saber-toothed tiger legs..\" wheezed Hannah, hunching her back for comedic effect, coiling her fat body into a bundle of fat rolls. Claire mumbled, \"Damn wh'ppersnapp'rs\" as she bumbled forward on her two trunk-like feet. It was fairly embarassing to have to use a cane at barely 28 years old, but her gluttony had reaped a hefty toll on her form, more than one could suspect. Indeed, more than being back at 500, she was dozens of pounds higher - though she hadn't stepped on a scale since October, some good 12 weeks ago now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio lumbered to their table, scraping their chairs back a good few inches - Claire practically had to drag hers a half-foot back, and her gut still scraped the table when she gasped for breath at her seat. \"Man, Claire,\" Dana spoke, \"that exercise regimen's been doing wonders for you.\" Claire put on a smile and flexed a flabby arm - her bingo wings draping from the bicep. Inside, she thought, <i>Yeah... some good it's done me, i'm the same fatass i just tried to stop being.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe menus came and at the top sat a proud, thick slab of meat - \"THE BIG MAMA! Finish this 72 ounce ribeye, fresh from Oklahoma, with the side of fries and the drink, and it's free!\" Dana spoke, \"Oooh, I think I found what you're getting, Claire.\" Claire shook her head, \"Nah - the 24 is just as good.\" Hannah shook her head and spoke, \"Ah, come on. I think I hear your tummy rumbling -\" she put her head down on top of Claire's pillow-like stomach. Genuinely comfortable, but Claire felt the intrusion of Hannah's head between a fat roll. She looked closer. That was a juicy - looking piece of meat, but she wasn't - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gurgle,</i> rumbled her stomach in reply. She sat, thinking. \"I don't even know if I can finish that, Han..\" Hannah spoke, \"Ah, come on, you can. I know my girl,\" she spoke, patting Claire's stomach. Claire's brain entered the same routine it did in recent months - the two putting mutual pressure on, the gluttony from the reawakened center of her brain that called for her to binge every hour.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, fuck it.\" The two gave a hearty, \"Yeahhh!\" The waitress came and asked, \"Soo, do we know what we're orderin'?\" Hannah and Dana offered up their request for the 24 ounce, but Claire spoke, \"Give me the Big Mama.\" The waitress raised an eyebrow. \"Ooooh. Do you, like, get how big it is? It's a pretty big steak.\" Hannah spoke up, \"And Claire's a <i>Big Mama.</i>\" Claire nodded and patted her gut. \"Yep. Bring her out.\" The waitress spoke up. \"Okay. You'll have to sign the agreement while we cook it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey wheeled the paper around - it was in part a waiver, waiving responsibility, in part, for \"deaths via unforeseen stomach rupture and those with pre-existing conditions, including but not limited to, Obesity, High Blood Pressure, Diabetes Mellitus..\" Claire shrugged and signed off, agreeing to pay $200 if she couldn't finish the steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteak was, in fact, an undersale of this monstrous hunk of meat. It lumbered out on a sizzling plate with a train of waitresses - \"Biiiig momma, getting her supper!\" they cried in unison, joined by several older patrons. Claire gawked at the food, but settled down. Her brain chanted to itself, I'm Claire Spittz, I've had three lunches back-to-back before. I can eat this.\" She hadn't eaten but one lunch today, and her stomach grumbled for it. She bit in - the steak was somewhere a tad below rare, and she tasted the blood from the meat. It made her feel like an immense, fat lion, consuming prey, and it made her stomach demand more. She scarfed through a few ounces, some fries, a drink, more steak, some more fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was rhythmic, almost hypnotizing for Hannah and Dana to watch the horking monstrosity that they had created. This super-morbidly-obese whale was going through ten ounces, twenty, thirty ounces of this steak. \"Ain't never seen nobody eat the Momma that fast,\" spoke one older patron, wearing his Vietnam Vet hat. His friend spoke, barely audible to those but Claire's table, \"Yeah, then again, ain't never seen nobody as big as that eating the Momma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore steak. More steak. The fries ran out. A refill of diet coke. More steak. Claire leaned back - there was barely 5 ounces left, but her gut felt like it was straining at every inch, every part, every parcel was screaming. She let out a monstrous burp as her heart raced from the intake of salt and meat. Her whole body was taxed by this olympic sport. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Claire Spittz went on and chewed, the last piece of steak dissappearing. She chewed, chewed, chewed. A chubby man stood above her, speaking, \"Open up,\" and she opened her maw. The man inspected - and the steak was gone. \"Momma ate,\" he declared, and was answered by a whooping rebel yell from the patrons, a rippling whoop that celebrated Claire's insatiable appetite. Claire was on the verge of passing out, fighting her eyes to stay awake as she kept a hand on her chest. Her heart jackhammered out at its ribcage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that happened, thankfully, was that Claire passed out from the food coma. She had to be hauled out by gurney, and the paramedics checked - she was fine, for now. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Another lazy day spent basically counting how many bags of pretzels she could shove into her mouth began for Claire at the printing office. Clients came in, Rick did most of the work while her and Dana chatted. Dana's eyes suddenly lighting up, she spoke. \"Ohh, Biiiitch. I have GOT to tell you about this - so, I swear, Saturday, I'm at Jessica's, right,\" she spoke. Claire looked intently, chuckling as she spoke, \"Here we go, all the best ones start with you being at Jessica's,\" knowing well the reputation of Jessica's Bar and Grill. She waited to see if the story would be as she expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah - and anyways, I'm a little sauced. Next thing I know, a dude in this denim jacket slides up and says,\" slipping into an overly smooth, false bass voice, \"Heyy, I'm Henry, I do accounting for the Parking Authority.\" Yep, it was one of those - and as expected, Dana recounted how the man proceeded to sweet-talk her into coming back home with him and having a one-night stand with him. \"Of course,\" Dana finished up, \"I was on bottom - no fucking way I'm doing anything but laying back and letting him do the work.\" Dana conveniently left out that she basically passed out towards the end as a result of her sheer exhaustion, even from doing nothing but letting the man harpoon her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And when we woke up, I swear, he looked at me like, \"Oh, my God, I just had sex with a whale.\" It was a brief humiliation - but Dana gave a good-humored chuckle. Claire gasped, \"Oh my god, that's awful.\" Dana shrugged, \"Eh. I get Hogged like, twice a month. I take it in stride.\" Claire marveled at Dana's self-confidence - her ability to take her massive gain in stride and still find a way to turn it to her sexual favor. \"You've got to teach me how,\" Claire spoke. Dana sipped a coffee as she munched a donut, speaking afterward, \"How to do what?\" \"How to get Hogged, or just how to act so sexy when you're so..big.\" Dana chuckled and took Claire by the shoulders, \"Oh, my young apprentice, you know not what you ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mentoring paused as some serious-looking figures suddenly appeared in Jean's office - two individuals in sleek button-ups and sport jackets, both male. They were speaking to Jean, who was seated at her desk - they couldn't tell what about, but Dana could only speculate - \"Oh, fuck, is that corporate?\" Claire shrugged, \"I don't fucking know, I've never been around for a corporate visit.\" The two got up from their chairs and did everything they could to look busy. All Rick could do was look smugly satisfied for a moment - the obese hogs were forced to struggle to their feet and sweat as they actually bound print jobs, served customers with breathless queries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something else under his satisfied, smug smile - something that Dana and Claire had not yet uncovered. It was, in fact, his call that summoned the corporate agents - hoping that, by his diligent work, he'd make management. If that could happen, he'd make these hogs pay - try to force them to actually work and stop spending their whole shifts eating. Or he could just fire them and be rid of the morbidly obese manatees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne agent left Jean's office and looked about. Dana and Claire turned to him, Claire speaking up, \"Hii, are you from corporate?\" The thin, pale-blonde man sized up the sizable elephants before him. The wall of flesh that stood in front of him was something out of Lovecraft's nightmares to him, a quivering, breathing wall of fatness that was something out of Dante's Third Circle of hell. He coolly repressed all but a slightly disgusted stare. \"Yeahh, I am. I'm Adam Cohen, nice to meet you.\" He stuck out his hand and the bundle of fat sausages that was Claire's arm took it, shaking it. Her palms were clammy and pumped with fat - her <i>hands themselves were fat.</i> It was no wonder that he had been called here to account for some unacceptable unproductivity. \"Would you mind coming to the back? Just have to talk to you guys.\" Dana spoke, \"Uh - mind if we take our chairs back there?\" He shot her an unforgiving glance, \"It'll just be a brief set of questions.\" The message was clear - <i>No, you can't, and your fat ass will have to stand for every question I ask you.</i> He led the two into the back, hearing their labored breathing at the hard task of walking a scant 15 steps to the chair-free backroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stood against the wall as Adam spoke to them, eyeing them in the harsh, buzzing light of the room. Claire was already struggling to stay standing, sweating a bit in her massive blouse that was beginning to get fairly tight, \"So - we've been auditing your regional offices, just making sure that things are up to standard - and we couldn't help but notice a big discrepancy in your output - we've handled those specifics with your manager, I've just come here to ask you a few more specific questions - for one, can you explain what is done with the snack surpluses?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana sweated and spoke - \"Uh - we dispose of them, as protocol says we should.\" Adam looked at her, with his pencil-thin eyebrows and his slightly sunken eyes that made her shiver in her fat skin. \"Ah. Disposal. Funny thing, that - the definition for disposal is that the item is first marked down, then after its expiration, it is entirely discarded.\" Until then, the blubbery duo hadn't remembered they were in front of the security computer - it wasn't on, or so they had thought - the monitor was just off, which the agent proceeded to turn on. The image they saw petrified them in its current context - footage of them 2 days after new years', taking snacks off of the \"marked down\" sections and putting them in their food stashes. \"This - shows that you have removed the food from the marked down section, and instead of discarding it, you have taken it for yourself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire trembled - partly from the exertion of standing, partly from the nerves the agent was hitting. Had she been stealing food? \"Uh - technically, it's going to be disposed of anyways - we just - \" Adam interrupted her with a voice brisk and cutting, \"-Disposed of it in a non-standard and unproductive way. It's also been noted that your office has spent more on expanding your service entrance, and funnily enough although you've been particularly lacking in food sales, more food.\" He stared deep into the two fat women's souls. Their sweat had become more rapid, their forms sank physically lower, accentuating their fat rolls and making them look more blob-like than before. Claire was beginning to pant from the exertion of standing still and upright. \"To be absolutely frank,\" continued Adam, \"your weight is beginning to become a productivity issue. You're wasting money on feeding yourselves. To make things worse, I've reviewed the footage and Rick has been the only reason any orders get processed at all. You have been negligent in your tasks and been using this office as a buffet.\" He put extra disgust into that final word - almost giving it the connotation of a feeding trough for the two pigs he stood addressing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your manager is being transferred and demoted. Jean will re-learn how to fill her role from a subordinate position. Rick is being promoted to Manager.\" They had a weekend to burn and prepare for the fresh hell that awaited them on Monday.</span></div></div>",

Inside, she felt a bit stung by the comment, but more and more, she began to simply accept it - she was a hog, at lest for now - she ought to enjoy her gluttony and her obesity, especially if she could leverage it to get some carnal pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, really though, what's step number one?\" Dana took a moment before she spoke, focusing on the turn onto the busy highway that led to their destination. \"Uh - step number one is to pick seats near some hot younger guys, like preferably college aged.

We're fat, we're not desperate.\" Claire didn't know about that - she was starting to get there, and she was confident she was getting home either shitfaced or with someone else, no in-between. \"Step two is to not just order drinks, but order food first. Let the hoggers KNOW that you're a big fatty who doesn't care that you're fat. Step three is to just wait. They'll come to you, you just haven't been to Jessica's.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey saw the titular bar as they pulled up - the conversation made the road blow by nice and quick. They pulled up to a nice and close parking spot and waddled past a pack of mid-aged women, smoking in the night air. They waddled forward, through the increasingly narrow door. Both women had to step in sideways - they were beginning to get too wide for these glass doors. They waddled up towards the bar as they made their strategic judgement. \"There looks good,\" said Claire, picking out a seat near some college-aged young men. \"Good choice, young pupil,\" sagely spoke Dana. They made their way to the two stools next to the men, Claire speaking a belabored \"Excuse me\" to the rectangular-headed young man next to her. The bartender, already swamped with orders, peeked to the two - Claire ordered, \"Yeah, can we get two orders of potato skins and two pints of Miller High Life?\" The mustachioed older man spoke, \"Gotchee', 'tater skins coming up in a bit. I'll get on y'r beers.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire could tell she had been successful when she noticed the man next to her looking at her - in that specific kind of way. His face was pointed at a license plate on the wall far to her left, but his pupils were on her, which she could just make out past the fat on her face. \"I love the apps here,\" the man said in a mid-high tone, \"These people know how to make some potato skins.\"  Claire turned to him and spoke, \"I haven't been here before, are they good?\" The young man curled his index finger into a circle with his thumb, sticking his fingers out to form the OK symbol, \"Oh, they're excellent. Go great with the beer. What's your name?\" Claire spoke up, \"Uh, Claire. You?\" He shook her hand, she felt his soft hands into which were a few lines, \"James,\" he spoke, \"But you can call me Curt.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire raised an eyebrow - \"Curt? Why Curt?\" The man leaned into some pre-prepared stance, leaning on the bar as he spoke in a cheesy, faux-gritty accent, \"It's the name of the first man I killed,\" as he made the kind of face that a Rambo poster would aspire to feature. Claire couldn't help but laugh - it was her kind of humor, she loved cheesy jokes that played off of those cliches. \"No, it's just my middle name,\" he explained more truthfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe potato skins arrived soon after, and Claire dove into hers, chasing them down with swigs of beer. \"So what do you do, Curt?\" Curt shrugged - \"I repair air conditioners. Didn't want to go through college, and it's a satisfying job.\" Claire raised an eyebrow, \"Mmm? Air conditioners? I never woulda thought, you've got really good skin.\" Curt smiled a big dumb grin, \"Thanks! I like to take care of my skin.\" His more round-faced friend leaned over, \"He's in touch with his feminine side. You guys should do some vinyasa together.\" Curt chuckled nervously, \"Yeah... yoga...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuicker than she'd expected, Claire began to finish her potato skins and her beer - As the bartender came around, Curt spoke up - \"Get her another round of potato skins and another beer.\" The bartender nodded. The round-faced friend turned to a more distant acquaintance, excited at something, and saying something that got drowned out as Claire spoke to Curt, \"Aw, Curt, you know how to treat a lady.\" He smiled and spoke, \"Keep 'em fed and give 'em beer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night seemed to sail by and another plate of potato skins and another beer later, Claire spoke - quite soberly enough, but enough to be convincing - \"You going home after this? I don't think I can drive.\" Curt nodded, \"Sure, I can take you back to your place, unless you wanna crash at mine.\"<br>\r\nClaire waddled breathlessly towards the man's grey sedan, shepherded by Curt's steady arm. In better light, she could see that he was built with a decent frame of muscle with some fat for insulation - a belly poked just so over his jeans. \"Mind helping me with my seatbelt? I have issues.\" Away from the prying ears of the crowd, Curt spoke - \"Oh, sure, no problem.\" She pulled herself into the seat, feeling crammed into the space - sliding her seat back, she began the task of trying to pull the seatbelt over her massive gut. She felt Curt's soft hands pull the tongue a bit harder - inching ever so close to the buckle. \"Hold on, this thing's got a neat trick,\" he said to the breathless and cramped woman as he pulled the red seat-buckle upward - it clicked and was even comfortable for Claire. \"Oh, that's a nice touch!\" Curt spoke smoothly, \"Yeah, if my woman doesn't need it pulled up at least one notch, she ain't worth my time.\" Claire took a breath and spoke, \"A-men!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire felt her pussy flare up - god, this man was hitting all the right buttons! He loved fat women, he had bought her food, and he was definitely interested. She figured she had a surefire ploy to excite him. As the car pulled into a parking spot, she rubbed her belly and groaned. \"Nnn... Too much beer..Oh... Can you help me up?\" Curt stood up and came to her side, tucking his arm past Claire's immense arm fat and around a ripple of fat below her underarm until her mid-back, which is all the man's arm could reach, with his tips barely able to make her left shoulderblade. Claire began pulling herself up, surprisingly easy with Curt's help, and they waddled together to the elevator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurt's apartment was an odd place. His kitchen was well-organized and clean, as was his bedroom, but his living room was an absolute mess. \"Sorry for the clutter,\" spoke Curt. Claire smiled and spoke, out of breath - \"It's...it's great. I think I need a place to lay down.\" Curt spoke, \"Oh, take the bed, I insist. Claire raised a brow - \"You sure it'll fit us?\" \"Oh,\" Curt replied, \"It's a queen, it'll fit us.\" True to his word, the bed was a queen-sized bed. It seemed to have enough room for Claire's 500 pound vastness and Curt, though he'd be an inch from the edge. He'd have little room for tossing and turning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a seat, I'll grab you a snack,\" spoke Curt. Claire sat down and waited - true to his word, Curt came in with a glass of soda and a few slices of cold pizza. \"This good for you?\" Claire nodded and spoke, \"Oh, yeah, this is great.\" She began eating as Curt spoke, \"I think it'd taste better if you took your top off.\" Claire had an idea - and a sexual desire she wanted to fill - \"My arms are just so tired and big - why don't you feed it to my fat ass while I take off more than just my top?\" The agreement had been made, and Claire filled her end of the bargain - exposing her fleshy torso outside of her tent-sized top-garment, covered now only by her bland-looking beige bra, all that would fit her considerable breasts. She laid back and let Curt shove pizza into her mouth. She bit off the tip, but more kept coming as she pulled off her pants. She got down to her  panties and barely managed to eat enough to stop the pizza from going all the way back into her throat. Next thing she'd known, she finished the slice in three bites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm,\" Claire moaned, \"more,\" as she took off her bra, exposing her breasts as she continued eating. She felt the sensual feeling of Curt rubbing her great, rolling gut that raced towards her knees, sighing sensually as she exposed her trimmed pussy, done just for this occasion. She heard Curt speak, \"I don't know, you want a hot dog with that?\" Claire nodded and she felt Curt slide inside her massive FUPA with his hard member. She was being overwhelmed by sensory arousal - she felt him rubbing her great, mammoth gut, which gave her an odd sense of arousal, the mild pleasure of cold but still good pizza going into her mouth at a rapid rate, and the wonder of Curt's cock penetrating her. She shuddered and shook her folds of fat as Curt entered her, feeling her heart race. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe enjoyed every moment of it - another slice of pizza was gone, Curt continued to push his cock in, draw it out - Curt channeled his sexual energy vocally, \"Eat it all up, piggy,\" the energy in his voice wavering as he focused on a three-front battle. Claire tried to muster the energy to speak, but she was being exhausted by both taking dick and eating, she panted a non-reply. She felt the most intense sexual energy, and shortly after, Curt withdrew and discharged his white, milky semen over her blubbery FUPA, and shortly after, she discharged. After a shower, she went to bed with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning after, Curt was already gone - but he had left a note. Claire picked it up and read it - it had Curt's number and a short sentence - \"Off to work. Thanks for last night.\" Afterward, she texted Dana - \"Dick appointment went good. Come pick me up.\" They had Rick to face.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire sat in Dana's car, gulping down lumps in her throat as she tried to calm her racing heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll handle whatever he's got to throw at us, Claire,\" Dana piped up, \"We've got each other's back.\" Claire sighed, \"I hope you're right, babe. Thank god for that guy Curt, without last night, I don't know if I'd be able to handle today.\" Dana spoke up, \"Oh, you'll have to tell me how it was after work.\" They had already gotten to the parking lot, and the sweet front-row parking spots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey waddled in and saw their first obstacle - the broadened gate had been replaced by the old one. Rick stood behind the desk with two bags, holding back a wicked grin. \"Come on through,\" he said, his voice dripping with mocking welcome. There was no way these 70+ inch waisted mammoths could actually walk through these 50 inch passes. Claire sighed and walked up front, trying to turn sideways. She sucked in her gut as best as she could, but only brought it in below 70 inches, somewhere in the 60's - and she felt the sides of her gut as well as a healthy fold of unhealthy cellulite-ridden backfat wedge into the wooden gate. She pulled herself through, keeping her gut sucked in - the middle required great exertion, and she barely managed to get through, gasping for breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick regarded the pathetic form of the whale in front of him, her gut heaving every second with exhaustion trying to pull air in to replenish her organs through crowded arteries. Dana had to do her bit now - thankfully having hefted the majority of the eating off onto Claire, though she had put on a fair amount of weight herself - she still struggled, sucking in her gut and still feeling it uncomfortably squeeze her as she waddled breathlessly and sideways through the gate. \"You'll have to be careful about that waist,\" said Rick, \"Too much larger and you won't even be able to come into work.\" He couldn't help but give a slight grin. \"Good morning to you too, Rick,\" said Claire. Rick spoke up, raising a finger in remembrance - \"Oh! By the way, your first task today will be taking these out back and disposing of them - these are your plundered snacks, and you'll have to properly dispose of them.\" Claire and Dana sighed, looking at their precious babies - the somewhat large-looking plastic bags held the salty snacks and sweet treats that had gotten Claire and Dana back to their places of grand obesity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire picked up one bag and Dana picked up the other. Rick watched, satisfied, as the two waddled off towards the supply bay and the dumpsters out back. His phone rang- damn it, he had hoped to oversee them and watch their overfed faces droop as they deposited their tools of sloth and gluttony. He paced into his office to answer the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Claire and Dana were panting, speaking to each other as they cast looks over their meaty shoulders, Dana inquired - \"Hey, Claire...You knowthat corner...next to the bay door?\" Claire wearily turned to her and nodded, sweating what looked like an ocean from her forehead from the brief walk from the top of the supply room to the mid-bay. Dana whispered - \"Cameras don't... look there, maybe we can have... a last little snack..\" Claire nodded and spoke wearily, almost unintelligbly - \"Gottarest...anyways...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two eventually came to rest on two stout metal boxes - and opened their bags while they panted, gasping for breath and holding their chests, trying to contain their overtaxed hearts as they opened bags of salty pretzels and mini-candy bars. They scarfed down the food at an alarming rate - hundreds of calories passed their lips int he matter of seconds - enjoying the last tastes of their mass quantities of food at work.  The last of the few fruit snacks Claire kept around dissappeared through her lips, the last of the mini-milky-ways, Dana's M&amp;M minis - dissappearing into obese and expanding throats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bags were half-empty. The two took a moment to breathe. They were so intensely breathing that they could not hear Rick approach from the top of the bay. Dana perked up for a moment, but she saw Claire eating - she whispered - \"Girl, we gotta move, I think I hear Rick,\" Claire urgently finished stuffing another bag of chips into her mouth before she put the refuse into the bag  and the two stood up, walking towards the dumpster. Rick eyed the two bovine forms waddling breathlessly out of a corner towards the bay door - he said nothing, as he had his suspicions. Though these two were immensely lazy and unfit- it wouldn't surprise him if it genuinely took them that long to get there and take a break. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost fortunately for the pair, they wiped their faces as they stood up and quickly got the bags in the trash - by the time Rick had rounded the corner, he saw them putting their snack bags in the trash. \"Good,\" he stated, \"now I don't want to see you snacking when there are customers waiting and jobs to do. And I definitely don't want to see you snacking on goods that are supposed to be in the dumpster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho-lee shit,\" said Claire as she buckled herself into her extender. \"Mm-hmm,\" spoke Dana, cranking the car - \"That was fuckin' close. I'm not going to be enthused about finding a new job...better to look now, 'cause that asshole's going to ... find a surefire way to fire us.\" Claire spoke, getting her breath back, \"Yeah.... I kinda wanna stick it to him... It <b>is</b> such a shame to waste perfectly good food.\" Dana giggled, and spoke - \"Claire, I love the way you think.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two elephantine women pulled to a close park at the familiar chinese buffet, \"God, stress makes me hungry,\" noted Claire as she hauled her massive form out of Dana's car. Dana herself had to pry herself out of the steering wheel and untangle her belly from the driving apparatus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough their soaring weight and increasing laziness had done nothing but create more problems, Claire and Dana could think of no better way to relieve stress than eat. It was the mechanism by which they became real friends - gluttony was the solution to their problems, so they thought. The usual stares from the employees and the customer base occurred as the two waddled their way to a table. \"Hey, Claire, Hey Dana,\" spoke the waitress. Dana replied, \"Hey, Sandy, mind getting us our -\" The waitress joined her to finish the sentence, \"Diet cokes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat women spoke as they got some fried rice. \"Jesus, I can't believe that RICK of all people is gonna be in charge of us,\" noted Claire, taking a breath after the statement. Dana nodded, \"Yeah - the kid's like 6 years younger than me, and now he's gonna be my boss? The hell?\" On to the fried scallops, the crab rangoon, the egg rolls, the chicken-on-a-stick. They piled their plates high with the contents of each plate, and a dissapointed preteen looked as the whale of a woman hoisted the last egg roll from the dish. He didn't even think of asking for it - he just mumbled to himself, \"Fucking fatasses,\" as the two women were ensconced in conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the table after a lengthy walk, and a moment of getting their breath back. The pair ate like women possessed, letting their stress be digested along with the egg rolls. The savory and intense flavors of the food shone through their mass production, and Claire enjoyed it deeply. As she got through her plate, she felt a pang of heartburn. <i>Damn,</i> she thought, <i>I thought I took my acid reflux pill today.</i> She ignored it - it was likely nothing, and there was food to eat - an important occasion. She continued on through her salt-laden and MSG-filled dish, enjoying and relishing every bite. \"What do you think he'll do on Monday,\" asked Dana. \"I'unno,\" said Claire, trying not to rub her chest in hopes ignoring the problem would make it go away, \"Probably throw away our snacks.\" The two continued eating as Dana groaned, \"God, I hope he doesn't mess with the gate. I can't get through the old one now, front or sideways.\" She looked concernedly at Claire, who rubbed at her chest. Claire, noticing, replied - \"Yeah - knowing him, he'll do that and use it as an excuse to fire us. We should just get looking for new jobs.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two pulled themselves up as Dana avoided asking Claire if she was okay - everyone had heartburn sometimes. Back to the buffet, Dana stood behind Claire, who moved a bit more sluggishly than normal. Claire felt a discomfort in her neck, rolling it as she slowly ambled towards the crab legs. The line had backed up considerably as she struggled to grab the tongs. Her right arm felt heavy and numb. She leaned in - why was her arm giving her trouble? She ignored a building pressure in her left arm - high blood pressure made these things happen. She began to pick up the tongs and tried to grab a crab leg when her heartburn returned, with a vengance. This time it was not just a burn, but it was accompanied by the feeling of her chest cramping up - like someone was balling the flesh into a fist somewhere behind her ribcage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis struck just as she was lifting the tongs with a crab leg back towards her plate. Her breathing quickened in the second beforehand. Just as an irate person in line spoke, \"Could ya hurry up, please-\" she fell backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer massive form smashed against the ground with great violence and her plate smashed against the carpet floor beneath her, the crab legs and noodles forming a messy pile on the floor. Dana looked to her, rushing as fast as her tubby legs would allow. Claire was clutching her chest and looking intensely at Dana. \"Claire! Girl, are you okay? Areyouokay,\" asked Dana, and Claire replied, \"My heart...My heart..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny dolt with a single functioning braincell could tell what was happening - \"CALL 911! CALL THE AMBULANCE!\" Things were getting fuzzy. Claire fought to stay awake - she felt death very close indeed. She couldn't think about her rampant gluttony, or the ignored dangers of her rapid return to obesity. All she could do was fight to stay awake, fight to try to survive. But the pain got worse, so bad. She wanted to pass out. She fought and her eyes went desperate. Her great neck fold was draped across her collarbone. She fought hard, hard for life, but the pain was becoming so bad. She couldn't fight it as darkness passed over her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Dana, seeing Claire shut her eyes as she clutched at her chest, her chest still struggling to pump air just as the paramedics arrived caused her to let out an involuntary shriek. \"HELP HERRR! HELP HERR!\" Oblivious to the shards of plate glass, the paramedic team approached the wad of human lard. As if programmed into their brains, the four-person team gathered around the heaviest concentrations of her weight - her torso and her thighs - heaving the great, fat woman aloft. The customers looked on, terrified as the 500+ pound woman was held aloft by four people whose arms struggled to carry the sheer mass of the mortally-endangered woman they were attempting to save. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally hefting the unresponsive, walrus-like form of Claire Spittz into the gurney, the team raced her down the handicap ramp and towards the waiting ambulance. The last that Dana saw of her at that moment was the ambulance driving away. Quickly paying her and Claire's bill, she rushed outside to her car and followed the ambulance. On the way, she picked up her phone and called Hannah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah was sitting at home, plugging away more numbers into a spreadsheet of other people's money when her phone rang. Seeing that it was Dana, she picked up. \"Yea?\" Dana urgently spoke, \"Hannah, ClaireandIwereatabuffetand-\" Hannah spoke, \"Slower, I can't understand you.\" Dana took a deep, sobbing breath and held herself back from screaming, speaking sharply into the phone, \"Claire had a heart attack.\" The ambulance turned into Herkowitz Memorial Hospital, as she spoke, \"They're taking her to Herkowitz Memorial.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDana couldn't think straight for really anything - she passed through a red light and damn near hit an oncoming car, parking in the lot just as the ambulance wheeled Claire out and into the emergency entrance. Dana tried to follow, but a security guard stopped her, \"Go to the lobby, check in there.\" Dana had to stop herself from shoving the man aside, \"That's my friend, that's my friend, you gotta - \" \"Look, I get it, but she's in good hands. Just go to the lobby, they'll let you know when you can see her.\" Hannah arrived shortly after Dana got into the lobby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened,\" asked Hannah. \"Claire and I were at the Chinese buffet.. she was going to get some crab legs when she just keeled over and started clutching her chest.\" The two sat as Dana and Hannah both felt their pulses race at a rate that scared them, especially in the context of what Claire had just experienced. <br>\r\nIt felt like a millennia had passed when the receptionist called. \"Ya' friend's at Room 138, Cardio ward.\" The duo walked in, through the sterile hallways, winding through the halls. Eventually they came to 138.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Claire was inside and breathing - with some assistance, some tubes in her nose, hooked up to an IV and an EKG which showed her still-high pulse.<br>\r\n\"Claire, oh, god, you're alive,\" Dana said softly. Claire blinked sluggishly. \"Barely,\" she eked out. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Life in the hospital room was so extremely dull, especially for Claire Spittz. The sterile white walls felt like they were sucking Claire's soul out, and had absolutely no character at all. Sure, on the wall over to the right was a painting of an alright-looking evergreen tree in winter, but it blended in too much with the white in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all gave Claire the grim impression that she was in the waiting room to Limbo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dullness wasn't helped by the disgustingly boring soap opera on the television. The same cliched, washboard-ab wielding man yelled at a statuesque blonde woman, \"Joan, how dare you do this to me!\" Of course, the volume was low. Claire WOULD change the channel, but two main things were holding her back from this. First, she was over 500 pounds and in a reclining position - pulling herself up would take more energy than she had. The second thing holding her down was the oxygen tubes in her nose, as well as the IVs hooked into her arms, pumping saline and a cocktail of medicine into her veins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the drugs, Claire felt eternally deprived of energy and sluggish after the previous day's heart attack. Eventually, a fresh-faced, bald, black doctor stepped into the room. \"Where's Doctor Akavian?\" The black man shook his head and spoke in a mid-ranged voice, \"Uh, Doctor Akavian doesn't work at this facility, and he's transferred your case file to me.\" The fact that her doctor dumped her only sunk Claire further back into her hospital bed. \"Oh,\" she spoke, as her eyes took on a resignation to the fact that Akavian now seemed to consider her a lost cause. The black man spoke again, \"I'm Doctor Riesling, and you must be Claire Spittz.\" Claire nodded, \"Yep. That's m'name.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiesling spoke dedicatedly, \"Well, Claire, obviously, you're alive, and your heart attack could have been far worse. Had you been alone and in a private place, you would have lost far more heart tissue.\" Claire puzzled and asked confusedly, \"Lost heart tissue?\" Riesling nodded and spoke expertly, \"See, when your arteries clog up and you have a heart attack, your heart's cells become more and more deprived of oxygen - when a cell runs out of oxygen, they wither up and die, leaving scar tissue - like a real bad gash that won't quite heal.\" Claire nodded, understanding better, as the doctor continued. \"You've only lost about five percent of your heart cells in this heart attack. Unfortunately, I've run out of good news with that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire frowned. It was clear where it was going from here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, picking up from your previous appointments - if you'll look here..\" He leaned in and showed her an ultrasound image. It was of a narrow tube outlined in gray, with about 40% of the passage taken up by an undefined mass that was distinct from the main walls. \"This is your artery,\" he said, pointing to the passageway on the paper,  as he then shifted to the mass - \"This is plaque, cholesterol that's built up in your arteries. We call this buildup Atherosclerosis - long story short, this is making it harder for blood to flow in.  This is what your previous doctor warned you about the last time you were this heavy, and now that you're back, it seems that you have it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image's context horrified Claire. This was an actual picture of her arteries - she wasn't being lectured by her mom on why she shouldn't have that second course of pasta, this was an honest-to-God picture of her arteries, which weren't too far away from being half-blocked by the fat she had been shoving into her mouth. Her shocked expression was noticed by her doctor, who spoke, \"And this is where I'm going to have to get kind of real for a second. The way you're eating - that buffet food, plus whatever else you've been eating - is going to kill you. If nothing changes, you'll have to buy a casket.\" He let the moment hang heavy in the air and reverberate into Claire's plaque-encrusted heart. He spoke again, \"Now, it's not unreversable. You've got some damage to your body, but there are ways to get back to good health. They involve some hard dieting, and a few rules: keep your salt intake low, drink more water instead of soda, and for the love of god, eat as little fried food as you can.\" Claire looked on at the doctor's grim but somewhat reassuring expression. \"Your hardships mean you qualify for a reduced-cost Weight Loss Surgery. We can look at this better later.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire finally mustered up the gumption to ask a question, \"When do I get out of here?\" Riesling spoke, \"In a few days. We have to keep a watch on you - heart attack patients are at high risk for another heart attack after their first one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a hell of a lot to digest. Doctor Riesling had basically just told her that if she didn't get back on the wagon, she was going to die a painful and agonizing death. She had a taste of that death at the buffet, and it was a damned terrifying thing - trying to breathe, losing control of her limbs, feeling her heart racing at such a horrifying pace. She had thought that it would explode, as it struggled to bring oxygen to her massive body. She felt death so close, so nearby - and it was so immensely painful, so horrifying. The morbid curiosity she had in that long-away time when she was a camgirl about how death-by-obesity felt was satisfied and it terrified her - it was a painful thing, and she felt, in part, some determination to avoid it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResisting it was that same classic sloth that she had developed by this point. It would take such a drastic reversal to get back to good health - she would effectively have to give up fried food, salty snacks, her favorite foods to survive. She knew how painful it would be to ignore the doctor's orders, but how psychologically doable was it for her to just give up on these foods, now that she had gone back to gorging on them? Was she just a lost cause?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that eating the way she was had been responsible for almost killing her, but did she have the willpower to save herself? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire entered work the next day, in an old beige blouse. It was an admission of temporary surrender to her weight, but she determined to strengthen in the days and months to come. Another struggle with the wooden gate, heaving her mass past the wooden obstacle with the usual disapproving stare of Jean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept up her work that day, but the constant siren call of the snacks came. <i>No. I'm going to be strong. I'm going to be strong.</i> She tried to focus in on her work, but it was so damned dull. Pick up that piece of paper. Occasionally talk to a disgusted-looking customer. She was worn down by it all. The stress built on her of the fact that she knew the tempting pieces of succulent caramel, of crinkly chips, of sweet chocolate, all so deadly for her, but all so good.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave up and found herself in the backroom. \"Oh, fuck it,\" she mumbled to herself. She felt as though she had no choice anymore. She couldn't stand it with all the candy all over the place, all the uneaten snack inventory. By the time Dana invited her to enjoy a spare bag of food, she couldn't even fight it anymore. She had given up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as such, her gains over that spring increased incrementally. Every month, Jean tutted at her. Almost as a taunt, she'd lecture her about her own recent weight loss, \"See, I put on like, 30 pounds over christmas. I was out of control. But I got back in control of myself. It's not christmas anymore, you need to care about your appearance and your health.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Claire's old, decently-fitting beige blouse became strained to the point of obscenity by the time May had come around. Her intake was frequently in excess of 5000 calories, with all of the salty, calorie-laden snacks and food that sat around the office, and the increasing amounts of take-out that she ate with Dana. Her gut billowed out and frequently took up the entire space between her knees and her chest, easily somewhere north of 530. She was in an eternal battle for breath, her breaths eternally shallow and any physical exertion requiring a gasp of air. She felt constantly sluggish, and her joints ached from the ever-increasing load put on them. At times, she felt her heart beating against the ribcage, as if seeking escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer beige blouse, mercifully lacking buttons, frequently rode up and exposed the bottom of her massive gut, leaking out of her ill-fitting shirt. At times, Jean would check this with a finger and give Claire a mean stare, with all of her creases returned. \"Another violation. Logbook. Now.\" Claire sighed and breathlessly waddled into Jean's office, towards the white binder labeled 'Disciplinary Log.' Jean stood behind Claire as she leaned on the desk, battling to get air into her overtaxed lungs from the tiny walk. She opened the log-book. Jean spoke sharply, \"Don't sweat on my logbook.\" Claire could hear Jean barely holding back, and she held her head just so slightly back to avoid sweating on the logbook. Jean leaned around Claire's mass, not asking her to move back. Claire felt the woman's head aggressively jutting into her gut as she wrote in the book. Her heart pounded harder than normal and she grew worried that the over-indulgence of the past 5 months would take their toll here and now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, she didn't feel anything else - but Jean finished writing her entry and rose up slightly, but her ear stopped at Claire's chest. She listened to Claire's heart beat wildly, barely restrained and fed by an inadequate supply of blood. \"Jesus, Claire, all this from a little walk?\" Her head drew away, staring at Claire with an expression of shock and disgust. \"And you still don't stop eating like a whale. Christ almighty.\" Claire weakly tried to hold back tears, and her eyes watered, but she scribbled her name in the entry for \"Employee Signature.\" Jean spoke, \"Now, this is your first formal warning. If you come to work and you have another little issue with the gate, or if you come here too obese for your clothes, or if you break one of my chairs, you're getting a pay dock to bare minimum. One more after that, and you're out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire came away from work each day more worn down by even Jean's passive aggression, let alone outright unacceptable comments like she had issued in that sit-down. That day in particular, she came home to the apartment in tears. Hannah herself had slowed her gains, but still continued upward on the scale, with a belly larger by a small degree, compared to Claire's exploding form.  Hannah got up, taking a breath as she did so, and did what she could to get her arms around Claire. \"Oh, baby, baby, what's wrong?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire pulled herself down to the couch, which creaked an insult at her. \"Jean.. She...\" Claire gasped for breath, taking a moment to let her tears out. \"She... Called me a whale...She said....\" Another pause. Hannah rested her head on Claire's immense gut, a comfortable shelf of adipose. \"She said... If I have more issues...with my weight...at work...I'm gonna get docked, and then I'mgonnabefired...\"She took a gasp and wailed her sorrow out. Hannah shook her head, \"Fuck her. She had no right to say that to you, that's SO fucked.\" Claire sobbed into Hannah, soaking Hannah's already-tight teal blouse, \"I can't lose weight... I've tried, but I can't do it... I'm a weak, fat, piece of shit, and I should just lay down until....\" Hannah hugged Claire as tight as she could manage through what felt like an ocean of fat, she could barely feel Claire's bones through the sheets of fat. \"Sshshhhhh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, the two comisserated further over beer and pizza, planning how to help Claire. Claire was at least somewhat reprieved by Hannah's comfort. It would be needed, because Ms. Spittz would face more problems ahead.</span></div></div>",

Numerous other containers littered the area around the bloated redhead, but she only cared for the webcam before her. She teasingly fluttered her eyelashes at the little camera, slowly licking her plump lips, but still missing much of the ice cream smeared around her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathlessly, she whispered \u201cThat will do it for this time; I hope it was as much fun for you as it was for me. And if you like, you can send in a suggestion for next week\u2019s video, and who knows, maybe your idea will be the one featured. Bye\u2026\u201d she finished as she leaned forward \u2013 giving a wonderful view of the canyon of cleavage \u2013 waving her fingers at the camera, before killing the recording.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Sarah slumped back into her chair, the unfortunate piece of furniture groaning heavily under the load resting atop it. She had just finished eating numerous gallons of ice cream in one sitting, at the request of one of her paying fans, as was usual for a weekly series she put out in addition to photos and the like. She regularly ate loads of ice cream like that, but not usually after having as large a breakfast or lunch as she did today. Her tongue continued to unconsciously dart out, licking at the gobs of ice cream as they melted around her mouth, but could reach most of it. She knew that she would have to clean up soon, but the cold weight settling into her gut was making her want to stay still for now. As she rested, drumming her fingers on her stomach, she looked down at the screen on the computer in front of her and saw the view that visitors to her site would view on this video: a deliciously fat young woman, who was only getting fatter with each passing day. Her breasts were packed into a lacy bra, several sizes too small, causing tit-flesh to pour our around the straining cups. These heavy udders rested atop the temple of gluttony that her stomach was; a huge fleshy sphere, the soft blubbery layer stretched a bit tight because of all of the food packed within. Out of view of the camera, her thighs were just as fat, flesh oozing out over the edges of even this extra wide seat, with a large ass that swallowed the stressed panties that was nearly hidden amongst the fatty rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a pretty good show, ya whale. Need anything else; a seven course meal for example?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked back over her shoulder at the speaker, before answering.</span></div></div>",

Having met in freshman year they now were living together in a student apartment. A large part of Sarah's enormous growth over the past two years was due to Derek's aggressive enabling of Sarah's natural gluttonous instincts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStifling a belch, Sarah saw Derek carrying what seemed like a pretty heavy bag of fast food from her favorite venue, Wendys. \"Mmm. Yeah baby you know I would,\" Sarah cooed breathily, her hands roving across her bloated gut. \"But I don't know if this little belly here can handle much more.\" She gentle jiggled some of her vast ocean of blubber. \"look at all the gallons of ice cream I gorged my piggy face with...and that's not including the huge meals you stuffed into my poor stomach...\" Sarah moaned at remembering the piles of food she had obediently been fed by Derek. Breakfast had merged into lunch and he had only stopped when it was time for her to film for her site. \"Look at me, baby, I'm so swollen and bloated I'm outgrowing my new...ompfhhh!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's lustful monologue and playful protests were cut short by Derek shoving an extra greasy triple cheeseburger into her mouth. \"I don't think you understand, sweet little Sarah. I wasn't exactly asking you. I was telling you what your overstuffed stomach is going to have to handle next. You know you want it, don't you, piggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's eyes went wide with shock and lust as she passively allowed Derek to push the rest of the burger into her maw, thanking her genetics that she possessed a roomy mouth. Stuffed as she was, she could only let out a high pitched squeak of approval and nod her head. She hugged as much of her giant bulging belly as she could reach and swallowed heavily. \"*pant*. Yes, sir. I want it all. I'll handle however much you choose to feed me, sir. I can't help it. I want everything.\" She put on innocent puppy-dog eyes, leaned further back in her groaning office chair, sticking out her giant belly out further for Derek's pleasure and offering her wrists to be cuffed. \"I'm all yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right you are,\" Derek shot back, grinning wickedly and binding Sarah with a pair of handcuffs, while cramming another giant burger into her mouth. \"Look at you, you giant glutton. Here you are, stuffed to the gills and you'll still eat whatever I give you.\" Another burger. \"Look at this giant tub of lard,\" he said in a mock-scornful voice as he grabbed Sarah's gelatinous sack of a belly and shook it roughly, eliciting a moan from Sarah and more creaks from her office chair. \"It's running away with you, but little piggy Sarah knows she can't stop eating.\" He let go with a pant and let it slosh back to pouring over Sarah's knees. \"I even work out every day and it's hard to keep up with this growing mountain of gut. You're going to become just a mountain of glutted blubber, is that what you want? Is that your highest goal in life?\" Sarah's eyes widened further at the thought, and she nodded dumbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek shook his head, \"what an embarassment.\" He fished through the Wendy's bag, but came up empty. It was his eyes' turn to widen as he looked at his massive girlfriend and her visibly even more swollen belly. \"Oh we're not done yet, my little glutton. You look like you have plenty of room.<br>\r\nSarah only hiccuped a little woozily as Derek stalked off and returned with more bags. Despite herself, she licked her lips...<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\nAfter another hour or so, Derek finally decided to relent. Uncuffing his girlfriend, he kissed her deeply and petted her dark red hair. \"You did wonderfully, sweetheart. I think this was our best record.\" He then began to clean up the bedroom, which by now was absolutely littered with detritus from the day's indulgences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah limply placed her hands on top of the mammoth swell of her exploding belly and groaned in overglutted haze. From what she felt cramming her gorged stomach, Derek had to be right. Letting loose a loud hiccup, she nonetheless gave her incredibly bloated gut a few gentle, proud pats, pleased that a literal mountain of rich trash food was currently quietly bubbling inside her, only to rapidly become more soft blubber and more inches on her already overloaded frame. Her eyes fluttered as her body struggled to deal with the effects of such a stupendous force-feeding and she was panting like she had ran a mile, her whole massive body jiggling with each massive, gluttonous hiccup. <i>How much did I eat today? It literally is a mountain of food, all stuffed away here. Derek's right. I really am just a giant pig!</i> Sarah thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer musings were interrupted by Derek rushing in, \"C'mon Sarah, there's only a half hour before your shift at the Caf. Gotta get that gut into gear.\"<br>\r\n\"HYIC! Whu-what?\" Sarah asked, slightly slurring her words.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek laughed, \"You forgot again, silly. Always thinking with your stomach. C'mon. Let's get you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Derek...I don't know...HYIC! I'm seriouslyyy glutted right now...HIC HIC...I don't know if I can even think straight with all this junk in my stomach...HIC!\" She whined desperately and gently jiggled so Derek could hear all her day's feasting churn turgidly, both wincing and getting turned on at the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, well that sounds like a \"Sarah\" problem, doesn't it? Shouldn't have been such a pig, huh?\" He kissed her cheek. \"Come on, it's not that bad. You basically just sit on your big beautiful ass and ring people in for 3 hours. I'm sure even you could do that, overglutted as you are. Without further ado, he began the process of hoisting his 650+ pound girlfriend up from her seat and, putting her in a pair of tight black leggings and a black t-shirt that left a good two inches of her swollen gut around her bellybutton for all the world to see, sent her moaning and staggering off to her job, hands clutching her wildly churning stomach.</span></div></div>",

Stumbling forward, trying to balance the huge front-loaded weight of her superstuffed stomach, Sarah made her hiccupping, panting way through the front doors. The rest of the students arriving for the evening dinner rush conscientiously parted ways to let the enormous employee stagger to her specially designed seat at the cashier station. Gratefully crashing onto her chair, Sarah let out a long groan, \"ughhhhhhh shiiit...HYIC\", both hands desperately holding whatever she could of her gigantically bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, girl. You look riiiipe...\" her partner Rosita observed, one eyebrow cocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shuut...HIC...shuut up...Ooooo...Get me...a drink...now...HYIC...ughh gunna 'splode...*glurp*\" Sarah panted, completely winded and struggling to keep every bit of garbage food in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWordlessly, Rosita got up and ran into the Cafeteria serving area as Sarah dazedly began swiping students in with practiced habit. Her \"rapid\" movement so soon after a great gorge had destabilized all the sludge in her gut. She desperately needed something to calm the storm. <br>\r\nMeanwhile Rosita was speeding back with a huge glass of ginger ale. She was used to Sarah's swollenness, but this extremity was more of a rarity. Arriving, she handed the glass to Sarah and shook her head, \"man. What did ya do to yourself. Looks like Derek dumped the entire local Wendys inta there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah didn\u2019t immediately answer. She had desperately grabbed the glass of ginger ale and was furiously chugging it down with practiced skill. Finishing rapidly, she blew out a long silent belch from the carbonation, and gently patted the sides of her vastly engorged gut. Still panting, she felt the liquid percolate down through the mountain of junk, and breathed a sigh of relief. Everything in there seemed to be calming down, but the huge amount of soft drink didn\u2019t do any favors for her bloated appearance, her skin-tight black shirt having retreated another two inches, baring even more of her oceanic belly to the world. Not that the confident redhead minded one bit. If she was being honest with herself, she\u2019d show more of her unbelievably fat body off if she thought she could get away with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing through a hiccup, Sarah lightly patted the top of her churning gut with faint pride. \u201cHYIC! Mhm you\u2019re not far off, Ros. There\u2019s def a lot glutted into this gut\u2026HYIC\u2026\u2019specially since I also did a stuffin\u2019 show earlier today *uuUURRP*\u201d Sarah chuckled softly, remembering the gallons of ice cream again. \u201cPhew that was a close\u2026.*glurp* call though. Thanks\u2026HIC! You\u2019re a lifesaver.\u201d Reclining a bit more in her chair to give her heaving stomach more room to churn her gluttony, her seemingly endless sack of a gut still spilled gelatinously over her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosita snorted. She had known about Sarah\u2019s kink and \u201cside job\u201d for a while now. A thick-set girl herself with big thighs and a juicy potbelly, she looked overwhelmingly tiny compared to Sarah. The same thing corresponded with their appetites. Rosita was a hungry girl who enjoyed her food, and plenty of it, but the mountains that Sarah could glut into her stomach boggled her mind. At the same time, Rosita sometimes took a perverse delight in observing just how much Sarah could handle, and egging her on to greater heights of indulgence, far beyond what was safe for the structural integrity of her bubbling stomach. There didn\u2019t seem to be any harm, Rosita reasoned, since Sarah was into the whole thing anyway. Staring at the gargantuan mass, Rosita whistled: \u201cshiiiit, and you\u2019re still conscious? I\u2019m surprised you made it at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHYIC! Yeah I\u2019m good.\u201d Feeling smug, Sarah grabbed two relatively tiny handfuls of her blubber and gave her gut a light jiggle, jostling her glut around and knocking a larger hiccup loose: \u201c*blurbleHELP!! Ooof! I\u2019ve been able to stuff a lot more into myself lately\u2026HYELP!\u201d She covered her mouth after the last loud hiccup and giggled. \u201cHeheheheHIC but Derek demanded I drag my fat ass here *gurgle*\u201d Sarah moaned: \u201cI think the jerk likes seeing me struggle with all this woman...HIC!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatEVER are you gonna do with yourself,\u201d Rosita snarked sarcastically.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah belched nonchalantly: \u201cURP...keep on overeating. Keep on getting fatter. *HYIC* Growing this gut.\u201d She affectionately rubbed as much of the massive churning sphere that she could. \u201c*glurble* Keep tryna find trashier *HIC!* and junkier foods *URP* to glut inta my stomach.\u201d She scratched her chin. \u201cIn fact if it weren\u2019t for Derek *HIC* I\u2019d probably just laze around the room...*ELP*...digesting all day\u2019s eatings...prolly have an lil\u2019 snack...*glorpHICC*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA SNACK? Yah right. Weren\u2019t you the fat girl who stumbled in her just about to pop?\u201d Rosita cocked her head and put her hands on her fleshy hips. She knew when Sarah meant a \u201csnack\u201d it probably was enough for a full meal for two people. \u201cBesides, girl lookat yourself! Ya don\u2019t think MAYYYYBE you\u2019re big enough? You\u2019re easily the fattest chick on campus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuh. There\u2019s always room in this belly for a snack or two...*HYIC*...or more...\u201d Sarah responded greedily, \u201cThat was then *ELP*...this is now.\u201d She lightly squeezed the turgid flanks of her gut and patted: \u201c*glurbleHYIC* My stomach can handle it. *ELP* It recovers quickly. *blorp*\u201d Despite her desperately full state, Sarah couldn\u2019t help but instinctively lick her lips at the trays and plates that her fellow students were shuttling around to the tables outside the serving areas. \u201cB\u2019sides Ros, ya know what I *HYIC* do.

Stretching her arms as far as she could reach, the tips of her fingers only made it half way down her gut, just to here her shirt had rolled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosita\u2019s eyes gleamed. This was too good an opportunity to let go \u201cSo whaddya waiting for, chubby?\u201d She patted a part of Sarah\u2019s bulging blubbery belly. \u201cGo for it. I\u2019ll cover for ya. I hear Lou is makin\u2019 his fried chicken tonight. Maybe he can hook ya up with somethin\u2019 special.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah abruptly looked up from semi-recline, straining to see Rosita over the mountain of her gut, the junky sludge within unpleasantly shifting with the effort \u201c*glurbleblorp*HYIC! Ya...ya mean that, Ros?\u201d Sarah already began to drool at the thought of Lou\u2019s cooking.

This is gonna be RICH...HYIC!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rosita watched with anticipation. What kind of state would the massive redhead gorge herself into this time?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The lure of the servery proved overpowering, and Sarah just began straight out gorging herself from station to station. Taking a large plate, she filled and refilled it with all kinds of goodies, greedily cramming her mouth with piles of fried chicken, bacon-wrapped hot-dogs, stacks of deep-dish pizza with veritable pools of grease, piles of cheesey mashed potatoes and great gobs of gooey mac \u2018n\u2019 cheese. \u201cMmmmmfff yesh *HYICC* thatsh *gulp* the schtuff...*blorpELP!\u201d Sarah mumbled to herself through a stuffed mouth \u201c*glorp* thish wash *gulp* the besht *chompURP* idea EVER *HYICC*...*gulp* sho much eatingg...ELP!\u201d. She clearly felt her gorged stomach struggle with the new input of this overly rich and heavy glut, but Sarah couldn\u2019t care less. She was a glutton and her stomach would handle it no matter what else was in there. She was in the throes of greed, and nothing else mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaggering forward, the massive front-loaded weight of her glutted gut making walking difficult, Sarah was steadily eating her way toward the desserts when a insanely greedy thought hit her. Giggling through her hiccups, she took a particularly wide piece of fried chicken and began piling it high with layers of burger patties, bacon, cheese mashed potatoes, bacon bits, thick slices of cheese, trios of hotdogs cut down the middle, french fries, potato chips, slathering each layer with mayo and ranch dressing, and finally pressing another large piece of fried chicken on top for an insanely fattening version of the double-down. Opening her large mouth and pushing as much of her creation in as possible, she bit down and involuntarily shuddered at the explosion of fried, greasy, savory, fatty flavors. \u201cMmmmmffff....oh yesshhhh...HYICCC.\u201d Marveling at the flavor of her own ingenuity, Sarah busily stuffed both hands into her mouth, forcing the massive monstrosity down her throat at breakneck speed, triggering an even richer hiccup, even as she rapidly made another: \u201cHYELP!! Oooof! Oh mann that was TOO good...*glorpHIC* Imma name that...Sarah\u2019s Special...HYELP!!\u201d Three more massive piles of glutty goodness were summarily slapped together and gorged into Sarah\u2019s miserable stomach. Hiccupping richly and happily, Sarah wandered to get a drink, arms wide out to balance  her stupendous gut when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHYEELP!...ooo....*glurble*...Lasagna...*URPHYELP*...this is RICH...HYELP!\u201d Sarah stopped suddenly in front of a huge pan of meaty, cheesy lasagna with only one or two slabs cut from it by other students, the mass of indigested sludge sloshing within her at the abrupt stop, her blubber jiggling across her body in slow, lazy waves. Visibly licking her lips, Sarah parked her massive body in front of the station and shoveled huge slab after huge slab of the rich pasta dish into her maw, moaning at the flavor and her own gluttony. Each heavy swallow slammed into her swollen stomach with a sickening *GLOPSQUELCH* and Sarah swore she could feel her massive gut bloat larger and larger with each huge slab...until it was all gone. Releasing an even richer hiccup, Sarah daintily placed both hands on top of her monstrous belly and gave it some light, smug pats. <i>God I\u2019m such a pig. That Lasagna alone coulda fed a buncha people but now it\u2019s allll here bubblin\u2019 in m\u2019stomach.</i> Hiccupping again, she wheeled around to continue her glutting only to see a line of nervous, but disappointed freshmen. The massive junior was not only tall, but enormously fat and by the boiling digestion of her stomach, seemed to be one bite from exploding. Sarah thought fast, \u201cuhhhhHYELLLP! Y\u2019guys didn\u2019t want that one...burbbleHELP!! It was startin\u2019 ta get an bit ripe...HICELP!!\u201d She lightly jiggled the top of her gut \u201c*glurbleglop* Best you let me \u2018n\u2019 m\u2019stomHYIC...HYELPglop! Handle it for ya....*burbleblorp*\u201d The freshmen seemed transfixed by the quaking ocean of her blubber and the churning of her gluttony to say anything and shuffled off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know for a fact that dish right there wasn\u2019t cold. You was just hungry, Sarah sweetie.\u201d Sarah whipped her head around to see Lou leaning on top of the sneeze-guard, ladle lazily twirling in his other hand, a knowing smile gracing his visage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned: \u201cHYELP! Well of COURSE I was...HIC! Can\u2019t let all this waste away!...*blurbleHELP!\u201d Sarah grabbed handfuls of her gargantuan gut and struck a cute pose, the overfed girl sticking her monstrous belly out even further. Sauntering over to the counter, Sarah batted her big blue eyes, her giant gorged gut piling against and over the lower guard with a sludgy *glorbleblurp* in a tidal wave of swollen blubber. \u201cHYELP!! Sooooo whatcha got for your...HELP...faaaaavorite customer...HYIC!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I dunno, hun. Ya look like y\u2019already had a few dinners.\u201d Lou gestured to Sarah\u2019s mammoth belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah huffed. \u201cHmpf. Why\u2019s everyone...HYELP...sayin\u2019 that.\u201d She crossed her arms over her prodigious bosom. \u201c*glurbleglop* Listen....HELP! Let ME worry \u2018bout my stummick...HYELP*glorp*...and YOU worry \u2018bout feedin\u2019 it...HYELP!\u201d She smugly spread her hands indulgently over the superswollen top shelf. \u201c*blurbleHYELP! This baby can handle a whole LOT *glurbleglop* more junk...HICELP!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLou pondered for a moment. \u201cHmm. Well I can\u2019t have ya blundering through the servery stuffin ya face with anything in sight. I got a whole school ta feed, not just ya stomach.\u201d He scratched his chin. \u201cI do have some leftovers from the past few days. Was gonna throw them out. Might be a bit ripe but if ya deep fry \u2018em a couple times I\u2019m sure it\u2019s safe. No one\u2019ll miss \u2018em either.\u201d He peered at the gargantuan girl through thick eyebrows, \u201cwhaddya say, hun? That enough \u2018junk\u2019 for ya?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHYELP! Ummmm...*glorp* YES PLEASE?!?!?\u201d Sarah\u2019s eyes had been glazed over and saliva had been forming on her greedy lips at Lou\u2019s description. She didn\u2019t think she could have found trashier and more disgustingly fattening food if she tried. \u201cHYELP! Don\u2019 tell me any more! *glurbleglorp* I\u2019ll have it all...URP! Gimme everythin\u2019...*blurbleHELP!\u201d As she heavily waddled behind the servery, she gently patted her boiling gut Oh man this is gonna be RICHH!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As much as her mouth was tired to the extend that speaking was difficult, this was nothing compared to the punishment and abuse she had given her poor stomach. Recklessly overeating many times over, she had dumped piles and piles of food of questionable quality into an gut that was already supremely struggling with other massive overstuffings earlier that very day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was feeling the full unbridled consequences of her insane reckless gluttony, the giganticaly bloated sack of churning blubber turgidly boiling and bubbling sludgily as the vast sea of semidigesting richness struggled to remain within its prison whose walls were stretched nigh to bursting. Her breath came in brief ragged gasps punctuated by violently indulgent hiccups that Sarah made no attempt to control or stifle. Despite feeling like one jostle from exploding, Sarah was still very much enjoying feeling her massive mountains of rich glutty, greasy sludge churn and boil within the overflowing vat of her squelching overworked stomach and between uncontrollable woozy hiccups, was moaning in appreciation of her incredible meals and the anticipation of even more piles of blubber mounding onto her mountainous belly. Her eyes were fluttering shut from her body\u2019s effort at handling the sheer enormity of her feast, and she was leaning heavily against the foot of the bed, a dopey slack-jawed smile on her face, her arms uselessly flopped on either side of her. \u201cWhutta gluttttt...*blurblegroanHYELLLLP!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLou said she even drained the ice cream machine. Girl is seriously an force of nature.\u201d Rosita snarked, giving the catatonic glutton\u2019s overglutted gut a slight poke, eye widening in reaction to how much jiggly soft blubber was there, even as stupidly swollen as Sarah was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDuhhhhh...HYICCELP! *glurbleGLOP*...gotta havveeee dessertttt...HYEEELP*bubblegroan*\u201d Sarah huskily chuckled, interrupted by a vast hiccup... \u201cHYEELPHELP!!

I figured you\u2019d like all the crappy free food you could possibly want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah slightly perked up at the mention of food, and strained and struggled to lift her head a bit higher to peer curiously at her work buddy over the mountain of her gut through unfocused eyes. Her miserable stomach began renewed churning and sludgy bubbling with the straining effort, which caused Sarah to smugly place steadying hands on the giant vat of her belly. Rosita\u2019s plump frame hazily came into view just over her gargantuan gut. \u201cHYICELLP! Ya...ya *grooanglurbleGLOP*rrrreally mean thattt? *glorpGROANHELP!*\u201d Rosita nodded in the affirmative.  Sarah\u2019s mind whirred with excitement despite her deadening food daze. Licking her lips, she vividly envisioned the mountains of glutting she would have day after day after day. Another neverending source of trash to stuff on top of her already massive meals! Such free feasting and stuffing would swell her stomach to gargantuan proportions!  After a few moments, Sarah hiccupped massively, and greedily patted the expansive upper shelf of her gut, settling back down into her prone position with a groaning glurgle: \u201c\u201c*blorpHYELLPPP! HIC! HIC! hurrray f\u2019r *glurbleHELP* m\u2019stummickkkk!

Accept Lou\u2019s offer and this is your fate every day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nodded woozily: \u201cHYELLLP*glurbleGLOP* I shurreee hopee soooo...HICELP...HELP*bubblegroanSLOSH*... \u2018M ALWAYS ready ta GL-*GLORPHYELPGLOP*Gluttt m\u2019selffff..HYELP!

Even I can\u2019t believe how much you shoved into this monstrous gut, and I\u2019ve seen you eat a LOT...You\u2019ve eaten so much you\u2019re pinned down by the weight of your own gluttony!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah moaned at the increased pressure on her belly as she contended the superglutted mass of her stomach. A cacophany of indigesting and partially liquefied sludge boiled and churned sickeningly within the giant mountains of blubber. Every slight movement caused her body to jiggle and her struggling stomach to glorp and burble, the slop turgidly and thickly boiling against the strained walls of her gut. \u201cHYIELP!!

I guess you wouldn\u2019t mind a bit more milkshake, right? It\u2019s getting a bit sour.\u201d<br>\r\nSarah blearily belched in shock and gingerly patted her massive, angrily churning stomach, but at the same time giggled dumbly at the idea. Hiccupping again, she stared at Derek dully \"HYEEEELLP!! URRRRRRRRP!!! Miiightttas wellll...HELPGLURBLEGLOOORP!! HICELLP*blurblesloshGLORP*\" Despite Sarah\u2019s mind-bogglingly stuffed state, the appeal of just a little more unrestrained feasting and gorging yet again proved overpowering to her appetite. As usual Sarah paid no heed to her violently boiling and glopping stomach. Slapping both hands firmly over as much of her soft, fat-stuffed belly as she could reach, she gently shook its massively gelatinous, bubbling, burbling mass in a vain effort to make room for more food, the vast blubber wobbling unsteadily like ocean waves. She hiccupped loudly, belched wearily but licked her lips greedily: \"HYYIELP!!!!! HELP! Letssss get chuggin\u2019...HYELP!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek smiled broadly and walked away to fetch the pitcher. Unbeknownst to Sarah, he had set her camera running through the entire chat with Rosita. If this video doesn\u2019t get the views in, nothing will he thought eagerly to himself...</span></div></div>",

Sarah lay lounging in bed on this Saturday morning, comfortably warm, and still uncomfortably overgorged, until Derek eagerly called from the other room: \u201cSarah! It\u2019s just incredible! You have to see this!\u201d It was a Saturday, and since Sarah didn\u2019t have class, she usually preferred to lounge sleepily until late morning at least. Grumbling miserably, but  interested in what Derek had to say, Sarah ever so slowly dumped her gargantuan body out of her bed, onto the floor with a great *SLOP GLOOOSH* punctuated by a rich rich hiccup. Her incredible gluttony the day and night before had extended, albeit not as vigorous, late into the evening.  On 4 hours of digestion, Sarah\u2019s stomach was still verrry stuffed from her previous day of eating, but such things  certainly wouldn\u2019t stop her from glutting herself more in short order. Stomach still complaining about being moved, Sarah, unsteadily patted her mammoth belly and slowly wobbled herself into the kitchen, crashed down on the floor on her cushy butt with a loud *GLOPHYELP!*, and groggily greeted Derek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone still seems a bit full from yesterday\u201d, Derek coyly remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHYELP!

Anyway, take an look at this.\u201d He brought a laptop down to Sarah\u2019s level, the screen displaying the most recent video on her paysite. \u201cI took the opportunity to record the results of last night\u2019s...festivities...and uploaded it to your site.\u201d He pointed to the number of downloads and positive comments. \u201cSarah, they LOVE it! You\u2019re getting major hits!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah squinted at the screen and indeed her newest video seemed to be trending upward at an skyrocketing rate. \u201cHuh, would you look at that...HYELP!\u201d She grinned and rubbed the blubbery flanks of her gut. Winking at Derek, she replied, \u201cI guess this means I have my work cut out for me today. Time to start the Saturday smorgasbord...*glurp*\u201d She checked her watch, \u201c9:30 sounds like as good a time as any...HYELP...Let\u2019s see how much I can glut inta here today...*glurbleHELP!*\u201d She patted her gut readily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were giddy with excitement, and in short order Sarah was dressed and tottering her way to the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The ever creativily named underground club for men and women who enjoyed women on the 'Larger Side' had been around since the late 60's. The 'Bakery' called that because the club was underneath a real well known bakery that had a secret back entrance that lead to a club that served fat admirers and made their dreams come true. Anything was fair game, from nice and legal squashings and stuffings to other less than legal activities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella found herself as one of the main attractions after she was recruited to work their after college. The massive Samoan/Latina was receruited as her frequent visits to the normal bakery. Izzy found herself coming here after Softball practice when she was a tiny 275 pounds freshman year. After joining the weightlifting and boxing club at her university her appetite only grew as she stuffed herself silly after practice. Little did she know she was being scouted by the \"manager\" who also served as a recruiter for the underground bakery. By the time she was a senior Isabella was visiting the bakery everyday and always got her food for free. She had grown to 450 pounds by the time she graduated and her immense size and unique physical prowess made her a prime candidate to work at the bakery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella was a Kinesiology/Biology/Chemistry pre med triple major/athlete at the small private catholic university which didn't offer athletic scholarships due to their small student population. She was bitching to the 'manager' who despite being a regular for nearly 5 and a half years she still didn't know his real name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God dammit, 250 k of debt just so I could play softball in college, I'm a huge dumbass literally, fuckin other colleges saying I'm too fat to play for them\" she scoffed as she stuffed another eclair in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe manager smirked, \"you know Izzy, I can help make that debt go away\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella swallowed her eclair and reached for another eclair only to find an empty box. The manager was already handing her another box of a dozen donuts.\"how can you do that? Hire me here\" she laughed as she grabbed a donut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not here, follow me, come behind the counter\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella was confused, but grabbed the donuts and followed the mysterious man behind the counter and into a back area she'd never seen before. The manager did a unique knock and said \"Go Saints\". That's weird Isabella thought, that was her university's mascot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slot opened and some eyes peeked through and then the wall slid open. Leading to a massive stairwell. Inside Izzy saw massive women dancing and squashing men and the rest was history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Isabella was in her loft provided courtesy of the bakery working out doing leg day on her day off. If Isabella was skinnier she would have been the perfect woman having an hour glass figure since she was 11 years old. Unfortunately for mainstream society and fortunately for not so mainstream interest her love of eating surpassed her desire to be beautiful by traditional standards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe loved 3 things growing up: eating, working out and playing sports. And her former football player dad and Latina mother encouraged all 3. She didn't let her eating habits get in the way of her athletic career and led her high school to a state championship in Volleyball, Softball, Basketball and Soccer her senior year. When she graduated she was 350 pounds and despite her obvious talent the only school that would let her do any sports was St. Paul University in the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt St. Paul she led her university to their 1st national championship her junior and senior year despite her 100 pound weight gain. She set school records for weightlifting and won the amateur boxing championship as well. She was a massive athlete and when she graduated she was a unique specimen for 'The Bakery' to mold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella was an immediate hit at the club. She had the flexibility of a yogi, the face of a ballerina, the appetite of a pig and the abilities of a even the best exotic dancers. She quickly moved up the ranks from server to dancer, to a headliner making many of the more tenured girls jealous. Whoever ran the underground bakery had connections all over the city and after no longer having to pay for food at any restaurant within a 25 mile radius of the Bakeries location, receiving groceries for free and plus the bakery's behind the door activities  she gained 100 pounds in just 6 months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella sat her fat sweaty ass on her reinforced love seat which she took up completely with her mass and chugged a weight gain shake. It was her day off and she was gonna relax. When her phone rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She put her hair in a pony tail giving her an exotic belly dancer look and headed to the elevator that led to the buildings basement. Her loft took up the whole 2nd floor and had direct access to the bakery one of the perks of being a headliner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked to club entrance and let out a big sigh as she perked up and put her game face on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked in and was immediately greeted by the manager, \"Mr. X is waiting, what took so long?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella rolled her eyes, \"I got one day off and I still have to come in, I just worked out, I had to shower, is that okay?\" She said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarcasm isn't a good look on you, timeliness is key for our clients which is why we are one of the worlds premier clubs for what we do.

He wouldn't give me anything that'd harm me she thought or at least hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe followed behind Mr. X swinging her hips and which caused her whole body to shake. They walked past the previous doors she'd attended to clients in and went into an empty room which only contained a lone seat and had cameras on all 4 corners. There was no Mr. X and she was alone. The manager shut the door behind her and she was all alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck\" Isabella said confused. Fuck they're going to kill me she thought when she heard the managers voice <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit in the chair\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't ask questions, sit in the chair\" and Isabella immediately sat down in the lone chair at the other end of the room. This chair was massive dwarfing even Isabella's massive hips making her feel like a child. Then the manager appeared in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should feel special, you're the 1st one to to give the ultimate show\" he said as he tied her hands to the chair handles and blindfolded her. Isabella let out a scream and struggled but she was trapped. \"Don't kill me please\" she pleased amusing the manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry you should be safe, Mr. X provided the pills and assured me you'd probably be safe, he has been watching you for a while\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck, should? Let me out!\" She struggled more to no avail, even her strength was futile against the straps. All of a sudden her stomach shook violently and let out a massive growl and her primal instincts took over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FEED ME NOW\" she shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish darling, Gorda Grande is ready for her snack\" and with that he pressed a button which caused a conveyor belt to come out to the wall and led directly to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open wide darling\" he said as he walked out of the room. The show was starting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella eagerly waited as the 1st mysterious treat went down into her waiting maw and directly to her screaming gurgling honey colored dome. Treat after treat went down Isabella's waiting mas and yet she was starving. She didn't question what was going on, she long forgot about Mr. X and the job and could only focus on getting more and more treats into her belly. Everything fell directly into her mouth, down her throat without any chewing. She was a black hole and everything was disappeared into her insatiable belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 1st familiar things fell into her mouth. Her hunger was so great it was hard to concentrate on anything but she still recognized familiar items she consistently snacked on. Eclairs, donuts, tons of normal bakery items she'd snacked on in college. The items consistently got bigger and if she could focus she'd be shocked as her mouth opened wider and wider to accommodate the growing items. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon whole pies, cakes and pizza were going down her expanding throat. Her belly growing exponentially as it stuck out further and further. The massive dome soon outgrew her thighs and touched the ground. Her tight tight bra dug into her back as her back rolls overtook the chair before her massive breast broke her struggling bra. Her tits and belly weren't the only thing growing, her thighs soon touched both sides of the chair and beyond. The chair held steady as long as it could causing her to have an incredible muffin top until her mass destroyed the chair she was sitting on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet she was still voracious, soon whole chickens, turkeys were being crammed down her consistently wider mouth. She didn't know what was going down her throat and honestly didn't care. She was in a state of euphoria as her never ending hunger demanded to be sated. Her belly soon reached the other end of the room and continued to grow as her growing assets caused her to eventually reach the ceiling. She barely registered her hair scraping the ceiling as the ceiling started sliding into the wall like the conveyor belt that came out of the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarger and larger items were being shoved down her increasingly expanding throat. She's outgrown the room and was still ravenous. </span></div></div>",

After the 1st incident they learned it was better to prevent the subjects from being able to see what they were eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figures watched in interest as a whole pig disappeared into the growing woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is where the other subject failed\" spoke one of the figures a woman <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed let's see if she can handle it\" another man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all clapped as the pig easily made its way between Isabella's plump lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, she's going to outgrow the room, the 1st to succeed in doing so\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes excellent\" Mr. X spoke in a monotone voice, \"let's see if she's the one to pass the test\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey watched in earnest as progressively larger animals came through, a pony, donkey, full grown horse and even the hippo passed through her lips with little trouble. They watched as she soon reached the 3rd floor with no signs of stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother woman spoke up, \"What about those pesky scientist who raised these ethical questions\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry\" Mr. X said as a multiple bound and gagged scientists began to appear on the screen on the conveyor belt, some fearful and others accepting of their fate. \"They're being dealt with as we speak\" he smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne figure prepared to leave, \"it seems we finally had a successful project, I'm going to contact my movie and television connections\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother figure also got up, \"I must contact my music contacts, let them know project fatwave is ready\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figures dispersed leaving just Mr. X who began maniacally laughing. \"Perfect, just perfect and the fools don't even know they're opening Pandora's box\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Always more choices, eh? Well, how does one of these two suit you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>1) Alison Park</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison had been a very popular and athletic girl through out much of her school life. The key words are \"had been.\" In her final year of middle school, she'd suffered a terrible injury at a volleyball game, ending all her athletic hopes. She was forced to fall back on her academic skills, which, thanks to no longer being second to sports, she was able to excel at. She was accepted to her university of choice. Two years in, her grades were looking great, and it seemed likely she'd graduate with honours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer waistline, however, was not looking so great. Thanks to numerous factors, almost immediately after her injury, her body began to expand by leaps and bounds, stunning everyone both with the scale and rapidity of her weight gain. Stress over her grades and the reactions of her fair weather friends had led her to become even more isolated, which in turn led to her eating more and getting even fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison is barely a quarter inch over five feet tall. She has pale skin, which hasn't been helped by her excessive time indoors, and long brown hair. She doesn't know her current weight, having last been weighed when she was 17. At the time, she was 363 pounds, and swore off ever stepping on a scale again. Now at 20, she knows she's undoubtedly gained a lot more, as she seems to be constantly outgrowing everything...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>2) Julia Fuller</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia, maiden name Miller, is a young wife of 23. She'd married her high school sweetheart, Isaac, right out of school. Her family had been less then supportive, but the two young lovers had managed to make their way in the world. Isaac had gotten his CPA credentials and was working as a tax accountant. Julia had been working as a secretary, but had quit when she was pregnant with their first child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was during her pregnancy that something in their relationship changed. Isaac had honestly told her of his preference for big, gaining women back in school, and given how bad her cravings were, she decided this was the perfect time to see if her hubby was being honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yes, he most definitely was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac had had no qualms about keeping Julia stuffed like a turkey, and Julia had happily sat on the couch and overindulged throughout her pregnancy. Her consumption never dropped after birth, however, and it increased twice more with both her subsequent pregnancies. The effects of her diet and lack of exercise were hard to miss. She was like a living balloon, being steadily inflated by food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive years into her marriage, her eldest daughter is starting Kindergarten. Julia is fatter then ever (\"unbelievably fat,\" as she would describe it), and really starting to feel every pound weighing her down. Chasing down three kids seems harder and harder by the day, while eating another burger or box of cookies is getting easier. On top of that, she thinks she might be pregnant again. And while she loves her kids, eating a lot, and gaining weight, she is starting to worry that she's approaching a crossroads she can never turn back from...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt story start, Julia is 5'9\" tall, with short black hair and brown eyes. When she last weighed herself, she was 538 pounds, though that was six months, three pant sizes and four bras ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>3) Or if none of these appeal, perhaps someone else?</b></span></div></div>",

It was a massive thing, reaching up to 700 pounds. It certainly cost a pretty penny too, although she kept that one to herself. Unfortunately, it didn't have either a speech mode or a wireless digital read out, so she had grabbed her friend and room mate, Tiffany, to help her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany took a deep breath before answering. \"613 pounds.\" She didn't tell Allie that she was rounding down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison felt her heart skip a beat. She'd known she was fat, but over 600.... she couldn't fathom it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe certainly looked every bit of her weight, though. Alison stood in only a bra and a pair of panties she'd purchased online, as there wasn't a store in a hundred miles that carried garments in her size. Her great, cavernous belly hung down to her knees, jiggling like liquid with each lumbering step she took, slapping heavily against her equally massive and jiggly thighs. Her arse stuck out over two feet behind her, and was nearly as wide as she was tall. The fact that her love handles were still managing to crush her cheeks was nothing short of impressive, and all this conspired to try and make her taller laying down then she was standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps an exaggeration, but at the moment, Allie didn't think so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts were impossibly huge things, each larger then her head. One benefit of her belly being so huge was the extra support it gave her gargantuan girls when she went bra-less, whether it be by choice or necessity. At the moment confined by a massive white bra, the soft jiggle both engaged endlessly in was a clear indication that the lardy things certainly couldn't support themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms had fattened so much that her upper arms had developed fat rolls of their own, something she had previously thought impossible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head and neck had bore their share of the lardaceous bounty, as well. She had sizable chipmunk cheeks, a double and triple chin, and her neck had disappeared under a roll of its own, which was then promptly buried in her shoulder fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison was quite simply enormous, and though Tiffany was considerably taller then her friend, at 139 pounds she was dwarfed by Allie's sheer mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison stepped off the scale and made her way to the couch. Her titanic thighs forced her to adopt a slow, heavy waddle, and she swung her arms as she moved to help herself maintain balance. Tiff tried not to pay attention to how much of her friend \"moved\" as she walked the short distance to the only piece of furniture capable of supporting her weight. Alison sat down, bringing an agonized creak from the sofa. She grabbed a box of doughnuts from the end table next to her and began to scarf them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiff cocked an eyebrow at this. \"Are you sure that's a good idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison just snorted. \"Why? Do you think it's going to make me fat?\" She slapped her belly, sending a ripple through the flabby flesh coating her middle. Her sticky fingers, coated with jam from the pastries, smeared sugary goodness on her overfed rolls. If she noticed the mess she'd made on herself, she made no attempt to clean it off, grabbing another treat and stuffing it in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiff sighed. \"That's not what I meant and you know it. I'm worried about you, okay!? I've known you for three years, and you've been eating and growing like crazy the whole time! You still move remarkably well for someone your size, but that can't last. What are you going to do when you can't take care of yourself, hmm? What about your health? Have you even considered losing weight?\"</span></div></div>",

All those years of being followed by oinking teenagers, or putting up with my mother's bull shit sarcasm, or my Dad's passive-aggressive crap, spending literally all my time alone, and it never occurred to me that I could just lose the weight! Golly gee whiz, Tiff, this changes everything! Thank you so much for your input!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany was hardly one to take that laying down. \"Oh, f@#$ you! So sorry I was worried about you! Fine, keep eating, then! See if I care when the floor gives way under your gigantic ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will! I don't recall ever asking for your concern anyway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiff put her hands up in the air. \"That's it. I'm out. If I have to listen to anymore of this, I'm going to scream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is fine by me. Hey, as long as you're out, could you grab some more doughnuts? Seems we're almost out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiff stopped midway through putting her shoes on, jaw open, aghast and furious that Alison would even say that. She didn't say a word, only grabbing her purse and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison gave a snort and turned her attention back to the box of pastries, grabbing a bear claw and sinking her teeth into the delectable dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany was only gone about an hour before she came back. Alison had, in the meantime, demolished what was left of the doughnuts and cooked a frozen pizza, which she was almost halfway done eating. The tubby young woman looked at her room mate coming in the door, and her eyes widened as she saw Tiffany struggling with a massive armload of take out containers. She saw Thai food, Chinese, at least one pizza, and a cake, and that's just what she could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tiffany forced her haul onto their overfilled coffee table, Allie had to ask, \"What's all that for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tiff turned to look at her, she gave a grin that sent a chill up Alison's deeply buried spine. \"Why piggy, it's all for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany made her way to Allie, draping herself over her massively obese room mate's flabby frame. \"You asked me to help you find out how much you weigh, and then attack me when I point out eating like a pig isn't going to help? But, I guess I shouldn't be surprised. You're such a perfect little pig, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany grabbed a slice of pizza from Alison's plate, and brought it to the 600 pound girl's mouth. Alison initially tried to keep her mouth closed, but Tiffany just reached over and forced it open, making her take a big bite and keeping her hand over Alison's lips, forcing her to chew and swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You couldn't even wait until I got back. You just had to eat something, didn't you? Such a hungry piggy.\" Tiffany ran her hand over Allie's huge belly rolls, jiggling and rubbing where her stomach roughly should have been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't you worry, Piggy,\" Tiffany said, bringing the slice back to her mouth. Alison hesitated, then slowly took a big bite of her own accord. As she chewed, Tiffany continued. \"You'll never have to be hungry again. You just need to eat and eat and eat. Just keep eating and getting fatter. That's all you have to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany forced the remainder of the slice into Alison's mouth. \"Eat more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept her one hand on Alison's cheek as she chewed and swallowed. \"Get fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed another slice. \"Getting fatter will stretch out your stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison felt her eyes start watering a little as she opened her mouth for another bite. \"So you'll need to eat more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany shoved almost too much of the slice into Allie's mouth, leaving her barely able to chew. \"So you'll get even fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison swallowed the bite with some difficulty, coughing lightly as she did so. Tiffany offered her a sip of a drink, and as Allie pulled on the straw, realized that it was a chocolate milkshake. Moving the empty plate aside, Tiffany grabbed the first of the fast food containers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to eat more every day. You're going to get fatter every day. You're going to eat until your belly hurts, then eat even more the next day. You won't slow down for anything, will you? Not even the ability to walk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison's lip trembled but she didn't hesitate to open her mouth as Tiffany started shoveling noodles into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a good little piggy.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alison woke up to Tiffany still opening the door, but without vast amounts of fattening food like she had in what she just realized was a dream. She had a pounding headache, so bad she grit her teeth. She felt back down to her belly - it was all still there - all 613 pounds of it. She was only slightly resenting of the fact that all the food she was eating wasn't real as she felt her hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Still</i> hungry?\" said Tiffany, incredulously. Alison glared a look at her of weariness and anger. \"Yes. I am.\" said Alison in her low-to-mid tone, Alto voice, compared to Tiffany's projecting, higher soprano. Tiffany shrugged. \"I just got groceries - and yes, you're going to eat what I eat.\" Alison gawked incredulously. \"You're -putting me- on a diet? What are you, my mother?\" Tiffany shot a dagger-like glance at her. \"If you eat nothing but pastries and insist on trying to give yourself type 2 diabetes, then yes, it seems I'll have to be your mother to stop you from dying before 30.\" Tiffany wore a crop-top - her stomach jiggled ever so slightly as well, but it was peanuts compared to Tiffany's huge gut which boggled the mind with its scale. If one were to put a yardstick up next to a seated Alison, the mass that was her gut would take up about 2/3 of the 3 foot stick. Around, it measured well over 100 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Alison, disregarding these glaring facts, said \"You're one to talk - your belly jiggles when you walk, Tiff!\" Tiffany frowned and instinctively grabbed her gut - as if to shield it from criticism. Tiffany was not 'fat' by any standards, still at a normal BMI at 5'7, but she was still somewhat insecure about her jiggly stomach when it came up like this. \"Oh, so this means nothing?\" Tiffany strode up to Alison and shook her exposed stomach - she never bothered to put her clothes back on - \"Hmm? Hmm?\" The great, gargantuan gut rippled as Tiffany played with it roughly. Alison pulled her away from her stomach. \"Don't talk shit if you're not necessariy a VS model either.\" Tiffany spoke gruffly and loudly, shouting. \"I'M AT A NORMAL WEIGHT, YOU'RE MORBIDLY OBESE. THERE'S A FUCKING BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US,\" she pointed for emphasis at the couch, \"AND YOU CAN'T TELL ME TO LEAVE - YOU CAN BARELY GET UP ON YOUR OWN!\" Tiffany took a breath and spoke rapidly, \"So the LEAST you could do is to go with this meal plan I'm setting for you. Or go buy the groceries yourself - at least it'd get you -walking-.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the firey redhead turned about and began putting up groceries. \"Now shut up and let me put up groceries. Get back to eating your shit - it'll either get rid of it faster, or get rid of -you- faster. If you're going to be a fat, ungrateful bitch, I don't care which.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison grunted. It was a weekend. She'd go out to get away from this cunt - but she didn't to put up with the normal difficulties. Every single other person looking at her with that judging stare she'd become blase to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she turned to the one sympathetic friend she had in this moment - food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got to finishing up her donut box - the remaining three were the glazed she didn't care too much for, but they were something. She reached over the couch for something else from the basket of goodies under the end table - it was full of some salty snacks she liked to munch on, especially in these moments. </span></div></div>",

Peace was only kept because Alison didn't grumble about the health food and small portions she was forced to eat, and Tiffany didn't bring up Allie heading out for fast food binges while claiming she was just \"picking up the mail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She either doesn't know or doesn't care that I can smell it on her. Well, at least she's getting more vegetables in her diet, and walking a bit more.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiff knew she'd come off rather rough with Alison before (as had Alison to be honest), but she was legitimately worried about her. The young woman had been pretty fat when they met, and she'd gotten so huge over the last three years. Tiffany was really worried about something bad happening to her friend. <i>\"I'm way too young to be burying my friends.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there were other reasons she'd lost her temper so quickly. Tiffany was looking at the results of her midterms, and felt sick as she contemplated how poorly she'd done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a lot of distractions going on in her life right now. Beyond the events with Allie, her Mom and Dad were going through a rather nasty divorce that had been building up for years. On top of that, her Grandma was in the hospital, and the end result of all of this was that studying for class and doing assignments was nearly impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking matters worse was her scholarship. If her GPA dropped too low, she'd be cut off financially, and her deadbeat Dad made sure that there wasn't any chance of her parents bailing her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"He knows he'll get his ass handed to him in the divorce, so what does he do? Takes his drunk-ass buddies to Mexico, and spends every God damn cent on hookers and blow.\"</i> By the time The Deadbeat got back to the States, her parent's joint checking and savings accounts were overdrawn, and all their credit cards maxed out. Her poor Mom was quite literally sick when she found out, vomiting in the kitchen sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany wasn't really the crying sort, but if she was, she'd be bawling right now. She put the paperwork on her desk and rubbed her forehead, feeling a migraine coming on. She opened one of her desk drawers and withdrew a box of cookies. They'd been Alison's before her enforced diet, and like most of her treats, Tiffany had \"thrown them out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she'd actually done was put them in her room, eating them whenever the stress got to be too much. Given her old man's addictions to both alcohol and gambling and fears that he may have passed those genes on, Tiffany wasn't ever going to consider a stiff drink as a means of relaxation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled four cookies out of the package, biting into the first one with a soft coo. It may not have been good for her, but right now, she needed this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison walked into her room, and saw a few dollars on her desk that she knew she hadn't put there. Little did she know, but Tiff was feeling guilty about eating the treats she'd paid for, and was subtly reimbursing the massive young woman.</span></div></div>",

Got it...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia was currently engaged in one of the hardest things she had to do today; the arduous task of undoing her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just about...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, for a normal person, such an activity could be described as many things, but difficult certainly wasn't one of them. Julia's measurements were anything but normal, however. The sheer scale of her belly and bust meant that she was operating by her sense of touch alone. Matters were further complicated by the fact that these pants were simply too tight, and honestly should have been replaced a couple weeks ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, just to make this extra challenging, she had to stuff herself to the brim yet again before trying to remove them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave another grunt of exertion as she pulled at them even harder. With a loud \"POP!\" her gargantuan belly surged forward and launched the pants' button across the room, where it smacked loudly into the wall. Julia jumped at the sudden sound as her fat surged forward, taking advantage of all this newfound space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, I suppose that works,\"</i> she thought as she reached for another cupcake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia Fuller could be called a Homemaker, although that would imply she was looking after her children in some way. With her eldest now attending kindergarten and her younger siblings in preschool, Julia had a lot of time at home to herself, which she spent doing what she could seriously consider her actual day job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer husband, Isaac, had never hidden his love of fat women. Heck, Julia had been fairly chubby in high school, and it had come as a total shock when one the top guys on campus had asked her out. The two had hit it off splendidly, and as the last five years of marriage would attest to, they were practically made for each other. She'd loved that her boyfriend (now husband) found her perfect the way she was, meaning she was free from worries about diet or exercise. If she didn't lose any weight, he wouldn't care, and if she wound up fatter, he'd actually be happy about it. Julia felt so at peace with Isaac and herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, while married life with Isaac had been good for her heart, depending on how you viewed such things, it had either been bad or good for her waistline. The last five years had seen her weight steadily rise, and her gain only seemed to be picking up speed. When she graduated high school, she'd been about 175-200 pounds, which she'd considered pretty hefty back then. Now Julia's weight was well in excess of 500 pounds. Her last successful weigh-in had seen her at 538, easily the biggest she'd ever been. A more recent attempt to weigh in had ended in failure, as the scale had been crushed to scrap under her massive tonnage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia's jaw had dropped open in shock, and she'd almost turned tomato-red in embarrassment. It was only because of Isaac's constant encouragement and flattery, as much in the bedroom as in words, that she'd gone from morbidly horrified to borderline sexually excited by her lardaceous mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, being fat, eating more, and getting fatter had, over time, become the keystone of their sexual relationship. Julia's meals had grown in size until they dwarfed those of the rest of the family. Everyone else was eating three meals, while she was eating four or five a day. Any activity that wasn't a meal was always accompanied by snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring her third pregnancy, Isaac had taken to preparing a cart load of treats for her to enjoy during the day without having to rise from the couch anymore then was necessary. He'd kept doing it after little Debbie was born, and Julia hadn't failed to notice that it seemed to be getting fuller by the day. Isaac always encouraged her to eat everything on the cart to \"keep her strength up,\" though of course they both knew the actual reason why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of that, he'd usually bring a reward for her if she managed to finish the whole thing before he got home. Said reward, inevitably, was one she could eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd though she hadn't said anything, Julia figured he had to know she was treating herself daily to a sizable fast-food feast after dropping the girls off at school. He would be the one receiving the credit card statements, after all, and her reward treats had gotten quite a bit bigger since she'd started doing that a few months ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe end result, as you might imagine, was that Julia had gotten very, very fat. The bottom heavy beauty was currently sitting in a loveseat, though at her size, it looked like a chair. Her humongous hips touched both arms of the couch, and her barrel round thighs looked uncomfortably squeezed between them. Her heart shaped belly spread across her lap to her knees, and though it wouldn't be visible until she rose, her wide ass stuck out far behind her, and had taken on a decidedly rectangular shape as she piled on the pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove her belly, however, her gain had been considerably smaller. Her bust had grown a good bit, and her face had noticeably rounded out, but both were dwarfed by her other gargantuan features. Even her pillowy arms, which now had quite the jiggle to them, seemed like they belonged to a considerably smaller woman then Julia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anything, though, her reduced gain up top was only encouraging her gluttonous ways. Eating for her could be described as many things, but never tiring. And so Julia's days went by, taking care of her kids, and otherwise stuffing herself silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing the last of the cupcakes, she looked over the now empty cart with a feeling akin to either pride, lust, or perhaps both. She checked her phone for the time as she swallowed the last of her milkshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"If I leave now, I'd have enough time for McDonald's run before I'd have to pick up the girls.\"</i> Julia was already drooling at the thought of stuffing more fatty goodness down her throat, and wondered how much better her reward this evening would be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she had to stand up first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBracing herself on the arms of the loveseat, Julia attempted to rise with a loud groan. Her body's enormous measurements and her packed belly saw her fail to rise more then an inch on her first attempt. Her second and third weren't much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrrrrgh!\" With a loud, pained groan, Julia slowly rose to her feet on the fourth attempt. Finally standing, she adopted a wider stance and stood still for a moment, panting heavily. After her short break, she slowly waddled to the front door. She couldn't help but notice how much of her body wobbled uncontrollably as she moved, and just how much slower her walking speed was compared to even a few short months ago. Even the short trek from the loveseat to the door left her winded, and it was quite clear that she'd failed to do anything approaching adequate exercise to accommodate her newfound poundage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more logical side of her mind found this very worrying, and Julia (at least in part) debated slowing down or reversing her gain. Her reprogrammed emotional side won out, however, and she grabbed her purse and headed to her car, her belly growling hungrily. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Julia leaned against the wall to kick on her sandals, eliciting a loud creak from the drywall. She'd had plenty of practice putting on her footwear by touch and memory alone, given her inability to see her feet without a mirror, but it still took her a couple attempts to get them both on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready, Julia was feeling winded and wanted to sit down, but she forced herself to continue as her massively overstretched belly let out another subdued grumble. She opened the front door and squeezed herself through the (compared to her) narrow 36\" opening, having to exit at a wicked angle because of her ultra-wide hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia crossed the front porch in a few short, waddling steps before she approached the front stairs. It may have only been four steps, but at her size, it was damn near a mountain. Julia grabbed the handrails on both sides and slowly, carefully lowered her heaving mass down one small step at a time. Each movement saw a massive wobble from her gigantic posterior, and her huge belly and gigantic thighs greatly impeded her leg movements. Both together threatened to destroy her balance at any time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Easy does it, girl. Slow and steady.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like an eternity, Julia was finally on the ground. Leaning against the nearby wall, she panted open-mouthed for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wait, did I remember to lock the door?\"</i> Julia looked behind her, her eyes lingering on the front steps. She bit her lower lip in trepidation. <i>\"You know what, I'm sure I did. Not important anyway.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving caught her breath, she turned towards her vehicle, a slightly oversized SUV and began waddling towards it. She felt her huge ass cheeks damn near pop out of her jeans with each shuddering step, and only now did Julia realize she'd forgotten to change into an unbroken pair of pants. She tried to pull her shirt down to cover up her damaged trousers, but it kept trying to roll back up her belly, leaving her engorged lower belly roll on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia was a little embarrassed, but reasoned that no one would see the damage if she didn't get out the vehicle. <i>\"Besides, it's not like I need to worry about them falling off,\"</i> she thought as she contemplated how packed she was into these jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving made her way to the vehicle, she leaned against the hood, struggling to catch her breath. <i>\"Good Lord,\"</i> she thought. <i>I swear that's getting harder.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia was grateful that they'd replaced her old car with this SUV, as it was far easier at her size to get in and out of than her old vehicle. Still, it was a bit of a hassle. Opening the door, Julia swung her first leg in. Resting the first part of her enormous right ass cheek on the seat, she began the long, arduous process of shuffling herself slowly into the driver's seat. Each shuffle saw her heavy belly smack mightily into the steering wheel, and her booty was already spreading across the center before she could even move her left leg in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door ran into its own problems, as the door kept bouncing off her impressively huge thigh. Julia kept shuffling over and trying to close it again and again, only to feel it bounce off her leg fat. At long last, she felt the door latch, although not well, necessitating her to shuffle one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia took a moment to lean back in her seat, panting. She could feel sweat building between her rolls. Her fat was crushed against the driver's door even though she was spreading across the front of the vehicle. She could barely reach the steering wheel at its current angle, but it still was rubbing against her belly. Moving her seat back further wasn't an option, as she could barely reach the pedal as it was. Even the instruments were half obscured by her lardy bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Am I seriously getting too fat to <b>DRIVE</b>?\"</i> Once more, the logical part of her mind was quite terrified, but Julia couldn't help but feel so hot at this realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving caught her breath for the third or fourth time today, Julia put on her seat belt, her extender barely reaching. Feeling a strange sense of pleasure as it uncomfortably dug into her stomach, she put her car in drive and made her way down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl was having a pretty boring day at work when his head set dinged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, welcome to McDonald's, can I take your order?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman's voice came through. \"Hi! Could I get 4 Big Macs with fries, 2 double quarter pounders with cheese, three large chocolate milk shakes, and six apple pies, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She sounds cute,\"</i> Carl thought as she placed her order. <i>\"Must be buying supper for the family.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to supersize any of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... oh, why not? Supersize the lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your order comes to XXX dollars, first window please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the vehicle came around the corner, Carl's jaw dropped. <i>\"Holy @#$%, she's huge!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl didn't manage to close his jaw as he watched this enormous blob of a woman struggle into her purse to pay for her food. Her body was so engorged with lard that her arms could barely move inside the vehicle. She was still a beautiful woman in spite of her gigantic size, and she gave a cute smile as she paid for her order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl was so shocked that he barely remembered to call out as she left, \"T-thank you for choosing McDonald's, please come again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Like there's any fear she won't. Seriously, <b>Jesus Christ.</b>\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia stopped in the parking lot and started to dig into her absolutely huge order. She bit into her first burger with a loud \"Mmm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I thought that clerk was going to pass out from shock. I've gotten so fat people can't even believe it. I wonder what they'll think if they see me get even fatter...?\"</i></span></div></div>",

The preschool pick up had proven the most problematic, as she'd had to exit the vehicle to put her young'ns in their car seats. Getting in and out of the vehicle at her size, combined with bending into the car to secure her kids after such a big meal, had altogether proven nearly impossible. One of the teachers had given her a helping hand, though Julia had felt her eyes taking apart her bloated parody of a body as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia had taken a pair of breaks before getting the car back on the road. Too tired to even contemplate standing long enough to cook supper, she text Isaac while she panted, asking if he'd be fine if they ordered in for supper. He'd text back right away, saying that he'd pick something up on the way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat something had turned out to be a Chinese dinner for 12, the bulk of which was just for Julia. While Isaac took care of himself and the girls, Julia stuffed herself silly. As if that wasn't enough, after the girls went to bed, her hubby ordered her a large fully loaded pizza for a late evening \"snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying on their tilted bed in her underwear, Julia consumed each and every slice of pizza, pushing it into her own mouth when Isaac seemed like he was going too slowly. By the time she was finished, her fingers and lips were orange with grease. A piece of pepperoni had fallen off one slice, landing on her exposed belly and leaving a stain of its own on her soft, pockmarked flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she rubbed her expansive belly, spreading the grease on her fingers across the opulent deposit of heaving flesh, she groaned as she watched Isaac come back in with a lemon meringue pie. \"Oh, honey, I couldn't,\" Julia murmured, despite feeling her mouth begin to water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, don't say that, sweetie. I know you have room. And if not,\" he said as he fed a forkful to the beached whale his wife had become, \"we'll make room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia moaned a little as she accepted the delectable morsel, chewing slowly as the weight of all she'd so far eaten came back to her. As she chewed her second mouthful, she felt guilty as she contemplated her current state. \"Hon, can I ask you something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac frowned a little, as this was out of character for his wife this late into her evening stuffing. \"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I've gotten fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac couldn't help but let out a snort of laughter. \"I'm sorry, pardon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia blushed. \"Not fat, but like, really fat. Too fat, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't think so. What brought this on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia looked down at her grossly overfed body. She ran her hands along her fattened flanks, her tiny hands unable to reach all points of her massive belly, which in turn was still dwarfed in size by her gargantuan rump and legs. \"It's just, it's getting really hard to do things, you know. Standing up without help is hard, walking anywhere is hard, I'm even getting too big to fit in my car. Loading up the girls after school today was beyond difficult; if Mrs. White hadn't been there, I'm not sure I could have done it. Even cooking and cleaning feel like herculean feats these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I did get my raise at work today. We've been talking about hiring someone to help out for awhile now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know. It's just, I worry I'm getting to the point where I won't be good for anything except eating more and getting fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia interrupted Isaac. \"I mean, I almost fill our bed just with my ass, and I outgrew my biggest jeans today, and I'm so stuffed and yet all I can think about is eating the rest of that pie and hoping there's something else nearby, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it was Isaac's turn to interrupt Julia. He shoved a large bite of dessert into her open mouth, leaving her eyes wide with shock as he smeared meringue around her puffy lips. Planting a kiss on her lips as she chewed and swallowed, Julia said in a voice barely above a whisper, \"I just don't want you to think I'm useless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Julie, you know I'd never think that. Do you really think I only love you because you clean the toilet or do the laundry? I love you for you; always have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fed her another mouthful of pie. Once she swallowed, Julia said, \"Would you love me even if I got fatter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac's smile seemed to widen a little. \"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother mouthful. \"Even if I got lazier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChew, swallow. \"Even more out of shape?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fork was beginning to scrape the bottom of the plate. \"Even hungrier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, 1000 times yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I got skinnier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac's smile seemed to freeze momentarily, and he may have hesitated a moment, but the time span was too short for Julia to be certain she didn't imagine it. \"Of course I would, honey. Do you want to lose weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was pretty certain he already knew the answer, as her belly let out a growl as he placed a box of donuts on her jiggly belly. He opened the box and grabbed a jumbo bear claw. Holding it to Julia's mouth, she said before taking a huge bite, \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to eat less?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia was painfully stuffed, but forced herself to take another bite, feeling her body quiver as she did so. \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsaac smiled even wider as she reached forward and grabbed a pastry herself. \"Do you want to eat more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia moaned as she sunk her teeth into the custard filled treat. \"I shall take that as a yes. Do you want to get fatter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was silent for a moment, the only sound in the room the smacking of her lips. He said again, \"Do you want to get fatter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia looked him in eye, then slowly nodded. Isaac continued to grin. \"Good girl. I'll call the agency tomorrow and get someone to take the load off you. You just focus on what's important, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia kept eating, using both hands to funnel pastry into her ever-hungry maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what happens next for Julia?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
