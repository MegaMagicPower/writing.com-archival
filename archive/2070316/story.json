Your feet were gone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead they had been replaced by these, nubs. And was that a tail?!? The knowledge hit you then like a flash.

You try to stand but your body was too young and week and oyu only end up wigglign a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you became aware of sudden feeling, before it faded, and your diaper started warming up. You were wetting yourself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething in you snaps at the realisation and you start crying, letting out all your emberesment, confusin, and fear in one babies wail.

Something that you could feel through your mittens while alos feeling your mittins on whatever it was. There was no doubt.

We mean you know harm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try hard to process your surroundings. Although you are afraid, you don't sense any danger. Clearing your throat, you take it slow and try to be more open-minded. Even though you are seeing creatures that are unfathomable, it's a reassurance that they look like animals that you're familiar with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-ferberos?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the cloaked members pulled down their hood revealing another female or more specifically, a fox. Her whiskers wrinkled as she sighs, a little annoyed by the deer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew we should have set up an illusion before, Jani. This human is clearly afraid and confused. We should've slowly settled him into becoming accustomed to our world and ourselves instead of teleporting him without knowledge,\" the fox criticizes the deer who is apparently named Jani.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJani huffs, clearly believing that transporting your confused self is a much better option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not want to waste time, Khevi. We are peaceful creatures and all we want is to slowly grow bonds with other races. That is all,\" she shoots back to the Fox known as Khevi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhevi snarls and takes a long look at you, causing your body to flinch at the sharp yellow gaze. Despite her intimidating appearance, she smiles warmly with her maw and comes closer than any of the other members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that the damage has been done, I suppose all we can do is answer your questions. Before that though, what is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-adam...Adam Kingsley,\" you answer hesitantly, wondering if you should really be giving out your name to such strangers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhevi hums and Jani can only sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Adam, what a unique name,\" Jani praises in a sweet tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt really isn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhevi rolls her eyes and focuses her attention back to you. \"Well, as you can see. You've been transported to a different universe. From what we've researched about your world, you're likely able to recognize that we're similar to the animal counterparts that you know, but the difference is that we're shaped differently...similar to your kind, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is too much to wrap your head around, but you take a deep breath and keep your head cool. Khevi smiles to see that you're trying to remain composed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although we didn't specifically choose you, I'm glad that you're taking this well. I know that this is all very sudden and I apologize for that. As you've heard, I originally wanted to transport you without knowing so that you'd eventually realize who we are as a people and the land. You can blame this foolish deer for causing such confusion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not foolish!\" Jani opposes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhevi ignores the dear and maintains her focus on you. \"We'll remain here as long as you need to understand your current situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Khevi and the banter between her and Jani makes you feel a little at ease. The fact that, despite being anthromorphic animals, they have such human expressions and emotions makes you feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat doesn't make your situation completely acceptable though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess my next question is...why am I here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhevi hums. \"Well, as I've said, this is an experiment that has been going on in order to welcome new races into our world. We've known about your universe for a while now, Adam, and many of us feel a connection to humans after some observation. We just had to take one in so that we can come to a better understanding between us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-that's...not cool though,\" you explain, \"...I mean, you shouldn't take someone without warning. I need to go back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhevi's eyes turn sharp for a moment. \"I'm afraid that is impossible. Although it is harsh, we spent many years finding a way to transport a live organic being. It takes years to recharge just to transport another. You may be angry and upset by the situation, but from now on, you'll be taken in by one of our people as your guardian. From there, you'll learn about us just as we will learn about you. This is the first step in building a relationship between our races.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...by kidnapping people!?\" you ask, unable to help raise your voice after hearing such an unreasonable excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhevi hums and closes her eyes. \"A harsh term, but...yes. It has to be done. Just like your race, we are naturally curious about what we can see. It was only a matter of time before our desire to bring a human to us came to fruition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body slumps as you realize that the fox is completely serious of your situation. You're...trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not worry, Adam! One of us will take care of you with all of our hearts and love! In fact, why not come with me and allow me the privilege to become your moth-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJani's excitement is cut off by Khevi who can no longer tolerate the deer's inability to hold back. Sighing, she explains further your choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I've said before, there is no choice but to accept your new life here. Besides, we haven't researched how to send one back to a specific universe. Although you may find it ridiculous, we're giving you a choice here: You have to choose someone to become your caretaker, guardian, mother, or however you wish to call it. Each of us are prepared to take care of you and exchange knowledge, but there are many of us outside this chamber and you're free to look around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I've said again, this is how it must be. If you try to run, then I'd like to ask you...what will you do in such an unfamiliar world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer rational logic sticks with you despite your desire to escape such a choice. You grit your teeth, wondering why of all people, you had to just suddenly be chosen at random.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do?</span></div></div>",

She gazes around the various beings in the circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, will you all please remove your hood, everyone?\" Khevi requests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining 10 members remove their hood revealing all sorts of familiar animal heads.

So far, only two anthros have made an impression on you, being Khevi and Jani, so it's obvious that you'd go with one of them. That said, despite Khevi's forwardness on the fact that you could no longer return, she seemed to be the most logical and calm one. That's not to say any of the other members aren't, but she is the one to first approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I suppose I have to go with Khevi then,\" you decide resulting in the fox to smile a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the members around you frown with disappointment, but none of them approached you, so it's truly their fault. As for Jani, she seemed to be hit the hardest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fair! Why does it have to be her! She's the most boring!\" Jani protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhevi's smile immediately falters and she growls, causing Jani to shut up and flinch a little. It appears that despite living harmoniously, there is an obvious hierarchy among the anthropomorphic animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jani, he has made his decision. It's clear that your eagerness has put him off,\" she explains harshly before turning to you and smiling warmly, \"That said, I'll admit that I'm happy that you chose me, Adam. From now on, I will be your guardian or perhaps more appropriately, your new mother. Let us depart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are admittedly awed how composed and proper Khevi appears. She raises her hand towards you, seeking to hold your hands. You are surprised to see that her hands are shaped just like humans, with five fingers, except it is completely covered in her red, silky fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are understandingly cautious, but at this point, you feel Khevi is to be trusted and her intentions are clear. If it weren't for the fact that these beings could show such warm and empathetic emotions, you might be screaming your head off. It probably also helps that they are similar to animals in your own universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing your hand on top of Khevi's, you figure you were only going to shake her hand, but she completely destroyed your image of formality. Instead, she pulls you close into a hug, burying your body in the soft fabric of her robe. You're shocked by the sudden greeting, but her soft hold on you reminded you that you accepted her as your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you are embarrassed since you still didn't know much about her, you didn't try to pull back in fear of offending her. You simply awkwardly hug her back, unsure of what else to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhevi hums softly and you hear all the other female anthros gasp in jealousy and amazement. It appears history has been made for this world as Khevi is the first anthro to become a guardian of an entirely different species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attention around you didn't make you feel better; however, you do notice that her body feels like a fluffy bed and that's probably thanks to her fur hidden behind her robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, Khevi pulls away revealing your slightly red face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us depart, my son...\" she declares, holding out her hand again, but this time, you get the impression that she isn't going to surprise and hug you. It's clear that she'll be holding your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, you relent seeing how there is no other option.

I suppose it's similar to that alliance you have on Earth: E...erope?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the European Union?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhevi grows embarrassed. \"Yes, that continent though I did not know that the alliance had a name. We've been studying the state of your world for many generations behind a glass wall, so I am sure there are still things we don't know. With your help, we'll learn more about your world and humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, it was a little cute how Khevi tried her hardest to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing, Khevi stops near a bakery. She smiles a little and points to it. \"Why don't we continue chatting while we enjoy some fresh bread? We can discuss more while you eat. I'm sure your hungry by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, you could eat something and based on the customers entering and exiting the store with baskets with bread rolls in them, it didn't look any different from the bread rolls you see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sitting at a table on the outside patio of the bakery, you listen intently and try to ignore the stares and gasps of the onlookers who were seeing a live human for the first time. Khevi explained that their research into the human world was known, but your presence was not announced. No doubt rumors would spread about your appearance. For that reason, Khevi admitted there would be some dangers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't lie to you, my son. There will be dangers lurking and it won't be long before your existence will spread throughout the continent. There will be jealousy amongst females and perhaps even within our organization that will want to snatch you. There are also the males who may see you as a potential threat to acquiring a mate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise an eyebrow as you bite on some crusty bread. It tasted like any other fresh bread and was filling you comfortably, but you felt an odd numbness in your legs. At first, you thought it may because you were sitting incorrectly; however, no amount of shifting could stop it. You try to remain focused on Khevi's words and ignore it. Perhaps when you finally got up, you would be able to walk it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...is there anything I can do to help defend myself?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhevi smiled sadly. \"Based on what I've seen, we are far stronger than the average human. I hope you do not take offense to that, but you'll likely fair better running. In any case, I will not leave your side, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are a bit frightened by the fact that you are helpless. You didn't need proof beyond Khevi's word. It was apparent with how large majority of the anthro are and the fact that Khevi herself had quite a strong grip when she was leading you by the hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...well, I appreciate it, I guess,\" you replied with uncertainty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhevi chuckled. \"Please Adam, I know it still young, but you do not have to be formal with me. I have given my word to you as your mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grow embarrassed at how easily she claims to be your mother. That raises a question though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why mother?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhevi widens her eyes for a moment and then softens as she smiles maternally. \"I suppose I should explain that. Strange as it is, I simply feel that is an appropriate relationship. There is a lot of females here that develop a maternal desire or continue to hold a bond with their children. It is a nature that we have accepted for quite a long time. We naturally aim to become a mother and take care of our children...our future. You are a big part of our future too, Adam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that makes sense...\" you state, knowing that you couldn't expect the culture to be similar to what you knew on Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhevi nodded and her whiskers flicked a little. \"I know it will take time, but...I want to become someone you can always trust and confide in. Will that be a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see some worry in your new mother's eyes and you couldn't help but give her a little of your acceptance. \"Well, I suppose I have to trust you, don't I? Even if it's strange for me, I don't see much of problem right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhevi closed her eyes and chuckled. \"Of course. It's too early for such talks I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her eyes, she sees the sun is at its peak and no doubt would start to descend in a few hours. She rises from her seat and offers her hand towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come. Let us continue towards my home. As it is the first day, we cannot let our guard down so we should leave as quickly as we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, finishing up your roll of bread. You reach forward and try to push yourself off the seat until you realized you had no ability to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to feel a rising panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I can't move....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhevi stares confused before her eyes widen. \"Oh dear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly moves to your side and pulls you up using just one arm's strength. You feel her hand gripping tightly around your waist and keeping you secured without any problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what's going on? I...I thought I could just walk it off, but...I can't feel anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhevi hushes you softly and pulls you into a warm hug. \"I am sorry, my son. I should have been more careful about the food around here. There are magical properties within that bread and it appears your body needs to slowly adapt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what does that even mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of your legs gone made you panic more than anything and Khevi's hold did nothing to help. Still, the fox held you tight and strangely rubbed your back in comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be okay. The feelings in your legs will return. For now, I will have to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Khevi plan to do?</span></div></div>",

Given her stature and the fact she's an otherworldly being, it shouldn't be that surprising. You'd rather not have to be carried though, you wanted the feelings in your legs to return!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! I should be able to walk on my own! How the hell can bread make my legs feel like jello anyways?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt appeared you were making a ruckus by your yelling. Khevi looks around and apologizes for the noise on your behalf while trying to calm you down. Instinctively, she begins patting your back and juggling you a little as you are firmly secured around her waistline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be okay, the feeling in your legs will return, I promise! It's my fault for neglecting the idea of how our food could affect you. In your eyes, it seems like normal things you would eat, but everything we have here has a unique energy that helps give us strength. It appears that your body needs to slowly adapt to that. Until then...please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugging you tightly and trying to soothe your emotions, you do feel a little calmer as she strokes your back. As embarrassing as it is, you seem to have no choice but to accept Khevi's offer to carry you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay, I'm...calm. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing you apologize, Khevi closes her eyes and leans forward to nuzzle your head. The public affection is seen by others which causes whispers and giggles to sound around you. Your face turns red further by the attention and you clear your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhevi realizes now she's making the most attention and moves quickly to exit the cafe. She hides you under her robes while continuing to stroke your back. You have no choice but to relax against her soft fur. As she takes you to her home, you start to doze off. Perhaps its due to the bread, the warmth of Khevi and her fur, or both!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, you slowly drift to sleep despite your hardest to stay awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up...</span></div></div>",

You know the look as well and despite being a deer, she somehow has the powerful puppy-dog eyes that so many people crumble under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, you couldn't ignore the others who stand before you. If you're planning to settle with one of these anthropomorphic beings, you shouldn't be swayed by such hopeful eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you turn your head to look at the others, you hear a small disappointed gasp. Your head snaps back at Jani who appears to have made the sound. Now, her eyes are filled with anxiety with her ears flopped down. It seems she thinks you have already made a pass on her though that wasn't your intention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhevi sighs and admonishes the deer. \"Jani, have patience, will you? The boy has the right to choose and should be able to take time with others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Jani's snout, her lips quiver and she can't help but complain. \"It's just...I'm the one who summoned him, haven't I? For years, I've been waiting for this moment and have researched into the magic that has brought this boy to us? Why shouldn't I have a claim to him?! Am I to allow someone to steal the results of my efforts?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou widen your eyes in surprise as her words echo into the distance of the temple you stand in. You hear some of the beings clear their throat and an uncomfortable silence remaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhevi narrows her eyes, annoyed. Yet, she does not raise her voice and maintains composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one is questioning your accomplishments, Jani,\" Khevi asserts, \"...you have been invaluable, but by summoning him here without a choice, the most we could allow him is to give him a choice and that still may not be enough for taking away his life on Earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJani knows this and takes a deep breath, bowing her head. \"I'm...sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe temple returned to its anticipatory mood as the rest of the hooded figures awaits your decision; however, you could no longer stop thinking about Jani's revelation and it left you feeling split.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one hand, she is the one who is responsible for your summoning...one that you had to begrudgingly accept. On the other hand, you had first experiences of what it feels like to be cheated of hard-earned work. You've put yourself through study and competitions within your school, yet...none of the top universities seem to see or bother noticing your accomplishments as they look at others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't seem any of that matters now. Despite your mind telling you to study the others carefully, your heart spoke out without your permission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll choose Jani.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were some gasps and annoyed grunts around you. When you realized what you had said, it was too late as Jani's mood turned upside down. Her squeals grow louder and without being able to properly react, she envelops you into a hug, burying you deeply into her robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Adam! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Mommy will always protect you, I promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>M-mommy!?</i>' you think and want to speak out, but your voice is all but muffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding you close with one hand on the back of your head, she uses her free hand to point at the remaining anthropomorphic animals. A cheeky grin filling her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IN. YOUR. FACES! It should be of no surprise to all of you that the summoner is the best guardian of them all! Ha ha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone rightfully grunts in disgust and leaves. Not that most of them weren't disappointed but they hardly had the time to listen to the summoner's growing cockiness. Behind Jani, Khevi sighs, a hand covering her eyes before she removes it and walks up to the deer who squirms while holding you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get ahead of yourself, Jani! Seriously...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns her attention to you, still buried and starting to find it hard to breathe now. \"Adam, I want to make sure. Is this what you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA muffled response returns from you and Khevi clears her throat towards the deer. Jani picks up and then releases you, embarrassment on her face. You gasp, filling your lungs with fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about it, you curl your lips but have no reason to go back on your word. Looking at the deer who is quivering with joy, you would feel awful to break her spirits now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm sure,\" you finally answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhevi stares at you for a moment, then closes her eyes. \"I understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns her attention the deer and gives a final warning. \"Jani, this human is putting his trust in you. I want you to keep that in mind. Despite being part of the council, you are the youngest out of all of us and you still have much to learn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJani continues to grin and pulls you back in, stroking your hair affectionately. \"Yes, but I think we all have things to learn around this human, no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhevi snorts, amused. \"I suppose so. It'll be interesting to see how far your relationship brings us in terms of the future. Do take care of yourself and Adam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the fox takes her leave, leaving you and the deer alone. She puts some distance again between herself and you, then takes a long good look at you. Her mouth is as wide as it could possibly be and makes you a little concerned now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Adam, I'm so happy! Once again, thank you for choosing me as your guardian!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing such a bright light emitting from her, you can't help but nod dumbly. In a way, she's kind of adorable. Still, you try to not let yourself get ahead in terms of expectations and remain uncertain about this new arrangement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Jani is quick to establish herself without delay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, Adam. As your guardian, would you mind if you called me Mommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou widen your eyes and felt your face reddening in embarrassment. You wanted to believe you misheard her when she hugged you, but it seems that wasn't a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...w-why?\" you ask, hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJani fidgets, growing somewhat meek. \"There's a lot we don't understand and when researching about your species before summoning, I took notice that children call their guardians 'Mommy' among others like 'Mom' and 'Mother'. I find that Mommy sounds the best and if I want to be your guardian, I'd like you to trust me and grant me the privilege of that title!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to choke up but can't. Trying to avoid eye contact, you try to delay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I don't think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, Adam! I want you to trust me! P-please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes once again transform into puppy-eyes and you crumble under the eagerness she emits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you respond?</span></div></div>",

More than that though, she begins lifting you up, causing you to yelp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-whoa! What the-!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing forced to wrap around her with your legs locking around her thighs with your bottom supported by one hand and your back being held by the other, you have one more reason to further grow embarrassed. Being raised up, you find yourself meeting up with her chest and even though it is covered by her robe, you realize how much it sticks out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJani giggles at your reaction. \"Surprise? We're stronger than we look! I need to carry you close to me and this is the easiest way. Otherwise, I risk others attempting to snatch you and we wouldn't want that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-still, this is a bit much...I mean, I feel like a child!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJani cocks her head and then eyes quizzically at you. \"Huh? Is...that not what you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause, some of the color returning to your face. Ignoring your current carried state, you feel like there is some sort of misunderstanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...I'm eighteen? That's the beginning age for an adult on Earth,\" you explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJani widens her eyes. \"Fascinating, but...it's hard for me to grasp. Eighteen seems far too young, especially for my kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou furrow your eyebrows. \"What do you mean? Wait...how old are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJani tilts out her chin proudly. \"A forbidden question, but one that I'm not ashamed to say since I'm still a little young myself compared to the others! I'm only a hundred year old! That's why for me, an eighteen-year-old is the same as a child. I'm basing that on your human years too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze, disbelief overcoming you. Although she's not a human so you couldn't indicate age from complexion, she and even the older members of the council all looked quite healthy and young if you had to indicate how they all talked and kept themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-still, I'm an adult, trust me!\" you remain firm, not to be dissuaded by her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJani giggles, finding your declaration to be cute. \"I will still keep you close for your safety. In fact, I shouldn't even hold you publicly yet. It's too soon for the other citizens of this country to know of your existence. Besides, you are probably tired and hungry, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...wait-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could even question further,  Jani lifts her robe and envelops you. It happens all too fast and for a split second, you are flashed with smooth, protruding mounds that make your eyes bulge. Before realizing what you are facing against, your view turns dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressed by the deer, you find yourself latching onto something. Only when a trickle of a sweet, warm liquid enters your mouth do you realize what's happening. Being locked to her chest though, you can't unlatch nor can you protest. All you can do is wiggle uncomfortably as she strokes your back from the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it easy for now, Adam. Just trust in your <i>deer</i> mommy and all will be well. I promise that you'll forget about your old life soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt feels like a bittersweet ending, but nothing in your mouth that you are forced to swallow tastes bitter. In the end, you had to keep nursing on the deer's chest. As much as it pains you to admit though, Deer milk tastes better than you could imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suckle obediently while your deer guardian begins exiting the temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to see the outside land of Ferberos, you could only take in the sounds of bustling streets and merchants advertising around. It makes you curious as to what kind of sights await you but for now, only your new self-imposed mother's chest exists. Pretty soon, even the liveliness of the foreign city can't stop you from falling asleep as you drift off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up, where do you find yourself?</span></div></div>",

Say ah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, listen to me-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJani doesn't hear you and one of her furry mounds with a dripping nipple gets stuffed into your mouth. With sweet deer milk leaking onto your tongue, you're forced to swallow. You suckle a few before you unlatch and pull away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp. \"W-wait, I said!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJani's ears flop and her eyes grow concerned. She lowers her snout. \"Oh <i>deer</i>! What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little milk drips from your mouth. Embarrassed, you wipe away with your arm and in front of the all-too-eager deer, all you want is some time to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong? Well, I don't know. Does your people breastfeed people my age like this in your culture?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJani's ears lift up and she chirps. \"Yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. \"That was a dumb question from me considering our age gap. I should have known better. So I guess others cuddle with their children naked too, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJani giggles, finding your confusion to be cute. \"Of course! It serves for establishing a bond and since I'm your 'Mommy', there's no better purpose too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh again. \"Then...my last question is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a snap of your hand, you pull the lower half of your body away and reveal your troubled \"longsword\". It wags to the incomparable soft furry thighs of Jani that it had to slide across while she snuggled with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this normal too for you?!\" you ask, incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJani widens her eyes and gasps. You're ashamed to even grow hard but maybe you are accepting these anthropomorphic beings better than you thought. What you can't wrap around is how any of Jani's behavior to a newcomer like you is supposed to be \"natural\"!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O...oh deer! I never expected you to have such a cute mushroom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare blankly at the deer. Somewhere inside, it feels like you've lost a bit of your sanity. Her deer puns aren't helping either. \"Wat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, forgive me!\" she gasps, \"...I've looked through images of humanity and I believe you called it...a penis. To me, it looked like a mushroom. I never expected that someone your age would carry it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly recollect yourself, ignoring her misunderstanding. \"Yes and I'm sure you have males in your world that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't?\" she interrupts you, cocking her head. This causes you to utterly freeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJani gives a light smile. \"We don't have any males or the sort in our world. I suppose that makes you even more special and important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaping at her in disbelief, you do recall that there were only females from the hooded figures that formerly surrounded you. If only she didn't hide you underneath her robes, you could've seen whether that was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, based on the deer's expression, it doesn't seem she's lying at all. Still, this should be impossible if their species are meant to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJani widens her eyes in delight. \"Oh! I suppose since you are most curious, I will indulge you with a bit of our history! But then, you must promise to let me continue feeding you, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush a little, but nod, not necessarily liking how she breastfeeds you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow are Jani's people born?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>Long ago...a world was born in one of the many dimensions of the universe. It started with earthly nature as its first life by the overseer goddess, Gralia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody knows what Gralia looks like, but it is known that there other overseers that look after each one of their own worlds. They live to maintain balance while emphasizing free will of others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that free will can grow out of hand. Gralia looked to the other overseers and saw problems with how things are maintained. On one planet, there is overpopulation which led to war and death. On another, life wildered in the presence of other life which became too greedy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese overseers took a hands-off approach which Gralia could not accept. She felt that her children needed to know who their greater mother is. In doing so, they are able to perform actions while knowing that the overseer is always watching. While a person with bad intentions can still perform their acts, it is with the understanding that Gralia won't approve. For many, this is sufficient for them to work together and live in harmony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second thing is love. Gralia could not keep her distance and she wanted to make sure that all of her children felt loved to ensure their happiness. Each individual born is not from another but created from Gralia herself. They would rise from the clay of the Earth with different characteristics and their own uniqueness. This also helped prevent overpopulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last aspect of the life she created is equality. While perfect equality is not possible as she cannot know if one learns better than the other or becomes richer than most, Gralia offers the same gender to all. This way, physical dominance is less of a factor than growth.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's seems pretty high bar to maintain. I mean, does that mean there is never any fighting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJani shakes her head. \"Of course there is fighting. Since we all have our own unique traits, that means we also have our own egos and goals. However, there is no question that Gralia is watching over us and may at any time judge us. Therefore, there's always a second part to our thinking which makes us wonder if we are doing the right thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou narrow your eyes. \"...and I suppose taking me away from Earth is the right thing too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deer glances away and chuckles nervously. \"I see you are still upset at that. I suppose it's still too early, but I and others had the best of intentions. <i>I</i> want to make you happy, my son. Tell me, are you unhappy right now? I've heard that when a mushroom is up on Earth, they are overjoyed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clear your throat and curl your lips. \"I'm not...unhappy. I don't know to be honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then,\" she begins leaning closer to you, \"...are you dissatisfied with me so far as your mother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" you take a deep breath and blush. \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJani emits a relieved sigh. \"I'm glad to hear that. Well now, let's settle down and continue, okay? There's plenty to learn about each other and this world, but we don't need to rush, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing guided back to her chest, you nod hesitantly. Although it's still strange to be naked, you don't know how to begin explaining your discomfort to her in a way that will make them understand. As such, you simply try to keep your lower half away as you latch on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt becomes hard though as she wants to snuggle closer to her. You let out a muffled grunt as you feel her soft legs gently touching your member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?</span></div></div>",

Although you didn't want to admit it, this whole situation is arousing for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJani seems to notice something is up as she feels you tense and your lower member strained, poking her a few times.

It'll go down after a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deer frowns, unconvinced. \"When we tried doing our research, we had limited scope of Earth and couldn't see everything going on.

If I consider you as my mother, then it would be wrong to help me in that way. Even nursing me at my age is too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJani cocks her head, clearly not understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and try to elaborate. At least, talking helps to keep your lower half calmer. \"Well, it goes like this back in my world: A mother takes care of her children, but when it comes to anything s-sexual with their child, it's something that is disallowed by pretty much every major country.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sexual?

Although I want to be your mother, I'm still far from being your real mother if that helps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes twitch and you can't deny her own reasoning given that laws and culture would be different over here.

Looking at her, she seemed to be on the larger side in terms of body shape due to the way the cloak appears to be further spread out over the ground than, Khevi's and Jani's, and bulging out agianst the cloak at the breasts stomach &amp; hips, with a vague pear shaped outline. Her head was mostly covered in snow white fur, besides her black ears and a small amount of black fur surrounding her forest green eyes. She had long white hair which seemed to curl as it extended downward, Her face had a surprisingly youthful look, seemingly in the late 20's possibly early 30's if you had to take a guess. As much as you'd hate to admit it she looked kinda cute, with the friendly closed smile her slightly chubby cheeks adding to her cuteness. She then began to open her mouth and speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Adam, it's a pleasure to meet you my name is, Bai Yun, and I'll be more than happy to be your caregiver/mother and help you get settled on our world Ferberos.\" Her voice sounded sounded slightly soft and gentle with a very motherly and caring tone that reminded you of your own mom, which brought a smile to your face thinking about her before the feeling of tears welding up in your eyes, as you turn away from her realizing you might not get to see your mother again. Bai Yun noticed the sad look in your eyes and she began to frown as well, she knew what it was like to have things suddenly and unexpectedly taken away from her in her past. \"I know this is a lot to take in so suddenly, and I'm sorry we took you away from your past life on Earth were all of your friends and family are, but I know how it feels to lose everything.\" the emotion of her words made to turn back around look into those leaf green eyes of her's which appeared to have some sadness of her own inside of them, you knew she was telling the truth and not just trying to comfort you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I was very young cub, my real parents dropped me off at an orphanage due to being unable to financially take care of me, I then spent my youth and early adolescent years in an all girls orphanage just outside the city of Furdale, My time in the orphanage was miserable, I had very few friends and most of the girls would mock me when I was younger some due to my height and weight and other just called me ugly, I only made 2 friends during my time there, Maria a Lion, and Anna a Rabbit, they were the only 2 people who ever were friendly and honestly those two kept me sane in that hellhole. They were around for years until 6 months before I was adopted, when they themselves were adopted at the same time. I was so upset they were gone and I was alone for the next 6 months, At 14 I was finally adopted by this family of Grizzly Bears named the Kodiak's, they were wonderful people who took me in and made me feel like one of their daughter right away. The next 6 years or so I spent with them were, some of the best years of my life.\" You saw the smile that had formed on her when she mentioned her adoption family turned into another frown and it looked like her lip was beginning to quiver and her eyes began to look glassy for being close to tears, whatever happened must've devastated her, you began to feel pain in your heart for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I was 20 years old and away at college my parents took a business trip to Anthroville which is on the other side of the continent, and.....(sniff) during the continental flight(sniff)(whimper) a strong storm came....and they(Sob).\" She began to break out in tears...with her hands covering her face and she began sobbing, You felt your heart break for her and you were left speechless on what to say, You had never really been good with words when it came to comforting a grieving friend/family member so you instead got closer to her and wrapped an arm around her. She probably would've returned it had she not been crying. It took her a full minute to composed herself, and she decided to skip the ending since it was obvious what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a year and a half later were I ran into who I thought was the love of my life, a Panda named Pao Ling, he was another shining light that I thought me and him were going to spend the rest of our lives together, we dated for a 3 years and married shortly there after, then we.....(sniff) tried to have kids several times but...(Sniff)(small Sob) I miscarried 3 times. The doctors told us that I most likely will be unable to ever physically conceive cubs due to some sort of defect in my Uterus.\" She was at the point of crying once again, and just as you were about to say something she dropped the bombshell on him...\" My husband was furious he blamed me for the loss of his kids..I tried to convince him to adopt or some other way....(loud sob) but he refused...saying how he wanted to naturally conceive his kids over anything else....(Cry and Sob) and If i couldn't have kids.. the marriage couldn't last...so he divorced from me.\" Bai couldn't take it anymore and collapsed to the ground sobbing and whimpering uncontrollably. You felt teas come to your eyes as they slid down your cheeks, you got down on your knees next to her and you started going to put an hand on her shoulder again, before she shot up and gave you an extremely tight hug(unintentionally having your face smothered in her large soft breasts when she shot up) as she sobbed into your shoulder. This would've been much more awkward had she not been wearing that silk cloak and the situation been different, but you felt to upset for her to get embarrassed about it. You managed to wiggle your way out of the soft body pillows that was her chest before returning the hug yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of you were kneeling on the ground, you saw/ heard some of the other girls begin to sniff and cry including Jani who was quietly sobbing and Khevi who had a tear or two rolling down her cheek. You felt the wet spot on your shoulder expand of her tears as Bai continued to cry and whimper. You felt like you had to say something to her, she told you her life story in an effort to relate to your situation, but you found out she had lost more than you could even imagine, you now felt lucky just growing up with a present family. Khevi then appeared by your side and continued the rest of the story for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bai was then left out on the street after her husband ended up with basically everything in the law suit. She was on the street for a couple of weeks before, Jani found her starving eating out of a dumpster by our magic temple, she brought her to us and we decided to take her in and trainer her in our ways.\" Bai looked back up at Khevi and Jani and large smile formed on her face with tears still in her eyes, \"I can never thank you too enough for that, all of you girls were life savers being so friendly, and helpful to me.\" Bai said as she regained control of her emotions again. Khevi continued on with a smile on her own \" After her first 4 months she had regained not just the weight she lost, but her smile and pride, and was advancing in our magic teachings faster than anyone we've ever seen anyone before her, especially after not starting out when she was teenager like the rest of us did, she has a true talent for magic inside of her.\" This made Bai blush and smile again as she whipped the last of her tears out of her eyes. \" Aw thank you Khevi your too much.\" she said. You then unwrapped your hands around her and stood up, before reaching down to help bring her back on her feet. Jani then chimed in \"Yeah not to mention one of the largest stomachs, I swear she could eat four servings of a full meal before winding up full.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze up slightly and cringe as well, you had just helped her up and she looked indeed heavier than the rest of the girls, but you had no idea how Bai was going to react to a statement like Jani just said. To your surprise she laughed and even added in some of her own humor. \"Yeah well someones gotta eat all the delicious leftovers around here, I swear the food in the gardens is some the best I've ever had in my life, even my personal favorite Bamboo is amazing, Though I will say something weird must be in that soil plot where it grows, because I swear I've never had so much gas eating Bamboo until I came here.\" Everyone burst out laughing and even you laughed a little at the slightly embarrassing story. One of the other girls who happened to be a skunk ironically told another story. \"Bai your the only one who has ever given me a run for my money in terms of having smelly gas and that's saying something. Adam, I remember this one time when Bai was new here she had beans and bamboo on the same day and passed one of the nastiest Silent &amp; Deadly farts I've ever smelled and I was blamed for it.\" The girls all laughed again and so did you, it was rather odd to see people in relatively serious and important job such as this, who can bring someone from separate universe here with magic, who were girls nonetheless laugh about farts. Though this lax environment and comradery the girls shared it made you feel comfortable, and welcomed. Bai who was still snickering responded back, \"Sorry Stella, I didn't mean steal your thing, but just like you helped me step up my game with magic, I helped you with your flatulence game.\" It was honestly nice to see someone like Bai go through so much and still be able to smile and laugh about such a juvenile thing. You realized then you still had to decide on your caregiver, Should you just go with the friendly, big, somewhat flatulent Panda, or meet the rest of the girls and decide on everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Instead, he felt an urgent need to go backward, to regress into a happier past. Little Andy had been the perfect baby boy, the precious preschooler. a praiseworthy elementary schooler - his parents, family, and teachers always had told him as such but in recent years he had grown jaded with the prospects of an independent adult life.

He had taken an early leave when he grew bored of the colleges girls around him and found himself sipping on cup of jungle juice he had slipped out of the party with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond tipsy yet not drunk, Andrew nearly spilled his drink when a cloaked figure approached him out of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The human world is so boring is it not?\" A woman's voice asked of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Andrew slurred, still half expecting the smaller woman to be some kind of weird cop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what I said Mr. WIlde.\" The cloaked woman stated, \"You're not satisfied with your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not true.\" Andrew expressed, \"I like me for who I am. I'm just dissatisfied with....I don't know really\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you do know Mr. Wilde.\" the cloaked woman said, \"And I also know I can help you in getting away from all of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What like a study abroad program?\" Andrew asked, \"That's nice lady but I'm graduating in a couple months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cloaked woman giggled, \"It is a kind of study abroad program, the logic of those two words could apply to this opportunity.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look lady.\" Andrew slurred once more, \"I've been drinking if you haven't noticed, I'm not in the mood for word games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let me put it simply Mr Wilde.\" she said as she pulled out a large ticket arrayed with all kinds of animals paws, adult in shape, surrounding a human hand that looks noticeably smaller if not juvenile in appearance. \"I've been scouring this university for people with the openness to leave this world behind. I've had success among college communities of furries and adult babies but my offer has been rejected more than I had anticipated. I have some tickets to spare and you look like you could use a fresh start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm no fucking furry!\" Andrew defensively said, \"I'm not an adult baby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. But you share more in common with them than you realize.\" she said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In what way?\" Andrew asked. He didn't know anyone on campus that was into ABDL at all, but he knew the furries had a club for themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're considering taking my ticket\" she slyly said. \"What's stopping you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just, I just would like to know details.\" Andrew said \"I'm up for an adventure but this is all too weird to not ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sympathize.\" the woman said, \"But the ticket would lose its validity if I told you. This is your only chance to take my offer and there's no going back should you do so. That's <b>all</b> I can say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew drank the last bit of his jungle juice, needing the courage if not simply to buy time for his inevitable answer. What did Andrew do?</span></div></div>",

A mysterious figure appears out of nowhere wearing an old cloak. That sounded like something out of a DnD game or story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she offers a mysterious ticket with no description about what its for only that it is one way while talking about furries and adult babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nuts, crazy, insane to even take up the offer! He should say no walk away and maybe call the cops!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet. Maybe it was the alcohol talking but she seemed sincere and he could \u201csense\u201d that she truly meant him no harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Andrew sets the glass down and grabs the ticket. He could hear the smile in the cloaked woman\u2019s voice as she spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcellent! She cried clasping his hand that held the ticket. A part of the mans\u2019 mind noticed that her hands felt, weird. Inhuman. But maybe that was just the drink or she was wearing some sort of weird glove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can promise you won\u2019t regret this decision. She said honestly excited and happy. Despite himself Andrew felt his lips turn into a small smile at her words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, I hope so. So, when is the trip? And is it by buss, or train, or whatever? What do I need to bring? The woman giggled. You don\u2019t need to bring anything and all you have to do is relax, don\u2019t fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrews brain hardly registered the words before he felt the ticket in his hand began to heat up before a strange powerful force grip his body. Wha?!? He cried doubling over in pain as he felt his stomach churn and his libs be pulled in every direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon\u2019t fight Andrew! The woman cried wrapping him in a hug. It hurts! He coughed out his voice strained form the pain. I know sweetie. Just focus on my voice. Its ok. It will be over soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew suddenly felt a, well a \u201cpulling\u201d sensation covering his whole body before a feeling a weightlessness before he blacked out. He could have sworn he heard someone shouting before losing consiousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew groaned as he woke up. Immediately he could feel a headache coming on and he clutched his head moaning in pain. The sun coming from the windows was painful so he pulled the covers over himself. The bed was comfy at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes snapped open. His collage bed was nice, but not this comfy! He wasn\u2019t in his room! He pulled the covers off of his head and immediately noticed the unfamiliar ceiling and the unfamiliar room. Though the glare of the sun and his own drowzyness kept him from getting a good look at for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere am I?\u201d He thought trying to remember last night before parts of it came back. \u201cOh.\u201d He groaned as he remembered. \u201cRight the study abroad thingy.\u201d He muttered. Maybe this was the hotel room?  She did say soemthing about leaving that night so maybe he just couldn't remeber the trip? Groaning he moved to get out of bed and get some answers, and breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes he notice anything different?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's up to you of who gets to be your mother, and you get to decide how it happens. You can just have her adopt you as human, or she can unbirth you. You can even show up as a furry of your choice. No Shrunken chapters in the story though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings that are not allowed:<br>\r\n1. Vore of the main character (this does not include unbirth.) And no loopholes to try and vore them.<br>\r\n2. Death of any characters. (Absorption of other characters and letting them reform as they were is acceptable.)<br>\r\n3. Hard vore and gore.<br>\r\n4. Going in depth on diaper usage. (Yes, I will allow diaper usage, but only brief mentions of it.)<br>\r\n5. Child abuse, or any other type of abuse.<br>\r\n6. Unloving and hateful characters. (If they're there for a brief moment to be vored, that's fine, but no keeping them around and no prolonging the time they get vored just to torture the main character.)<br>\r\n7. Turning the main character into an unloving and/or hateful person, or making them a villain.<br>\r\n8. Having the main character being unbirthed and regressed to before conception to never be born.<br>\r\n9. Torture of any sort.<br>\r\n10. Scenes with blood and/or gore.<br>\r\n11. Cock vore.<br>\r\n12. Gender Swap of any characters unless they are inside the womb. (You can say that you were a human boy and appeared as a female furry. I'll leave an option for that.)<br>\r\n13. Not letting the main character gain a mother at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese rules may have things added in the future so be sure to look them over from time to time.
