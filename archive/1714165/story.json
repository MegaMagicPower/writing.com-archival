You were a friendly and easygoing guy, but was also headstrong, tough, never backed down from a challenge and was always willing to help those in need.  As a kid, you grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma with your parents.  You had always liked to animals, especially dogs.  When you were 9, you got a Black Labrador puppy for Christmas, who you named Bandit because of his mischievous nature.  Sadly, when you were 16, Bandit mysteriously vanished and you never saw him again.  You had a difficult time coping with the loss.  Shortly after turned 18, you decided to enlist in the US Marines, and went on to serve as a highly-skilled special forces soldier for several years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were currently riding with your team in a small convoy of Humvees, traveling along a desolate desert highway in Kandahar.  You were riding shotgun in the lead Humvee with a few of your teammates.  You had just completed a grueling assignment and was on your way back to base.  You continually scanned the roadway and the surrounding desert, keeping an eye out for any possible threats.  You had seen a lot of nasty stuff during your time in the Marines, leaving you hardened and fearless.  You were about 50 miles from the base when suddenly,</span></div></div>",

You possess short brown hair, pale green eyes, and are quite fit for your age as you are an active guy who loves the outdoors and enjoyed extreme sports. You are also a major animal lover, which was probably handed down by your mother's side of the family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lived with your mother and uncle on the suburbs of San Francisco, as your father worked as a company executive, and with him being a workaholic, he was often abroad for prolonged lengths of time. Not that you are complaining. You and your father aren't close, as he was always busy working and had little time for family. He could easily afford you and your mom a fancy apartment in downtown with the money he had, but your mom simply opted to stay with relatives. Your uncle is a veterinarian and opened a clinic right on the unused side lawn of his house. He practically demolished the garage and yard, building a one story house extension which would later transform into a cozy vet clinic. Your mom helped him as the receptionist and you frequently visited the clinic after school to help as much as you can. You like to socialize with people, and the pets being brought over to the clinic was definitely a plus. Dogs are definitely your favourite kind of pet. You wouldn't mind cats\u2014they are definitely cute\u2014 but nothing beats dogs. If you can, you would adopt one right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt just so happens that your uncle's friend's pet recently had a litter, and would like give one to you as a sign of thanks for helping her pet a few months ago. The woman came to the clinic with a bright smile and had a short talk with you and your family, bringing in a rather large basket filled with layers of warm blankets and the sleeping litter. They are the cutest thing ever, and you guessed that they are around 8-10 weeks of age. Looking down, you saw that it was a litter of:</span></div></div>",
