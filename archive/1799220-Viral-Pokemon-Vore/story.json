You can decide how the infection started, how it spreads, and how it can be stopped, but you may need to know how ferals act. Symptoms show that their eye color becomes a pale purple, they become ravenous for whole food, and they lose any sense of who they were and can only growl, roar, bark, instead of speech. <i>Some authors may have the infected speak however, depending on the storyline</i>.

Cold rain continued to fall into your eyes, blurring your vision during your dash within the dense forest. Your predator took heavy steps from behind, eager to catch you in its grip for whatever terrible punishment ferals hold against the poor non-infected they capture. You wouldn't stop running though, even if you had begun to deplete all of your strength from the deriving and exhausting chase. No matter how long you ran, your pursuer continued to chase you, somehow managing to keep up to your brisk speeds with its heavy form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were growing tired, feeling your legs stammering for balance with each step as your breath was harder and harder to catch properly, drying your throat out. Your heart felt as if another pounding beat would cause it to burst from your chest. You take a turn in the cluster of trees within the forest, almost slipping on the wet ground as the storm's downpour continued its rage. Twisting around and laying your back to a tree trunk, you remain still and quiet, sitting down while listening if your attacker was close by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSplashing steps splattered from behind you, and a low growl emanated around which made you cringe. It wouldn't be long for that infected <i>Pinsir</i> to know where you were hiding. Peeking around the side of the wooden trunk, you watch as a large brown shelled Pinsir roams around while listening out through the rain for you. Drool seeped down from the vertical toothed maw as its eyes glows an odd shade of purple with its facial expression being in wild starvation. The bright gaze made your pursuer seem all the more intimidating of a predator. Some animal's meal for this Pinsir is the <i>last</i> thing you want to become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, it turns, seeing your muzzle poke out from behind the tree. You curse yourself and get up to run once again as the Pinsir dashes forward at you, lowering its head and opens the two large crab-like claws formed upon its cranium.

For some reason, this thing was much faster than you and was capable of preserving a substantial amount of energy, probably due to the fact that it has eaten a large number of ill-fated pokemon with its gravid weight to bolt this fast. Their entire digested bodies are likely the reason that this Pinsir resided so much power, having its muscles expand and nourished with its prey's energy while having such an cannibalistic personality kept its blood pumping with adrenaline. The rainstorm and tree obstacles didn't aid you in any way either. Waves of scattering droplets struck down on you, seemingly to beat you down lightly to startle your sight. Scattered wilderness and debris littered the muddy puddles, forcing you to struggle every so often with a fallen tree or large tears of land; even hidden roots attempted to trip you. The large oak tree neared, and the slimy snarls of the infected creature behind you grew louder. You tried hiding from the monster and that trick failed miserably, and you wouldn't have the time to climb a tree unless you wanted to fall back down into its drooling mouth. You trembled at the image of the Pinsir roaming the forest with a fat shelled belly, knowing well aware that you would be squirming inside to digest into its built form. As risky as it sounded, you had to fight the Pinsir if you wished to survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging your hindpaws into the wet ground, you manage to brake yourself along the slick terrain to turn and face your enemy, although, the Pinsir was already prepared for an attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts head had already been pointed forward with claws gaping open until it rams into you, tackling your body forward into the tree you had previously been running toward. You howl in pain as the claws grip around your waist with your arms pinned in their grasp as you crash into the tree. Your back remained stuck to the tree, as the impact of the tackle slams the backside your head and spine into the wooden trunk. The pain stung sharply, stunning your vision and awareness into mere fuzzy pictures that faded in and out of your sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDazed, you were easily vulnerable to the Pinsir as it releases the head claws, causing you to fall against your rump in front of the successful beast. You groan from the pulsing headache that it gave you as the Pinsir stands above you, letting the drool strings from its mouth to drip onto you. The Pinsir peered down at the stunned prey it towered above, eyeing your male body up and down to embrace of where to start its meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then feel...</span></div></div>",

Your vision is recuperating from its blurry state, only until everything suddenly goes dark. Wet walls push against the sides of your head, squishing your face together while steamy air vapors over it. A pale, pink tongue brushes under your chin to slather your muzzle in a gooey substance as a strange deep moan echoes around you. You wince at the disgusting squelching running over you head, endeavoring you to try and pull out wherever you were trapped inside. Your brain still ached from the tree's impact, scattering your sense to struggle your comprehension of what was really happening. The squishy surfaces clench at your entire head, yanking on it as a slimy tentacle slaps over your face again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, the Pinsir murrs in glee with bloated cheeks as your body loosely sticks out from it shoulders down. It grabs your arms and presses together against your sides, pulling you in forward to devour your neck into its maw. You feel a shift and your head slides forward, receiving a bath by the pulsating tongue while the soft clenching walls around you yank down. After your shoulders are squeezed through, you manage to force your dizziness away, giving you the time to realize what was occurring. You try to move your pinned arms, but they remained caught in the grip of the Pinsir's mouth, and your legs had been lifted up, incapable of touching the ground to be left to kick the air helplessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou angrily grunt and attempted to yell, but no room appeared in the Pinsir's throat for you to open your mouth. Pulling more of you in, your torso is devoured into the vertical toothy maw, and the clawed hands leave your arms to hold your legs in place as your waist is ingested inside. The tongue thrashes outward, gliding and sweeping across your crotch area to unwillingly elicit a recoiling gasp out of your muzzle by the sensitive feeling. You didn't truly desire to be pleasured in such a demonic way, but your body refused your involuntary thoughts and thrives with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour member pokes out, throbbing at each touch of the tongue as the tasting muscle begins to juggle around your blue furred sac about, teasing you. The infected murred at the bag's fuzzy texture and flavor, practicing the weight of your wincing balls by juggling them around some. Instead of your legs kicking and struggling to free your body, they bent at their knees while occasionally twitching in such physical joy. You didn't want it to end this way, but it was better being swallowed whole pleasurably then being torn into a gory pile of limbs to be eaten bit by bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour testicles got the best of you while you growled loudly, releasing their seed out into the Pinsir's mouth to wash in and over-flood with. Spewing out from the mouth, you unwillingly hump your knotted doghood into the tongue, squeezing out any remainders for your own enticement to be finished with your last closing moments. Was it supposed to end like this? Was your entire life meant to lead up to this point? Defeated and swallowed down by this Pinsir for you to hump your way down into its stomach, forever to be used as mere belly fat? You whimper woefully once reality overtakes you. There was no hope for you to escape, and by living alone in the wilderness, no one would miss you or even know of your existence. Knowing this sorrowful factor, you regretfully submit, ceasing any to all struggles. Without a struggling Lucario, the brown shelled anthro points its head upward, letting your legs and twitching paws to sink down into its depths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>D-Dang it...Rgghh...</i>\" Your mind speaks out to yourself, having trouble to even think anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your nose tip presses against a fleshy flooring, your head reaches the Pinsir's awaiting hot stomach, growling for food. A brown shelled bulge sported out from the outside of the Pinsir for the infected pokemon to press its clawed hands on the protruding gut, rubbing and squeezing the outer lumps of your body. The tongue licks at your foot pads, cleansing them before sending them down into the Pinsir's purring throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of your wet body arrives at the stomach, curling in and somehow managing to fit inside the tight space compacting around your doomed furry body. The heated and soft cavern walls press against your body, as you feel an outside force pat your soon-to-be-digested form. This was it. This was your demise. Your small adventure through these woods have ended you up with an ejaculated prick, a saliva covered body balled up inside a Pinsir's stomach as bubbling fluids begin to fill the sac. The fizzing juices spread around your lower half and stop, ready to work on your body on up. The belly jiggles around, bouncing with diagonal swishes, insinuating that the newly fat Pinsir was walking. Its hands still continue to squeeze through the tight walls, feeling you lightly wriggling within the sloshing liquid from the chamber's shakes. The musky air is depleting with your panting sobs wasting it all. The oxygen leaves you, and you are left to faint within the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Pinsir sat down with its back against the tree, letting a large, brown round belly sag out in between its opened legs. Burping, the tongue parts from the vertical toothy lips, hanging down lazily as it drips more of the once tasting saliva and Lucario cum. The infected Pinsir pats a clawed hand on the gut, pressing in and feeling the flesh from it droop slightly over its claw-fingers as a twitch from the body encased inside it moves. It purrs from its victim's weak squirms as they soon die out and the stomach juices overtake the Lucario's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rain finished its downpour while the Pinsir fell asleep, blissfully digesting you away.</i></span></div></div>",

Shaking off your dizziness, you look down your muzzle to witness a disturbingly massive penis poking at your mouth that stretched across from the Pinsir's crotch. Hot pre-cum spurted out in a single, thick glob onto your nose-tip, eliciting a spinal tremble to shatter down your body. Before you could even react, the shelled being had already grasped your wrists to hold up them against the tree as the Pinsir's mighty cock pushed forward and welcomed itself into your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crustacean thrusted in, pushing your head back to the tree as it retracted his waist right out. The length of the rod tunneled its way over your tongue and too close for comfort of a ways down your throat. You cough out the taste, only to receive it again as it humped into your mouth once more, brushing the long flesh of meat against your taste buds. Its waist movements began to increase, bucking forward and backward at your head to only leave you sitting submissively at the feral's mercy. You tried kicking your legs in retaliation, but its heavy shelled armor took whatever damage you tried to inflict as its mad humping spree continued to shovel down its cock deeper into your esophagus. The infected feral began to suddenly growl out loud, gritting its teeth together as drool sploshed from the toothy mouth onto your face. The hot slime coated you in the extensive strands that unwillingly roused your hormones. Your own member was becoming aroused, for it gladly poked out from its slit and throbbed from the intense heat of the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tip of the Pinsir's member pressed at the back of your throat, pulling back, squeezing its way back deeper again. Pre-cum was already dripping in small droplets, sticking to your mouth and lubricating it to create a very easy and sensual ride for the horny Pinsir. Your legs twitch and thrash out soft kicks of reflexes as you found yourself starting to moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>C-Curse this infected feral...This is just...h-h-humiliating...</i>.\" You jeered yourself in your own thoughts. Now you even regretted coming into this forest, only to get a mouth-full of cock and highly likely to end up as this Pinsir's next lunch. The tight, pinning grip on your wrists began to increase in strength, hurting deeply as the Pinsir's thrusting waist kept colliding with your head. Your skull bashes into the wood at a steady pace, ramming into the tree trunk over and over again while the penetrating member violates your mouth with powerful humps. Your knotted canine cock bounces and slaps against your abdomen with each pound, shaking violently in the mad spur of your involuntary blowjob. Finally, the Pinsir pushed in one more time, ejecting out its long awaited semen. The white flood erupts inside your mouth, traveling down your throat that almost brought you to choking by the massive dispersal. The Pinsir releases you, yanking out its satisfied member from your mouth, letting a strand of Pinsir seed to stretch from its bulbous cock-tip to your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gag out the rest of the goo from your mouth as the Pinsir grabbed its shaft once more, fapping any remaining cum to shoot out onto your face. You fell to your hands and knees, spitting the cum out while wiping your face of the warm slime. The entire moment derailed your strength to the point of exhaustion, tiring each and every muscle within your sweating body to cringe under the Pinsir's mighty power. Suddenly, you felt the flat, spherical foot of the Pinsir stomp down onto your back and press you down to the wet dirt floor, and remain stunned in weak fatigue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shift hovers above, giving you a slight and odd sensation at your...</span></div></div>",

Before you could jerk away, the pucker gapes open as the Pinsir sits more downward, sucking your head inside its anus! Disturbed and confused, you struggle within the dark sphincter of the infected's ass. \"<i>What's happening</i>?\" You engagingly wondered. Was this thing actually shoving you up its...anus? You heard rumors that infected pokemon used sexual related organs to down their prey, but you never expected it to be real! What would this mean? Was this how you were meant to go away in this world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the time of devouring your head into the hole, you press your hands at the ring, pushing against the feral\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lower cheeks to free yourself, only to have your hands sucked in with you. The odor floods your nostrils as your head works its way up into the Pinsir; your shoulders trail behind it all and squeeze inside. The Pinsir lowers its head and torso, lifting its rump into the air to leave your legs to rise off from the ground. Gravity aids your consumer as your lean torso seeps closer into the brown crab creature, leaving your legs to kick and flail aimlessly in the air. The Pinsir shakes its rump, swishing your body from side to side in the air to wedge you deeper into the asshole. Seeping up your waist, your black legs slowly sink into the stretching walls of the the anthro crab's rectum, all until arriving at your foot paws. The cruel Pinsir teases them by flexing his pucker in and out, feeling them writhe in anguish as you form quite a noticeable bulge in its body, allowing the Pinsir to rub and become increasingly pleasured from the erotic feeling. Using your feet as a dildo for his ass, it continues to suck them in and out until you struggled no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEscape was futile now, and the Pinsir had clearly already won. Being drained of energy by the prolonged chase in the storm and suddenly being raped tuckered your body into almost complete motionless. You know you are doomed, and you had fooled yourself into thinking that you could ever survive in this horrible apocalypse. The black paws disappear from the pucker as the crustacean stood, sporting a large brown belly. It places its hands against, lifting it up and dropping it, watching it jiggle out. You feel yourself curled into the hot tight stomach walls as they converge on you, squeezing you until there was no room left. The shifts of gravity always changed while you felt the hard hands of the Pinsir pick up its added new weight, then dropping you to stare at how you sag and vibrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whine within the tight vicinity of its small stomach. Acids began to rise up in the dark steamy sac, pooling through any remaining small crevices that lied open. The thick fluids bubble at your curled hide, forcing you to faint away with the Pinsir's bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hours later, the infected Pinsir woke up from a long and needed nap under a tree. The rain storm had stopped and the bright sun shines through the trees to awaken the infected being. The brown creature happily looks down at its belly in satisfaction which has decreased in massive size from digesting its Lucario meal overnight. It suddenly feels a pulse at its rump. Squatting down, its pucker opens, pouring a dark steamy sludge of what was left of the dog's body to plop down into a mashed pile. Dropping the last of the Lucario's remains into the pile while releasing a quick moan, the Pinsir stands back up, heading out to the forest as the feces slowly decompose into the soil. The Lucario made for an excellent sex-toy, and a better meal for the Pinsir's ravenous anus. It was simply just another victim for the crustacean's ass where many others have fallen.</i></span></div></div>",

Although, you were sprinting too fast towards the tree which may cause turning to lead to slipping. Digging your hindpaws into the mud, you skid yourself to a rough stop, right before you almost collide the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blow a sigh of relief until barking a roar of agony. The Pinsir had still been dashing from behind you, preparing a sharp head-butt from his claws. Your body thankfully fits in between its claws, but suffered the hard dome of the Pinsir's noggin as you launch with the infected's mad dash forward. Slamming into your back, you strike face-first into the tree anyway for you to hit your head and body against the wooden wall, jogging your brain back and forth inside your skull that almost made you throw up from the sheer force. Reconditioning and endeavoring to break free from the claws' vice grip, you pull and strain every muscle in your body, but remain trapped with your arms pinned at your sides. The Pinsir tightens its grasp, picking you off the trunk and head-butting forward again, slamming you into the tree again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are constantly pummeled into the tree, each time making your limbs and consciousness numb up to weaken your willpower down. After one final crash into the wood splitting tree, the Pinsir drops you from its massive claws, allowing you to fall face forward on the tree, sliding chest down. Lying on your torso, you breathe heavy wheezes of air as you horrifyingly feel something wet dab at your footpaws. A tongue strokes through your three toed footpaws, lubricating your pads in clear sticky saliva. You groan and tried to move, but every muscle in your body aches and denies any movement you hope to muster. Hard shelled hands grab your legs from behind, lifting them up higher to bring your feet in front of your soon-to-be predator's face. The vertical mouth softly nibbles at your paws, poking them with its teeth and coerce them to wriggle within the tasting maw. Immediately afterwards, the hungry Pinsir slurps in, causing your body to slide back and enter its stretching mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt slurps once more, bringing more of your legs into its jaws for its tongue to brush back and forth over, delighting your rare flavor. Your rump is squeezed into the mouth while your arms slide past you, remaining at the sides of your head as your hips gain height in the air. You desperately attempt to grab anything to pull yourself out, but the mud simply goes through you forepaws and slip you even further back. The Pinsir then chomps forward, bringing most of your torso in as it lifts its head up for the assistance of gravity. You feel the wet drooling lips rise up your neck and around your head. Your blue ears fold back as your last view of the outside world is slowly shrinking within the dark vertical toothy frame of the Pinsir\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mouth. After your whimpering head slides back into its throat, the infected creature places a single clawed hand around your arms, pushing them down before closing its stuffed mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour feet touch the surface of its stomach, causing your environment to dwell away from you. Your fleeing dash for freedom and horrible decision have led you to become another mere meal for this beastly feral, soon to be broken down to fit its shelled hide to toughen the creature even more than it was now. Because of you, it could inflict more havoc among non-infected and devour them just the same. You groan in defeat, fully aware of your fat transforming doom that lied close-by. Fainting, the Pinsir belches aloud, sitting down on its own rump to stroke its well fed gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Pinsir lays on its side, moaning while letting its large belly sag out in front of it. Luckily for the Pinsir, its prey was foolish enough to stop its chase for an easy catch. Maybe it had finally given up like many other meals the Pinsir had devoured beforehand. Nothing stood in its way in claiming its prize, whereas it was rewarded with an audible gurgle to rumble from the feral's domed gut, working over the dog's body for a pleasurable digestion. Licking the drool from its face, the Pinsir closes its purple eyes for rest as its insides began to boil the Lucario's body for nutrients. Placing a single hand on its gut, the infected crab anthro rubs its shelled gut until falling into joyful slumber.</i></span></div></div>",

You bound forward at the tree, hopefully able to climb it to escape the oncoming infected crustacean instead of ending up as its furry wiggling meal. But once your forepaws touch the barked surface of the tree, they instantly slip from the water, causing you to collide into it face first! Slamming into the tree trunk, the force of the impact sends you back to where you had jumped, miraculously landing on your feet for an awkward stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, your mind twists your world in a mad spiral while your eyes struggle to focus. You feel your head give out and grow light headed to the point where you begin to stagger around, striving to keep your balance from the pain of running into the tree. The entire environment swirls as your muscles ache in malaise. Inevitably groaning in defeat, you faint, falling downward to the muddy ground on your back, unconscious. The ramming Pinsir behind you skids to a halt in front your body, surprised yet purely satisfied that its meal knocked itself out. It listened to your subconscious whines of anguish, pleasured that it has so easily conquered you. It lowers down to inhale your scent, breathing the aroma of your delicious canine body. Its impatient tongue disperses from its toothy maw and slides over your muzzle, taking your flavor with a menacing swipe. Retracting back the tongue, the Pinsir murrs at your taste, however finds your body to not be at the best of conditions seeing that you were slathered in mud. Yet, the infected knew a better way to take in your faint form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwisting around, the Pinsir crouches its waist downward, placing its clawed hands over its butt cheeks in a tight grasp. Squeezing them apart, the Pinsir's pulsating pucker opens up slightly as it bends down to touch your footpaws. With a little suction motion, the paws slowly gulp up into the Pinsir's rump, stretching around your legs as they're pulled upward into the murky sanctum. The brown shelled anthro growls in pleasure as your waist suck up into the musty hole. It makes quick progress on your hips, easing your furry chest up as your head approach its demise. And after swallowing your muzzle in, the Pinsir stands back up, removing his hands from his rump and onto the jiggling belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>After a few minutes of pleasuring massages on its shelled belly, the infected Pinsir lays on its back with its arms and legs spread wide open for the feral's protruding gut to sag out, dozing off into a deep slumber in the soft forest rain. It was an excellent vanquished meal, and the infected Pinsir wishes that all of its prey were just as foolish as the Lucario was. In fact, muffled bubbling noises squelched deep inside its stomach, pacting together to turn the idiotic dog into belly fat. It was the easiest meal of all to capture.</i></span></div></div>",

Bee-lining through the woods until coming up with a new tactic was a more probable solution. You twist your leg to the side, ready to lose the incoming Pinsir, but alas, you lose your footing against the slick mud and slip to hit the ground. You splash in the wet dirt, gliding off to the side of the tree. You manage to wipe the mud from your face, only to get tackled by the Pinsir, slamming your entire body back into the mud! You roar in anger as you have a grapple fight with the infected feral, trying to avoid it from pinning you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt grabs your shoulders and bashes its massive claws at your skull, throwing you to the ground, disoriented. You're then grabbed again by its menacing claws, thrown to the ground face first for another rough landing. You crash into the mud with the Pinsir hopping on top of you in a painful impact, crushing your weakened form under the heavy weight. It pins your shoulders down while mounting on top of your backside with an uncomfortable bulge poking in between your firm butt cheeks. <i>This thing...was going to rape you</i>! Attempting to avoid being raped, you struggle in the tight clench, waving your arms along the dirt while flailing your legs. However, the Pinsir just bucks forward, stabbing his meaty shaft into your rump, releasing a loud yelp to escape your mouth. He pumps in again, this time, much harder and faster, squeezing his member deep between your thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour legs quiver, causing you to feel sick to your stomach as the rod of meat snakes its way through your anus. The shelled anthro began humping against your waist, sliding back and forth, leaking pre into your crack, spewing down into your ass tunnel. You curl your hands into fists, gritting the dirt in heat. Your breathing increased in speed and vigor, as with it, so did the Pinsir's humping. The crustacean flopped its tongue out, swinging it into the air back and forth with each pump, slopping out strands of drool onto your yellow furred back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter one final buck, white thick liquid erupted from his tip, pouring into your anal tunnel. The Pinsir shakes his waist, squishing all of his seed out as you cry out barks of agony and pleasure. Before you could manage to try and crawl away, the infected pokemon forcefully pulls his member out, emanating a loud pop. You collapse back onto the ground, exhausted and humiliated. The Pinsir only growls as his member drips the last drop of cum. You try to lift your chest off the ground by your arms, but the Pinsir simply places an armored foot against your back, slightly pushing it forward to cause you to pathetically fall back down<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt, the shelled pokemon grasps his cock once more, and places it at your\u2026</span></div></div>",

Kicking only got more of your legs and tail wedged in as the member began to grow in size, bulging a round bump from your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sucked back again, this time, all the way past your waist.

And with one last stroke, the infected feral roared in the rainstorm, ejaculating all of his seed to the muddy ground, spewing white streams across the forest floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pinsir grunted and turned away from the white puddles, to roam the forest for another victim to devour.</i></span></div></div>",

You heard an awful groaning come from the beast during its wobbly posture, having a difficult time keeping its weighted balance with the dizzying impact.

The brown crab shook off the disorientation and tensed itself, ready to attack once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to charge forward and attack, fully aware that running wouldn't save you.

The clear slime oozes out from the Pinsir's mouth onto your head, ready to eat. You thrash your hands out at the heavy padding at its arms pinning you down, but seemed to have no effect on the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bring a knee into the waist of the Pinsir, yet even that was concealed by an armored shell. You struggle and shake every limb of your body, not wanting to be eaten by some brainless beast. The mouth suddenly gapes around you, feeling the edges of the teeth poke at your cheeks. The perverted tongue makes its way to your lips, poking at them until forcing itself into your mouth. It tasted all around, wiggling and constantly sticking its own saliva in and out of your mouth as you could only reply in a muffled yell until it fully pulled all the way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crustacean pushed you in further up to your torso, leaving a bulge to bloat out of its neck. It lifted its head up, making a quick meal out of you with your entire body descending into the dark wet depths waiting to consume you. Your legs kick, tail thrashes, and you screamed through your teeth. Your feet arrive, and the Pinsir gladly cleanses them of the mud, sucking on each pad and smothers its tongue all around your fur. You couldn't help but twitch them from the tickling feeling, scrunching them in the sensitive touch. After so much drenched suckling, the Pinsir swallows your footpaws, letting your entire body to slide into the stomach for digestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kick at the slick walls as much as possible within your immobile curled up state, but only seemed to pleasure the Pinsir as it stroked its belly, purring out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Pinsir slapped the round belly, feeling the foolish canine inside it struggle helplessly within the pooling stomach juices filling inside the organ. The Lucario whimpered through the muffling flesh of the Pinsir's fleshy gut, soon to rot away and turn into nutrients for the sick beast. The feral feels its stomach begin to churn its acids, and the Lucario stopped kicking at the stomach walls. The single act gifts the fat Pinsir with the achievement of vanquishing yet another meal. Waddling over to a tree, the Pinsir lays back to let nature take its course as it placed a hand on the protruding gut, rubbing the enlarged flesh as it belched out loud. The Lucario had proved to be a tricky course to catch, having the predator slam into the tree earlier before for it to have an opening for an attack, but the canine was too weak and too slow to avoid sliding down the Pinsir's jaws anyways. The furry pup was a delicious meal, and the Pinsir doubted it would get such a decadent dinner again. If only Lucarios were more common.</i></span></div></div>",

Its armor was much tougher than you thought, and you would definitely suffer the consequences for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head claws bite down, trapping your neck in between them to cause you to gag out loud. You place your hands on the massive piercing shells to try to pry them open, but to no avail, they remained pinched together around your throat as you had dire trouble with breathing. The Pinsir lifts its head up, also lifting you up into the air as well. Your legs flail into the open air while you twist and turn your waist.

You feel a small, wet tentacle spread a slick, slimy feeling against your pads, causing a single yelp of sensitivity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monstrous creature browses it in between your toes and up your ankles, unwillingly making you release a growl of enticement. The lips then come closer to your hindpaws, pecking them with 'kisses' until opening up. The mouth nibbles against your feet, poking your sensitive paws with its oval row of teeth, making sure not to scratch you. It would want your entire clean body to go wiggling down its throat for an excellent belly bulge to form out. You begin to feel aroused from the soft biting, allowing your paws to get drowned into a cavern of drool, and dipping them further inside the Pinsir\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mouth. Your shaft begins to rise in size and thickness as you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re slowly lowering into the mouth of the brown crab; your feet touch the back of his throat while its tongue begins to brush up your legs, testing the flavor brought out in them. Your moan of pleasure grows louder while the Pinsir gulps more of your body in, getting to your waist. Your common sense has long ago abandoned you now that you're horny desires have flooded your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tongue squeezes in between your rump cheeks and under your tail, poking a dark blue pucker hole hiding in the tight crevice.

Pointing its head upwards, your own head disappears into the growling mouth, dripping your own cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour senses felt as if they were in heaven.

Your weak mind could care less about your sanity now.You ball up within the stomach, feeling the walls tighten together, squishing your body even closer as you flutter your eyes in physical joy.

Its tasty seed served as an excellent sauce for the canine meal, which also serves for a well-stout course to fill the Pinsir's belly. Loud gurgles and lack of movements signify that its prey had fainted away finally, digesting quickly as the Pinsir purred in bliss.</i></span></div></div>",

The weighted crab anthro collides down on its backside against the puddled dirt, spurting mud to splash out from underneath the shelled being. You release a tired but ready huff, preparing yourself as you slowly walk over to the fallen Pinsir. It appeared that it was still stunned from the attack, lying against its back while grumbling out noises of discontentful pain. Discovering your lucky victory, you heave out an exhale of relief, turning away to leave the Pinsir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething holds you back though, as if there was a rope tied around you and the Pinsir which tugged you back if you ventured to far. You halted and looked back at the barely conscious infected creature. If you left it there, it would just regain its composure and track your scent. After it gobbled you down, how many other pokemon would join you in its stomach, digesting away for the Pinsir to just grow stronger and eat even more people? It had to be taken care of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou regretfully walk back to the groaning feral, prepared for what was necessary. You focused your aura into your hands, ready to strike at the Pinsir's heart. But you stopped yourself from doing that too. What was wrong with you? This thing has probably killed or infected countless others. Although, you couldn't help but feel a little pity towards the anthro. It used to be someone just like you that had a terrible occurrence into falling victim to a horrible force. Maybe you could end it like other non-infected have; <i>by eating them before they ate you</i>. Vore was always an open option, but you never tried it before. It seemed disturbing to swallow something whole and alive, but all pokemon were capable of doing it. Only carnivorous pokemon used it to survive, and only a few demented psychopaths ate things that way for pleasure. Swallowing the Pinsir seemed to be the only remaining liable option, so you gulp heavily on your choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that it would be best to eat the Pinsir to be on the safer side, you grab its thick ankles and stuff its spherical feet into your outstretched mouth as you shut your eyes tightly closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taste was a little sickening at first from wet dirt, but after swiping your tongue across its soles, you actually found the flavor to be...well...enjoyable? Your jaws accommodate the size of the Pinsir's legs surprisingly enough, and you had yet to tear anything so far. Your cheeks bloat out as your tongue willingly began to lick at the plated calves. Sucking in, you brought the shelled creature to slide towards you on the wet floor which occasionally thrashes a leg in reflex. You still manage to gulp again, bringing a large majority of the Pinsir's legs in you which signifies how well things are turning out for you. By now however, the brown crab has shaken its dizziness away and quickly realizes the current situation. The newly awakened feral glares evilly as it hisses at you, kicking its legs inside your throat to force you to gag it back out. You tense your throat and mouth muscles to converge onto the shelled thighs, attempting to not release this Pinsir, otherwise, you'll suffer <i>dark</i> consequences. Yet, you press on and grab his swiping arms to bind them at his sides. Once done, you swallow its entire waist, reaching half way in this deranged process. The Pinsir hisses again, twisting and fidgeting its entire body from being furious by having to be devoured by its intended prey. Your tongue brushes along the hard shell of his back, tasting the rare flavor of the crustacean. You almost catch yourself moaning there for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts head disappears within yours, followed by its giant claws before they try to pinch at your lips when the ends sink in. Gulping the feral down, a large bulge plopped down into your stomach, giving you a large, yellow belly that sagged greatly out. You fall on your butt from the massive new weight carrying you down, rubbing the delicious meal from the outside as you feel its never-ending wriggles and struggles. Now it made sense to you why predators enjoyed vore. It felt so natural to do for some reason that you didn't have a clue of why you haven't done it to any feral within the infection in the first place! It really amazes you at the fact that your belly could even contain such a beast within such a small organ, or the fact of how amazing it felt to feel your prey strive inside it. If anyone was watching, you'd only need purple eyes to be any different than what an infected would look like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rain around you slowly dissolves into a soft sprinkle, and then finally, into nothing. The clouds in the sky above the forest broke, releasing sunlight down upon you and your furry gut. With a few more pats, you stagger up, not used to the newly added pounds just yet as you waddle back out the woods to do what you came through this forest in the first place to do.</span></div></div>",

So with being isolated for a large portion of your adulthood, you aren't sure how the infection started; in fact, no one knew. It wasn't even diagnosed as an infection until the recent behaviors of the pokemon changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some certain point of time, a supposed disease of some sort was sent out into your land, infecting only a few anthros when the epidemic hit. Apparently, once infected, the host pokemon would begin to lose all of their memories and become impossibly hungry, forgetting who they were, and who they knew to become a ravage animal! They would eat villagers, even sometimes raping their victims before devouring them, and as word has it, biting them infect them too. Some travelers and safety searchers that have past your home say that a poison was released in a river to start the infection, others say it was just another natural way for the apocalypse to occur and destroy life to start all over again, whereas a few pokemon mention something about microscopic pokemon being up to this disaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since the infected began to spread their virus in some mysterious way while avoiding eating others, the number of ferals increased, causing them to muster plentiful strength and speed as their eyes become a faint purple. They now roam the entire island, eating or infecting every living body near them. Many pokemon, like you, live in isolation from abandoning an overrun village or from other dangerous non-infected pokemon that become cannibals by the corruption of the infection has caused without even being infected. There were plenty of cannibalistic pokemon that would love a squirming Lucario to stew in their guts, so even if a traveler found their way close to your camp, you were sure to make small talk before sending them on their way. You hated the constant loneliness and fear of having to go outside for food, wondering if today was going to be your last, but what does one do in such a chaotic time? Whatever was causing this, you were sure to stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you began to pack and prepare for a region-crossing mission to save the land you lived on. You picked out food, created tools and packs for the trip, and even a few medical supplies from certain plants. You only needed one more item before taking off for your trip, and it thrived in a local forest that you knew was crawling with infected pokemon, where you had a small encounter with a Pinsir.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Walking through the wet grass, your sagging belly bounced with each step with your stomach already beginning to digest the infected Pinsir. Its motions had ended just moments ago, sending out a growl of pleasure from the churning gut. You blissfully pat the fuzzy orb as you continued through the forest. During your travels you check the spiks that adorn on your forepaws and chest. As a recently evolved young one, you had despised the sharp projections that put fear into anyone who dared to touch you, or give a handshake, or to even hug. In a spiteful rage towards them, you obtained a smooth stone and grinded it against the spike's tips, dulling them out all the way until they were mere, hard bumps. What seemed like a good act to do for your part has turned quite sour. If only you had known about the infection, you would have left the spikes there, for maybe it would save you from a feral that wouldn't risk devouring a sharp meal. Now the monsters get to have the luxury of tasting and swallowing a Lucario meal which is rare around these parts. You shudder just at the thought. Nearing the edge of a stream, you finally locate what you were looking for this entire time. A bush, flourished with rare berries, blankly sat planted on a small isle within the stream in the wide open, just for the taking. Checking the water, you browse your sight into the murky water, not even being able to see the bottom anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe recent storm must have washed mud into the river, but no matter. You remembered where parts of the water were only knee deep and besides, the berries on the other side were a necessity to your journey. Then again, you also remember an infected Dewgong had emerged from the river in a recent visit in the past. You had managed to get away before it gobbled you up in its snapping maw, but you never knew what happened to it afterwards. You hoped that it had moved on down the river since then, due to the fact that you didn't know anyone living anywhere close to this place. It probably became hungr<i>ier</i> and went after a different location for some anthro with the misfortune of being devoured by it. Risking it, you step into the flowing water, making your way in the murky creek to the tempting bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few slip ups and stammering steps, you finally reach the shore line, getting out of the water before heading towards the bush, all until you heard a distant splash. You quickly turn around to see a female anthro Vaporeon, standing in the stream with\u2026</span></div></div>",

A female Vaporeon, who appeared naked like many pokemon in your world, suddenly crouches at the shallow end, investigating your fat form with peaked interest. Her body was remarkably beautiful with a tight and tone figure; it was a shame she had only joined the ranks of animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes glimmer out brightly, even at a far distance from where you were standing, and sat with dripping wet skin to cause it to shine brightly. The Vaporeon's breasts play as eye candy for you, shining from the water with a pair of dark blue nipples protruding at their round ends. You felt your hands quiver from the sight as the dirty side of your brain ponders of how neatly they could tuck into your palms, wondering if they were as taut and squishy as they appeared to be. Continuing your vision to scan downward, you skip past her flat abdomen and pay much more attention the wide rump outline that protruded. Her lower cheeks appear to be large, but not too large for one's specific taste; as if it was the perfect size. Your hands begged to want that too. Finally, the Vaporeon's thighs disappeared under the drifting water as her thick tail stretches down to its slick fins that bob with the stream's surface. Your sheath pounded by her image, but pretty looks or not, she was still just as dangerous as any starving feral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get into a readied battle stance, but your body groans in an agitating ache from the tense movement. Placing a hand on your belly, you feel it grumble from digestion as a response. Any physical demanding motion would cause a terrible and sickening pain, making your gut queasy from the weight fizzing within the digestive liquid-filled sac. Fighting this infected anthro may be a bit difficult. Scratch that; <i>will</i> be difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith what seems to be a joyful growl, the Vaporeon dives into the water, blasting like a jet towards you at a blinding speed! You focus and collect a large ball of aura energy in the palms of your hands, fearing if you'll be able to even hit such a rapid target, especially with the mist she was splashing around her. Without losing concentration, you aim directly in front of you as the water type jumps from the stream to attack you. You launch the blast of energy, watching it...</span></div></div>",

Blasting a ray of water from her mouth, the powerful streaming liquid collides into your aura sphere in mid-air, exploding the ball of packed energy directly in front of you before it could be reach anywhere close to the Vaporeon. The blast of the explosion sent your body crashing onto your backside, forcing your belly to ache in distressful pain as you grind into the sandy ground. You groan from the pressuring feeling as you place a paw atop the filled gut, kneading around to comfort it as you wipe the soot off from your face with your other hand. Waving the smoke in front of you away, your vision turns dark again, but by the shadow of a Vaporeon woman that suddenly surrounds you this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a startled eep, you attempt stand back up, however your arms couldn't manage to pick your heavy weight up. They quickly give out, inevitably slamming you back down to the ground once more. The Vaporeon walks closer to you with her breasts bouncing by each step to taunt your hormones again. The two dark navy-blue nipples pointed out from her chest as she looked down at your feeble body; her hips swaying from side to side and her tail seductively brushing the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwe struck, you remain on the isle surface looking up as the feral licks her lips, letting a drop of saliva leak from the mouth to drip from her chin and onto your head. Your legs twitched in recoil by the erotic feeling. Feeling a sense of compelling arousal and mystified bewilderment, you blankly gaze at the seductive and wet figure standing so close to you as you inhale her foresty scent. The act has you sitting still, acting a little excited as your sanity dissolves into curiosity for what this feral plans.

Thin clear strands of drool bend in the deep moist cavern of her jaws, oozing down as the tongue throbs eagerly for your filling body. The victorious Vaporeon softly placed her hands at the back of your head, all until pushing it forward to stuff your face into her watering jaws. Your muzzle squishes into her tongue, cushioning it as it laps under your chin, enjoying your rare pokemon flavor. You jolt your neck and started pressing her shoulders away with your forepaws now that your survival instincts were kicking back in, but her grip released one of her hands to lower down at your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a quick grope on your crotch, causing you to twitch in unwilling shock as she fondles her delicate fingers around your drooping soft sac, enticing your shaft to erect out by rubbing her thumb against the crease line. As if your body was acting on its own, your hands went from pushing against her shoulders for freedom, to lowering down and grasping her round breasts, fondling the heavy sky-blue orbs while the Vaporeon easily enticed you full length to erect out from its hiding place. Her breasts felt better than you had imagined. The plump jugs fit into your cupped hands like heavy putty, juggling and testing their weight as her stout nipples poked into your palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hate the fact that you were becoming so easily seduced by an infected feral, yet your mind has undergone such pleasured haziness of adoration that you could care less, all the while, you moan within her swallowing jaws. Your head dives deeper into the squelching and gulping walls consuming your body, and is fully pulled in close to the stomach's sphincter. After having your fuzzy belly thoroughly licked, the fat lump of meat is sent sliding down into her throat, taking your hands away from her wondrous pair of blue globes and into her stretching mouth to your disappointment. Her hands grip your throbbing member, rubbing and cradling the long, meaty pole with her teasing fingertips for a final taunt to your genitals as you humped your waist into her hands submissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could rise to your beloved climax, she lifts her head back in the air, sinking your waist into her mouth as she gives it a single and final lick for your last treatment of pleasure before it goes down her throat like the rest of her meal. Your legs slip inside, and finally, she closes her mouth after your foot paws plop inside, writhing inside as the throat tunnel works them down with your curling, collective body sitting helplessly in the stomach. You tighten yourself together inside her belly, slightly disappointed from being denied the ability to orgasm to the Vaporeon that easily defeated you with only her sheer looks and speed. You wouldn't give up though as you placed your hands and feet along the slimy walls, pushing out against them while you groan in pain. Nothing loosened though, and you were rewarded for your weak efforts by the stomach walls actually becoming tougher, contracting closer together to force your limbs to give out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sob as your muscles surrender by the mere power of just the Vaporeon's stomach with digestive fluids began to rise within the steamy chamber. The enzyme pool began to fizz at your lower body, causing you to pass out from exhaustion and air depletion with the juices literally sucking out the energy left draining inside you. Your last sense of feeling was of the rubbing hands that circled around your mighty bulge. You release your final pant of air, disappointed that you survived for nothing except as an infected's meal, becoming nothing more but fat for eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Vaporeon belches out loud, letting saliva drip down from her mouth and she rubs her newly round and swollen belly in delight. Lying down on her back in the comfortable grass, she eases her stomach as it digested the motionless body inside, slowly churning the Lucario into a boiling stew. The Vaporeon adores pleasuring her dominated prey, only to the point of the almost orgasming before digesting them. It had seemed to make her food taste so much better knowing that they are at a physical and emotional toil, defeated in a battle of fighting and pleasure. Another, yet smaller, belch fumes out of the Vaporeon as she rolls her breasts together, satisfying herself with another successful hunt as the dog inside her sloshes within her fat belly next to the river.</i></span></div></div>",

The Vaporeon had purposely positioned herself to where your muzzle slid along the inner-sides of her legs, causing you to grunt from her soft, hot flesh. You despise being treated in such a humiliating way, yet you also thrive for it, like a crazy hunger. By the feral's forceful hands, you suddenly feel your head tilt up, giving you a great view of her blooming vagina that was now just millimeters off. It flares open as her thighs convulse around your head, locking it in still before you could even begin to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a tug of her forepaws, your cold nose-tip pokes at the outer edge the Vaporeon's pussy, causing your erection to shoot out fast and hard from the arousing heat expelling to your muzzle with the woman's sensitive touch. You listen to a soft growl of pleasure rumble from her before your face was suddenly taken inside the infected's waist! The Vaporeon was...going to shove you into her vagina? Not even carnivorous pokemon stooped that low! Alternative and sexual vore were only the rare cases of crazy, psychopath pokemon taking into that pleasure, but then again, this girl was no longer sane and showed too many cannibalistic characteristics to count.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing the danger, you press your hands against her legs, pushing back as your head was fully shifted inside with the swollen vertical walls. But gravity was on your predator's side, for she simply sits down upon your shoulders which stretches her sex line over those too, trapping your upper body for an unbirthing fate! Your nose suddenly catches a whiff of her arousal that vapors past your nostrils as you inhales the burning musky scent into your lungs. Your cock thrummed at the aroma while your sanity was easily discarding with lust. Releasing your tongue from your own quivering lips, you began to lick her sensitive walls willingly, beginning to enjoy the dilemma you were in. You couldn't help but desire the delicate flavor and texture of her vagina once the slick walls vibrated at your tongue dabbing and upper body wiggling as they twitched inside her groin. The infected Vaporeon forces herself to kneel down closer, squeezing your arms to sink in while your large furry yellow belly struggles to fit inside. After a few immense shoves, the fat sphere trails in with the rest of your body, all until she arrives at your long awaiting member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending her knees up and down, she pumps herself around your crotch, making you surrender a moan of orgasmic stress from the overflowing pleasure. Pressing any pre-cum to spurt out, she lubricates her vaginal walls and yourself with your very own contents, gifting her a much more satisfying and quicker time in slurping your body up. She raises the volume in her groaning as she begins to fondle one of her breasts, pumping on top of you and plants her other hand to grope at the stretched lump in her waist that your consumed body proportion had expanded out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, your legs buck out, ejecting your steaming seed in her vagina as she rains down her own orgasm onto your face. Your slime covered head pressures out pants of ecstasy, blowing through the limited musky air inside her squelching body. With her vagina dripping wet and you exhausted, she slurps you up once more, allowing your legs to travel up with you until she arrives at your feet. Using her finned tail tip, she tickles the pads of your paws to let them squirm for her amusement before sucking them up into her groin with the rest of your body. With the gooey massaging walls, you are surprisingly curled up into an opening, forced in a ball-like stature around your belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whine out like the trapped puppy you are, trying to kick and push at the throbbing walls clenching around you. They convulse together, squeezing your thick body together until every crevice and empty space is closed off. Where were you? You were sure that you weren't inside its stomach, especially since there were no connections to the stomach from the vagina and no digestive acids about. It suddenly dawned on you that you were squished and compressed into the <i>Vaporeon's womb</i>. Your mind panics as you wiggle your body more frantically. On the outside, you only manage to shake her distended belly up and down, sloshing her round gut to interact with her purrs of pleasures. She rubs her hands over the tight dome, feeling through her completely short fur that could resemble skin as your body began to tire out within the dark vicinity. What was going to happen to you next? Would you just suffocate or starve to death inside the organ? You would never get your answer as the walls continued to tighten, forcing the air to leave as you pass out with the gurgling innards that rumbled around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Vaporeon purred in pleasure, rubbing her engorged blue belly as the Lucario slowly absorbed into her body. The womb's slick walls started to work against the dog's faint body to slowly absorb it into energy,  breaking it down by forming the flesh into itself. The distant gurgles entertained the feral while the canine was being processed with her cum juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping back into the water, the Vaporeon floated on her backside, letting her big gut bloat out from the surface of the water while she squeezed it in bliss. Fading away, the seduced Lucario's body is absorbed into her own; supplementing much needed energy and cum for the infected water type as she fell into a deep slumber floating in the water. After defeating a crisis of the infection, it simply proved to be too overpowering to the canine, leading the hero into just another unbirthed victim of the apocalypse.</i></span></div></div>",

But, somewhat of a relief, she clearly shows emotion and had beautiful, yet shocked, ocean blue eyes. She wasn\u2019t infected thankfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou understand why she had all the reason in the world to be scared of you, once you glance down to see your large belly hanging out as if you were a feral that had eaten someone recently. She crouches to prepare an attack until you raise your arms up and yell, \u201cStop! I\u2019m not infected!\u201d Her eyes lit up, still feeling uneasy about your presence, yet she soon stands normally once again, more curious then scared. You continue, \u201cI\u2019m not infected, trust me.\u201d You point to your eyes. \u201cSee, they\u2019re not purple, and I'm clearly talking to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vaporeon girl finally responds by pointing to your round belly, \u201cThen\u2026would you care to explain that right there?\u201d Her voice was soft, but sweet, even if she was utterly terrified. Her legs were slightly quivering in the flowing water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had a little surprise encounter with an infected Pinsir on the way here. I\u2019m not here to rob you or hurt you. Trust me.\u201d She finally stood up straight, relaxing and blowing a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...I guess I believe you. Sorry about that though; you can\u2019t be too careful at times like these, you know?\u201d The water type answers as she walks out of the stream, and stops in front of you. She was only an inch or two below you in height, sparking a smile across her face. The Vaporeon raises a hand, \u201cI\u2019m Charm.\u201d You gladly shook it and respond back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Lace, and yes, I know exactly what you mean. If you don\u2019t mind me asking...\" Your ear give a quick flick in the air as you replace the paw to your belly, \"...I\u2019m definitely positive that I\u2019ve never seen a Vaporeon out here whenever I had visited this place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe points a thumb behind her down the stream. \u201cThat\u2019s because I live in an underwater cavern that only <i>I</i> know about that's actually far from here. I tend to stay away from most villages and people. Usually they get overrun by the infected. The area I was living around wasn't holding up enough food or resources for me to use, so I thought I'd see if there was anything up stream. And judging from your <i>gut-filled</i> presence, there are plenty of berries as there are ferals in this forest, I presume. Are you part of a village, Lace?\u201d Her head tilts a little to the side with her eyes peering over your shoulder to see the scenery in any hopes to see evidence of civilization somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I live by myself too. I was just coming here to collect these pieces of fruit specifically.\u201d You point your gaze at the bush, looking at the gleaming berries growing from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre they particularly your favorite? I know there are different kinds with certain remedies that can cure specific illnesses, but what exactly are these kind\u2026? I have never seen these before.\u201d The Vaporeon questions with an intrigued brow raised. You step over to the bush and pluck off one on the green, fleshy fruits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a <i>Lum</i> berry. It cures any status ailments, whether you\u2019re sick, tired, or weak, cold or hot, stiff or strained. They\u2019re going to be very useful to me when I go out on my trip.\u201d You explain. Charm tilts her head to the side again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA trip?\u201d She asks. Grabbing all of the Lum berries, you carry them in your cradled arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m going to travel around, find out what I can about the infection and see if I can stop it. I\u2019m not literally going to sit under a rock and live in isolation my entire life. I\u2019m going to move out of my cave and help solve this epidemic, because it seems to me that no one has tried or succeeded.\u201d The Vaporeon was a little taken back in from the surprising comment. Her face looked a bit worried for a moment, but she picks her spirits back up with her gleaming smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m going to wish you luck! I\u2019m glad someone finally decided to break out of solitude. I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ll find the answers you\u2019re looking for, and by the looks of it,\u201d She pokes a finger into your belly, feeling the melting body withheld inside your stomach. \u201c...You can take care of yourself from these creatures.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying farewell to Charm and waving goodbye to each other, you walk back into the forest while she dives back into the water, heading in the other direction for a good symbol of parting ways. Tomorrow morning, you would leave everything behind, headed out into the unknown for the sake of the world, or a beast's stomach.</span></div></div>",

The home has suited you very well in keeping out of feral's scent range, and not once has one aimlessly wandered inside. You stare back at it with a small sense of sadness before leaving it behind, likely, forever. You step out onto a ledge with your flat belly that digested the Pinsir, watching the sun glimpse over the horizon to reflect a soft yellow glow in the back of the sky. The digested feral inside of you has provided an overwhelming jolt of strength surging through your muscles, and with great luck, the infected's body appeared to have no effect on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDescending off the rocks and traveling across the field, you begin your quest for the cure of the infection. Deciding that it would be best to find a village first, you could hopefully discover someone who was at least up-to-date on the epidemic to gather the most valuable information as possible. Hearing about a local town in a valley from a traveler who had gone past your home once, you head eastward on a dirt path, never looking back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking the most of the trip, you ponder about how the infection probably started. Maybe there <i>was</i> a virus in a river, and some unlucky passer-by\u2019s daring sip of the contaminated water initiated it? Or, there was a possibility that a poison type pokemon purposely created the disease, infecting others for his or her own cruel and strange cause? Many scenarios flash in your head, always creating new theories and possibilities for such a sick, twisted world. Sunlight beams down at you with a beautiful glow, exposing the never-ending sky speckled with cloud streaks following the wind. The trees give off a flourishing green, ripe with moisture and splendor that dance with the air skipping past them. The outside air sends a whiff past your black nose, which fills you with joy to experience the wonders of the wilderness. It was a shame that you couldn't freely go outside unless you wanted to be hunted by a feral to crawl down its salivating jaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping, you see a figure in the distance...!</span></div></div>",

Walking down the path, you begin to ponder to what you may actually find within this small town. Seeing that wagons or pedestrians were nonexistent within the territory limits to the village, it rouses some skeptical hopes in you that the village citizens may no longer be around or alive. What disturbs you the most, however, is the <i>silence</i>. Not only close to the town had you discovered it, but your realization had occurred from the very beginning of your journey. The soft wind resonating as the only source of noise was probably a terrifying enough experience that was almost equal to the battle with the Pinsir. You pass the town gates with a wooden banner nailed above with an engraved, <i>Jade Gorge</i> across it. A nice name for a small town. Stepping out into the dirt streets, something was obviously clear. No one was walking anywhere and the doors and window openings were all boarded up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a single sound emitted anywhere this time around, even with the wind as soft as it was, blowing the light dust from the graveled routes. It was obviously hit and abandoned from an infected horde. \"<i>What a shame...</i>\" You mind declares by the sight. You step slowly out into the empty lot, watching the rooftops and alleys as you pass by, knowing that a feral can be near, but hopefully with no pokemon to commerce about in the village, an infected would surely have ventured off somewhere else. You peek into what looked like the town hall at the center of the village. There was a small crack in between two wooden boards that covers a window opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering inside, the entire place was completely trashed. Bookcases fallen over, drawers opened, paper and debris scattered all around the dark room. It was too dark from the menacing shadows to see anything else, but the hall had clearly been ransacked by robbers. Sighing with a depressed octave, you move away from it and check for a shop in town for any possible remains of what happened. Finding a saloon-looking building close by and still standing, you focus aura energy into one of your hands and punch the door, blowing the boards away in a small blue explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the smoke clears for the most part, you step inside, only to see a large blast of orange flames shoot out directly in front of you! You quickly jump back, clumsily and accidentally falling on your rump from avoiding the searing fire. Rubbing the soot from your eyes, you glance back in shock as a Typhlosion steps out from the pieces of flaming wood with smoke fuming out from its mouth. You roll back, standing up once more as you toss your bag to the side to avoid the fire and possibly inevitable fight. The fire-type growls an intimidating and heart-pound rousing tone, having a somewhat equal height to you but sports a rim of chub over its belly from most likely having a mixture of work-outs and overfeeding. Muscle is hidden with its curvy, yet straightforward arms to force a difficulty to guess what its strength truly was. With a flat chest, a masculine body, and such a menacing voice, the Typhlosion presents itself as an quite irritated male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring into the face of the fire type, the Typhlosion\u2019s eyes show\u2026</span></div></div>",

It practically worked. His green eyes gleam a furious expression as his fangs flash out to show you his jaw's menacing power with the gnashing grinds of his somewhat sharp teeth. \u201cIf you wanna keep your life, then I suggest you leave, <i>now</i>!\u201d He yells out, obviously not taking 'no' for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou relieve yourself with an inhale to build up some courage. Raising your hands up a little to try and explain yourself that you're not a threat to him, you quietly plead, \u201cListen, I\u2019m not looking for trouble...I\u2019m not here to steal from you or\u2026!\u201d You try warning him, although, he quickly cuts you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s exactly what the <i>last thief </i>said. This town wasn't ruined because of infected you know. It was wiped out from raiders like <i>you</i>.\u201d He breathes in a mighty puff of air until blowing out it back out as a storm of scorching fire! You roll to the side, seeing the ground where you once were left as a large, black, and smoking smudge spot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! I\u2019m just\u2026!\u201d You were cut off yet again as the Typhlosion pounces out, tackling you down and endeavors to bite at your neck for a severe wound. The force of the impact launches both of you rolling into another hut door, crashing through carelessly while grappling with each other in an even match of brawn. He thrashes his claws out your head; occasionally leaving a mark or scratch on your face as you deliver a fair amount of punching jabs into his ribs. You place your legs at his torso, kicking them to hoist the heavy, attacking Typhlosion off of you and into a wooden table, breaking pathetically under his falling weight. Swirling back to stand up, he repositions himself along with you for the two of you to stare at each other in a standoff within the empty damaged hut. You circle around the room in a slow manner, taking your time while waiting for the other dare making an attack or approach. A single drop of blood slipped out from a scratch on your cheek, down to the floor in a wooden loud <i>thap</i>, signalling a cocky grin from the Typhlosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiplomacy would never work for a punk like this. Even if you were to convince him that you're not a threat, you had a real sense he was picking a fight on purpose. Some pokemon just have a real nerve to pick with the world and its inhabitants, especially <i>this</i> Typhlosion. And besides, this idiot would pay for attacking you so ignorantly. Just then, he pounces forward at a dangerous speed, almost to the point where you weren't ready for him. It was now or never to make a decision. You could either risk the time into fighting this fire-type and earn some kind of pride out of it, and it'd probably put this guy right back into his place if you did. Then again, he might be able to overpower you, which may lead into undesired events if he was voracious as much as the ferals were, or even worse...horny enough...But a flaw applies to that as well since you've seen his speed first at hand. Running could lead to the same exact fate...</span></div></div>",

Heated seconds passed by with wavering struggles. Every time it appeared that you were just about the push the Typhlosion over, he would strike back with a bone compressing force towards you, striking a startling fear in your body to struggle less. The entire charade of a battle was exhausting. You were about even in strength with him which gave you some hope of winning the battle since it was better than fighting off a much larger and much stronger, although, you quickly began to see the flames build up at the back of the Typhlosion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neck to flare out as he inhaled a large load of air to prepare another flamethrower!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching his maw spread wide open and a glow of orange shining out from his slimy gullet, you immediately turn while tossing the heavy being, throwing him of his feet and into his side. The Typhlosion was left unprepared from the move, and accidentally releases the fire from his mouth for it to spurt out in random directions, scattering the burning fireballs around the cabin. Flames engulfed the targets they hit, igniting wooden objects and furniture on fire, including the ceiling! Down on the floor, you kick away the Typhlosion as he spits out the last of his inaccurate attack. Rising up, you press a hand over a table to aid yourself rising back up. the fire-type growls above the crackling sounds of fire and grabs your ankle, digging his claws into it. The pain wasn't too agonizing, however it did in fact cause you to bark out and frantically try to kick away the Typhlosion yet again. You manage to hit your hindpaw against his chin, making him unintentionally bite his own tongue. He roars and releases your ankle to cringe at the comical yet unbearable pain he was suffering through. You return to raise up your body with the table's aid, however, once at a full stance, you look back at the table to discover it thrives with many ingredients and flasks and jars. It was an alchemy or medical experimenting table, and right when you saw the flames eat away at the wood to reach a fallen cup of lamp oil, it was too late. A small sea of fire flourishes madly out towards you, singeing a few hairs and covering your face with soot. The heat has you barking out with surprise and leaves you back-tracing awkwardly with steps to avoid the mass of burning heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoke floats throughout the entire vicinity, staling the air and engulfs much of your vision. The Typhlosion finally gets back up from the floor, a little dazed but still desperately furious with you. Ignoring the dumb idea that a fight was still at place, you wrap an arm above your eyes and dash to the exit door, however a blast of fire suddenly destroys it! Spinning around, the Typhlosion glares his generic cocky attitude again, calling out to you, \u00e2\u0080\u009c<i>Oh ho ho no you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t</i>! You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not leaving this place until I know you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re <i>dead</i>!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And it was if karma came to the rescue, burning debris from the ceiling came crumbling down, landing right on top of the fire-type!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlamming into his head, the Typhlosion fell unconscious under the pile of burning rubble to slowly be crushed and burned by the colossal debris. You let out a single chuckle before turning back around to find another way out, but\u00e2\u0080\u00a6there was an odd feeling you had ringing in your heart. You started this journey wanting help others, <i>even if they didn't want help</i>. You hate feeling guilt, especially since that idiot of a pokemon started the fight. You tried to talk him out of it. <i>Twice.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou regretfully turn around yet again, heading back into the smoke-blinding horror as parts of the ceiling fell from above. You squint your eyes in the dark fog, coughing from the disgusting smoky air, which made you think why anyone would ever willingly breathe the stuff daily. Then, two light sandy-colored legs were stuck out from under a pile of rubble, motionless. Finding the scene pathetic and feeling a little merciful, you unleash an aura-filled punch to the small mound of debris, blasting most of the burning material away, revealing a knocked out Typhlosion beneath it all. Grabbing around his back, you lift one of his arms around your neck and press his body at your side upright, helping to drag him through the falling building and seeing a light from the outside as a glorious exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou push over a fallen wooden beam as an obstacle and arrive back outside in the wonderful day, welcoming fresh air as you cough out the rest of the contaminated kind. You drop the fire type out on the dirt road carelessly and you stagger on over to your bag. Pulling out a canteen, you unscrew the top and splash cold water on your face to relieve yourself of your endeavors trekking through fiery obstructions, carrying a heavy oaf, and washing away any soot or ashes off your sweating body, until walking back to your unconscious \"friend\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying down on his back with his mouth miserably open and eyes close, you drip the cool water over his smudge-covered face, waiting until he finally coughed out violently. The Typhlosion groans as he places his hands on his head that marked with a small spot of blood from the falling ceiling's impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAhgghh, my head hurts like hell!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He yells before rolling over to his knees, curling up while continuing to grumble in discontent. You unhappily large burn marks against one of his arms, seeming slick and just very painful to the eye. Feeling that hated sense of compassion towards the newly saved Pokemon, you go through your bag and pull out one of the many Lum berries you collected. You rip off a large piece and hand it over to the Typhlosion. He turns to look at you with surprise, looking back between the berry and you, discovering where he was and what had just possibly happened for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</span></div></div>",

His arms were quivering with his eyes struggling not to lose focus from time to time. He clearly needed help, <i>fast</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah, and you better thank me for it. Now hurry up and eat the berry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You gesture the green fruit closer to him, already irritated with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat does it do exactly\u00e2\u0080\u00a6?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He grabs it slowly into his hand and began to sniff at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to help your burns heal faster, and hopefully relieve some of your pain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You answer him, wishing that he would just eat it. He carefully licked the fruit once with a single scrape and almost instantly backed his head away in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAghk! Aw man, this thing is sourest thing I have ever tasted! Where'd you get this crap?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Typhlosion pushes it back into away, refusing to eat it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cQuit being a baby and eat it, or you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll regret it later. Those burn wounds are going to get any better, in fact, much worse unless you grow up, be a man, and eat that tiny thing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You retort, wondering if you should just take it back and let him suffer. The arrogant fire-type grumbles and restrainly bit into the fruit, mumbling some unhappy sound as he swallows the entire Lum berry. His tongue flops out and a queasy blow of air exhales from his dispirited maw. The Typhlosion tries getting back up with his new found sense of bravery, but he ends up suddenly gasping and falls back down, gripping his arms. You shake you head back and forth calmly with closed eyes from watching the poor scene, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you really expect it to work that fast?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe angrily grunts and sits back up straight, pouting in his time for the Lum berry's effects to quicken in his body. Sighing out loud again, you plop down a seat on your bottom next to him for the both of you watch the building in front of you burn down. The flames flare out a demonic, yet strangely beautiful, coloration out from the dying construction. The two of you were, in a way, hypnotized by the hot picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to break the silence. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m Lace.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You reach out a paw to him as he turns his head to you, feeling uncomfortably annoyed and surprised at the same time. The Typhlosion unwillingly lends out his hand, grasps yours, and shakes it with just a single, powerful tug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJackal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He hisses. You smirk and continue to watch the flames in front of you glow a bright orange, until he finally spoke again. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo...I take it that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re <i>not</i> a robber?\u00e2\u0080\u009d You laugh at the comment and shake your head. Jackal looks back at the fire awkwardly, blushing a little with embarrassment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUm, so there's like, uh, no hard feelings between us, right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, <i>Jack</i>, you tried killing me and I not only spared your life, but I saved it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You answer back at him. The Typhlosion tilts his head a little down with a wavy frown, obviously feeling a bit guilty from trying to murder you with little suspicion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut yeah, there are no hard feelings.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You continued afterwards. He smiles back a little until you give him a swift pat on the back, causing him to yelp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOw!

Jackal was slightly taken by insane idea of a death wish to openly travel everywhere for the idea of possibly stopping the infection which could easily land him in the belly of some creature, although, he seemed to see it as more hopeful than crazy thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJackal, what specifically happened to this town? Did you ever live here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d You ask him, impertinent to know because he mentioned that raiders were the main cause of it. Jackal only sighs before sitting further back in his seat, rubbing the back of his head with the eerie silence of the dark hut. He didn't even glance at you for awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cActually, when I came to this town, it was already abandoned. I figured that it had been overrun by infected ferals and everyone was either eaten, infected, or they just\u00e2\u0080\u00a6left at first.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He replies. You could only slowly nod in confirmation as Jackal continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I traveled here, I knew for the most part raiders were a problem because ferals don't go through your belongings, remove your drawers, and pull out all that you own from your homes. The old market places were of course empty. At first, I found only a couple of infected.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He then flexes his arms and bloats out his stomach. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut they were no match for these.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou huff in playful annoyance and grab your bag before heading out towards the exit.

Looking up from the dirt path, you spot the scuttering Typhlosion approach you from the town with a pillar of smoke trailing out of it from you past fight. There wasn't much you could do for the town, and seeing that it may sadly burn down, it could've been an improvement to the hellish sights one could see and ponder about. Jackal was still wearing the orange bandanna on his left arm and carrying a brown satchel bag filled with what you had suggested. You stand off the fence to meet him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLooks like you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ready.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You point out with a smile. He nods, and with that, the two of you continue on your way! You unintentionally gained a traveling companion in what seemed like a battle to the death about an hour, which made you think about the turn of strange events held out for your future on this campaign. The two of you go down the dirt path that led out from the mournful remains of Jade Gorge with your heads held up high. Along the way, Jackal asks you, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, where exactly are we headed next?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re following this dirt path until we reach another town. It has to lead somewhere, right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d You answer right away. It was true you had no idea where you were going, but you were bound to run into at least some kind of civilization or infection-informed person. Jackal nods to the proposition as the both of you travel along through the valley, passing through forests and across rivers, and luckily not meeting any hungry infected. But speaking of which, you turn to Jackal during your adventure, \"Jackal, you wouldn't know how the infection spreads to pokemon, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugs, \"Not really actually. I've never seen someone turn into a feral...I think I remember one guy saying that if a feral scratches you it causes the infection to spread into you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tilt your head, \"And have you been scratched by a feral?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grunts, \"Psh, plenty of times, but that...was a long time ago...sooo...\" Well that threw that hypothesis away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking and giving small talk for a few hours, the two of you set camp in an opening of trees. Lighting a small fire, you sit down atop a stump and you begin cooking a bowl of berries, letting the delicious scent fill your hungry nostrils. A growl rumbles for a meal since you haven't eaten all day, and with the previous morning dispute you spent wrestling with Jackal, you could use some energy for your system. Jackal was down on his rear upon the grass, tugging at his bandanna tightly wound over his injury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you keep playing with it, you may make the wound worse, you know. You don't want to reopen or irritate it.\" You suggest to him. He reluctantly releases the cloth with a grumpy scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Typhlosion sneers, \"Well it's certainly <i>irritating</i> me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some lunch can take your mind off of it. You hungry? It'll be ready in a few minutes.\" You prod the mashed mixture of food with a stick as he it heats up in its bowl above the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm actually more thirsty than hungry. In fact, as long as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still waiting for that to cook, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m gonna take a wizz.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jackal says while turning away, walking behind some trees. As you check the pot, you suddenly heard a rustle in the leaves off the distance, and it certainly wasn't coming from the direction Jackal left in. This noise was <i>behind</i> you. Jumping up and staying alert, you scan the trees around you, searching for the noise. Just then, something appears from the bushes, revealing...</span></div></div>",

A snake head brushes out from the leaves, followed by two large yellow globes, with dark hazel nipples peaking at each end. The entire naga was mainly covered with glimmering violet scales, save for the golden streak over her chest and breasts, the underbelly of her mainly snake-side portion of her body, and the softly rattling tail tip that lifts above the ground slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female Ekans slides her extensive naga body towards you with casual ease, staring deeply at you with bright and beautiful golden eyes. Her torso rises up as her tail slides from side to side in a wavy line behind her. You were bewildered by such a lithe body while her hypnotizing voice practically sings out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is that absolutely <i>delicious</i> scent I smell?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She slithers closer, but in turn, causes you to back up to keep your distance. Her eyes weren't purple with great luck, and she was clearly capable of speech thankfully which removes the possibility of her even being infected. But something about her seemed\u00e2\u0080\u00a6dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look her in the eyes to face this sudden stranger and interrogate her for her presence, but suddenly, you start to have a strange feeling stir inside yourself. Almost as if her eyes begin to grow in color, the world around you begins to fade away as if it never existed as her alluring pupils were all that you could focus on. Having the environment disappear, your eyes constantly focus on hers with your mind seemingly to grow fuzzy and careless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice echoes out into your ears as if it was coming for every direction. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell what do we have here? A Lucario wandering in the woods alone? How could such a stud like you roam around the woods by yourself without anyone by your side?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She places her scaled hands under your chi with such light, delicate intention, raising her head above yours to leave you staring blankly at her spell-inflicting gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI-I was\u00e2\u0080\u00a6j-just\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d You stammer out but found yourself at a loss of words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh shush shush! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure you have your reasons, but perhaps you would prefer some <i>company</i>.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The end of her tail slid around your ankles, circling up your legs which forced them to tremble helplessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA-a-ahh-h-h\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d You could only let groans of pleasure escape your lips as her long body began to coil around your frozen body, tightening you in its mighty grip. Your arms become pinned to your sides with your head the only part uncoiled. The smooth, scaly wrapping grinds all around, giving off small squeezes to tempt something dark in your mind and your crotch as a snicker shrouds over you. Her forked tongue flickers out, tapping at your face before tasting your fur in all out whiplashes of the muscle licking around your entire head. Oh, how her scales felt wonderful to you, and her tongue, brushing around your lips felt so\u00e2\u0080\u00a6intoxicating. A moan of delight escape the Ekans\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lips as her hands rub over your wet cheeks. the naga had left quite the amount of her warm dribble smearing your face to leak onto her coils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretching her mouth open, you stare up into the slimy tunnel dripping saliva onto your face, beckoning for you to willingly jump into it to fill this snake's belly; your new master's belly. Pleasing this Ekans was all that you could wish for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, reality snaps back to you once you hear a certain Typhlosion's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lace, is that food done ye\u00e2\u0080\u00a6whoa\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\" Jackal's voice exclaims from behind you. Your world reverts back for you to shake the hypnosis away of the Ekan's eyes. Realizing the danger at hand, you struggle with all of your will to get away from the serpent, however, all of your limbs were tightly pinned together in her coils! Your time for escape was far too late. Her head looks away from you with disappointment to whoever interrupted her little Lucario snack, staring at Jackal in surprise though once she noticed his unaware reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you weren't alone after all. Well if  it isn't just my lucky day then! Two cute-looking boys in one meal!\" Her voice rang out with glee. Jackal backed up, obviously not trusting her for your trapped state in her twisted body and her strange taunt right from the start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLace, wh-what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d His voice quivers, but the naga continued to try and seduce him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome here you spicy anthro. Let me take a better <i>look</i> at you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She calls over, curling her finger from a raised hand towards herself, begging him to step forward. You try to yell out for him to avoid looking her in the eyes, although the end of her tail wraps around your muzzle, ceasing your cries. Jackal then\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</span></div></div>",

The Ekans hisses with deadly rage, tightening the clench around your body which constricts most of the air out of your lungs. You manage to be able to choke out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cJackal, a-attack her\u00e2\u0080\u00a6!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObeying your demand, Jackal takes a deep breath until flaring out a stream of fire towards the naga, causing her to shrivel back and slither away in another direction with you still trapped in her coils! You twist and turn as her body loses grasp on you, trying to escape the pursuing Typhlosion giving off a chase. Feeling your back dragging against the ground, you manage to slide an arm out from a coil to punch the scaled tube around you with a powerful blast of aura. The Ekans shrieks in pain, automatically and happily dropping the rest of your body for her to attempt panicky slaps on her burn so she could keep off the blue fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling and rolling over the forest floor, you were able to stand a little after a complete stop, welcoming a wind of air inside your chest from the previous pains of suffocation by the naga's cruel and twisting body. The Ekans, meanwhile, hisses again and expects revenge for her lost meal, freeing her long fangs from the roof of her mouth as her eyes turned more devilish then deceptive. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will pay for that you stupid mutt!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe serpent lunges out to take in your head, until an odd blue and pale tan-colored blur smashes into her side, sending her torso tumbling into a tree. Jackal pounces out to the snake, blowing fire around her fallen body to avoid escape. She twists and turns, looking for a way out of the ring of flames, but the only opening for her escape was blocked by the Typhlosion as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ekans backs up into the tree, acting weak and defeated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWould you really hurt a young lady, and one with such a peaceful face\u00e2\u0080\u00a6?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She gleams her eyes once again, pulling their hypnotizing effect back out towards Jackal. You block your vision, not falling for that trick easily again, however, you hear slow footsteps crumble in the grass. Daring to peek over your elbow, you watch as Jackal slowly walks towards the snake, smiling as she beckons him closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJackal, stop!\u00e2\u0080\u009d You yell, but the Typhlosion seems to ignore your call and continue his gullible-self on towards the snake. She was curling her finger towards herself, getting him closer as she chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to hurt you. I just want to give you a little kiss, is all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She beckons to Jackal. He was standing just inches from her for her body to raise up to meet eye-to-eye level with him. Her tongue flickers out, almost tasting the Typhlosion's lips before she hisses, \"Foolish boy. You were never going to be able to avoid my gaze. Your meaty hide sha-\" Before the serpent could ever claim he victory, Jackal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth had opened up and chomped her head into it! With dire haste, he quickly locks his hands around her wrists that endeavor to claw out his eyes as he gulps further, taking in her shoulders. Her tail thrashes out in agony while Jackal continues to slurp up and lick over her scaled, long body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grumbles a muffled sound in the midst of his lunch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would reawwy hewp if you hell her taiw for me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (It would really help if you held her tail for me.) You break out from staring and desperately dove onto the ground, wrestling with the rattling and writhing tail. Finally catching the striving tentacle, you happily push it along into the Typhlosion's swallowing maw, helping the consumption of the witchy reptile speed up a little. A bulge forms from his cheeks, leading to his throat, and ends at his large belly which squirms and screams with rage. The tip of the purple and yellow noodle sinks in between Jackal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lips at last, followed with a loud gulp and a deep sigh of pleasure. The Typhlosion lands on his butt, letting his extremely large belly slam down with him for him to put his hands on so he could feel the coils of the Ekans slide around inside. He loosens his tongue out from his mouth and he blew out more moaning air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOooooh, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I want that berry stuff you had cooking anymore. Ergh.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He fusses as he closes his eyes to embrace the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting yourself chuckle, you give a friendly, soft nudge to his gut, causing him to gasp in surprise at the sudden wave of pleasure. You even felt the Ekans twitch from you little poke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to ask, \"So, is that the first pokemon you've ever eaten before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal blinks a single eye open to look at you, answering, \"No actually, it isn't. I've had a couple of ferals before, and my first time was sorta outta desperation. But...I can see why carnivorous pokemon and ferals want to snack on us all the time because of it. I kinda like it a tad bit really.\" He raises a brow. \"...Have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one.\" You mention your experiences with the Pinsir and how tough it was for you to decide to down such a monster in a way. \"However, I do agree with you. It's more satisfactory than it is weird. I could just never bring it upon myself to swallow someone else if they weren't infected, unlike that <i>snake</i>. How'd she taste?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal blushes from the nosy question, replying in a softer, more embarrassed tone, \"Oh, uh, she was uh...kind of good, actually. I think I prefer eating reptiles in fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scowl and lean in, \"Only infected reptiles and carnivorous ones, <i>right</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, whatever.\" The Typhlosion answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter helping Jackal up, you head back to the campsite with the heavy Typhlosion and sit close by the fire while eating your cooked food and chatting with Jackal until the sun begins to set. You watch as Jackal falls asleep, cooking the food he had just eaten ironically. His belly sags out immensely over the ground as he rests on his side. Deciding that it would be best for you to also get some rest too for whatever tomorrow would hold, you put out the fire and collect two blankets from your bag. You toss one over the snoring Typhlosion and lay one on yourself, dozing off by nightfall.</span></div></div>",

The sun on the horizon rises, setting a golden glow on the land that almost made you thing the world was perfect and without any evidence of chaos. It makes you ponder what the world would be like if you fail and digest in someone's stomach, and if the ferals soon ruled the world practically. How would life move on? Would the ferals just begin eating each other until the very last one is left? And what then? Stretching and yawning, you bend up and manage to stand up from your rest spot with cool air brushing past you. Your fur prickles and you almost shiver from the wind of the changing season. Summer shall be missed. You look to your left across the black smudge that used to be your campfire to the pile of Jackal's blanket, with the Typhlosion missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flip your head back and forth, searching around for the fire type. The Typhlosion was nowhere to be seen. \"Hey Jack, where are you?\" You call out for him, feeling a little tension from the possibility of something to have happened to him. In response, a rustle in the leaves of a bush catch your ears' attention. Jackal's head then pops out from the leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, it's <i>Jackal</i>. I don't see how difficult it is to grasp that name. What do you want? I'm a little, <i>erk</i>, busy here.\" He answers in a foul mood. After a long, growling grunt, he blows a sigh of relief with a content smile, walking out of the bushes with a much flatter stomach. \"Aaahhhhhh...much better.\" Well it appears that the Ekans had to come back out of Jackal at some point which added a thin layer of pudge over the Typhlosion's gut, you noted, as he rubs his rump a little before returning the blanket you generously put over him last night back into your bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair of you grab your things and continue down the road, wondering what may be at the end of it. Jackal mentions, \"It better be a fort with plenty of guards stationed in it. I'm not going through some desperate town expecting us to help them with all of their needs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that seems a little cruel to say, don't you think?\" You retort from his lazy and selfish statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head though, \"You haven't been in a populated village in a looong time from what I can tell. Small, rural towns aren't exactly the greatest safe havens during these times. If a village like it still stands, it won't last for long. They're practically giant dinner courses for ferals.\" The news came across you as simply terrible while the Typhlosion continues. \"Typically, villagers are always wanting to persuade visitors and citizens to stay, because if a large majority of them abandon the town, what will the remaining Pokemon do when there comes a time for a horde of infected attacking them? It doesn't stop there, really. I've noticed the town help boards with each one I traveled through. They're just butchered with posters and requests of missing Pokemon and sad situations that you wish you could help with, but...\" He peeks a glance at you, frowning, \"...Why risk it finding someone when they're most likely just a pile of crap left out in the wilderness to decompose, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could mourn the situation any longer, a shriek pierces the air. Your ears rang up as Jackal looks around frantically through the forest trees. \"Wh-where did that come from...?\" The Typhlosion asks with shakes hidden in his voice. Pinpointing your ears on memory, you glance past the side of the road and into the depths of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The yell came from there. Leave your stuff to somewhere safe and keep your guard up.\" You advise. He nods and places both bags at a tree basin hidden from the road, following you into the midst of the ominous woods. The scream sounded like it was from a female, and whoever she were, it was clear that she was in danger. The two of you silently creep over the grass, yet keep a fast and steady pace closer to the noise's apparent spot. Lifting a branch up, you instantly spot a short Buneary girl with oddly red-colored puffs instead of tan-colored ones, being pinned against the ground to what looked like a male Marowak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skulled pokemon headbutts the screaming rabbit, causing a final yell to strike out from her before she is knocked effortlessly unconscious. \"Hey, get away from her!\" You yell over to the Marowak with its back turned to you. Disturbingly, his heavy breaths cease and his backside remain facing you. Typically, someone would've spun around in surprise with the inturder's presence. As creepy as it could, it slowly stands up to what seems like your height from leaning over the rabbit girl. It tilts its head quietly, glowing bright purple eyes within the bone helmet's eye sockets as a low growl rumbles in its spit-dripping mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal simply growls back and sprouts out in a mad dash, running to the Marowak on all fours roaring. The Marowak simply raises its bone club, tossing it forward in a spinning chaos to nail one of Jackal's sides. The Typhlosion roars in pain while he's knocked back from his pounce, slamming into a tree as the bone boomerangs back to the Marowak's hand. Even infected, the feral still knew all of his predecessor's skills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright, Jack?\" You call over in concern, but he only puffs out a small cloud of smoke in your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, it's <i>Jackal</i>! And don't worry about me, my arm is just stuck in this fucking knot hole. Hurry up and save the girl you stupid mutt!\" He furiously yells as his arm was thoroughly stuffed inside a thick tree trunk. The Marowak growls in amusement as it begins to dash towards you, jumping in the air to your surprise! Unprepared for it, the feral collides into your body with a powerful impact that sends the two of you tumbling over the grass as...</span></div></div>",

The feral crashes downhill to toppling down from a large grass mound and falls into a ditch. Getting back up finally, you run over to the top of the forested hill to see the Marowak fleeing in the opposite direction, disappearing within the sea of trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal, by now, pulls his arm towards to himself and finally pops his hand right out of the tree trunk's knothole. Shaking his arm a bit to circulate the blood in his wrist again, he spins around and flashes his fangs out, exclaiming with confident readiness, \"Alright! Let's do thi-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's already gone.\" You say, cutting him off as you pass right by him. He stares idly ahead, surprised that the battle had ended so fast and miserably.

Continuing to look down the hill from a different side just to be safe enough to know the Marowak was truly gone for good, you mention, \"Here, if you want to be useful, go check on the Buneary to see if she's still okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...right...\" He stammers about. Walking to the faint body of the red and brown rabbit, he pats her face a bit in attempt to wake her up. Only a soft whimper responds. Under the sense of uncomfortable tension, he then takes the girl by the shoulders and wiggles her body, worriedly yet awkwardly begging, \"H-Hey kiddo...uhm...Buneary, wake up...\" After one final shake, her eyelids break in between, revealing her hazel, uninfected eyes gaze upon the strange Typhlosion face staring down at her. Blinking again and again, she lets her eyes accustom to the light to catch the glimpse of Jackal close to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeakly, she opens her mouth to say, \"Y-You saved...me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal only rubs the back of his neck while stating, \"Guh?! Well, the thing is...mmphmff!\" He's interrupted, but definitely not by you this time. The Buneary had pushed her head forward, kissing Jackal against his own surprised lips. Her eyes were closed, living in a pure blissful moment, but to your view, Jackal was flailing with wide open eyes of dismay. He muffledly yells during the rabbit's smooch as he thrashes his arms out against the Buneary to desperately pry her from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking her lip-giving present, Jackal retreats back by stepping back and almost falls over, coughing loudly from the horrific moment. He consistently spits out the taste from his mouth, shouting out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWh-wh-what the hell?! *Cough* What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong with you?!\u00e2\u0080\u009d You couldn't refrain from laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit only giggles as she stands up for you to get a good look at her. Her small, thin frame only stood up to be about half of Jackal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actual size, if you didn't include the long ears, suggesting in your own thoughts that she must have been a teenager which would explain her early evolution form. As stated before, the puffy fur on her ear tips and lower half were of a crimson red, instead of the pale tan color which was odd. It was probably a recessive trait or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was the least I could do for rescuing me! I mean taking on an infected, powerful Marowak for just a stranger was so reckless, yet so brave!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Buneary begins to blush as she crosses her arms behind her back while digging a single hindpaw into the ground, looking away from Jackal. Jackal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes open a bit more wider to your amazement from how wide they were before, and he was struggling with either telling her the truth about her rescue or letting himself take all of the credit, because after all, you <i>did</i> do all of the work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to Jackal and give a soft punch to his back, sneering with a grin, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah Jack, tell her how you scared the feral off with your fearless and god-like courage.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He gives an angry glare at you as he fumbles around in his mind to find the right words, when all of a sudden, the Buneary hops onto the his back! She hugs around his neck, which was thankfully not ignited for the moment, as he yelled in agitation trying to throw the joyfully laughing girl off. He was too busy running and struggling around, fighting the rabbit off to the point where he runs face first into a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Buneary finally hops off, laughing to herself as Jackal falls to the ground groaning. You decide to stop the Buneary from giving Jackal too much love torture by asking her off topic, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSay, if you wouldn't mind me asking, but how does a young Buneary like yourself go wandering in a dense forest infested with ferals all alone?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pauses her chuckling and flips her vision towards you, looking a bit worried. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m <i>not</i> supposed to tell outsiders from my village about our hideout.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She instantly cups her hands over her mouth, frightened. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou didn't just hear that!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Village? If she knew where a village was, then why would she try to hide it? Were they just protecting something? She tugs down on her large ears to covers her face as her hindpaws alternate stops in her mad fit. \"Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh nooooo! I'm gonna be in soooo much trouble now once the Chief hears about this! Oh me and my big, fat mouth. Please sirs, just forget what I said. I didn't mean it! I'm a liar! There's nothing for me to hide!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attempt to settle the frantic girl down, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy <i>savior of a partner here</i> and I are searching for a cause and possible cure of the infection. We've been looking for a village for some help or knowledge about it, and it would help if you could tell us about your town.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You try to persuade her with the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ponders a bit with an unsure expression, contemplating hard until finally answering, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOkay, but if I show it to you, promise me that you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell anyone there that I was the one who gave its location away, alright?\u00e2\u0080\u009d You nod your head and smile, but the girl presses your loyalty. \"You have to swear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, you hold up a forepaw. \"I do solemnly swear.\" The bunny gleams a satisfied smile at you as you give a light and non-painful kick to Jackal, still mumbling on the floor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey Jack, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re leaving.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groans bitterly once more before replying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy name is <i>Jackal</i>, you stupid pup.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span></div></div>",

Enjoying how much fun you got out of his agitation from the nickname, you will proceed to always call him that from now on, <i>especially</i> if he hated it. But then you remembered how young and innocent Rose was, so why would she leave a safe village?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRose, why did you leave your village? Was it attacked or did something happen to it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d You ask. She shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, my village is one of the safest ones around! Well, actually it does get an occasional infected attack, but we've managed to keep a stable society in a hidden location with our really really big system of guards, especially with keep thieves and cruel pokemon out. I left because we recently lost one of our village scouts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She then began to skip at a lesser pace and her head tilts a bit down. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe scout that disappeared was my older sister, so I set out to find her myself. I heard the rumor from a couple of guards talking to each other.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She suddenly embraces herself with confidence, looking triumphant. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I promised myself to find her! She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too fast to get caught by some fat infected! She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the fastest Lopunny in the region, and I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just give up hope on her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Buneary begins to daze out into this strange daydream state during her speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirk a comically across your face as she hums out a military sounding tune with her skips slowly transforming into a march. For a teenager, she truly was a young child at heart. Rose stops when all of you arrive at a large rock wall. Only a few trees and maybe a bush or two were scattered around, and that was a large sum of the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re here!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She exclaims joyfully while heading towards a large rock. Somehow, even with her small frame, she is able to push the colossal boulder to the side with simplest ease, revealing a small, open tunnel. You could almost hear Jackal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s jaw drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose just giggles, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe rock is fake, but robbers and ferals can surprisingly find that out quickly. There are a lot of open crags and nooks they find themselves venturing through, and there's even a massive cavern system close-by the village that's crawling with the hungry monsters. But our totally awesome security keep them away, so that's pretty cool, right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She gestures her hand for you to follow her into the narrow and dark crease.</span></div></div>",

The maze of paths and darkness seems never-ending, plus repetitive. However, the three of you arrive at a large wooden gate to your surprise, with torches aligned and lit along the rock cave walls that reveals a strange yellow symbol on a crimson flag. Three upside-down black triangles all centered within a large yellow one. You wonder if it has true meaning and to be honest, the large wall of wooden columns could be mistaken for just a simple blockade which prompts you of the security's concern. Rose taps at an indenture within the wall as Jackal oddly scoots closer to you and bumps you with his elbow with the girl's back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe mentions with a whisper, \"Hey, I'm not exactly excited about this whole 'secret village' stuff. I've got your back if things go south down in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin and answer without facing him, \"Hmph. I'm flattered to hear that you care about me so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Typhlosion scowls at you and steps back to his previous position. Suddenly, a Scyther in leather armor-like padding wound to its torso held out a long arm-blade at Rose after opening the 'door' you never saw in the wall. Although, he seemed to have instantly recognized her as he embraces the small rabbit into a hug. (Avoiding cutting her, of course.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rose?! Where on <i>bloody</i> earth have you been? The Chief has been worried sick about you, and the village was expecting you have been gobbled up!\" He exclaims to the girl in an odd accent. Glancing back up in his time of bewildered happiness, the green bug gasps to see you and Jackal behind her. His expression reverts back to anger. \"And <i>who</i>, might these two be?\" Before Rose could speak, you choose to explain yourself while stepping up to the Scyther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friend here and I are traveling to research about the current infection. We so happened to find Rose looking for her sister in a forest patch next to a road close by.\" You justify. The Scyther's face turns to a blank or worried tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's why this mischievous rabbit ran off. Well, a'right then, but now there's been more than one of you to say the same thing. We don't know much about the infection as it is and we're just doing our best to avoid any problems.\" He sets Rose back onto her feet from his hug and nudges his shoulder in an odd gesture. A guard hidden behind the wall begins turning a crank, lowering the entire midsection of the wall into an open slit below it to the open the gate entirely. \"Come along then, I'll show you two <i>tourists</i> to the Village Chief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could take one more step though, he turns and holds one of his bladed arms out at you, \"But mark my words, Lucario, make the tiniest hint of any trouble, and I won't think twice about slicing up you or your bandanna companion over there into a bloody pile of cut meat.\" You nod to his warning as you grip your bag a bit tighter, following the cautious Scyther. You can hear Jackal behind you tug on the bandanna you gave to him on his arm and mumble out,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Bandanna companion</i>?\"</span></div></div>",

The entire residence was underground beneath a large mountain with most of its interior actually carved out, with occasional small crags and slits that streaked across the <i>extremely high</i> ceiling above you. \"That must be where the oxygen and light outside come in from\" You think to yourself. Four impossibly towering pillars hold up the roof above the village's head, with staircases and and rooms engraved around them to be used as vacancy and watchtowers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough a little too dark for your comfort, there was plenty of lighting to see all of the citizens, dirt roads, and signs around. Especially the buildings. The buildings are made of the very rock used from digging inside the mountain, either sculptured out our clayed together in large stones, giving a very sturdy and earthy look to the whole area. You watch as you enter the door a stretched sign reading, <i>Redeemer's Grotto</i> carved into the rock banner, <i>Let those with minds rise above the evils that lurk our world</i>. Torches were lit everywhere and anywhere they could to destroy any sense of pure darkness, which so happen to reveal to you were of local soldiers scouted all around, wearing the same exact symbol on the flags at the entrance upon their leather padding. Villagers roam the streets freely, with the town's guards kindly greeting them and moving on with their lives as if the world wasn't in an apocalypse. You could get used to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Scyther stops you from moving any closer as to what seemed to be a large Charizard wearing the outside skeleton armor of an Aggron, who bears the three horned skull on its head with the shoulder armor pieces on, well, the shoulders. The orange dragon's clawed hands grab the sides of the helmet, lifting it off, to expose the Charizard's face. The armored lizard was male judging from his masculine torso while protruding a yellow cushioned gut, thick legs, packed muscle, and reveals a long scar going from his brow over one of his eyes, streaking across to stop at his jaw. Fat or not, he was intimidating<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pence, who are our guests?\" His deep voice asked the Scyther, Pence. It seemed more of an order, than a question though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chief, I found these two outside of the gate. They want to help with the infection epidemic.\" The Charizard chief just grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't everyone? You know that's not a good enough excuse to let newcomers into our city, but what I'm really interested in is if can you explain to me <i>how</i> they found the gate?\" He inquires with a smokey huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPence shudders a bit in fear, \"...S-Sorry, sir...it was my mistake b-but...\" The bug was debating on whether to confess the truth on the matter, or merely lie to keep Rose's skin in the clear. Although, the Buneary appears from behind you, raising a paw in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because of me.\" She says softly. Her ears were bent downward in sorrow along with her face dreading her actions. The Chief looks down upon her, but instead of a face of anger, he seemed a tad bit...happy? The Charizard crouches down to his struggling endeavors from his thick body and weighing armor to her height, and pats her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking for your sister no doubt. Don't worry my fair girl, I'm sure she's out leaving ferals in the dust right now.\" He pats her one more time before standing up fully to look at you again. His unhappy tone returns, and yet, it sounded a little less sinister, \"I'm sorry, but you may as well turn around, for we know little to just as much as you do about the infection. They crave for whole flesh and even the occasional sadistic pleasure with their purple eyes. That's all we know. We've kept as far from it as possible and we would like to keep it that way.\" He explains to you. You thought so, figuring that they wouldn't know much, especially since they literally <i>live under a rock</i>. You also notice that during his speech, he held Rose, close. Even Pence had an emotion of unwillingness towards the topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ask the Chief...</span></div></div>",

The reptile ponders fro a moment, silently thinking to himself as you notice Pence's glare darts from you to the Village Chief, and back to in a repeating sequence. Anxiously waiting, the Village Chief finally brings his attention back to you, assuredly making up his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hmmm, there may be one pokemon you might wish to look into, but the journey there may be a bit <i>hectic</i>. He's a Toxicroak from what I've heard, and he lives in a swamp just south of here. According to some of our messengers from long ago, they reported that he's a professional when it comes to diseases or mental illnesses.\" The Charizard trails off in his explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm expecting a 'but' here...\" You worriedly question. He nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>But,</i> I believe the last report I ever received about his whereabouts were about a year ago. I wouldn't be sure if he's around the swamp area anymore, or if he's even alive still. There's also infected <i>thriving</i> in that place. Most of the hordes we fight off come from that bog.\" His cautious warning was greatly stressed in the danger. However, he sighs as his arms crossed against his breasted chest, \"Although, if you're <i>truly wanting</i> to uncover any details about this chaotic infection, the Toxicroak would be a great start for investigation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for the information. I would hate to pester you any longer, but would it be alright if my friend and I stay a night here?\" You ask, \"It would only be one night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pester me?\" The Charizard bellows out a mighty laugh. \"You brought back one of my citizens safe and sound. You've done enough to live here.\" He picks up Rose and places the rabbit on his left shoulder. He tosses a hand for you to follow as he turns around. The Village Chief peers back at you during his walk, \"Come to my home after you've splurged this city of it's wonders. Just ask any guard and they'll be more than happy to point you into the right direction. Mow please excuse me as I escort this little lady to her home.\" Rose giggles and hugs his long neck. The Charizard chuckles before leaving, \"No indulge yourselves for what Redeemer's Grotto has to offer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPence huffs and takes his leave close to the Village Chief's side as he glares at both you and Jackal. You ignore the bug's attitude and bring your attention to Jackal who was strangely quit the entire time. \"You good with staying here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raises a brow. \"<i>Now</i> you ask me?\" With the Scyther and Charizard far off in the distance by now with their backs turned, Jackal huffs, \"Hmph...I'm not sure if I lie those two, mainly that <i>Scyther</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be sure to inform the guards to let you sleep outside in the feral-filled tunnels then.\" You return with a sarcastic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft. You know what I mean.\" He tugs on his satchel and begins to head out into the town's streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And where exactly are you heading off to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns around, but continues his walk backwards and away from you. \"I'm gonna look for a bar. There's bound to be a few in this giant hole.\" The Typhlosion disappeared into the busy crowd of other Pokemon citizens as the Chief and his crew had done. You were now left alone and free to do what you like within the city. But what to do? Figuring out that this city probably has its own currency system to have kept its civilized society stable, you are completely broke to these Pokemon, rendering it useless to bother to purchase any goods for your journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuiding through the paths, you absorb the details of the stone constructions and amount of Pokemon around, not used to such an environment. The darkness to the area actually grows on you with time, slowly letting your mind forget that things could be much brighter. during your time in the city, many bystanders either greet you as a new-comer or compliment in wonder since you're the first Lucario they've ever seen. It wasn't like your race was endangered, but it was true that you haven't come across any other Lucarios in your lifetime besides your parents. But typically if you ever have the rare chance of meeting a Lucario, it most likely wouldn't be under a <i>mountain</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne instance stood out the most to you, however, from all of your encounters. A Sneasel stops you from passing as she steps from an alleyway. \"Oh, excuse me, mi-\" You are cut off as she snickers mischievously and trails a finger up your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I heard a rumor of a Lucario entering this city. Typically guards ignore or force away anyone whoever tries coming here. So what made you so special among the bunch that they let in, hmmm? There was a commotion that the Village Chief himself offered for your stay here. You sleeping with him or something?\" Her sly and smiling expression puts you in unease as the single digit begins to slide up to your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what? No, we-\" You are interrupted for the second time once the Sneasel's finger reached your lips, pressing down on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well then allow me to introduce myself. My name is Maple, but you can call me <i>whatever</i> you like.\" Her body steps closer to you, to the point where her body heat was soaking into your flesh from the close contact. The sultry cat flicks an ear as the claw tip circles at the outer edge of your mouth. \"Typically I don't see many Lucarios out and about these days, and I'm wondering if you wouldn't mind having a little chat with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was blatantly obvious of what she was <i>really</i> asking, although your mind actually has difficulty processing it all from the girl's bosom squeezing her breasts into your chest. You shudder at their texture with a strange, but sweet smelling aroma surrounding the girl. Her perfume was almost mind-controlling. You sadly played dumb to her request. \"To t-t-talk about wh-what exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blue eyes roll with her grin before she answers back, \"Oh dear, have I already enthralled your cock already? My, you <i>are</i> a <i>dog</i>.\" Her hand tugs at your groin before she brushes past you with a wink. \"If you're interested, I can give you a proper 'town welcoming'  by meeting me at the Eastern Well later tonight. Just ask around to find it, <i>Lucario</i>.\" And with that, Maple vanishes into the crowd like so many others have done to you today. You legs shake a little from having such a seductive woman flirt with you and actually offer a tempting deal, and it was even free with no strings attached! You saw little reason to refuse such a thing, and you <i>did</i> plan on leaving tomorrow, so you may as well enjoy your time here. However, you saw something a little dangerous about the cat, be it her dark-type nature or the fact she never bothered to get your name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Maybe she has some kind of dog fetish or something...</i>\" You guess in your own thoughts. The idea actually makes you greedily happy a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend the majority of the day exploring the city, seeing its attractions, if there were any to offer, and stop by the occasional bar to see if Jackal was inside. Alas, you have no luck finding the Typhlosion and you skip the pubs without even purchasing a drink. Through time and boredom, you soon glance up to see a clock tower reveal that it was getting close to sunset outside. You weigh your options of what to do next. You could either go see the Village Chief about that generous suggestion of letting you stay for free, or....you could meet up with Maple the Sneasel and see what she <i>really</i> wants to do with you besides just talk. Blood begins to boil in your groin with the thought, however, you were certain Jackal would also be at the Chief's den which had you a little worried about him. You certainly did not want to prepare and leave the city in the morning without knowing where he was within this massive chasm. You didn't want to lose precious daylight in having to search the entire city for him.</span></div></div>",

As good as it sounds to spend your time with that tantalizing Sneasel, it all sounded too good to be true. Making your way through the streets as usual, you are able to find a Ninetales soldier leaning against a lantern post. You grab her attention by asking for directions to the Charizard's residence, to where she happily and clearly instructed its location to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTraveling and arriving to the stone construction, Redeemer's Grotto flags curtain down along the large front entrance of the wooden doorway. Two guards give you the clear to enter, having to expect your arrival from a word of the Charizard. Entering the large building, you step through a somewhat luxurious foyer and greeted by an Espeon maid. The Eeveelution adorns a crimson dress with yellow ruffled foliage supporting the city's colors, in fact, most of the furniture and art depicted these colors very well, and a bit, <i>extremely</i>. You wondered if the Village Chief forced his servants to wear clothes, since they were an unnecessary asset to Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you must be Lace! Allow me to show you to my master's quarters.\" She gestures for you to follow with a happy smile. Keeping yourself at her pace, she sneaks in a comment by whispering, \"...Are you actually solving the reason for the infection? Do you know anything about it so far, because I mean, we're not supposed to discuss it in our city but you <i>know</i> that everyone is wondering how this entire mess got started. We're not dumb enough or brave enough to just ignore that factor, especially with-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Luna, I know you aren't interrogating out guest for why he's here, are you?\" The Charizard's voice calls out. Luna, the Espeon, eeps as she discovers that the both of you had arrived in the Village Chief's throne room, having her face glow a bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stutters with terror and embarrassment, \"N-No of course not, master. Please excuse me.\" She quickly performs a small bow before leaving the premises of the room without another second to waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Charizard chuckles as he rests his big-bellied self upon his throne. \"Don't worry about her. I have no laws saying that our citizens can't acknowledge the infection's existence. But with our demanding urges, people seem to think that, not that I'm complaining for it. It provides much less stress for me due to the lack of panic as a leader.\" He slaps his hand on his legs and stands up to welcome. \"Ah yes, I have a new open inn to show you. How has your stay been in Redeemer's Grotto so far?\" He steps down the small platform to approach you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think back as much as you can about so far, but can only imagine Maple and what tonight could have held. \"Well, let's just say I met some interesting people today. Mainly one person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon's eyes glimmer. \"Oh? Don't tell me you've already spent your time with one of the city's many prostitutes, have you?\" His sinister grin apparently wasn't meaning any harm or surprise, but more from the sense of pleasure?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cheeks begin to build up heat up. \"Wha? No, heh, not entirely...Do you not outlaw prostitution in your city?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Charizard releases his quaking laughter, grabbing your shoulder with an arm wrapped behind your back to pull you into his own side. \"Bah ha ha ha ahh haaa! Why on earth would I outlaw such a thing? Work is work and pleasure is pleasure!\" You feel a tad awkward being nudged into the dragon's pudge like this, but you really wanted to make a good impression on this leader. He continues a smile and calms down from his laughter, \"Even my lustrous maid Luna partakes in several naughty antics with me at night, now isn't that right my little servant?\" From calling out to Luna, he had noticed her walking past the throne room in the hall, and she easily picked up on what he was talking about. Her face explodes with red even more than yours did, and she quickly quickens her speed down the hall with her two-tipped tail tucked between her legs. He chuckles once more before replacing his attention back to you. \"I may or may not know many prostitutes that thrive throughout my city. So who took your fancy, you dirty little hound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reply with an unwilling snicker and reply, \"Do you know of Maple the Sneasel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis entertained smirk droops down into a bewildered frown. \"Are you saying you actually saw that Pokemon?\" You nod, curious as to why he appeared so troubled upon hearing her name. The Charizard softly releases you and questions you. \"And do you know where this Sneasel is? Did she request to meet or take you somewhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorriedly, you admit, \"Well, she said she wanted to see my tonight at uhm..the Eastern Well, I believe?\" The Village Chief glances over at a Rapidash guard, nodding to him as the horse exits out of the room. You are able to listen to the soldier rally up a few troops and head out. \"Why is that a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because...\" He states with a hint of grin. \"She's actually a slave trader who kidnaps citizens and smuggles them out of the city. We've been trying to track her down and have been searching for her secret tunnels that she's been shipping her poor captives to. But now, with your help in this, I suppose she expected you to capture you in seclusion since you are unaware of her notorious nature. Hehhehheeeh, you've done well yet again!\" He gives a powerful slap to your back. \"You never cease to impress me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a Dragonair naga slithers in, carrying a dead-looking Typhlosion over his shoulder! The soldier announces, \"Sir, I found this Typhlosion passed out in the streets, mumbling about how it was urgent to see you for something.\" You couldn't believe that the fat <i>husk</i> slugged over the guard's shoulder was Jackal. The Charizard chuckles and nods, allowing the naga to drop Jackal onto the floor for him to groan in misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">T-Too...much ale...</font>\" The fire-type manages to spit out. He was completely out of it and drunk. You go over to your drowsy companion and swing his arm around you to help him stand up a bit. You noticed that he sports a large beer belly that sloshes with each slight movement he makes with all of his rambling and hics emitting out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Village Chief smiles and begins to lead the two of you out to show you your place of stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was empty except for the small rug lying in the center, with two beds were in far corners. The space was a bit small, but definitely tolerable. You set your bag next to the bed as Jackal immediately collapses on his own bed face first, grumbling in the sheets as he stroke his gut to calm it down. The Charizard lights a torch against the wall with his flame tipped tail, lowering it back down from the wall to the floor. The thick orange tail sweeps slowly across the dusty flooring to grasp your odd attention as the Village Chief sighs to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, it isn't much since the building was made recently which is why you can have all to yourselves, but for a night, I'm positive you'll find that your beds are quite <i>comfy</i>. Tomorrow morning, meet me at the town gate and I'll give you the directions to the swamp...that is, if you're still actually willing to travel to it. I'll allow you to sleep on the decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much.\" You bow the to Chief leader, seeing as that is the correct response to him around here. The Charizard asks one more question as he turned to leave. \"I never did get your name, did I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lace.\" You answer. Jackal raises a hand up before you could say'Jack' again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm-shmmph...Jawkhal....\" He grumbles followed by a hic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lace and Jackal.\" The Charizard huffs out with a smile. \"I'll be sure to remember those names.\" He then takes a strange, and violating glare at your body, browsing it from top to bottom. You hear him say as he opens the door to leave with his back turned to you. \"Hmph. You seem to be a bit young to be going through so much trouble that could easily throw your life away.\" You watch his tail brush one last time against the flooring before it disappears behind the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you were in your selected beds at this point, Checking on Jackal, the Typhlosion apparently decides to sleep atop his blankets and covers, preoccupied with his hangover. You close your eyes as you say, \"See you in the morning, <i>Jack</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal had his back turned to you while he slept on his side. He didn't even bother correcting you this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking your eyes tiredly, your blue ears dart up, catching an unusual sound and presence in your midst.

Your ears ring up and your body immediately jumps out of bed and hastily checks on Jackal. The big lug was still able to sleep in the chaos and noise, snoring a tad bit as he scritches his belly and snuggles close to his covers. You'd hate to feel bad, but giving him a light tap to wake him up was certain to fail, that's a definite. You press his side forcefully, causing Jackal to cry out in alarm before he rolls himself onto the floor with a loud <i>THWUMP</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack! What the...\" He shakes his head violently as he rubs his tired, gloomy eyes, barely managing to ask in his sleepy state, \"Wh-what's going on...?\" You didn't take the time to answer him immediately while you walk to a closed window. Opening the wooden shudders, you peer through the opening to find a storm of purple glowing dots deep within the gate entry darkness. The entire wall was completely demolished, either by being crushed by what ever Pokemon were strong enough to use such brutality, or it was burning down to a crisp, clouding the short area in a dense smoke. Several infected were scurrying down the streets to collect the meals they could find, but thankfully, you witness several blockades and groups of guards ready to defend such a situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah, out of all the days to stay here.\" You say to yourself before you open the door to head downstairs. Jackal, realizing the danger at hand now, shakes off any remaining drowsiness and follows swiftly behind you. Opening the door to the streets, you watch as Redeemer's Grotto soldiers fend off the maniacal infected ferals rampaging the city. Some guards with kicking bellies, others with their legs or heads sticking out of an infected's mouth. What terrified you the most were of the ferals that overpowered the sentries with...<i>other</i> parts of their bodies than just their maws. Having to observe a Floatzel's thrashing legs sink down into a Sableye's purple cock as i growls with vanquishing the whining soldier. You are ready to help until you notice Pence the Scyther, kicking an infected Mightyena anthro off of him, spotting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You picked one bloody time to stay here!\" He said while striking the Mightyena again, sending it to yelp in retreat. The dog kicked to its heels, running away in limping manner only to get caught by a Swellow soldier's grasp. The Scyther turn to talk to you in the heat of battle, but seems to be too out of breath. \"We usually experience massive infected attacks maybe...<i>heghhh</i>...once a month? But recently...<i>heghhh</i>...whew, they've been coming more often for my comfort. I think they're finally understanding that we can't last like this forever, especially when the take off with several of our soldiers in their stomachs.\" He sighs out, resting his elbows on his bent knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll help but I really hate to say this. After this is over, we're heading out immediately to the swamp.\" You try and appeal to him, getting a nod from Pence in return. The bug Pokemon shrugs a shoulder to his side, pointing at a direction while looking at Jackal. \"I could use you over this side of the town. There'a large majority of grass type infected attacking that area from what I can tell, and I'd really appreciate a fire type that looks like he can screw em' over a tad bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPence and Jackal left you standing at the road to take care of your own street as you hear the Typhlosion yell over to you in his run, \"Hey, Lace...uh...good luck out there! And stay alive, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to the direction where the larger battle seems to take place, looking through the crowd of Pokemon fighting in gripping battles until you hear a loud roar arise above all the others...</span></div></div>",

Ascending from the crowd of ferals, a massive and brown female bird releases her shattering call once more. It gives you a good enough look of the Fearow's saliva and tongue wobble in her open beak, releasing the hot steamy air of her empty stomach out with a clear intent of filling it. She was tall, taller than all of the ferals that were funneling out of a dug open entrances some of the ground-types made, completely appearing as their alpha. The obvious attribute that clued you in on the avian's gender was the round breasts exposed on her lithe figure. Her violet eyes survey the city streets, attempting to find the easiest prey to snatch up and gobble down without any distractions or guards to oppose her. That glowing glare fixate on you as you stand in the open, far from the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you fear, the brown feathered wings flap once more, breaking the air and glides the Fearow like closer to your position faster with each second. She was twice your height, watching talons of her legs reflect the torchlight out to catch you with her booming back wings flapping to gain velocity. Her hands even are outstretched to slice the claw tips through the air on her way over. It was time to run. Attempting to turn around, the pink scaled legs easily catch up to you, not even allowing you the decency to get a padding start. Her talons scrunch together, grasping you tightly from the dirt road to carry you with her in the air. You witness the ground parting its way with you, slowly and surely taunting you with its distant hope fading as the Fearow gains much air in height. She circles above the town with your struggling and yelling body snagged in her talons' clutch, hoping some guard would launch some kind of projectile attack to help save you. But to their own concern, they had ferals on the ground to deal with already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMovement might have made it worse for you though. Major panicking writhes were close enough to stab your body against her sharp claws, which would lead to a much worse death than just sliding down that long throat of hers. She grips her talons together again, except vastly tighter this time to constrict out all of the air from your lungs. Your muscles seize together and your bones tremble in the vice pressure. It was a strong grasp to cease your squirming, reinforcing that you were going to be her easy-to-eat prey by pressing her scaled flesh against your furry one. Your eyes roll up with your ribs begging for release as your soaring dangerously high above the city. Would you really want her to just suddenly let you go? The mighty Fearow screeches out once more with outstretched arms, having her belly rumbling about at the cavernous city walls. A big woman like her was going to need more than just you to sate her hunger. It was now or never to be saved.</span></div></div>",

She had kicked her legs up during her flight, releasing you to be thrown into the air in front of her. Having the strong forcing wind blow through your fur instead of being compacted to death by talons, the nice sensation ends once you are faced with a large, open maw leaking copious strands of drool from the spread beak. In the split second that you had been thrown, the <i>long</i> tan-colored beak quickly snaps you up, stopping you from falling to your death as it happily accepts your shuddering small body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fearow herself being as big as she is, her beak sports a large tunnel to snap up prey of any height like your own quite effortlessly. Most of your body has already been consumed within her ravenous mouth, leaving your arms and legs to dangle out the sides of her beak. You cough out when that large and fat tongue of hers looms over and strides across your entire face and back. The saliva oozes slowly in large portions, pouring against your fur and sticking it together in big slimy heavy clumps that never seem to stop drenching you. You couldn't believe that this was the end, and that your quest would actually land you right here, as bird <i>fodder</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere and then do you start to feel the rumbling of the walls of her mouth, hearing a murring noise of content delight. The Fearow at least seems to really like what she was tasting. You didn't know whether it was an insult or a twisted compliment. Kicking your legs as the only action you appear to be able to make at this point, you only manage to shuffle around on top of her wet, cushioning tongue, giving her much more wanted pleasure and flavor of your furry hide. The tongue curls around you, hugging you tightly into a fixed, laid out position. The massive tentacle wriggles and begins to pump up and down your body in a spring-like coil, squishing its tasting mass around your drenched form for the best extent of flavor and texture of you. You can gag and whine out in distressing defeat all you want from the pools of saliva washing over you, you're muffled each time the tongue smooshes itself up on your head and face just to reinforce what you are to her. The thick tendril unravels your tuckered body at last, letting you lay upon it to bathe in your own loss. The Fearow gulps down, sending your body to suck inward all the way and leaves you to hit face first against a slick fleshy wall that opens to take you in her esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squeeze within the dark humid tunnel, whimpering out as the sphincter slurps you down.

A round bulge protrudes out of her long feathered neck as a Lucario wobbles and squirms for freedom in its travel down her craned neck, passing her breasted chest and emerging inside the stomach, giving the bird a nice, round belly for his body to boil inside. She screeches once more, her gut jiggling up and down from the flapping of her wings along with her prey's useless struggles. She dives down to fill the rest of her steaming stomach, catching up to three soldiers off guard at different moments and snaps her beak shut each one each time over them. The Pokemon trapped inside cry out and wriggle for escape, although, wet licks and heavy swallows answer their pleas, sending them right down to join the Lucario who by now has finally surrendered to the truth of his existence. The Fearow caws out and dives back down to aid her infected companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd for the city of Redeemer's Grotto, the presence of the Fearow have many guards and citizens fleeing, but are quickly captured and eaten by the ferals who wait by the exits, fixing the remaining survivors in the middle of town surrounded, and soon to be devoured with the rest of their citizens.</i></span></div></div>",

The Fearow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knees bent down as you feel a foot clutch closer around you and pulls you up to her basin of her vagina. To your horror, after you witness so much sexual organ <i>consumption</i>, you had no intention of thinking that you would suffer from such an ending, however, it appears your failure of resistance shall suffer dire consequences; by being stuffed inside this Fearow's crotch for who knows what will happen in there. The large bird nudges your head to firmly touch the blushing pussy, sliding you back and forth against her hot folds to drench your body in their sticky liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunt in response as she flops her long tongue out, enjoying your body as her toy with your furry wriggling pleasing her sole and talons. The Fearow grinds your body once she presses it flat out onto her pussy, squeezing you against the fleshy ceiling with her soft rocks of her waist, rubbing you over the sensitive material. Some time afterwards, the Fearow transitions into the next step by plunging your head upwards, which squishes it through the lowering lips and compact around the vagina's new guest! You twist and writhe for freedom while receiving more annoyance for giving the brown bird much more pleasure from before. You felt yourself slide in closer, feeling the slick walls vibrate around from each slight movement you unwillingly give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you are up to your waist inside her and leaves your dangling legs to thrash in the cold air, the Fearow grips them with her foot again and begins pumping them inward and outward. Your upper body would enter the heated wet walls, and was then pulled out, drenched with sticky love juices. Her insides were practically steam off with heat, warming up the consumed portion of your body that have you groan in confusing arousal. The massive avian releases your black furred legs to allow them being swallowed inward to leave your hind paws the only remaining portion leftover. She presses a single talon against your paw pads, poking them in as they wriggle helplessly with the large lips puckering over them, sending you sliding up unknowingly to the womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Fearow finally unloads the pressure in her waist, splattering her orgasm on the rooftop to weep down the walls for any Redeemer's Grotto soldiers to watch. To some, it disgusts them, others were heavily aroused by the sight, while the rest were left disappointed in a fallen comrade. However, many would consequently be left distracted for ferals to creep from around and capture the soldiers. They struggle desperately, yet many would end up as meals for their infected captors to devour wholly. On the rooftop, the Fearow shivers in the enticing after effects from the orgasm as she feels a humping bulge travel inside of her waist to her midsection. After playing around at the kicking walls by poking the feathered lump with her wing, she caws out joyously, flapping her wings and takes off into the air to be ready for more meals. In her intimidating dive, she caught two more panicking citizens: A fat Charizard and a small Buneary girl. They would make wonderful unbirthing victims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey wriggle in her taloned clutches while she lands on another rooftop for them to join the wobbling belly a Lucario struggles in, all the while, the Redeemer's Grotto soldiers were losing the fight against the infected horde, especially without their leader anywhere around to direct them. Many were only sloshing bellies to the ferals, and soon, the entire town's population would become nothing but cum and body fat.</i></span></div></div>",

When your straining energy was draining out from all of the work, you feel your shoulder squeeze out at last, able to slip out your entire arm now! Making sure you wouldn't waste the time nor the element of surprise, you focus as much energy as your body allowed in its asphyxiating position to strike the Fearow. Your paw ignites in blue and you effectively slam it forward into the large bird's ankle to erupt a small burst of your blazing aura. She yelps at the burning impact, cawing out pain while instantly dropping you from her ensnarement to get away from you, which thankfully for you, you're to be sent straight onto a close by rooftop to land on in your brief descent down. Still moving forward by the force though, your body grinds into the gravelly clay rooftop of the building you crashed down on, sliding closer and closer to the edge. Slamming your forepaws into the ceiling you were gliding against, you struggle to stop yourself from flying off of the building towards the ground below that could kill you from the fall. In the last moment to halt, you press your full body weight into the flooring, ceasing your force backwards with your legs dangling over the edge. Huffing gratefully heaves of air as you grumble to get back of from hanging off the edge of the rooftop, you continue to hear the Fearow's cries cawing out in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, you had sprained nothing in the collision and managed to stand back with only just a few bruises. Driving the dizziness away to make sure the Fearow wasn't going to circle around and grab you again, you quickly scan the area for the fastest way down the building to return to the streets where you were needed. Spotting a destroyed portion of the rooftop leaving a gaping hole their to the floor below, you hop down that and easily find your way down through staircases to open a wooden door to lead into a small alley. Patting away all the dirt from your legs, you glance up to see the Fearow you attacked kick at its ankle to stop the burning, only to crash straight into an outer village wall while knocking the daylights from the carnivorous bird thanks to your attack's distraction. You see the avian creature slam down to the floor into a pile of crumbling rubble, unconscious from hitting the concrete head first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter just a few steps in the alley way with a victorious and satisfied huff of air, you instantly meet a new obstacle ahead you as a silhouette of a body turns the corner, gleaming two purple dots from its large head. You frightfully listen to the sound of lip smacking and stomach gurgling as you look a bit downward to see a large sphere hanging from its midsection, slightly bouncing by kicks with muffled yelling calling out inside. It was an anthro Politoed, and a hungry one at that. It would've definitely already been fat, even without the meal trapped inside of it. The heavy dome of rubbery flesh sags to taut and bouncy proportions, topped with a faint pair of male breast flabs and round thighs to stand on. Its glistening skin reflects the torch light of the alley, along with the evil violet hue of its eyes. The infected Politoed smacks its chos with its broad tongue to lick over its watering mouth, stroking at its fat belly to make the prey inside whine out in anguish. Apparently, the amphibian was ready for you to join the unfortunate victim squished inside its large gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green and yellow frog unleashes its whip-like tongue, causing you to try and...</span></div></div>",

You frightfully gasp and toss out your hands in an accidental reflex, wincing as the slobbery whip makes contact in a heavy slap. You shut your eyes close as you feel the tongue hit you...but...within the clutches of your hands instead! Opening your eyes, you watch as the tip of the long muscle wriggles around in agitation while trying to flee from your hold. The bright pink tentacle wobbles around between your paws close to your face, struggling to either escape or to lick your face. Before the Politoed could react or pull its tongue back in, you tense your muscles and attempt to toss the hefty toad out like a mace with your hands trapped to its sticky texture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swing your arms to your side and over your shoulder, lifting the Politoed off of its feet and into the air some. Its bellied mass crushes into the graveled road on its gut close in front of you, shaking the earth beneath you during the impact. The frog gags out from the force and starts to choke out in coughs throughout its writhing. You suddenly see a large bulge in its fat travel up through its throat and out of its mouth as the frog tries to gag out what it previously swallowed up. An Ivysaur head spurts out from its lips, gasping for air to finally breathe again. The dino's hands slide out and attempt to pull his entire body out, <i>slathered</i> in the frog's saliva to easily slide back outside. After his legs are freed, the Ivysaur falls down on his chest with a wet splat, groaning in heavy pants of air completely grateful to be out of the feral's belly. You so happened to take note of the nut sac and wobbling wet cock to see that with was a male with his back turned to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe coughs out a bit more and manages to get to his hands and knees. Looking up at you and standing up poorly, he thanks with complete appreciation, \"Whew! Thanks buddy, I owe ya!\" After saying that, he coughs out again weakly, pressing his hands on his knees. After being inside that tight stomach which the frog most likely roughed him up to do, the Ivysaur would need a moment to catch his breath. \"I'd be a bunch of frog fat and a pile of feces if it weren't for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering the infected Politoed, you walk over to his heavy form as it flips itself over to his back, dazed. This was your chance to stop it once for all, which you then experience a bit of deja vu with memory of the Pinsir you stunned on the ground. You had been successful with swallowing up a feral before, and even that was surprisingly a magnificent experience, so perhaps you could succeed again?</span></div></div>",

You approach the stunned frog without another thought and go down to grasp its legs. Your tongue pokes out between your lips, touching along the rim of your mouth in anticipation as you recur the sensation of feeling of having that Pinsir slide down your throat back in the forest. Devouring the feral had proven to be disturbingly pleasuring, along with packing a lot of energy for your trek from your home. you had deduced that ferals are so quick and powerful from so much nutrition they receive when they guzzle down Pokemon. Now it was time to give this feral a taste of its own medicine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Politoed remains lying on its back, grunting out in loss of focus with its bulbous tongue lolled out tiredly. It's just like what they say, <i>the bigger they are, the harder they fall</i>. You grab the ankles of the green and yellow toad, lifting his footpaws up to your awaiting mouth to consume. Your tongue impatiently thrashes out, brushing against the outer smooth skin of the Politoed that has your legs shuddering a tad with your fur prickling with excitement. The strange meaty flavor ignites and persuades your tongue to continue dragging his hefty length over the frog's soles, wanting more its hide inside your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt makes a single quick moan of surprise, still barely conscious from its fall, however still dissipating in energy. You murr at his flavor when stroking your tongue around them, striding it across his soles more and up his ankles to finally widen your mouth. Quickly pressing them in, the feet submerge inside of your maw, letting your tongue do its work to lick around at the cushioned soles. You sweep his on all three of his yellow digits for each foot with the muscle, coating them in a clear slimy liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frog tries to kick at the ticklish feeling, but with its added weight, only seems to jiggle its thick legs. You swallow them in happily, gulping his knees and thick thighs into your throat to expand your throat and appease your lust for food as you arrive at the hard part. His hips were wide, and shaking to get free, which now that you thought about it, it seems like the infected Politoed was stirring back awake. Not knowing if you could even hold this wall of <i>flesh</i> in, you open your mouth to its maximum ability, wincing at the stretching feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hips however are gulped down into you, sending his waist to follow his twitching legs. Now that the difficulty of that was over, you still had to squeeze its <i>very chubby</i> belly inside, and as much as you wanted to taste and lick the frog pudge, you were not so sure your own belly could hold this frog in with its shifting movements. The Politoed began to lose its dizziness and realize the danger it was in once its purple eyes widened. Struggling inside, it almost causes you to gag his body back out from his sickening movements and thrashes while he croaks in anger. His feet were almost in your stomach, causing a fat bulge to form from your neck to your chest, bouncing out in distress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe round belly seems impossible to devour at this rate because you needed more time to cram it in, but what choice did you have? You made a last attempt to swallow the toad blubber in, feeling his body begin to...</span></div></div>",

His belly was stuck sloshing outside of your mouth, stopping you from taking anymore of its girthy body in. \"<i>D-Damn, I was so close!</i>\" You think to yourself as you endeavor to gulp the fat globe in in hopes something would turn out for the better for you. But to no avail, the Politoed lost any sense of confusion it had before and was in a full attempt of escape by kicking his legs inside your tight throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't take it anymore, and you feel like your stomach was going to convulse and deny wanting any bit of more meat. Curling your torso down, you place your arms off the big blubbery gut and onto your chest and belly, gagging from his struggles with audible wet whines. The feral chuckles once it sees its endeavors working and twists around inside once again within your maw, placing its hands against the rim of your jaws while pushing against it. You feel his body reverse its movements, sliding back out of your throat and freeing itself your maw in short but victorious shifts. His feet finally plop out from your gagging jaws, leaving half of his rubbery body to be slathered in coats of thick Lucario drool. You collapse to your hands and knees, struggling to get back up from the feeling of the frog forcing itself back out of your maw. Your throat seems to have increased in pressure, and your stomach growled in an ill state from the thought. A shadow looms over you quite soon afterwards, darkening your surroundings in an ominous veil in the shape of a frog. Raising your tired vision up, you watch as a dark green pucker ascends over you, seemingly to pulsate and wince in tension. The Politoed was standing directly in front of you, with its hands gripping its fat cheeks to stretch its rump wide open for your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to protest out immediately, only until your sounds of sorrow are muffled out once the hole gapes around your entire head with the light green asscheeks clenching around it. The Politoed murrs with ease, pumping your head within the anal tunnel back and forth like a toy for its rectum to where the only thing you could do is shiver in distress and push against its rear, smooshing the doughy and rubbery orbs into your paws that it only makes the excited frog drag you in closer. The fleshy and narrow tunnel had stale air, which was little to be had, and obscured your vision in complete pinkish darkness. You feel your arms squeeze inside the hole while being pinned to your sides, rendering the useless arms to struggling for freedom from the awful torture in being a sex toy. The anal walls press up against your body, mashing your head to squish your face's cheeks together to make you whine unhappily. \"<i>This...th-this can't be happening! It's shoving me up its a-a-ass...!</i>\" You whimper to yourself as it only pleases your predator. The Village Chief's words turned out to be true for some ferals using more than just their mouths to claim their meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Politoed began to squish your legs in and out, using them for its enjoyment, and oh was he <i>enjoying</i> it. The toad rolls its long tongue out, dangling it in the air  to swish lightly as its bucking motions continued to bounce its belly and butt pudge around. At last, your furry legs are dragged inside, leaving the musty hole to close around your footpaws with your body sinking through the frog's body. You groan in defeat once your body crams into the hot stomach, pressing at the compacting strong walls weakly as you were made a meal out of. After thinking you beat the Politoed, the roles reversed, and you still ended up in a stomach for your quest to come to an end. Moaning inside, you are left as nothing but meat to the frog as you're slathered in stomach juices to be prepped for digestion. A large bulge presses out in the chubby Politoed, making its protruding gut round outward a bit more luxuriously to the feral's delight. It slaps its hands together on each side of the fleshy globe, massaging the tautness and fat over your devoured body. You curl within the fumey organ powerfully, dozing away into faintness inside the toad in your pathetic sobbing. Hopefully someone would come save you as you did for the Ivysaur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, at that moment in time the Politoed spots the Ivysaur anthro down aways on the same road, held up upon his hands and knees during heavy breaths to regain his senses. The obese frog walks forth to the grassy dino, ready to reclaim the meal it lost before to join the weak predator of a Lucario. The Ivysaur hears the heavy footsteps come to him closely, but it was already too late for him to escape. He gasps suddenly when he sees the open and drooling maw of the Politoed again over his shoulder, and attempts to crawl on his back to flee the drooling mouth once more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Two green Ivysaur feet disappear in the Politoed's lips with three clawed digits on each hindpaw scrunched in stress before vanishing. The chubby amphibian swallows the massive bulge into its obese size, belching out victoriously from the second course. Planting its hands into his pudgy gut, the Politoed feral takes a moment to feel the struggles of his meal once again as the Ivysaur whines inside with an unconscious Lucario covered in drool is mashed against his own slimy nude body. A hero that had saved him was all at a lost at this point to where they both would share a digestive fate for the apocalypse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Politoed roams through the streets with a sloshing belly, it knew it could fit just one more delicious Pokemon in its stomach before it would retreat away back into the caves. Its purple stare looks over to see a male Typhlosion, too distracted fighting other infected that he would make another easy meal. After all, the Politoed couldn't wait to cram a cute fire-type down into its boiling belly. The infected frog pads over to the fire type who has his back turned to the Politoed. Jackal suddenly felt two amphibian hands capture his arms as a long and slimy pink tentacle wraps around his head, blinding his vision as he's lifted from behind and stuffed face first into a feral's maw. He growls in muffled tones as the frog would make a snack out of him, along with all of the other ferals to the citizens of Redeemer's Grotto.</i></span></div></div>",

The infected Politoed's belly is resting at the outside of your devouring lips, but was still able to begin sinking inside. Determined to win this struggle now, you grip your food by its sides, pulling the Politoed towards your swallowing jaws to mash in more of the amphibian's sloshing belly inside your throat. You wince in a little by the round size, but pass it off as being completely worth the venture when you discover yourself moaning some by the meaty flavor dragging over your tongue. Is this how ferals really felt when they ate someone? It was exhilarating to say the least, and quite desirable enough for it to become a habit. Maybe something about this could help you tie in what the infection truly was. But thinking could wait. You had a frog to swallow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you spot the Ivysaur anthro you had saved earlier pad over to you in his drool covered body. \"Ya look like ya need some help there. Let me repay ya for savin' me!\" He chuckles out, grabbing the Politoed's head as the obese toad struggles for freedom while spitting out hisses of anger. The Ivysaur lifts up the head, making the body the Politoed decline its body into your mouth, creating a much easier time to swallow the feral down now. Did the Ivysaur not see it as strange that you were eating a feral? Perhaps even sane Pokemon just eat ferals for the sport in it, and what was normal for the time. You had been living under a rock for a long time, but then again, so have Redeemer's Grotto citizens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow rubbery gut slides into your throat as you feel the infected's feet press against your stomach walls. Triumphant at last with the Ivysaur's aid, you finally gulp the round frog belly in, finishing any difficult challenge for this meal to continue to end the feral's time in the outside world. The infected frog's arms were compressed inside your  chomping jaws, allowing its chest to arrive at the base of your mouth. Your tongue flicks around hungrily, poking and juggling his chubby chest to tease the feral at its own game, feeling around for any indications for man-breasts. The frog grunts helplessly and jerks his body around in agony as a response to the torturing licks. The Ivysaur releases the feral's head, allowing you to be able to lift your own head up to swallow the rest of the sinking infected Politoed down. Its head is slurped inside, and you close your lips to seal its fate inside your digestive system. A <i>gargantuan</i> round bulge protrudes out of your body greatly when you take your final gulp, collecting down together to slosh your belly outward. The heavy weight plummets to your stomach, letting your yellow furry gut stretch roundly out to impossible odds. You could barely even stand now! Yet you had succeeded and defeated a feral. Now that was one less infected to worry about in this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pat your large and squirming belly that hung out of your midsection, enjoying the frog's constant writhing and grumbles. It felt amazing to have another Pokemon stewing inside of your stomach actually, stirring a form of desire for it within your heart, stomach, and mouth to where you wanted more strangely. The Ivysaur grins and gives a single slap to your back while thanking, \"Let that be a gift to ya, from me! If ya hadn't squeezed me outta that belly, I would've become just another layer of fat on it.\" He laughs in a joyful boast as he makes his way back down the street to continue his efforts to stop the infected horde. From what you saw after you had browsed your sight over the entire underground estate, the Grotto's soldiers were winning at the rate they were going, and the rest of the ferals would soon run or become large round bulges for the soldiers from what you would hope for. In fact, as you did peer around, more and more soldiers were stumbling around with fat bellies with prey trapped inside. So, maybe this had become a normal thing for society?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit at the building you were standing next to, and lean your heavy form against the wall. You would have to digest your largest meal that you ever ate to be able to move again; going back out there to fight would have been suicide for a plump and slow Lucario for a feral to feast on. You rest back, but stayed alert just in case a feral ever came by, waiting for the carnage to end. The soldiers would surely win.</span></div></div>",

The remainder of the infected ferals that hadn't been consumed and were boiling within the digestive bellies of the citizens and soldiers had already fled through the tunnels with their numbers cut incredibly short. The ravenous determined soldiers chased the infected out of the caverns, sending them scattering in terror. You relax against the wall you laid back on, rubbing your large furred belly to ease the digestion of the frog who long ago gave up its struggling efforts. You watch from your lounged position as soldiers passed by with kicking guts, assessing the damage done by the infected and calming any citizens down that the carnage was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you see Jackal walk by, noticing your newly expanded form. \"Well hot damn. I think it's safe to say that you beat me in size.\" He said while rubbing the back of his head, a bit impressed with your gut. You descend your vision a bit downward, noticing his large round belly that sagged down as well, occasionally bouncing out from kicks of peril within. He grips his other hand under the soft globe, pressing into the chub to tease his meal. Even Jackal himself ate a feral, concluding your suspicions about what you'd be seeing anyone defeating a feral would probably end with it sliding down their own mouths. You pondered how many ferals you could eat at maximum. You already felt like you were going to burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great to see you alive and well...eh, what did you manage to catch there, Jack?\" You scarcely asked through your full state. Jackal gives you a glare of what you called him, but grew a smile and as he closed his eyes delightfully. He tugs his gut, happily replying, \"Well, after Pence led me through to fight off grass-types for him, this Jolteon came out of nowhere and almost zapped the poor bug to death.\" Jackal flexes his arm some, cockily boasting, \"But she was no match for me. It felt nice to have her sliding through my mouth in a weird kind of way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Jackaaaaaal</i>!\" Yells a shrill voice emitting from afar. The both of you turn to look down the road, watching as a red and brown Buneary came frantically dashing down the dirt path while waving joyfully. Rose leaps powerfully up with her rabbit legs, grabbing onto Jackal's round belly and jiggling it around from the impact. She hugs the bloated chub, leaving Jackal to stammer in his own words while blushing a bit. Rose continues to cuddle the the thin-furred fat, pressing the side of her face into it like a pillow to listen to it gurgle. Jackal grabs the scruff of her neck and set her back down gently to her hindpaws as she cheers with glee. Rose giggles, \"I'm so happy you're still alive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-u-uh....yeah, of course I would be...\" He awkwardly tosses out words. He felt a bit embarrassed from the girl's odd clinging nature towards him, ever since she first laid eyes on him. The Buneary begins to look at the floor suddenly, almost hearing a quiver in her voice from your ears, \"I-I just thought...that if you had been...you know...e-e-ea...ea...eaaa...\" She couldn't finish her sentence as she jumped back at Jackal, catching him in surprise while clinging around his neck instead of his protruding gut this time. Rose whimpers into his neck while sitting on top of his belly, crying aloud, \"I'm just so overwhelmed that you're still here! I don't know what I would've done if it had been eaten by some rapist monster!\" Jackal, stilled stunned, slowly brought his arms closer to the Buneary, but instead of making contact, he simply just pats her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um. I think I'm tough enough to be able to handle a couple of infected...\" He assures her. She looked deep into his eyes happily once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely! You could take on the entire horde if you had to!\" Jackal just continues to blush, confused on what to say. He found the girl to be highly annoying...<i>but so cute at the same time</i> to the point that it was driving him mad. He wasn't very good with kids, but Jackal tries to shake those dreadful feelings away. He didn't believe in things being cute! He was tough! Males thinking that things were cute was...unthinkable to him! Rose then proceeded to poke at one of his arms. \"Just look at these strong muscles you have! I bet you're tougher than a raging Machamp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help yourself from covering your mouth with your hand, trying not to laugh at Jackal. Yes, he probably did have muscle, but by just looking at his arms and chest, there truly wasn't anything to see. You suddenly remember that you need to make sure the Village Chief was still around, and not digesting somewhere, and with that thought, you go out on your hunt to find the town leader...</span></div></div>",

The Charizard's pale yellow belly was...breathtaking for those who would want to rival such a stomach. You didn't think his gut could dome out anymore than it already did, but he easily countered your presumption about that. The impressive potbelly pokes outwards in a colossal globe of scaly flesh. It kicks proudly out, bouncing with every slight movement from the prey inside. Walking up to the fat dragon, you watch as the Village Chief's Espeon servant girl, Luna,  knead her hands against the large mass of weight, massaging her town leader's belly for eased digestion. His eyes are closed with his mouth open wide, procuring a toothy smile that flexed a floppy tongue out. He was clearly enjoying his treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of his eyes opened up, noticing you, and he instantly closes his mouth from his murring. After ordering his Luna to stop, he never let his smile fade away as he calls out to you while holding his arms out openly, \"Lace! My friend! I'm glad to see you alive and <i>well fed</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stammer closer to him, stopping while replying, \"I'm glad about that too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then places a hand over his fat gut, stroking at it. You wish you could take your attention away from it, but the Charizard notices that as well. \"I ate three infected anthros for my personal best record of hunting ferals. One Granbull, a Flareon, and I finished off with a very fast Grovyle that thought it could outwit me, ha ha!\" The Village Chief answers for you, smirking at his own added girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look away, getting to the point. \"I need to know how to get to the swamp we talked about yesterday.\" You politely demand from the fat dragon. His thick tail brushes sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, straight to business I see.\" He places his hands against the sides of the rock mound, pulling himself up with a hint of trouble thanks to his obese stomach. He manages to actually get to his feet and gestures you to follow him. \"Come this way. I can give you directions.\"</span></div></div>",

He had also explained to you the direction and paths to go into for the fastest trip to the swamp, and to get there, you had to bypass many feral-thriving areas by going through an 'empty' canyon. According to his scouts, they had said that a deserted village resided there, and the Charizard puts much stress into the words of his warnings about the infected that live there. You remember the Chief's words, \"The farther north you go, the more ferals you're bound to run into. They may even work together in packs just as they did to attack this, so be warned! They know how mighty they are the more of them that work together to devour you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are at the gate after you and Jackal had a moment to rest and digest most of your meals. Pence brought your bags that you had left in your temporary bedrooms as he said his farewells. Rose and the Village Chief were also there to see you off. Rose hugs Jackal again, except without hopping on him or anything this time, and smooshes her face against his mid-section. \"Promise me that you'll come back, alright?\" She begs the Typhlosion. He makes a single chuckle and scratches the top of the Buneary's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I promise.\" He assures her. So he finally lightened up about the girl after all. The Charizard places his hands on your shoulders, staring confidentially at you, \"Watch your back Lace, and keep you friends close. Infected ferals aren't the only Pokemon that would like a squirming Lucario in their bodies. Some Pokemon are carnivorous and crazy, so pay attention to those types!\" After a pat on your back, he orders a soldier to open the wooden gate. But before you left, you had to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, how did you ever get that Aggron armor actually?\" You question. He laughs out a bit, shaking his newly added flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wear it as a trophy! An Aggron was the hardest thing that I've ever eaten, including disposed of. An Aggron's skeleton is so strong, most of it survives digestion, thus, how I still have its exoskeleton helm and shoulders.\" He answers. The Charizard tapped his shoulder pieces to signify its durability and fortification.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPence walks up, gesturing his blade a bit in a good-bye wave, \"It was nice to meet you, Lace and Jackal. It's great knowing someone is finally trying to do something about this epidemic. I have a feeling you'll get far in your quest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after that, the both of you walk back through the tunnels, and manage to exit them thanks to the Village Chief's instructions. It was afternoon out in the blue sky, showing no signs of any clouds. Your belly is a bit pudgy, but it definitely digested most of the Politoed by now. Jackal's belly also had the same situation, which meant you had plenty of packed energy to make it through this trek to the swamp. You head northwest, to take a shortcut through this canyon, wondering if you'll meet anyone along the way, except for ferals though. This Toxicroak better be at this swamp, or this long journey risking your life dangerously was for all for nothing.</span></div></div>",

The canyon walls are truly intimidating in size, and the possibility of having infected hiding in the nooks and crannies of the plateau sides frightens you to no extent. You tighten your grip on your satchel bag and move onward as Jackal followed close behind, browsing and investigating the ominous rock walls. Your steps walk through its center while echoing around the natural eroded hall, making a straight narrow path to be able to pass the canyon's chasm to reach the swamp. Strangely enough, there are carved out sections of the clay and rock walls of buildings with rubble roofs, wooden bridges, and scaffoldings. It truly was once a place where Pokemon lived happily in a village, and you wonder if anyone was still around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Is anyone here?\" You dare to call out in hopes of seeing another rational soul instead of a feral. However, only the chilly and moaning wind of the canyon calls back by blowing past you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Jackal was a bit worried. \"That's it. This place is just freaking me out. We're outta here.\" He says as he bumps elbows with you to walk faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a dim shadow looms high above you during your walk! It went by too fast for you to be able to see what it truly was. Looking up, you search for the mysterious object, but to no avail, not finding anything in the air of it around. Perhaps then it was just a cloud, although it did seem pretty fast for the shadow to whisk at such a large size like that. Pretending to ignore it, you continue on, watching from the edges of your eyes for it. For about another five minutes, nothing seems to appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoincidentally, almost immediately after you point your vision up from the canyon floor, the large shadow flies past over your again; even Jackal noticed it this time. It was definitely a Pokemon, but which one? Was it infected?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instantly heard a, \"<i>Pssst</i>!\" The both of you look over to your right but see nothing but small grasses, an occasional weed, and clusters of rock. \"Are ya insane? Get under cover before ya get grabbed away!\" A woman's voice from what you guessed, (with a fill of a strange country accent), called out to you. An arm popped out from a small hole, almost covered by a bright brown stone. The arm was a bit thick in stature, but it had golden-hazel scales running almost all the way around it with claw tips at each finger. Under the arms, was a pale tan color of skin. The shadow streaks by again, and this time, you were ready to look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerror filled your eyes as you see a winged beast's width spreading out wide above you. It was a silhouette to your vision as it blackens the sun out in front of your eyes, and it conceals its species by the lighting effect. Its draconic hindpaws strike out, ready to capture prey like a bird. You quickly grab the tight bandanna around Jackal's arm, using it to pull him with you as you run for the waving big arm. You dive, tossing Jackal to his side with you as the both of you slide into the small hole, managing to miss the flying Pokemon's grasp. You heard its feet clench behind you, missing its attempt to collect you for its dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe both of you roll a bit down in the small hole is it formed into a sharp curving slide, as you fall face first into a...</span></div></div>",

However, there was a strange and quite lucky discovery. Your landing turns out to be more soft and plushy than you'd imagine! You feel your face slam into a thick cushion, making the impact much more comfortable to land in. Hitting whatever broke your downhill descent was obscuring your view though, so you place your hands around the plushy material that your head was stuck inside, and pushed against it quite firmly. With your head plopping out of the soft wall, you are shocked to find out what it was, or should you say, <i>who</i> it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had fallen face first straight in between a, quite chubby, female Sandshrew's breasts! You notice that your hands that you had used to grip and push yourself out are grasped firmly groped around her soft boobs, scaring you immediately with your fur prickling. Now you know what Jackal must have felt like when he first met Rose, except you were the awkward pervy one. Your cheeks flourish a bright red, and you release the voluptuous globes to begin grunting out different parts of different words in response, unable to control your voice. You crawl quickly back in embarrassment, looking up at her hazel eyes to see that she was also blushing as well, but seemed to be more flattered then horrified. Jackal remains how he fell, lying on the back of his shoulders with his rump accidentally in the air and his legs hunch over his body, groaning in discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumble back to try and find the right words, \"I-I-I'm s-so <i>sorry</i>...! We fell and I had no idea that what I landed into was...\" You trail off as the Sandshrew just waves her hand up and down to assure you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hun! Don't worry about it! I'm sure it was an accident.\" You notice that as she gestured her hand, that was the very same thick hand you saw previously, beckoning you to hide in the hole along with the same southern voice. Looking around you, you take the features of the small underground hole you stumbled inside, finding the area to be maybe a few of meters deep within the layer of dirt. It was small, but long for space. Torches light the side walls, pouring smoke out from small hole-vents made specifically to traffic the smoke out. You must have stumbled into her home, or actually...now <i>their</i> home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA male Golem steps out from behind her, curious at the new visitors in his small tunneled home with disgruntled frown. You scratch the back of your head. \"We apologize for the intrusion, we just didn't want to end up as some feral's meal out there. Your friend here helped us escape out there\" You try to convince him that you meant no harm, but he should understand, after all, the Sandshrew called you into her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's perfectly alright, hun! Don't pay no mind to my husband here. We have an infected large Aerodactyl that roams this canyon, eatin' poor travelers as they pass...\" She trails off, until saying...</span></div></div>",

Did you say, Aerodactyl...?!\" Asks Jackal as he sits back up on his rear, rubbing the back of his head from his landing. The Sandshrew nods her own head in response. In fact, you take the moment to just examine your two new acquaintances starting with the Sandshrew first. She was a bit of a chubby one, with thick arms, thighs, a short tail, and sports two large globular breasts which reveal the greyish brown nipples without any covering to hide themselves from, but in your world its unnecessary to anyway. Her belly was the most impressive feature to you somehow though. It booms out, hanging out in such prideful plushness and girth. Her underbelly parts appear so soft and comfortable to where they feel even better since you got a hint of a feel for a moment from your accidental entrance. You didn't know why, but you had no fascinations to bellies before this whole epidemic; maybe it was messing with your head enough or maybe there was something to it about the infection. You aren't sure and brush the thought away once the Sandshrew returns her chat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we've had that fella around this canyon for what...a few months, Morro?\" The desert rodent asks. Morro, being the Golem from what you've gathered, hesitates and finally answers while rubbing his jaw to contemplate, \"Yeah, I'd say about four months it's lived here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sandshrew continues, \"That infected grey lizard has been using this canyon for its hunting grounds. Everyday it comes by, sweeping one of our kind up and carrying the poor fella's off to its nest! It just doesn't know when to quit! There's barely anyone left in our town anymore, if that's what ya wanna call it still. A tomb sounds more like it. Hmph.\" Her resistant tone really shown through to you from her frustration with this thing. And you thought it took a horde of infected to ruin a whole town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorro steps up to wrap an arm around the Sandshrew, \"My wife and I only travel outside for a matter of minutes everyday, because we live in fear of that...<i>giant</i>! It's like it's always out there, patiently waiting for us everyday to join the fate of our neighbors.\" Yikes, you thought how it must have been hard to search for food in such conditions, especially when living in a canyon, but a monster who's whole purpose is to eat you is right at your front door everyday, something like that seems like it could really screw you over. You're surprised that this couple didn't bother eating you in the first place for food. It was still urgent to get to the Toxicroak in the swamp, but you aren't going to make any form of distance with that Aerodactyl there. You needed to take care of it first before moving on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sandshrew crosses her arms, retorting, \"We used to have a wonderful town in this small divide of cliffs. Little did we know that a ginormous dragon would destroy everything and run everyone outta of town with their lives or end up in that...mouth of its...Hun, anyone who hasn't run away from this patch of canyons and has managed not to get caught by that monster live underground or in the rock walls in complete fear. This is no longer living! We're just desperately surviving and herded like livestock for it!\" Her voice flares out in anger from her statement. You happily interrupt her rant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll stop it.\" You say. The Sandshrew and Golem then look at you with wide eyes, taken back from the sudden suggestion. Even Jackal is very surprised. \"If you can show me where this Aerodactyl rests, I'll try to stop it if I can.\"</span></div></div>",

Although, she quickly sighs and sulks as she turns to face you. \"<i>But</i>, he is right when it comes to you getting eaten...or worse...\" She shivers with disgust as the images of how the Aerodactyl could 'play' with you for its pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe holds up a hand, raising it to you, \"I'm Darcy. It's a pleasure to see a freindly face in these parts again, even if they have a death wish.\" You shake Darcy's hand, returning the favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Lace, and this is my partner Jack.\" You point to the Typhlosion, getting an angry huff in response. \"We're traveling the land, searching for a way to stop the infection.

You're not the first one to come through here, sayin' the same thing.\" She says as she shrugs her shoulders in disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis worriedly bewildered Jackal. \"You mean...there were others before us...?\" You could hear a loud bellowing gulp of fear travel down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Darcy answers, \"Did you think no one knows about the sickness? Plenty of people are trying to stop it!

Did you have any bit of fear? Absolutely. When you were attacked by the Fearow, you just got lucky as it hit a rock wall.

It's a shame that this place is so highly dangerous. You had traveled out of Darcy's home, and through the tunnels inside the canyon walls to avoid going outside. Darcy was kind enough, and <i>brave</i> enough, to accompany you on your way to the Aerodactyl's nest to show you where this monster resided most of the time, but wouldn't do any of the fighting. Morro had stayed behind, cowardly not wanting to risk his life and mentioned, \"Well someone has to watch over our home!\" Although he was kind of enough to threaten both you and Jackal to bring his wife back safe and sound, or the Aerodactyl would be the least of their problems. Jackal, however, found the confidence to follow and help you, even he tries to act tough along the trip, even with his legs obviously shivering in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exit the cavern, arriving at the top of a flat and open plateau. There was nothing on the flat surface, except a cluster of rocks, shielding sunlight over a large straw nest. The nest was occupied by a large grey beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all immediately tense up at the site of the dragon, but you luckily hear loud snoring with no purple eyes gleaming out. It was asleep for now, perhaps digesting away whatever prey it recently may have caught. Darcy holds your arm before you take a step forward towards the infected feral. She whispers, \"Well, there ain't any turning back now. However you're gonna stop this thing, I suggest you do it fast, and quietly! I'm stayin' here in the tunnel where its safe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, and wave your arm forward to gesture Jackal to follow you. You silently creep to the loud breathing Aerodactyl, feeling its exhaling breath to exhaust at you. It was warm, and gust blowing even, sending sand from the ground to wave out in small ripples from the force in your direction. Deciding to hit it at the back of its head, you had hopes that it would knock it unconscious so you could have more time to think of a way to kill it. The creature was massive stature, perhaps three time your height. You could only wonder how many meals this thing has eaten to achieve such a size like this, but seeing all of the empty homes along the canyon, you had a small guess of how many that could be. That fact only terrifies you more, making you question if two Pokemon could truly stop this thing if a whole town couldn't defend itself from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the shadowed nest itself, you watch as the dragon lays against its chest, slightly curled up in its comfortable snooze to happily enjoy. Its neck bulges out and shrinks back with each heavy breath, occasionally snorting that forces you to almost jump if it had awakened. It even moves a winged arm over to scratch at its large and scaly belly as it gurgles out, making the dragon even drool some with a faint, fanged smile. You could only imagine that it was thinking about food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust so very close to have an arm's reach to hit the back of its horned skulled, you need to just a take a step closer for a good shot. You press a hindpaw down, stepping against some of the straw of the nest to break it right under you. <i>SNAP!</i> Your heart implodes within your chest as you glance over to see the Aerodactyl...</span></div></div>",

You release a silent sigh of relief from dodging a bullet there and charge your paw with aura as you watch your steps this time. Focusing your powerful energy, you wish yourself luck and throw your fist down, jabbing the Aerodactyl directly in the back of its head that sends a small blue shockwave of blue flames to scorch out from the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a severe thumping noise from the hit as it's easily deafened out by the blood piercing screams of the Aerodactyl. The large lizard howls in miserable shock and agony, flailing its limbs in its nest aimlessly and unable to comprehend what was happening at the time. A massive, flexible wing collides into you to knock you back out of the den and onto your back outside atop the plateau. Your mind rocks back and forth inside of its skull when the back of your head meets the hot and rough ground to smack down on for your own pulsating pain to mirror the infected dragon's dilemma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly begin to recover from your dizziness to watch the behemoth of a dragon stumbling out if its cave, holding its hands that were connected to edges of its wings at the backside of its head that left a smolder smudge mark smoking out some along with more than just a headache pulsating for the feral. It groans furiously and heavily steps outward while fumbling and teetering some with its glowing, violet eyes struggling to aim straight to focus. You were unable to knock the infected out, but you clearly managed to stun it for awhile which was much more acceptable had it just awoken and chomped you up.

Loose sand float away in small waves as you watch the Aerodactyl begin to flap its wings with dizzy flails, and the beast was beginning to rise up. The massive dragon still somehow had enough focus to take flight in the air, gaining some distance from the ground a few meters up in hopes it could escape whatever had attacked it. You aren't going to let it get away that easy though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dragon aviates above you to fly off into the canyon, you pay special attention to the tail that it's dragging limply below it. Catching the long tendril in a dive, you are suddenly carried off with the Aerodactyl to soar through the air a you keep a firm grip on its tail. You gulp and regretfully look down to the floor, watching how far below the ground was beneath you now as the infected dragon scutters its wings in wild desperation, making you second-guess if this was the right plan or not. Jackal calls out to you as you see him get smaller and smaller in the distance, disappearing from concealing cliff-sides during your trip on the dragon's wavering tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving to embrace your fear, you climb along the tail slowly as best you can with it swishing back and forth during mid-flight for an uneasy trip to ascend up on. The Aerodactyl, although still stunned, notices your mounting and roars with great anger. It tilts to its side, slamming its backside into a canyon rock wall in an effort to crush you. You are able to dodge it just in time by sliding to the side of the Aerodactyl as its back grinds powerfully against the cliff, sending dirt, rubble, and dust clouds trailing violently behind it before releasing off. You continue your ascent, climbing up the long back and neck of the dragon as it continues to struggle, unable to do much with you out of its reach. It instantly flips upside down, almost making you slip and fall off to your death, but your hands luckily grab the horns on its head to dangle your body above the terrifying height. The Aerodactyl flips again, sending you to rise up in the air from losing your grip on its horns. The Aerodactyl thinks it has won now as you begin to stop rising in the air above the Aerodactyl and start plummeting towards it! Although, you charge your paw with a blazing blue fire, sending a deep aura punch towards its skull before you land back on it!</span></div></div>",

You do your best to hold onto to a shoulder of the screaming beast as it comes into contact of the flooring of the canyon, exploding dirt in all directions once finally hitting the earth and grind into the dirt floor like a massive cannon shot. You quickly jump off of the dragon, hitting the ground and rolling from the sheer force of the Aerodactyl's falling speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt crashes into a steep rock wall in a loud crunching noise, while you stop from rolling and attempt to shake your dizziness away, your blurry vision fades away enough for you to focus back to the large infected creature. It laid face planted in a wall, with cuts and scrapes along its body, growling muffledly in rage. It weakly and bewitchingly raises its head, craning its neck to stare at you, gazing an evil purple stare. You stagger backwards to get ready for a real fight with all of the excitement from putting a beating on the Aerodactyl draining out of your body from that gaze. That menacing violet glow proves to you just how dearly the dragon wanted to <i>kill</i> you. Taking a few more steps back, you trip over a rock and land on your large blue rear, gasping in surprise and making feverish crawling pushes back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a rumble in the wall groans, as large boulders begin to fall from the Aerodactyl's impact. They tumble out of the rock wall and plunge downward above the dragon, silencing it yells for its last time once the colossal rocks fall onto the Aerodactyl, letting out another crunching noise. You wince again as the dust clears, seeing a grey tail thrash violently from under the boulders until finally dying out in energy and falling to the floor. It remained still after that. It was over. You have actually defeated the giant Aerodactyl single-handedly! (Jackal would've probably done something if the dragon hadn't flew away with you on it. Probably.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan and fall all the way onto your backside, panting out from all of that terrifying work and luck as you stare up into the blue sky. You watch the white clouds surf silently and slowly through the air as the canyon breeze occasionally whisks by. The quiet moment you rewarded yourself was surely worth all of the effort you put in to help making this canyon a bit of a safer place. But you would need to get back to Jackal and Darcy to truly celebrate the day's victory, and besides, as eager as you were to just sit down and rest, you had a mission to complete. Sitting back up and trying to wet your dry mouth, you force yourself to a struggling stand with a groaning exhale. You feel your wounds pulsate repeatedly with part of your head aching, including a small bloodstain sporting on the of fur on it, and as for your leg, you have collected a few bruises on it. Well, at the very least it was nothing seriously vital and you could live to see another day!</span></div></div>",

You had returned to Darcy and Morro\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tunneled home with the chubby Sandshrew woman overwhelmed with complete joy of your surviving return. Jackal is leaned against a torchlit wall, smirking a bit as you fail to pry the grateful Sandshrew off. Morro is sitting on a rock-like stool, feeling slightly grumpy of how much his mate enjoyed your company, but is also content about the death of the Aerodactyl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo wet lips invade your mouth, pressing firmly against the tip of your muzzle with a determined, \"Mmmmmmwahhhh!\" Your body aches just from hit you took with the ground after you jumped off the Aerodactyl, but Darcy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s constricting grip was truly even worse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth releases its hold from yours before she cheers with a smile. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYa stupid dog! I can't believe ya actually did it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She applauds by giving you another painful tight squeeze. Jackal was kind enough to tap the excited Sandshrew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulders, signaling her that she should probably stop killing you. She looks to see you face jammed between her pillowy breasts, blocking off all of you air. \u00e2\u0080\u009cO-Oh, sorry hun, I just couldn't help myself! Heehee!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Her thick arms finally release you from the malevolent grasp, endowing you breath once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c<i>Kahhkk</i>, <i>ackk</i>...!

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a shame we can't have you stay any longer! This canyon could'a had a person like you around to keep off any unwanted infected, and you would'a be seen as like an icon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It was clear he was grateful, but he also wanted you to leave since his mate seemed more interested in you than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorro is actually right though, because you need to get to the swamp still. Every minute of time could've been precious in this case, and it was probably required of you to continue. You are, at the very least, making progress on the infection from your point of view, and this Toxicroak had the potential of helping you even more. Darcy sits down on a stool, patting at her legs happily. \"Ain't this excitin' though?! We don't have to live in this dump anymore! Morro honey, we can actually go back outside, to our old home and village, and look for other survivors. Finding food and water is easier than ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorro sits by his wife, wrapping an arm around at her backside to cup on her shoulder. \"I know dear, but don't get too excited. That Aerodactyl wasn't the only feral out there. We still have to deal with any other evil critters out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly pecks a kiss to his cheek, patting his rocky chest. \"I ain't worried ya big oaf. I have ya to protect me.\" The two smile at each other before Morro explains to you, \"I can't tell you how much my wife and I appreciate you saving us and this canyon. We promise we won't let you down, or let anything like that dragon dominate this land ever again. We'll try to find the others from our village and re-establish it. Your efforts won't go in vain, Lace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal suddenly raises a brow, \"H-Hey! I helped too...kinda sorta.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcy chuckles, \"Don't worry, we'll let everyone know about Lace and Jack, the 'dragonslayers', heeheehee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal scowls, but doesn't bother to correct them this time. He just glances to you to blame for the incorrect name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Darcy kindly gave her crushing goodbye hug to you, both you and Jackal left through the canyon path with your bags in hand, out to reach the swamp. It was a bit of a setback, yet you're glad you got to help out someone in need and make a difference. It was the entire purpose of your mission. The two of you travel with no infected-encounters and exit the canyon walls to approach a cliffside-craggy turf, overlooking the rest of far-off terrain to see that you're much closer to the swamp now. The bog is in sight, but has a certain residing between you and it. It looks like it'd be your next stopping point, so you head out in hopes you can get to your true destination before nightfall.</span></div></div>",

He sat his personal belongings next to him before he lied on his backside, yawning out tiredly with arms crossed behind his head. He murrs out to you, \"Take as much time as you need to pooch. I'm in no rush.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but <i>I'm</i> in a bit of a rush.

But you can't go anywhere if your leg gets worse. You are your priority, right? Don't worry. If that fucker is crazy enough to live in a feral-infested swamp, then he can probably take care of himself.\" Jackal sits up a bit with a worried look, \"...H-Hey, how is your leg, by the way? Do you need my help or...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine.\" You reply to him without even turning to look at him. You inspect your leg, and although it wasn't too bad, it might still get infected. Not with becoming a feral, but an actual disease like any other wound could get. \"I just need to wash it some. Just go back to relaxing. I'll be up and ready to go soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal shrugs and closes his eyes, lying back flat down with a hand on his gut. You stare at the cold lake water and prepare yourself for however this might sting. Nudging up to the coast of the lake, you splash a bit of water on your wound, cleaning your black leg fur and cooling it off whilst making it wince in some pain. You grit your teeth and just endure, feeling a bit better after your leg is given a thorough wash, and after you cup some water in your hands to drink. After the washing, you stared out at the pond, enjoying its odd beauty. Something was more odd though. There are strange ripples in the water seeming to ring out in the liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal peeks and eye open and looks up at you, noticing your tension.

Before you could warn Jackal of it, a glowing crimson beam of light flashes out from the water to narrowly miss the Typhlosion and hits the sandy ground next to him. However, the explosion sends the Typhlosion to fly back, hurtling into the ground with a small burst of dirt to fly out. You look inside the murky waters to witness a light blue Golduck hop out from the water, spreading droplets across the pond from his sudden leap while spreading an open sinister smile along his flat beak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe splashes back into the shallow part of the water enough to stand just a few meters out from where you were standing, bringing him to at least knee deep water. Swinging an arm to point a clawed and webbed finger at his target, the blue duck exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWow, I can't actually believe I just missed that!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The duck begins to count on his fingers. \"Even with the element of surprise, a powerful and direct attack, the fact that I was hidden, and the fact I had time to charge and aim, I still met the unfortunate end of missing. Damn, I'm embarrassed.\" He was apparently cursing himself; yet, his cocky smile never left his beak. The red stone engraved in his forehead begins to dim in color, cooling off after it had been recently fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou growl out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat was that for? We're not infected! You nearly killed him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d You flash your fangs out as you tense your arms, expecting a fight.

You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re even grouchier than an infected Granbull, dog. I tell you what, just coming to a lake and not expecting any other ferals or dangers is pretty stupid if ya ask me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Golduck chuckled out. His arrogant attitude was about to tip you over your stress level as the smug duck continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAw man, are the both of you dudes? Damn, that really blows. I never get any hot chicks to trespass this pond. Not even girls in general. I'm so horny, I'd bang an ugly or feral gal just to get some pussy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He called out in a disappointed tone, although he shrugs afterwards. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut still, a meal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a meal!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the tip over. He ate \u00e2\u0080\u0098trespassers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 on the lake for his own satisfaction, whether they were infected or not. You were going to take this bird down. Looking over, Jackal was too busy coughing out in agony from the burns he just sustained, and your leg would be a bit of a pesky problem to deal with, but...what other choices were there then besides fighting? There's no way you're going to bargain peace with this malicious runt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Golduck suddenly blasts forward in the water, jetting across the aquatic surface in high speeds as vapor splashes violently behind him. You aren't ready to risk your injured leg yet, so dodging was out of the question. You power energy together, combining aura energy into a burning blue globe of vigor. Before the Golduck could reach his clawed grasp around you, you launch the bright sphere and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6!</span></div></div>",

It suddenly shoots a spark, only making about a centimeters distance before disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Golduck stared out blankly, leaving a strange awkward silence between all of you. \u201cWhat happened to my jewel!!!\u201d He exclaimed, holding his head as fake tears rolled out of his eyes. \u201cWhat kind of witchery is this? What have you done? I\u2019ll be a mockery, a joke to all Golducks!\u201d He screamed while overreacting. He thrashed his head while running in small circles. It seems the stone you kicked at him hit the red stone, breaking it by accident. His words began to come out of his mouth rapidly, \u201c<i>Why did it have to be me, of all Golducks to be burdened with the shame of a broken jewel? Oh the embarrassment I\u2019ll have to sustain over the long years of my life with such knowledge! It all started when I was just hungry! But wait. Maybe it\u2019ll grow back!

You\u2019ll rue this day, <i>Face</i>, or whatever your name was!\u201d He continued his rant, beating the back of his head against the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down. We just want to know about the swamp up ahead. We\u2019re searching for any clues on how to stop the current infection going around, and we heard there\u2019s a Toxicroak that could help which lives there. Can you verify that?\u201d You tried to kindly ask through your impatience. The Golduck stopped his constant struggles and grumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I know a Toxicroak that lives there. He\u2019s someone I met a few months ago; A complete weirdo. He\u2019s a damn homosexual that tried flirting with me while I was minding my own business, doing my business!\u201d Jackal almost laughed out loud but kept his struggling chuckles by placing a hand over his mouth. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard from him since, but I plan on keeping it that way! Has this world gone mad?! Do females not exist anymore?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for the information, Gold. We\u2019ll be off now.\u201d You got up while taking your bag, passing a Lum berry to Jackal for his wounds as you began to walk away. Gold yelped out in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey. Wait! You can\u2019t just leave me tied to this tree!\u201d He begged to you, watching disappear into the tree patch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure we can.\u201d Jackal yelled over with a smile as the two of walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bastards! What if an infected comes by looking for something to eat? What if a woman comes by and I can\u2019t even appeal to her? You\u2019ll regret that you ever crossed Gold the Golduck, <i>Taste</i>!

It was getting late in the day, and it added an ominous tone to the already dark forested marshland. You could listen to the strange constant noises of the swamp, echoing around the entire biome that just plainly creeped you out. Jackal nudged you with his arm while walking forward, \u201cLet\u2019s not keep that Toxicroak waiting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe both of you entered the marshy bog, as you held the strand for your bag tightly as you could hear movements in the swamp. It always felt like you were being watched as you and the Typhlosion treaded through murky waters, walked over muddy lands, and ventured through moss and misty vegetation. Yet, no purple glimmers could be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Charizard chief from Redeemer\u2019s Grotto had told you that he probably lived in the center of the swamp, which wasn\u2019t much of help, but at least it gave you somewhere to look. Problem was, you didn\u2019t know how large the swamp was! The marshland never seemed to end as you continued to plow through the dense slough. Suddenly, something did give you an alert reaction. You heard a branch break somewhere far off. You stopped, perking your ears up and attempted to locate the source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal turned around, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me. Your sensitive big ears picked something up.\u201d He dropped his bag while placing both of his hands to his sides. Suddenly, two arms wrapped around his, pinning his arms by his shoulders. He gasped and quickly panicked in whatever was attacking him. \u201cJackal!\u201d You call to the Typhlosion, ready to help him in his aid. A female Leafeon was right behind him, holding his arms up high as she flickered a tongue, brushing against his face. Her purple lavender eyes pierced through one\u2019s sight like a spear, as her body could do the same with her impressive bust size and tempting waistline. She certainly sported a heavenly hourglass figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeautiful looks or not, she had to be stopped. You pounced out to Jackal, going to free him in her somehow powerful grasp until you felt strange hard limbs surround you. The sturdy shelled limbs held you pressed against something on your back, and you heard loud buzzing from behind. Looking up, you were caught in the clutches of a Yanmega\u2019s legs! You growled with rage, not accepting that you came this far just to be eaten by a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggled inside the grasp of the giant dragonfly, as its head above your own begins to drool, dripping long slimy strands against your face. Seeing that the Leafeon pushed Jackal face first to the ground, she lowered her crotch above him, ready to unbirth her prey! In retaliation, you bite down on one of the Yanmega\u2019s legs that pin you to its underside, hoping that it might be able to do something.</span></div></div>",

The massive dragonfly whirled in frantic circles and loops, pivoting to the wound in an upper leg. You collapse to your knees to welcome air back into your weary lungs. The infected Yanmega quickly disappeared into the shadowed depths of the swamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrucial for you to recover, you briskly hop back up to begin running to Jackal who was in definite need of your rescue. His head was jammed between the vaginal lips of the Leafeon, squeezing his shoulders up with his body to clobber around under the grass type for freedom. Your paws beat against the slick marsh floor, splashing in bursts of mud droplets audibly. But there were other footsteps you heard, except softer and much slower than your own. Your vision is tilted to your side to see an anthro purple/orange frog, emerging out of the marshland waters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCroaks rumbling out from the orange throat sac that hung down from his chin echoed into your canine ears.

Although, they widened with interest after seeing you and a half way unbirthed Typhlosion out in the open marshes. Looking around the wet floor, it simply picked up a handful of slick dirt, tossed it into the air before catching it again and blasting it forward in an excellent swift pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sludge bomb collided into the Leafeon's face, knocking her back to stagger at the ground until inevitably tumbling downward. Hitting the mud rump first, Jackal easily took the opportunity to squeeze his head back out her with a loud <b>POP</b>! A clear strand of pre leakage from her sex organ stretched across as the Typhlosion growled with rage. No longer would Jackal be humiliated by the infected Leafeon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped dead in your tracks because you <i>had</i> to watch his revenge unfold. The girl wiped off all the dirt from her face, only to look up at the open maw of Jackal's mouth. You unrelented interest peaked during the spectacle of the anthro Eevee-morph submerging into the fire type's throat, taking note of the wild thrashing her legs gave off seemed like an awkward dance movement. The shaking brown foot paws vanished in Jackal's jaws, bulging from his neck to the pit of his belly which he so happily rubbed after a satisfied belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands clapped slowly in the performance out of the background, taking your attention back to the Toxicroak. This time, you could pay more attention to the detail of its stature. Judging from his build, and bandaged crotch area, he was a male Pokemon with a bit of a tall physique. The frog's hind legs balanced his tall body as the sound of his croaking emitted out the orange sac attached to his chin. He could probably stand just a few inches higher than you even compared to your mid-tall height, especially with the crest on his head. Orange claws shined out brightly, showcasing their sharpness with poison tips on the purple hands. The Toxicroak began chuckling while stopping his slow clapping motions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, oh my! I don't often get to have visitors visit this swamp. Heh, they usually end up inside a stomach before meeting me!\" The frog croaked out with amusement. Jackal tensed his eyes with a short grunt. He clearly didn't like the Toxicroak already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't happen to have any knowledge about the infection would you?\" You kindly asked the amphibian however, continuing your guard. No one could be trusted in your time, especially those who aren't infected but live secluded in isolation. Those anthros tend to be more vicious and hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak placed his hands together on each hip by his wrists before answering, \"Hm. Wasn't expecting that kind of a question. I'm guessing that you're not travelling through this swamp for just simple sight seeing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal irritatingly flashed his fangs out to intimidate the frog, losing patience from every word the Toxicroak spoke. \"No, we clearly aren't, so <i>answer the question</i>.\" He snarled through his teeth. You glared a quick look at him, signalling him to calm down and avoid a fight. Although, when you looked back at the Toxicroak, he was suddenly standing directly in front of you while staring down at your legs! You wondered how he got close to you so fast and so silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frog bent down, investigating your hind limbs. \"Might I ask what happened to your poor leg? It's been scraped at the sides and bruises near the bones.\" He pressed a thumb against his tongue, wetting it, and rubbed the slick finger over a small wound under your fur as he held your leg in place firmly with his other hand. He slid the thin layer of saliva to wipe of a small stain of dried blood off your coat oddly enough. You felt a bit of awkwardness during the predicament, so you looked to Jackal who raised a brow at the Toxicroak's odd sense of care. He seemed to not want to attack you, therefore he must be friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak stood back up, displaying a cheerful smile, continuing, \"Judging from your injury,\" He looked over to Jackal's struggling belly, \"...and your <i>newly acquainted girlfriend</i>, we can talk safely in the comfort of my tent. It's secluded and definitely not too far off from here. I would love and appreciate your company....um...your names?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm called Lace, and this is my friend, Jackal.\" You raised a hand to shake, but the Toxicroak suddenly wrapped his arms around your back, embracing a violent loving hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! So you're the Lucario I've heard so much about! Please, please, I must take you to my humble abode!\" The Toxicroak encouraged until finally releasing you.</span></div></div>",

Who knows what kind of trick this pokemon could\u2019ve been up to? You didn't know him yet he seemed to recognize you as 'the Lucario' from somewhere. Although, he had plenty of opportunities to harm you or even\u2026<i>eat you</i>, but you assumed that it was best to just keep a safe distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Jackal steadily walked behind the Toxicroak as he earlier mentioned that he wanted to talk in his tent about the present infection. Jackal\u2019s belly bounced with each step that he made from the infected Leafeon girl. Dead leaves would crumble under the stuffed fire type with every step that the sound would never endingly stop cackling around in your large canine ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak looked back with a sly sarcastic expression. \u201cYou can walk faster and closer you know. I don\u2019t <i>bite</i>.\u201d The strange charismatic smile shined brightly, but his eyes seemed devious when he mentioned bite. He chuckled like a child softly to himself after the joke and continued staring forward in the direction all of you were headed in. It wasn't long until you came into a small clearing of the swamp, with a highlighted large tent radiating out an orange glow in its center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak motioned you to come with his waving hand as he entered his home, disappearing behind the cloth entrance door. Jackal gave you a doubtful agitated glare, as if to say, <i>\"You go in first.\"</i> A sigh withdrew from your lungs and you braced yourself when entering the Toxicroak's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Lace, have a seat. I can't wait to talk to you about your little 'research adventure' I've been hearing about.\" The frog said calmly. He was sitting down on his crisscrossed legs above a plushy cushion. There were a few more cushions scattered around the tent room with a blazing small campfire in the middle in which the seats had circled around. You took the farthest seat from across the fire, as Jackal finally walked into the tent upon resting a much larger cushion, displaying his gut to hang outward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak cleared his throat, pressing his hand to his chest. \u201cMy name is Hex. I live here with my sister Lilly to survive from the outside infected terrors. You\u2019re probably wondering how I came to know you.\u201d He raised a brow eagerly as he leaned forward, pointing his gaze directly to you. You nodded without saying a word. Hex seemed to be excited to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA messenger from Redeemer\u2019s Grotto told me that you were coming immediately after you had left. He said that you had begun a \u2018search for a cure\u2019 on the infection and that you were travelling across this massive island just to find it. I even heard about the small battle in that village you got mixed into, plus, that you even took down a large Fearow, if I\u2019m correct.\u201d He answered while taking a stick and readjusting the logs in the fire to burn brighter. His focus was finally off of you and back to the campfire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did someone beat us here if they left after us? We never saw anyone from Redeemer\u2019s Grotto on the trip here.\u201d You asked worriedly. Hex chuckled again in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrotto runners are meant to be faster than normal pokemon. The village chief appoints the fastest pokemon for the positions, and the one that came here was a Hitmonlee runner. <i>Cute fellow\u2026</i>\u201d Hex took his attention away after a glimmering gaze in the air. He snapped back into reality awkwardly, sighing, \u201cAnyways, back on track, he told me that you were requesting on my take on the infection.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were excited to hear some actual news about, and the Toxicroak seemed to look like he knew what he was talking about. \u201cWhat do you know about it?\u201d You tried your best not to yell it out happily.</span></div></div>",

You don\u2019t know anything?\u201d The Typhlosion flared the fire at the back of his neck, gritting his sharp teeth together. Hex only lifted a hand to stop him from talking. \u201cIt\u2019s very rude to interrupt. I never said that I was finished.\u201d Jackal grumbled as he sat back down on his cushion, angry as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInfections and diseases usually have symptoms such as specific sicknesses like, coughing, weakness, corrupt blood flow, wounds, rashes, blindness, and even problems with internal body parts, not making them go wild and madly hungry. However, this strange disease around only changes one physical trait in pokemon\u2019s bodies\u2026\u201d He pointed two fingers at his face. \u201cTheir eyes\u2026So this little factor really confused me on what I was dealing with, but then I took my theory to the next level I had interesting results. What if the infection doesn\u2019t affect our bodies, but our minds?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak leaned in closer to you, speaking a bit softer and more serious. \u201cWhat we\u2019re dealing with here, Lace, is a psychological type of epidemic.\u201d Jackal flashed a curious look from the unusual theory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd\u2026by psychological epidemic, you\u2019re saying that this infection is being caused by\u2026\u201d He trailed off, but you immediately finished his sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>A psychic pokemon.</i>\u201d You answered. Hex slowly nodded, revealing the true intentions of the infection. \u201cBut why? Why would someone try to control pokemon to kill others in such an\u2026uncommon strange way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure about that either, but I can tell you that I have a deep interest in finding out.\u201d The Toxicroak replied. He took the stick to move the burning logs and placed into a pot as he rose up, collecting a bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were unsure on how to take the situation. This entire catastrophe was all based on a single psychic pokemon, or possibly more. You suddenly felt a familiar nudge. Hex had dipped his thumb into his tongue again, and began to rub around the wound on your leg softly once more. You cringed a bit at the quick sting. \u201cCan I ask, er, what you\u2019re doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour leg is damaged and you\u2019re not going anywhere until I can at least fix it.\u201d The Toxicroak pleaded smoothly. He opened the bag he had picked up and held out a roll of bandages. He wrapped the end of all across your bruised area, stretching it tightly to your hind limb before biting the other end to cut it off. \u201cI need to go get some berries for your leg, but before I go\u2026\u201d He randomly stood up and opened another cloth door, beckoning for you to come inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding back up, but feeling a sharp tug at your leg, you walked over into the other room to see a Croagunk girl, who could\u2019ve been about a little more than half your size was laying down on her side, breathing slowly and softly. The room was kept dark, and empty plates surrounded her. She was lying against a bed of pillows, resting under a brown blanket cloth. You felt Hex\u2019s hand press on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLilly, we have guests\u2026\u201d He spoke aloud, softly. The Croagunk girl slowly blinked an eye open, yawning soon afterwards and ending it with a wheeze of some sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d She asked a bit weakly. Hex stepped forward, leaning down in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLace, meet my younger sister, Lilly.\u201d He turned back to his sibling. \u201cThese are travelers who are creating a cure for the infection.\u201d Hex placed a hand on her head, rubbing it carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi\u2026\u201d She shyly replied before yawning again. She steadily fell back asleep. Her Toxicroak brother sighed before rising back up and returning by your side. He stared at her until breaking the silence. \u201cShe\u2019s going to become an infected soon. She had recently been attacked by one.\u201d He sadly whispered. This shocked you a bit, while your eyes stared awe-strucken at the Toxicroak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLace, do you know how people are infected by the ferals?\u201d Hex questioned, already knowing the answer. You shook your head, expecting it to be from bites or something. Hex looked away from you, looking down at his sister, Lilly. His voice was almost without sound that your ears had a difficult time to hear it, but the message was easily clear. He had said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re <i>raped</i>.\u201d</span></div></div>",

According to your stomach, you can handle that.\u201d The Toxicroak placed a hand on Jackal's soft yet large gut, giving it a good squeeze to force the Typhlosion to grunt. He pointed his vision towards Hex, giving him the, \"<i>Hands off.</i>\" glare. Hex chuckled as Jackal looked down at his belly, still digesting a Leafeon within the deep flab of fat.

Freezing to a tall sharp position, your ears flipped up with the hairs shivering from surprise. Blurry, your vision slowly faded back into clarity, absorbing your surroundings. You arose from a heap of cushions to find Lilly, collapsed on the floor in front of you! Her face was buried into pillows, but her back would recess and encase air, so at least she was breathing. Getting up fully, you kneel down to her, placing a paw on her shoulder. She felt warm, however, weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLilly? Are you alright\u00e2\u0080\u00a6?\u00e2\u0080\u009d You asked the Croagunk girl. A cough seemed to have been her response. Pushing against the side of the shoulder, you flip her to face right side up again only to have teeth sink into your arm. With a quick howl, you thrash your bitten arm, attempting to throw Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sister back off. Finally, her flat teeth gave away, releasing her jaws from your limb. You grip to the wound fiercely, looking directly at your mad opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes were blank and purple. She had become fully infected now! You watch in horror as a small drop of blood sink down from the edges of her teeth, and a long drooling tongue happily laps it off in a clean sweep. You would feel awful to hurt Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sibling, but what else could be done other than to fight? If you ran, you would probably end up as main course for some other infected feral anyways. Lilly pounced again, hopping toward you to achieve another bite!</span></div></div>",

You yelp again, falling on your back against the floor to begin twitching and fidgeting your leg. The Croagunk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s teeth forced themselves harder on the scratch, forcing more barks of pain to howl out. You were finally able to pull her mouth off, freeing your leg of her jaws. A stream of saliva was attached from Lilly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mouth to your leg which was quickly licked away by her long frog tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending your leg towards yourself, you gripped the bandage tightly, hugging out the pain striking your engraved teeth marks. Suddenly, when opening a tightly squinted eye, a wide rump hovers above you. Opening your mouth to protest, it is quickly pressed between her purple cheeks, giving you a mouthful of her crack! She squatted down, sitting on your open maw while rubbing her groin on your jaw. Her anus squeezed against your tongue, letting you taste the stale rim of the dark purple hole. Placing your hands at her sides, you push her away, gagging from the flavor of her rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she sits back down forcefully, encasing your entire head with her anus this time! Coughing, you flex your shoulders to stop proceeding inward any further, but the Croagunk demanded an anal meal, as she stomps a foot against your hurt leg, causing a loud whimpered howl to escape your lips. Your shoulders loosen from pain, and are quickly sucked inside, followed by your arms and chest. Your legs twitch, fearful of kicking too hard may cause them anymore pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infected Lilly was victorious; able to successfully trap your fate as her whole unwilling meal. Your furry face is squished at the constricting anal walls to seemingly taunt you as you squeeze into a hot demise. Your waist is sucked within the ever stretching butthole, absorbing the tail and eventually, your legs. Your head suddenly feels an opening release in front of you, giving you a hint of where you were now. Your foot paws cringed in fear, as the anus rim shrinks back over them, sealing your inevitable fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Lilly, no longer conscious of herself, tilts her rump upward, letting the foolish Lucario paws to twitch for the last time before entering her lower intestines. She flipped back into a pile of pillows, letting her purple amphibian belly to sag outward, bouncing some from the struggles of her curled up prey. Rubbing it with her hands, she was able to lull its endeavors to finally faint into weakness, achieving her well earned prize. Having a small problem with getting up from her smaller size, the infected Croagunk girl chuckled witchly, walking out of the tent and into the marshes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex returned later with Jackal, to come home to a strange mess in the tent.  For some reason, Lace was gone, and, so was Lilly.</i></span></div></div>",

You felt sudden force to fall back as a strange push pressed at your head. Crashing down, the Croagunk girl descends down with you, eventually to release your head by accident from the sudden fall. Together down, you growl ferociously, sending an arm covered in aura to strike her chest, blasting Lilly out at the tent wall, tearing a hole to the outside during her launch. The frog collapses against a bare marsh tree out of the tent, cracking somewhat from the force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the best of your ability, you hop back up onto your legs once more to stare back out through the open hole. Hex\u2019s infected sister sat right up, shaking and holding her head until finally snapping out of the daze. You grit your fangs together, hoping she would just stop attempting to devour you. Regaining her sense, the infected girl hissed through her teeth, quickly scattering away until hopping into a forest of bushes to disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, falling down onto a cushion now that it was all over. Wiping off the saliva from your head, you ponder on how you would explain to Hex that his sister suddenly turned and ran away. You rub your hands together on your face, agitated and tired, wondering what you should do\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex rubbed his face with his hands in single slow strides. His eyes focused against the empty tent room, with an empty bed resting in its center. His breath was silent and his face was a ghostly pale color, resembling cold stone. Jackal twiddled his fingers a bit, unsure of what to say. You had recently just given the harsh news to the Toxicroak about his sister\u2019s fate in the most reasonable way you saw possible. No one spoke. Only the fast heartbeat of Hex\u2019s chest could be heard, echoing within the desolate tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was never your fault Lace.\u201d Hex suddenly choked out. Your head propped up from staring at the floor the entire time. The Toxicroak had turned to you, expressing a sense of compassion from his shining gaze. \u201cI knew that it was only a matter of time until she\u2026turned, however it was my fault I let you in charge of her. I\u2019ve should\u2019ve been here when it happened, so, I suppose I\u2019m\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t apologize.\u201d You interrupted him, raising a paw up. \u201cNo one is at fault here except for whoever started this infected mess. Alright?\u201d Your voice was serious, stern, and sympathetic. Losing a relative in such an awful way must\u2019ve been absolutely tragic, thus, you didn\u2019t know what Hex could possibly be feeling right now. He could mask his thoughts and expressions so easily, so you wondered what response he could have. You soon got your answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex had smiled. He smirked a smile the spread wide enough to each of his cheeks to stretch. The orange sac under his jaw began to croak once more, symbolizing content comfort. \u201cYes. Yes of course. How foolish of me to ever think that!\u201d He looked away from you, closing the cloth opening to the room, ignoring it for the time being. He stuck his hands against his sides, standing with pride in front of both you and Jackal. \u201cComplaining and worthless apologies will get us nowhere in the fight against this apocalypse, and it will certainly not help us bring my sister back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex padded over to a chest, rummaging through it to obviously find something. You were glad he at least got his confidence back. Jackal stood up, raising his brow. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you know someone who might know about psychics better than we do?\u201d Your eyes unwillingly looked down at Jackal\u2019s gut area, noticing at how most of the Leafeon he had eaten earlier was digested away, leaving only a bit of chub left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex withdrew a paper rolled up in a scroll-like fashion, holding it up high for the both of you to see. \u201cYou have quite the memory. Yes I did mention someone, in fact, <i>two people</i>.\u201d Hex walked to a close by end table, spreading the scroll across its surface to reveal a map of the entire island region you lived. He pointed a single purple finger in a specific spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis splotch of tress here is the swamp of where we are. Now if we\u2019re dealing with a sadistic psychic pokemon, I now just the people who can help us find out who it might be and how he\u2019s doing it.\u201d The Toxicroak\u2019s finger slid along the paper, gliding over to a dense prairie area of the map. \u201cThere\u2019s a Drowzee and a Hypno there that know exactly what\u2019s what in psychic abilities that I met earlier, maybe a few weeks ago when I was exploring. Problem is, they tend to be a bit isolated and a little tricky to find, but I\u2019m positive that we\u2019ll stumble upon them soon enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paid a bit more attention to the spot of where Hex was pointing, and discovered a certain obstacle. \u201cWait a minute. To get to the prairie, we would have to go back the way we came across the lake.\u201d You mentioned to Jackal. He gave a look that was confused on why that was a problem. \u201cThat means we have to go back to Golduck again, and I\u2019m pretty sure he hasn\u2019t forgiven us at our last encounter.\u201d You added to your statement. Jackal grunted angrily in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can easily take care of that duck, just like the last time. If he\u2019s smart, he would ignore us as we pass right back.\u201d The Typhlosion sneered back. Hex suddenly clapped his hands together excitingly at your conversation, bringing him to a full upward stance with light happily gleaming from his eyes. \u201cYou mean that cute little Golduck by the lake that pitches fits all of the time? I remember him quite well when I first moved to the swamp, and he had a pretty nasty bite with his aggravated words.\u201d The Toxicroak\u2019s voice sang out in joyful tune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered Gold\u2019s words when giving up information about Hex. He mentioned how weird the frog could be, especially as a homosexual that flirted with Gold. You shivered a bit, wondering if Hex would try to flirt with you. The Toxicroak did in fact enjoy your company and also didn\u2019t seem to mind rubbing your leg when bandaging it, even would occasionally lick his thumb to rub around your fur. But, he was just cleaning your fur from the blood\u2026right? Well, it\u2019s not like you had a problem with being flattered by it, however, you just hoped Hex wouldn\u2019t pull some trick on you into having\u2026eh\u2026<i>intercourse</i> with him\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou violently shook the thought out of your head, finishing off your topic, \u201cWell, since it\u2019s morning, I think it would be better for us to leave now to cover the most ground. Traveling at night is dangerous for non-infected anthros. Jackal nodded his head to agree with you, but Hex simply sat down into a cushion. This out you in a little unease since Hex was the only to know where the Drowzee was. \u201cIs something wrong, Hex?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex sighed a bit, looking at the tent door to Lilly\u2019s room. \u201cOh, I think I\u2019ll stay here for a short time and do some things before I go\u2026\u201d His tone of sadness returned. Your ears lowered some, pitying his loss. In reply, you answered, \u201cI understand. Take as long as you need, just remember to catch up with us later, alright?\u201d He looked at you, slowly growing a grin again with his eyes glowing their golden shade again. \u201cI certainly will, Lace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex returned to a stand, lifting the map to you. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need this unless you want to get lost. I\u2019m trusting that you\u2019ll be able to keep it safe since it\u2019s my only one and irreplaceable.\u201d You kindly accepted the gift, placing it into your bag for safe keeping. Before you could look back up, you were forcefully embraced in a strong hug by Hex, feeling his chin placed on top of your forehead since your view was obscured by the range bubble on his neck. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t leave with you now but I\u2019ll be sure to find you once again, so we can find a cure for Lilly together!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal snickered at your awkward hug as Hex finally released you, until he placed his hands on both of your facial cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019re a brave and stupid dog, you know that? I\u2019m sure you can make a difference in this hell-hole of a world we live in; just try your best not to get <i>om-nomed-nomed</i> by those beasties, promise?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled back, \u201cI promise.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Meeting Hex was actually a great use of help since you finally discovered how the virus spreads, even in an awful dreaded way, and who might be responsible for it. Not only that, but your bandage was removed from your leg, thanks to the hunt for supplies that Jackal and Hex did while you were being attacked by his infected sister, so the trip was definitely worth going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal walked out of the entrance of marshlands and back into a normal climate forest with you close behind. You wondered how much of a threat Gold would be when you finally reached back to the lake, needing to cross it. The vines you tied him with were purposely knotted weakly, and he could easily use his claws and talons to cut them off. He was left there to learn a lesson, you and Jackal hoped he took it to consideration.

A Mightyena stood before him, having the perfect female physique one could acquire with her large furred breasts, lean form, and wide hips that swayed to the sides while approaching the blushed anthro. Looking a bit closer, you saw the Golduck staring at her with aroused eyes of pleasure as his cock easily and rapidly erected out from the sight of the naked woman walking closer to him with a pre-cum leaking vagina!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust behind her was an anthro Charmeleon, and it was a male since it had the typical masculine body and firm balls hanging under it, but there was also a Feraligatr, having more the impressive build of pack muscle, fierce claws and talons, and not to mention its sagging large belly. So in total, there were four anthro beings waiting at the lake coast, seemingly to gang up around Gold as he remained dumb-founded by the dog's beauty in front of him. All of them had their backs or sides turned to you, unaware of your presence until the twig under Jackals paw broke. All of their heads<i> flashed their glowing purple eyes</i> from the alarming sound, directly staring at you. Gold however wasn\u2019t infected, still having bright blue eyes that stared deeply at the Mightyena\u2019s figure and still continuing to not notice you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female Mightyena looked away from the both of you, walking even closer to her horny duck victim, swishing her tail seductively back and forth. The two male anthros, however, began to walk towards you, interested in meals that were just for them now.

With a large blue explosion, the Feraligatr is sent out of the smoke cloud, barreling away while being covered in soot into the lake. After the massive splash, you squint your eyes to see the Feraligatr\u2019s head and belly to float to the surface with spiraling eyes before it fainted.

Jackal seemed to look sick, not enjoying on how he captured his target. His belly grew to a swollen sphere, doming out in extraordinary flab. Heck, even Gold was doing well. His beak had two large black foot paws sticking out, wiggling and thriving in discontentment. His blue soft stomach grew unnaturally, expanding his belly outward to uncomfortable proportions; however, the horny duck didn\u2019t seem to mind. He was still lying down on his rump, wagging his tail happily before he belched out the female dog\u2019s air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped over to Gold with Jackal, crossing your arms before he finally opened his eyes to see you. \u201cAw crap, not you idiots again.

After a lick of his lips, he gave out a cocky smile from his beak, \u201cThere were other ferals, huh? I guess I scared them off after they saw how I handled this lady\u2026\u201d A vein pulsated at your head. <i>Strike one</i>. But Gold continued, \u201c\u2026And of course, since I finally got to have someone actually female to come here, \u201c He clasped his hands together lovingly, pressing the side of his head on them, \u201cI got to even have some fun with her before I sealed the deal.\u201d An erection glimmered out, dripping a few drops of semen. <i>Strike two</i>. Yet, Gold continued bragging out as the flames on Jackal\u2019s neck ignited brightly. \u201cSo when you met that homo frog for whatever reason you needed him for, did you want and have a gay orgy with him or something?\u201d <i>Strike three. <b>He\u2019s out.</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour leg burrowed deep into his gut, rocketing into his flesh that almost made his eyes pop out from the sudden force. He gagged out as he slid a few inches back from the push, holding his gut that seemed to move upward. \u201cE-e-e-eehhh-h-h\u2026.\u201d He whimpered before contracting his throat. A Mightyena\u2019s paws spurted out from his open beak, still wiggling and struggling to be free. More of her nude body slid out, slipping out from his mouth as Gold quivered from the horrible feeling. Finally her head popped out, as her infected body curled up and shivered from the cold of the outside world from being in the hot ranks of a stomach. She was drenched in saliva, dripping wet in the clear slime that seeped down through tuffs of her fur before she finally passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal\u2019s covered his mouth, gagging from the sight as Gold regained his stand, wheezing out, \u201cWha-<b>HACK-HACK</b>-What was that for\u2026?! You really need to work at your anger issues\u2026!\u201d He coughed once more before falling to his knees. \u201cYou two are lucky I\u2019m in a good mood today, or I would\u2019ve enforced my territory rule on you again!\u201d You raised an arm to hit him again, but he backed down in time. \u201cHey, listen, I\u2019m sorry for what happened earlier, just try not to be in such an irritated mood all of the time.\u201d Gold said, crossing his arms and looking away, \u201cSeriously, you guys are awful at first impressions, and you certainly would have a difficult time finding a cure if everyone hated you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unwillingly agreed to Gold\u2019s argument and turned to leave. Jackal however stayed behind. \u201cYou know, considering you, I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re not eating that Mightyena or having sex with her body since she\u2019s out cold. Or, are you just waiting for us to leave?\u201d The Typhlosion asked angered, yet curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Golduck scoffed at his question. \u201cMe? Never! Ever since you and your buddy Lace had your temper tantrum with me, I decided to ignore eating others, especially non-infected, and devour infected only if I\u2019m being attacked by them.\u201d He pointed to the floating body of the Feraligatr. \u201cYour friend Lace seems to follow that rule too, and trust me on this. I wasn\u2019t saying that I had sex with that Mightyena, I was\u2026just\u2026<i>masturbating a little</i>\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cheeks flushed red, embarrassed to reveal that truth. He then began walking towards you, while gripping a bag that you never noticed before that was sitting at a tree. \u201cSo are we leaving or not?\u201d He surprisingly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2026?\u201d Jackal asked. Gold flashed his glare back to the fire-type. He said for the first time in a serious haste mood, \u201cListen,<b> fatty</b>, I\u2019ve lived my entire life here alone, protecting this lake for no reason against other infected ferals for years. I honestly would to end this charade and do something more important with my life. And besides, I\u2019m going to see the rest of this island if it\u2019s the last thing I do! In any case, I also don\u2019t want to be here at this lake when those infected wake up, so I\u2019ve packed this bag for any emergency and if you got a problem with my following, suck it up, <b>tubby</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal looked to you to see what you would say, wanting you to stop Gold from coming. Smirking, you replied, \u201cSure. Just don\u2019t slow us down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>((Gold has joined your party!))</b></i></span></div></div>",

Jackal adjusted his bag closer to his shoulder, gripping the leather strap tightly as the flames at the basin of his neck tensed out some. He was so easily pestered by the Golduck\u2019s repetitive tune that it never ceased to annoy him. The same rhythm beated around his brain over and over again, that he couldn\u2019t take anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flipped his head back, glaring at Gold with fire in his eyes and a scent of smoke from his mouth. \u201cStop <i>humming</i>.\u201d Gold raised a brow to the demand, but ceased his hums. Your group continued again, but it wasn\u2019t until you took about five more steps before hearing Gold again. This time, he was <i>whistling</i> the same tune. Jackal immediately stopped walking, dropped his bag, and swirled around to face the whistling blue duck. \u201cDon\u2019t push me you <i>little bastard</i>. Don\u2019t think that I\u2019ve forgiven you for almost killing me the first time at the lake!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood! Remember it then, cause\u2019 if you keep yelling at me or even just try hitting me again, I\u2019ll be sure that I will <i>kill you</i> this time!\u201d Gold replied hatefully. Jackal growled with fury, quickly walking with anger over to the Golduck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want a death wish?\u201d He snarled while pressing his fore head at Gold. Gold pressed his head forcefully forward against Jackal too, growling back, \u201cYou wanna try killing me? Heh-heh-heh\u2026\u201d The two agitated anthros battled it out with their heads, pushing their craniums together in an all out tug-of-war match. You sighed and walked over to the over-reacting pokemon, stepping in between them and pushing them apart with blazing thrusts of your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two need to cut this crap out and calm down. This is the third time we\u2019ve stopped because of an argument and we\u2019re losing daylight! I want to arrive on time at the prairie to meet Hex, so suck it up, and walk. Don\u2019t talk, don\u2019t look at each other, and just try your best to focus on what we\u2019re doing, alright? I don\u2019t need to be babysitting you two twenty-four seven.\u201d The Pokemon glared at each other with distaste but looked away from each other, keeping quiet for at least a long two seconds before Gold opened his beak again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why we need to meet that gay frog in the first place. I caught him staring at my ass from the first time I looked at him, and I can\u2019t tell you how many times he tried coming on to me. I\u2019ve never\u2026\u201d He stopped blabbering on and on when he caught sight of your stone cold gaze. His jaw closed shut, and all was quiet once more. Although, there was this weird buzzing noise that seemed to echo around the trees\u2026What could it be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, your felt hands grasp under your arms, and you were lifted off your hind paws several inches off the ground. You panicked in the sudden grapple, flailing your best on what was happening. Gold was suddenly picked up be a flying figure, and soon, so was Jackal! Your eyes widened when you noticed that your capturers were none other than anthro Beedrills! If they were on the ground instead of buzzing in the air, their hind legs standing would make them just as tall in height and build as all of you were. Exoskeleton arms immediately wrapped around your own arms pinning them to your sides, but, how were hands still holding your shoulders...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were unable to see the Beedrill behind you, although you could certainly feel his tight grip and hard armored chest press against your back, so you looked at your struggling and writhing friends for their attackers. Having six limbs in total, instead of their four front limbs being legs, they were built and formed like arms! This explained how they trapped you, but you needed to know why...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir bug-like eyes had no pupils, but were a crimson red, not the infected purple color! What was going on? \u201cHey, let us go! What do you think you\u2019re trying to pull here?!\u201d Gold roared out, turning with great effort in the Beedrill\u2019s constricting exoskeleton arms. The bees seemed to ignore you and communicate with each other instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRazz! This catch will definitely please the queen! They\u2019re not infected!\u201d One Beedrill said with excitement through the mandibles of his mouth. Razz, being the one who was apparently holding you answered back, \u201cIndeed they\u2019re not. We may be easily promoted at this rate in our catches!\u201d All of the Beedrills snickered in a male tone, buzzing away as they held all of you into the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you were able to beg or ask anything, the thick striped abdomen of the Beedrill thrusted out, stinging your back, sending its stinger to poke through your skin before your world suddenly disappeared in darkness\u2026.!</span></div></div>",

Your eyes opened out from the darkness under their lids to a bright shine that took awhile for your pupils to adjust to the light. After a few moments of blinking, you were fully aware of your surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were somewhere inside of a cavern-like tunnel, with strange hexagons of yellow mushy material, dripping honey while they were filled with sleeping Kakunas. The entire area was lit up with a yellowish-orange color, reflecting from the glistening honey that leaked off the walls. Buzzes echoed through the tunnels, insinuating that there were many bugs type pokemon that lived here. Looking to your sides were both Gold and Jackal! Though, the two were encased in some kind of hardened honey that molded to the wall and surrounded the entire bodies, except for their heads. They both were squirming to get free, with shut eyes and teeth gritting together, they endeavored with great effort to break through the strange yellowish mesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal noticed that you were awake, quickly whispering over in a panicked tone. \u201cLace! About time you finally woke up! Please tell that you\u2019re able to at least move.\u201d After hearing his quickened words, you looked down at your body, seeing that you were also cocooned in the strange honey. It had hardened all the way to your shoulders! You squirmed inside the brick hard yet slick substance, but it wouldn\u2019t give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, sorry, I can\u2019t even budge.\u201d You answered back before Jackal quickly shushed you. he raised a small ear to hear buzzing fade away before you continued on to a lower whisper. \u201cWhat the heck is going on\u2026?\u201d Your plush rump still ached to where that Beedrill had stung you to knock you out. You had been proving too much to handle with all of your squirms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold answered this time with a hissing tone, \u201cWell, after you decided to take a nap, those bees took us into their hive, trapping us here for no reason! They completely ignored what we were saying!\u201d You suddenly saw a clawed black hand slap Gold across the side of his face. A Beedrill had floated down on his fluttering wings and took notice to your conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuiet you! The Queen doesn\u2019t like her gifts to speak against her!\u201d He angrily seethed out through his mandibles. His glowing red blank eyes glimmered their way over to two more Beedrills flew their way into the tunnel. \u201cThe Queen is ready for all three of these vermin. But I have to warn you Razz, she\u2019s in quite the picky mood today.\u201d Razz nodded as each of the Beedrills walked in front of the three of your, gripping their arms around your honey capsules and peeling them right off as if they were toothpicks. You opened your mouth to protest, but it was quickly covered by Razz\u2019s hand from behind, as he plucked his stinger at the ground, breaking the hardened honey at your feet, as all of the Beedrills grabbed their captives from behind. They took flight, carrying you to the top of the hive roof and into a bright large room with two Beedrill guards standing at the opening, each at one side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting their attention when they looked at the three of you, they nodded and allowed your capturers continue buzzing their way to the room\u2019s center. A Vespiquen sat in a large yellow throne, engraved with gold that leaked out honey. Her mandibles seemed to stretch wide, as if she was smiling. \u201cAh! Let me see who are guests are this time!\u201d She happily cheered in an adult tone. She looked at all three of with determined red eyes from side to side, watching you as you make muffled cries while squirming in the air inside the honey cocoons. \u201cA Golduck, a Typhlosion, and\u2026OH! This is a new one I\u2019ve never had here before! A Lucario, and lucky for me, all of you seem to be male\u2026\u201d Her clawed fingers tapped at each other in interest at their tips as one of her Beedrill officers spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe discovered these three by the forest trail south of here, near the river banks.\u201d He assured his apparent leader. You took advantage of what he was saying and remembered his directions. They may be useful when you leave, or escape this place. She chuckled happily and finished off saying, \u201cOh, and none of them are infected! It just gets better and better! And to think that I expected such a horrible hunt for snacks today.\u201d You gulped at her words. Did she say, hunt and snacks in the same sentence\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe relaxed back into her glorious chair, revealing a bright pinkish-red slit on her crotch area, spewing out her inner juices. Gold yelped a bit at the sight, having a quick and hard erection that was clearly visible through the clear honey. The Vespiquen continued, \u201cSo, who will be my dinner today? I think I\u2019ll choose that excited duck over there and how about...hmmmmmm\u2026\u201d She tapped a single red claw hand, pondering hard on who should satisfy her stomach! <i>She was going to eat you!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back and forth between you and Jackal, strained against the cocoons and Beedrills that held you, as the bee that held Gold quickly fluttered over to his queen, presenting Gold as his offering. \u201cI think I only have room for two, so the last one, Razz, you can have.\u201d Razz smiled happily as she pointed a finger at her chosen meal, smiling wickedly. \u201cYou, I want that one too.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Movements were unnoticed and uncared for by the Beedrills, and you couldn\u2019t even compromise, or beg for that matter with Razz\u2019s hand firmly clasped around your muzzle. Remaining as the only option, you let out soft whimpers and waited for your end as Razz hefted your capsule over his shoulder, carrying you over to his queen by fluttering over to the throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold had already been chosen and presented to the bee woman from a Beedrill holding the tip-end of the capsule at her puffed crotch, pulsing to be filled. Gold shivered, from fear and excitement. Being unbirthed by a woman was just one of his many dirty fantasies that he always dreamed of, and this one was a particular personal favorite. Through the foggy gold outer-casing, you unwillingly forced yourself to notice his hard member to press at the inner walls, squeezing out pre in the small humps he delivered inside the honey cocoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Beedrill wasted no time, and began to lower Gold\u2019s capsule downward to the vagina laid out before the horny duck. Gold shivered along the Vespiquen, as her hands were placed firmly at the end of her arm rests, gripping her claws into and digging back. Her gown like abdomen writhed a bit as her lower lips were suddenly expanding themselves to fit Gold\u2019s cocoon inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou endeavored to burst out yelling through the Beedrill\u2019s hand masking your mouth, but it held tight, and another hand was clenched to a fist as it jabbed your cocoon\u2019s side, forcing pressure against your ribs. The thrust definitely kept you quiet from then on, when suddenly you were being handed off to another Beedrill instead. The bug that had been feeding his Queen your Golduck companion was now grasping you tightly and buzzed over for his queen\u2019s second coarse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold was already half-way down his descent, as the Vespiquen was now pushing him inward by herself, nudging him down her abdomen by forcing her hands down on top of his head. Gold had his eyes closed, murring at his pleasure while he continued to hump his on oval honey cage, seeming to be on his edge. He pressed his against the inner walls one more time, (for all to see), and gaped his beak wide open, bellowing out. A splotch of white suddenly popped out inside the transparent cocoon, and then another, and another! The Golduck blushed ferociously and cannoned all of his seed out to drip against his belly and legs, seeping down into the bottom of the capsule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Vespiquen hissed from the erotic sight, uncontrollably pushing the ejaculating duck far inward until his shoulders were absorbed into between in her groin area. \u201cEeh\u2026eh\u2026\u201d He stammered out before two clawed hands enveloped his face, poking him fully down. Pre squirted out from her bloomed vagina, and the Vespiquen was certainly breathing more heavily now. She held her chest with a hand, getting back control of her senses through heavy breathes, \u201cBring me the dog\u2026The Typhlosion is all yours Razz.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s why you were passed off. Razz rubbed all four of hands together, excited by the news and hovered over to his prize. Jackal gasped before scrunching his brow downward over his eyes. He wouldn\u2019t be taken without a fight. Instantly, bright flames exhaled out in a wave of heat, spewing fire at the approaching Beedrill. Razz jolted his wings upward, evading the blast of flames as he caught up to the continued imprisoned Typhlosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange golden goo began to ooze out of his stinger tip, and Razz began to plaster the heavy liquid around Jackal\u2019s mouth. The fire-type\u2019s protests became muffled when the honey suddenly hardened, ensnaring the Typhlosion's flaming breath! That explained what substance you were trapped in, however, you still needed to know its flaw. Too late to know though, when you felt yourself shift within the different Beedrill\u2019s hands and given to the malicious Vespiquen, eager to let you join your friend\u2019s fate! Gold had bulged her gown-like abdomen greatly; always easing and retracting from his small wiggling. You gulped as you felt your face pressed into\u2026</span></div></div>",

Your ears folded back as the fur from your neck to your spine spiked ferociously outward. Your cheeks flooded with blood from the embarrassing factor, watching while your contained legs press inside the bee-woman's vaginal walls that rippled at your touch. Already being slick from Gold's descent, your cocoon finds its way down into her love-hole, sliding slowly for the pleasure of the Vespiquen, and surely for the entertainment of her Beedrill servants.  Looking back with a few uncomfortable nudges, you watch Jackal's head being pumped and compressed against the beating member of Razz, thrusting his mouth all across the blood engorged rod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male Beedrill was certainly enjoying his new toy, (and probable snack later), judging from the smirking mandibles and erotic groans he would make. Jackal simply had his eyes shut in defeat, for there was nothing he could really do no matter how much he disliked the idea of servicing the bee-anthro. He simply let all four exoskeleton clawed hands remain gripped around his face and hump away. The other Beedrills, on the other hand, also took pleasure in watching the fun sport when their own erections began to protrude out. Unwillingly, they grabbed their pulsating cocks into their palms and began to fap away to the intoxicating sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering your own predicament, you look back down on your dreadful progress, noticing that you were almost all the way up to your shoulders! A clawed hand suddenly wrapped around your muzzle, as another was placed at one of your sides. You stare into the hungry lustful eyes of the Vespiquen, see her half-conscious state getting the best of her. She began to jerk her arms up and down, which soon caused your golden capsule to pump vertically wit her movements. She was using you as a <i>dildo</i>! Humiliated yet somewhat unwillingly horny, you were pressed inward and then pulled half-way out by the queen bee as her moans suddenly began grow with her speed. Her volume was exceeding her limit, and so was her climax at this rate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel your cocoon press against Gold inside the womb, poking at the hot drowsy duck further in the sac. The Vespiquen's audible moaning suddenly transitioned into excruciating hissing when her enticement hit its full potential limit. Her cum fountained up her vagina, exploding out her hot juices across your cocoon and over her body, dripping wet while expelling warm steam. Your cheeks flushed to their own full potential, as sweat dripped through the fur on your head. The experience was even enough to tire you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExhaling greatly, the Vespiquen patted your head as another hand craned against her chest, slathering her cum over her breasts for her own enjoyment. Just then, the hand on top of your head suddenly started to press down, pushing you past your shoulders in the hot slick tunnel with your head and neck to remain. Twitching on reflex from the odd outburst for pleasure, you turn your eye-sight to Jackal who seemed to be surrounded by the Beedrills as they circled around him to rub all of their cocks around his face. The crowd of male Beedrills suddenly gripped and pinched all around the skin and fur of his face as they ejected their loads, shooting the thick ropes of their semen across poor Jackal. The white goo oozed down his face and neck, leaving the exhausted Typhlosion to come to a small orgasm himself inside his honey capsule, splashing a white spot within the transparent cocoon. After that, your field of vision is shrouded in a very dark-pinkish color, echoing gurgles while heat floods around your entire body. You feel compressed against soft pudgy skin which expected to Gold. Interesting and satisfying enough though, even at the brink of your life, the honey that had once been hardened around you had melted away, allowing both you and Gold to curl up inside the womb to the best of your abilities as the hot thick honey filled it in between the empty space and crevices inside the organ. You were up to your chest in the hot nectar, and it was occurring to you that it wasn't going to go anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou promised others that you would make alive though! You promised to solve this mystery and put an end to the infection! Could this truly be your doom? You place your paws as far apart against the slick slimy vaginal walls, as Gold seem to be at the final moments of passing out from exhaustion and enticing pleasure. Your endeavors soon tired out, and you were back to being constricted within the muscle walls once more, as they suddenly began to pump and press around the two of you, readying your bodies for absorption. Gold's odd skin plushed against your furry body over and over again, squished together and pulled out for another squeeze. It felt like you were inside a fleshy hot bean bag that wouldn't stop jiggling. Whimpers softly spoke out from your mouth with Gold too busy just enjoying the ride, letting his satisfied dick flop around its pre and passing out from the rumbling motions of the womb. The honey's aroma, combined with the lulling compressions of the moist tight sac caused you to tire out, submitting to the Vespiquen for your final moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Vespiquen rubbed her bulged out, yellow-black striped abdomen with tender excitement. The Lucario and Golduck were squishing around through the honey-filled womb, ready to be absorbed into the queen's body for nutrients. The queen looked over to her favorite servant, Razz, who was joyfully rubbing and jiggling his newly fat belly that stretched out from the Typhlosion's occupied space. She smiled in delight as she snapped her claws together, signalling her Beedrill underlings to rub their victim's in their master's bodies. The bees gladly agreed to the task and impatiently squeezed and patted both the Vespiquen's abdomen, and Razz's struggling gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look forward to my new promotion, my Queen.\" Razz was able to speak out from his ecstatic mood as he belched out the last of his meal's air. His queen simply winked at him and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep catching fun and delicious snacks for us, and perhaps you can enjoy this every time.\" She said with a malicious grin and wink.</i></span></div></div>",

I want that fat one right there.\u201d Jackal\u2019s belly was still engorged out by the infected Charmeleon from that lake that he was still digesting, and his gut had rounded out his golden cocoon prison somewhat from the pressure. The Vespiquen then curled her clawed finger to herself, curling it to order the Beedrill holding the chosen Typhlosion to bring her main course over to her. A sinister tongue brushed through her mandibles, speaking out between the lickings, \u201cI enjoy a little fire-type spice to my diet, and with your cute little chub, I\u2019m going to be full for days!\u201d The queen insect then clapped her hands together a few times, commanding her underlings, \u201cPrepare them for the unbirthing, my sweet servants!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal suddenly grew pale. Gold suddenly grew excited. The Vespiquen lazed into her honeycomb throne, relaxing into the chair as her crotch laid for a seductive display for her blooming folds, twitching in anticipating excitement. You struggled within the grasp of Razz, the Beedrill keeping you captive in his grip, but your yelling protests were muffled by the hand clasped around your muzzle. Squirms barely even seemed to be noticeable by anyone within the confining honey cocoons, and all hope seemed to be lost. Jackal tried to thrash about in his cocoon, not wanting to accept the fact of being devoured by a vagina, however Gold seemed to feel the completely the opposite. Sure, he was a little scared about never seeing daylight again, but heck, this was a once in lifetime experience! The perverted duck seemed happy to die in such a peculiar questionable fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hissing whispered then sent your soul to shrink back into the depths of your body as you heard Razz speak through his mandibles, close to your ear, \u201cThat means you\u2019re <i>all mine</i>, pup.\u201d A rough tongue brushed against the back of your head\u2019s fur, sending shivers down your writhing spine. Razz began to nibble behind your ears, pinching your skin every now and then from his pincer-like mouth. Enjoying your flavor, the Beedrill murred at your taste as you were forced to see a front row seat of your friends' final demise.</span></div></div>",

The honey still compacted you, your friends could neither move, and all of you were surely awaiting to be digesting in some bee's belly at the end of the road. But honestly, if it was just honey, how could it be hardened like slick cement so fast. An idea blossomed out like a flower of hope inside your head, and you felt like it was the only last remaining way. You chomped down onto Razz's hand that covered your muzzle, sinking fangs into the exoskeleton to cause the Beedrill to release your mouth after a brutal yelling hiss of pain. You felt a hand jab at your side in revenge but the bite was well worth it, you hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all your fault Jackal!\" You yelled at the Typhlosion, which bewildered him for a moment, including some of the other Beedrills. \"Ugh, if you weren't wasting our time by complaining about Gold all of the time then we wouldn't be in this stupid mess you <i>dumb prick</i>!\" Jackal was taken back at your comment, lowering his brow in a furious expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me? This is <i>my</i> fault? If anyone is to blame here, its <i>you</i> for allowing that stupid perverted duck over there to tag along!\" The Typhlosion roared in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cry me a river Jackal. I wouldn't have allowed him if you weren't such a total <i>pussy</i> all the time. How many times have I to save your wimpy ass? Gold can at least keep up and take care of himself.\" You barked back. This angered Jackal even more, as his fangs grit against his teeth as smoke began to flare out from his nostrils. Gold was enjoying the argument, as well as the other Beedrills within the throne room, watching on the betrayal of their meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How am I the pussy if you're only saying that knowing we're about to be dead you hypocritical bastard?! How about you come say it to my face when I'm not in this stupid cocoon?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, I can't because we're in this mess since this was all of your fault! Why else would I say it now? You've been pathetic this entire journey out here with me, and I feel like I'm carrying extra luggage with you around! You're just useless wasted time for me you dumb Typhlosion. You know, maybe you're right we're in this mess, because I should've <i>left</i> you for <i>dead</i> back at that burning house! Why don't you hurry up and grow a pair already since you're about to pathetically die right now...\" You hollered out to the enrage fire-type, finishing the insult with a cherry on top. \"...<i>Jack</i>!\" You felt a sudden swipe against your face, punched from Razz who was impatient with your sudden outburst. \"That's enough! Don't make us kill you before we eat you, <i>mutt</i>!\" But it was already too late. Your plan would surely work by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pores on the backside of Jackal's neck began to grow brightly within the cocoon, putting pressure against the honey walls. Jackal, by now, looked more sinister and dangerous than the Beedrills, as he stared at you with an evil glare that it made your heart pound uncomfortably. More smoke bellowed out from his mouth, as he opened it slowly and began to rouse a slow growl that boosted in volume with each passing second. The Vespiquen was tired of your shenanigans and ordered a Beedrill to bring her the  Typhlosion over to her. Razz's eyes widened as he held a hand out to point at Jackal, yelling, \"No, wait! Muzzle him!\" But it was already over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal roared out loudly, as the back of his neck shined more brightly and suddenly bursted into flames, melting and breaking the cocoon! Flames blew out with each breath of hatred toward you, as he slowly walked closer to you with the Beedrill's astonished by his fearful power. The flew over to stop the Typhlosion from proceeding even further as Razz dropped you to evacuate the queen away. Jackal simply blew storms of flames towards the anthro-bees, singeing them and causing them to retreat while dropping Gold's cocoon that shattered on impact from the fall. You, however, still remained in the clutches of your honey capsule!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid at your side, seeing your world vertically flipped to watch as two Typhlosion feet slowly approached you. \"<i>Uh-oh</i>.\" You thought. Sure, you were able to get your friends free but at what cost? Jackal was easy to rile up but difficult to calm down! One of his foot-paws kicked with painful force across your head, forcing to roll from the impact. You wheezed out air, trying to stop your head from shaking so much so you could at least confess to Jackal your reasons. But after recovering from the painful kick, you look up to see a dark shadow loom around your trapped body, with Jackal towering over you as smoke streamed from his maw. You suddenly heave up towards him, as he gripped your cocoon tightly within his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe murred out an evil chuckle, ready to take his vengeance from your harsh words. \"Who's the wimpy pussy <i>now</i>?\" You had to think fast of what to say to stop him from making a big mistake...!</span></div></div>",

Your eyes widened with despair. Your friend was actually going to eat you! Desperate, worried, and even betrayed, you squirm within the hardened honey cocoon with all of the might that remained left in your body, but it would never give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were trapped, rolled up in a sweet honey wrap for Jackal to enjoy his revenge all the more better, only to end up digesting away because of his temper. All this time he came along to pay you back for saving his life, and now he's ending yours! Panting within the hot moist mouth of the Typhlosion, Jackal muffledly chuckled with your head inside, lapping and twisting his tongue around your face for his pleasure, and your humiliation. Jackal did his best to lift your capsule upwards, heaving your imprisoned body upward to slide your head into his gullet, deepening and sliding within the fleshy tunnel that massaged your body on the trip down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no use. Struggling, whimpering, begging, and even submitting wasn't going to help you in your time of desperate need. The foot end of the cocoon was snapped up within the fanged jaws of Jackal, as he rubbed the protruding bulge the started from his chest to his neck, and ending at his bloated cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gulped loudly for the distraught Gold to hear, while the duck was too busy recovering from falling out his cocoon and wiping the honey shards off him during his meal. The Golduck stood up, ready to face the treasonous Typhlosion, and ready to either save you, or avenge you. You, however, were to busy being crammed within the asymmetrical tight compacts of Jackal's stomach, writhing at the uncomfortable position with the cocoon around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronically, the heat of the stomach and the rumbling walls helped to slowly melt the honey away, loosening its sticky grip, allowing you to at least fumble around inside Jackal's belly, now bloated and being rubbed from the outside to intimidate Gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jackal...!\" You tiredly and feebly begged. \"Release m-me...you're going to...to...\" Your mind was at the break of exhaustion. You had struggled too much and oxygen was quickly depleting. The constant motions of the rocking stomach didn't help. They even made you more tired as it is. Suddenly, the stomach rumbled in a strange way, and pressure was building up in the pucker closed hole below you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt suddenly open up, revealing a beak! Gold's head slowly slithered out from the intestines and into the stomach with his eyes tightly closed and his mouth angrily gritting into a scowl. He had been anal vored by Jackal! It seems he chose to pick a new favorite in catching prey ever since he ate the Charmeleon at the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold's legs and tail finally popped out of the hole as it closed back up, sealing the both of inside to struggle for your last minutes until the digestive juices begin flowing. The Gold tried his best to try and beat the walls with all of his limbs, accidentally and occasionally knocking them into your saliva covered body. Your bodies were then forced to press against each other within the tight small compounds of the organ sac, rubbing against each other as Gold was forced to endure it all. Your eyes slowly battered down, your energy absolutely drained. You passed out in your friend's belly, as Gold unwillingly had to deal with your unconscious body and slick fur to slide itself around him inside the gurgling stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gold laid against the floor of the hive, defeated and covered in burns from all of Jackal's attacks. The Typhlosion's rage and fury allowed him to have obsessive amounts of power, even with the weight of a Lucario being tussled inside of him. Jackal laughed to himself as he approached his weakened enemy, gloating out, \"Time to pay the price for trying to kill me. This would be the second time you've tried to do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold tried crawling away on his back, widening his fearful eyes until he could stumble away no more. Jackal turned around above the water-type to give the duck a good look at his rump, and bulbous cheeks. He then lowered them down, sucking and squeezing the Golduck's in between them. Jackal let his tongue flop out joyfully, enjoying and savoring the moment of finally getting rid of his annoying duck companion. Gold's body flailed and distressingly kicked his legs and wagged his tail, but to no avail. They were quickly engorged up, with his taloned feet to be squished inside. Jackal sat all the way down, rubbing his newly and fairly large belly as it sagged outward across the flooring. Placing both of his hands around the squirming gut, he jiggled and tossed it around, teasing what was once his friends as a final insult before he stood back up, searching for an exit. No Beedrill within the hive dared to stop him, seeing that he had devoured two pokemon without breaking a sweat, staring at his fat belly bounce in front of him as he walked out, back to the forest.</i></span></div></div>",

Jackal only snickered and dropped you. At the crash of your fall, the cocoon instantly began to crack and shatter into a sharp web-like design across the golden capsule, signifying you might be able to nudge your way to freedom. You squirm and writhe inside, hearing more cracking noises until you were finally able to pull an arm out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPunching against with a swift swipe of aura, you were able to break the cocoons outer coat, destroying it around you to fall across the floor. You breathed a sigh of relief, only to gag out painfully after having a Typhlosion leg lodged into your gut area. You curl to your knees, holding your bruised area while trembling before looked up at Jackal, seeing the hunger in his eyes. He wanted you to be out of the cocoon, just for the pleasure of having you struggle against his power. He was turned around, looking back down at you with his rump close to your nose tip. His soft bulbous cheeks squeezed together, catching your muzzle within their crevice! He was going to anal vore you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll just show you how <i>useless</i> I am with my weak body, according to <i>you</i>. I think I've picked a new favorite of humiliating vore ever since the Charmeleon I helped save you from.\" He maliciously said as he sat down even closer, enveloping your head! Your arms panicked against his rear, pressing at his plush cheeks and struggling to pull your head out. It seemed to be all over for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, you were right when you chose to bring Gold along. Water streamed in a burst of vapor jets, blasting the Typhlosion back, plopping your face out to breathe fresh air again! Gold stood at his destroyed cocoon, as water dripped from his beak before he wiped it away with his arm, revealing a smirk after revealing his mouth again. \"Wow, you're really <i>hot</i> tempered, aren't you?\" The smug duck said as Jackal recollected him self, still furious. While water streamed down off his body, it quickly became steam as he roared more fire around his body, whipping it out in all directions. The flames scared away any bug pokemon that remained in the hive area, hiding in between crevices of the fire-type's rage. Gold continued to taunt the Typhlosion, joking once more, \"Do I have to literally <i>cool you off</i> every time you pitch a bunch of tantrums?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal bolted forward to Gold, smoke clouding out of his fanged mouth as his mane of fire bloomed out a storm of heat. Gold smirk grew into a wide grin, as his red jewel, crested into his forehead began to glow. Before the enraged Typhlosion could even reach the Golduck, Gold fired his red beam!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA simple spark jolted out, disappearing a few inches away from Gold. The duck's jaw dropped as he held his head once more, paranoid and hopping his legs around. \"Damn it! Damn it, damn it, damn iiiiiittt! I forgot that you broke it! Has it not healed yet, even by all this time? Lace, you stu-\" Gold was cut off from his rant when Jackal  finally tackled the duck, smashing the water-type into the ground as he was gritted against the floor while sliding from impact. Jackal held his face into the breaking flooring, grinding it until they finally stopped from the sheer force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal yelled angrily as he prepared to strike Gold with his flamethrower, however, the duck quickly slammed his head outward, zen headbutting the Typhlosion in the face. Blue sparks flashed out as a small trail of blood streamed out of Jackal's nose as he went tumbling backward, falling onto the floor rump-first. Gold's beak cheeks sprang out ward, and he unleashed a cannon of water to launch Jackal all the way against a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wince from hearing the smash, and after the dust cleared, Jackal was covered in a few bruises, and his flames had been extinguished. His heavy angry breathing was replaced by soft tired panting. His temper had finally gone down. Placing a hand at your knee, you stagger your way up to stand, walking over to the beaten Typhlosion with Gold, as the duck licked his chops. \"I can't wait to feel him sliding down my gullet.\" The Golduck said, slapping his blue belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou placed a paw at his chest to stop him, replying, \"We're <i>not</i> going to <i>eat</i> him.\" Gold raises a brow, now a bit ticked off and wanting a reason for why not. You lower down and face Jackal who finally opened his eyes, attempting to focus them in his fuzzy state. Sure, you were mad at Jackal for almost eating, but he did kind of have a reason to do so. You held out a paw to help him up, contemplating, \"Are you done pitching a fit now? We can finally leave this cave you know.\" Jackal only huffed angrily in response, slapping your hand away as he struggled to get back up.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe walked past you, coughing out from under his breath. \"Don't talk to me.\"</span></div></div>",

Aching and exhausted, all of you sit down against the grassy forest floor, relaxing in the tall grass. Jackal had been silent the entire way there, taking the lead and avoiding eye contact with you. Gold could care less if Jackal was angry or dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes slowly drowse away into slumber while your body lays in the soft ground against your back. Your arms and legs lay displayed outward and lazily as Gold yawned tiredly. The duck would keep watch as the three of you would probably take turns for resting and guarding. Jackal was laying flat on his side, back turned to you and breathing heavily. Maybe he would loosen up soon. He can't stay mad forever from just a few fake insults.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNudging your head back, you faint away into long awaited slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Golduck's eyelids began to droop half way over his eyes, and occasionally drooping his head down while watching the setting sun. He always perked his head back up, only to slump back down again. \"I think it's time for...<i>yaaaaawwwn</i>...to switch roles.\" Gold joyfully sighed out. He sat up from the log he was sitting on and began to walk towards Jackal. The fire-type's mane of fire enflared out as Gold approached. So, on second thought, Gold backed away and stumbled closer to your body instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the Golduck suddenly stepped on something thin, yet long. Gold tensed up and stared down at his legs, noticing a black scaled tube, ending with a black and red dagger-like tip. Hissing invaded Gold's eardrums, as the water-type gulped to look up at slanted purple eyes glow above him. Out from the descending sun's light, its orange haze shone a large Seviper naga to tower over Gold with a angry scowl. Gold lifted his foot of the tail end he had stepped on before freezing in fear. Short gasps began to exhale out of his open beak as his pupils trembled in anguish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to leave, the infected Seviper naga grabbed him with its arms, raising him up to eye level to stare into his fearful eyes. The duck gagged out, causing both you and Jackal to grumble awake. \"Alright, duck, you better have a death wish if you decided to...\" Jackal groaned out before rubbing his eyes to see what was truly happening. You perk your head up to see the Golduck squirming in the arms of an infected serpent, with its forked tongue working its way around his face. The Seviper spots you a few meters off, as Jackal ignores his grudge to help Gold. The both of you charge at the snake, flaring up both of your power to strike the infected feral. The Seviper lashes out his long body, hidden in the tall grass to surround the you and Jackal in its tight thick coils. The smooth scales squeeze at your body, catching you off guard while they continue to twirl around and encase your frailness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold gulped as he stared and the flat chested Seviper, also staring at the two throbbing cocks along the snakes waist area! The two pulsating rods were erect and desperately reaching upward. One member rested atop of the other, both of them oozing pre-cum as the snake inspected Gold's blue body. He tightened his grip around Gold's arms as he pinned them to the amphibious duck's sides. He was then lowering his writhing victim closer and closer to his throbbing cocks, as you watched within the intertwines of the Seviper's gripping coils. Jackal roared and puffed out small balls of fire to scatter around before he was fully encased under the tube-like body of the snake to cause less distress. You heard his muffled yells and saw his bulging struggles underneath the scaled mass, as you were left to act quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fumbled around and shook your entire trapped body, Being this snake's toy was the last thing you wanted, especially for poor Gold. The Seviper angrily hissed at you, interrupting Gold's descent to his impatient members. The duck's anus loomed just an inch above one cock, with his lips close to the edge of the other as he quacked soft whimpers. Your endeavors was loosening the infected Seviper's grip, allowing you to slowly slip from his thick coils.</span></div></div>",

A large burn smudge puffed a splotch of smoke to flow out from the snake's side as it pulled away while dropping Gold to the grassy ground. The duck scuttered and panicked on the flooring, crawling away to avoid a hateful bite from the Seviper's intimidating fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal forced the coils encircling his body off of him with a rage of heat, spewing out bright flames across the the tall grass, backing the Seviper away. The infected hissed loudly, venom seeping out of his sharp crimson teeth. It lunged forward at Gold, seeing at how the duck was the only one that couldn't burn the naga. Although, Gold lifted your bag in front of him in defense, that cushioned the plunge from the Seviper's maw when it caught inside of its mouth. It quickly swallows it whole, spilling a few berries out of it before bulging out of it throat to sink into his underside. It gagged at the cloth material, expecting a struggling duck inside of him instead of whatever he had just ingested.

A purple tip leaked out a thin watery substance that glowed purple. It was a poison sting attack, and the venom had been injected into your body. It wasn't much to do anything to your body, but it did leave an annoying prick at your tender skin. Jackal plucked his needle out oh shoulder with his mouth before spitting it out, making sure the infected snake was far off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping over to Gold, your nudge the curled up Golduck with your knee, wondering what was wrong with him and why he didn't fight back. He looked up with an awkward and weak expression, as his body shivered and occasionally jolted in a quick spasm. He had been paralyzed from the tight grip of the Seviper! It was alright though, you had your bag to recover the...your bag...that you couldn't find...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same bag that you needed at the moment for this sort of event was now boiling up inside that Seviper's belly, wasting all of your time to pick and collect those. You scrunch your brow and hold your head, attempting to restrain your anger to lash out against the strained Golduck as he continued to shake helplessly. Instead, you hold out a paw and help the water-type up, walking along with him to return at the logs all of your were resting on before. You set him down as he curls up, saying, \"It's your turn to keep watch...\" He drifted to sleep instantly as you rest down while sighing out in agitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal nudged your side with his shoulder. \"I'll do it. Just shut up and get some sleep.\" The Typhlosion said with a haste-filled tone. You opened your mouth to speak, but he purposely interrupted you by repeating, \"<i>Just shut up</i> and get some sleep.\" You smirked at his remark before yawning out. The sun was fading away off in the horizon, darkening the sky to reveal the moon shining high and bright in the purple tinted atmosphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, just try not to kill me in my sleep.\" You playfully assured the Typhlosion as you flopped down at your side, leaning into the grass. You were kind of glad Jackal was slowly coming around again, and maybe the both of you could actually have a <i>normal conversation</i> again. The trip to this spot from the hive was just stressful, quiet, and very awkward. Your eyes droop down, falling into a deep slumber to the noise of Jackal, digging around the dirt with a stick from boredom.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Your mind felt a bit weird. It had been only about half an hour of traveling ever since Jackal 'politely' woke you up by kicking you, but your body felt different for some reason. You remembered the infected Seviper's poison and figured it was some of the draining effects that it would have. It would probably go away soon though. Jackal started to seem better, with his head up high and positivism shining its way through him. Gold, on the other hand, didn't look so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis arms clenched around his chest as he ached his way along the entire trudge to the prairie. You would be sure to try and  get him help soon once arriving at the psychics' tent. After all, it wasn't too far away at this point in your journey. In fact, once the three of you climbed up a massive grassy hill, you were suddenly greeted by a familiar friendly welcome. \"There you two are! What took you so long?\" Hex spoke while leaning against a tree under its shade. He pulled himself off and walked closer to both you and Jackal, with arms wide open. He immediately clustered his long arms around the two of you, hugging you deeply as he uttered from behind your heads when he nudged his own in between them, \"For a moment there, I thought something terrible had happened to you! I don't know how I would react if I knew you were gobbled up by some <i>beastie</i> out there...Oh! Who do we have here?\" The tall frog released you and Jackal, taking more interest into Gold that stood bewildered and scared. \"You're that Golduck from the lake! My, oh my, it's such a coincidence in meeting you again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex began to step towards the shorter duck, but Gold backed away, hissing out of his beak while thrashing a clawed finger at him, \"Don't you dare touch me, <i>frog</i>.I remembered the last time you tried touching me.\" Hex didn't care, and accepted the Golduck into his arms, lifting Gold off his feet by a few inches from the difference in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, how could I forget our last get-together? You know, I'm pretty positive that you've grown an inch or two since we last met!\" The gay frog dropped Gold, closing his eyes while apparently agitated. \"I see you're still interested in women as always. Tell me, have you actually made any friends, or were you forced into their short quest for girls or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold furiously picked himself off the ground from being dropped, yelling in return, \"Hey! I'm capable of helping others you <i>sick toad</i>! I'm not your little boy toy so how about you find some other poor sucker to flirt with or to have se-ACK!\" Gold was jabbed by a single finger on his forehead by Hex, as the Toxicroak pushed back down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see your manners haven't changed one bit.\" Hex interrupted as he turned his back towards the Golduck, ready to travel with you to the open plain. He raised a single purple arm, aiming with his finger to a small brown spot fixated along the grassland. \"That's their tent. I'll introduce you and we can discuss things in there.\" You nod as you follow Hex's lead towards the psychics' home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tent was pretty large, stretching into a multiple room canvas with interesting symbols painted along its outer cloth walls for decoration. Torches were stabbed into the ground next to the entrance's sides, as the four of you approach the cloth door. Hex clears his throat out loud, causing the attention of someone shuffling or moving inside. Just then, a Hypno's head stares through the open crevice, squinting its eye before asking in a deep and male monotone voice, \"Speak your needs...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex seemed to know exactly to say, \"I think you may remember me, Gyro. I would to have a chat with your Master concerning the current infection, along with these travelers.\" The Hypno, Gyro, stares at the polite Toxicroak before turning away, leaving all of you in complete silence. After waiting for a few more silent moments, you open your mouth to ask a question until an amphibian hand clasps over your entire muzzle. Hex held a single finger close to his lips to remain quiet, and as you behaved, the Hypno came back, speaking out in his strange mood, \"My Master accepts your concerns. However, your Golduck and Typhlosion must stay and keep watch for any dangers or infected that may linger about. The Lucario can come with you.\" You look back at Jackal and Gold who just shrug and lay down against their rumps, waiting for you to kill some time so they could leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing your arm, Hex showed you in, following Gyro in a separate room of the large tent. It was slightly hazy from smoke, as candles burned an intoxicating aroma around the the area. In the center lay a square table, with a Drowzee wearing a ceremonial robe sat at one end, sipping tea from a smelted cup. The Hypno raised his arm out, pointing to where you should sit as he padded over to sit next to his master. The Hypno rested the teacup onto the low-to-the-ground table, resting on his knees as he beckoned the two of you over. \"Ah! Hex! What a splendid surprise! I see that you have survived well during your swamp expedition. I must ask you to sit down and join me for some relaxation.\" The Hypno was also a male, with a strangely soothing voice that almost made you want to yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would love that.\" Hex answered as he sat on his knees across the Hypno and Drowzee's side of the able. He patted his hand next to him, calling you over he continued, \"This is Lace, a researcher for the current epidemic. He's survived some interestingly tough ferals on his way here.\" You finally rested on your legs like everyone else as the Drowzee raised  curious brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So does this mean you finally have that certain mate you've always been looking for, Hex?\" The psychic suggested as the two of them chuckle at each other from the joke. You give an uncomfortable fake smile, waiting to discuss the real reason you were there. \"Oh don't worry, Lace, I was only kidding around. Ahem.\" The Drowzee pressed a hand at his chest, looking directly at you. \"I am Draxius, and you've already met my apprentice,Gyro I presume? Well I did hear from a Redeemer's Grotto messenger that you're the Canyon Dragon Slayer! I'm guessing you earned that title after you single handedly defeated an infect large Aerodactyl?\" Word got out that fast? Their towns runners were definitely good at their job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I did,but what can you tell me about the infection. Is it true that a psychic pokemon can cause such a thing?\" You ask briefly. Draxius sighs as he comes to a stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right directly down to it, hm? Well Lace, you're correct. I suppose it's possible for one to control others into their extremist lustful emotions, but you would have to be a very powerful pokemon, and I cannot stress the word very enough when I say that.\" Draxius explained. He began to walk around the room with his arms crossed behind his back, continuing to explain. \"Both me and Hex discovered that it is mainly infected body fluids that are mixed with an opposite host, it becomes infected with it, meaning it travels through your very blood stream once it succumbs to the virus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can biting infect others then?\" Hex asked this time. Draxius hesitated but returned walking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the most part, yes it can happen, but a large supply of saliva is needed to get into your wound for it to infect your entire body. But infected ferals do not typically bite others just to pass on their traits. They want more fun than just <i>that</i>.\" The Drowzee stopped before, as you were given a good view of Draxius. His small trunk hung down over his mouth, as his eyelids drooped over lazily somewhat, He was also on the pudgier side of things, having a plump yellow and brown potbelly that sagged out. Gyro, although, was leaner and wore nothing on his yellow body, except for the yo-yo he wore as a necklace. You flipped your attention back to Draxius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how powerful does this pokemon have to be in order to control all of this? I mean, could a simple psychic pokemon like you perform such a thing?\" Hex raised another question. The Drowzee huffed at it, replying, \"This pokemon can control hundreds of other pokemon from many miles away, all at the same time. And what do you mean <i>simple</i> psychic pokemon? I am the Great Draxius of the Mountains!\" His gaze became a little more uneasy after that comment. \"Allow me to show you what I can do...\"</span></div></div>",

Your thoughts and reason tend to wipe away inside your brain at this point, as your focus was lured into the whirls of Draxius' hands. Even Hex was passionately watching, unmistaken to fall under some enchanting spell the Drowzee had fixated your minds on. The amplification of your sudden tiredness brought you to the brink of sleep as you were unaware of a loud yawn to flow from your stretching muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tent around you even disappeared, letting the chubby Draxius become your one and only vocal point of attention. Your eyelids began to lower down, as the Toxicroak kneeling next to you lulled himself to a sense of hypnotism to the Drowzee, gladly accepting the wavy circles of its palms. A soft voice echoed through your head, commanding you, \u201c<i>Now my little dog, why should you try and ignore my plea to let you relax? All I want of you is to feel at your most comfortable condition\u2026</i>\u201d His voice soothed your mind as it faded against your feelings. \u201c<i>Just surrender and loosen up. I can promise you that you will certainly enjoy it and wish to never go back again\u2026</i>\u201d You felt a bit confused on what he was asking for, and yet you didn\u2019t seem to have a choice to ignore it\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind had opened up, and Draxius had full control over your entire body. You felt his energy flow through your blood vessels and breathe from your lungs, becoming a part of his exhausting magic. Something felt very nourishing just above your thighs, easing its comfort to rise up and harden to a stiff knotted rod for its heated delight. Your cock had been engorged with blood as it twitched with each heartbeat that pounded in your chest, loosening your balls to hang down between your legs for Draxius\u2019 amusement. He ceased his entrancing spellbind after fully putting you under his direct powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Drowzee slowly lingered closer to enjoy his two new pets succumb to the hypnotism, ready to please their master at whatever he beckoned for. He stepped onto the low wooden table, standing before you when he began to seductively disrobe himself, letting his ceremonial sashes limply slide off from his shoulders and past his wide brown hips. The Drowzee stood before naked and pudgy with his yellow and brown belly droop in front of your face. Your tail starts to wag at the sight as your cock tends to wince in arousal. Leisurely, he rests his rear end against the flat table, spreading his legs wider for the entirety of what your master had to offer. His brown scrotum slacked down against his groin, just above his pulsating pucker. You press your muzzle towards the musky groin, spilling your tongue to his genitals and lapping them up to catch all of their stifling tastes.  \u201cGyro, you can have the frog to please yourself however you like. I\u2019m deciding to enjoy myself with this dog.\u201d The Drowzee managed to speak out in between soft grumbles of contentment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hypno took a look at Hex from his side of the table with unsure eyes, seeing the Toxicroak turned around with his hands gripping his own amphibious purple rump. The hypnotized frog tugged at his plump cheeks, easing them open for his small hole to throb in ignorance. Gyro tensed while glancing to the Drowzee, \u201cOf course Master, but\u2026do they deserve this punishment? I know what happens to those you corrupt, and I certainly think they could help stopping the infection.\u201d Draxius gave a quick glare with his low eye-lidded gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come now Gyro, they will be thanking us as they stew in our guts. Honestly, as if these two could possibly do anything to stop this so called \u201cpsychic\u201d pokemon that can infect others. They can\u2019t even resist me! We\u2019re helping them end their lives in a much more civilized way than being devoured by some rabid infected animal out in the woods! Now go give your Toxicroak some attention.\u201d He said before groaning out a growl of pleasure. \u201cOh! Watch the sheath!\u201d Your mouth was sucking upon his anus, squeezing between his rump cheeks as they tighten at the sides of your face. You continued your splurge for lustful hunger, rimming around the butthole and feeling it ripple in response. Hearing his calming voice sound through your ears, you follow your orders and climb onto the table with him. Standing over the laid back Drowzee, you slowly buck your knees outward, lowering your crotch to rest at his burning member. Both of your cocks nestled with one another, throbbing and hardening at each other\u2019s sensitivity. \u201c<i>Begin my little slutty puppet\u2026</i>\u201d Draxius ordered in your thoughts. You began to grind at your master\u2019s rod of flesh, pressing your weight upon while squishing your member against it. The Drowzee gasped pleasantly once more, enlightening you to help satisfy your master additionally further. Hex moaned louder than anyone within the tent, feeling the Hypno\u2019s impressively long yellow muscle pump deep into the horny Toxicroak\u2019s rectum, as it constantly had to widen and extend from such lengthened girth. Tears welled in the frog\u2019s eyes, but a happy smile grinned across Hex\u2019s mouth at great proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, both of the psychics bellowed out, extinguishing their orgasms into the bodies of their pets who gladly accepted their offerings. Draxius blasted large heavy streams of his seed across your chest and his own as you stood around his bloated belly, emptying your own pleasure across his face in thick ropes. It stuck across his open mouth and crosswise his small trunk for him to swallow and enjoy its wet, sticky warmth. Hex croaked aloud, feeling his belly drink the Hypno\u2019s burning load to expand out somewhat. His hand clenched the sloshing stomach, while his anus bubbled and spurted out big glops of Gyro\u2019s semen to spill out around his long purple legs. The Hypno trembled from the experience as he pulled out, releasing his cock to flop downward as it was finished with its horny urges. You stepped away from a top your master, enjoying how his globed gut to squeeze and slide between your legs when you found your hind paws to rest on the floor once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxius panted with tiring bliss as he clenched his chest with a hand, and afterwards, licking his lips to finish his fun. He nodded to Gyro, allowing the Hypno to prepare his meal. The chubby Drowzee revealed his intentions when he\u2026</span></div></div>",

He was about a head shorter than you, but he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let that stop him from testing your flavor. His small yellow trunk rose up from above his mouth, and began to sniff at your face, tickling you from its rubbing and touch to cause you to giggle out some. He smiled back, and afterwards, licked his mouth to clear up some of his drool spilling out. Your mind wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t truly thinking about whatever consequences lay ahead, for your only purpose and thoughts were to pleasure this Drowzee in what he may ask for, even if it was a fattening meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGyro, using his hypnotizing yo-yo to strengthen the affects of the spell on Hex, waved the tool back and forth, catching the Toxicroak\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention to follow its lead. The frog shuddered from the pulsing pain from his anus as it spilt the last of the slimy strings of the Hypno\u00e2\u0080\u0099s semen before he sat upon it, and flopping onto his back as Gyro grabbed his ankles. His tongue brushed itself across the sole of the frog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foot, making Hex wobble the three toes on each foot as they were thoroughly and vastly drenched in the Hypno\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sticky dribble. His hind paws were slathered in the gooey fluid, creating a happy expression from the anthro frog to collect the thick liquid all across his feet. Finally, Draxius opened his maw, pointing at it with one hand to gesture you forward. Your controlled mind accepted the offer while you plunged your own head in, willingly succumbed into being eaten!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Drowzee wrapped his arms around you, easing his hands to your plush furry rump before groping the tight rear. You grunt in response as your head is shrouded by a pink muscle, whipping around as you around pulled into the wet confines of his throat. The gaping hole grips around you, rippling your body to slide inward in a wormy effect. Draxius murred in a muffled tone as your embodiment bloated his cheeks and neck, as the Drowzee lowered a finger in between your round cheeks to welcome itself inward. It tickled at your tailhole, occasionally poking inward to force your body to retract and twitch from the pleasured reflexes. You happily shivered as your torso is encased with his drooling maw, convulsing from utter joy in appeasing your master in such a beautiful manner, while his hands release your rear end to suck your sides into his tight jaws. His trunk then plunged into your tight pucker, pumping it as a sex toy as it inhaled your body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s musk. You couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but moan to the top of your lungs at his rapid pace of pleasure, causing your knees to buck and thrash your legs from the aching tenderness. It slides out, fully satisfied when your crotch is gulp down, pressing your hardened length along his broad wet tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour legs slip inside, closing his slick lips over your hind paws to fully imprison your body within his. You giggle as you know your master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contents have been fulfilled. Your body contracts together into a fetal position as it was constricted together tightly from the slimy organ walls to begin its digestion process. The stomach began to shift in motions, constantly bouncing and churning your aroused physique into wobbling swirls. The Drowzee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spell then began to fade away, as you were suddenly regaining your personality and own thoughts. Where were you? And what was\u00e2\u0080\u00a6<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hit you. You were in a stomach! Your heart began to pound as you panted unhappily and terrified. Your attempts to kick and push the fleshy walls were futile, as your limbs had been pinned together so tightly! You already pleasured and exhausted body was already drained of its energy, forcing your eyes to shudder and aches to cease. Your mind began to shut down, with your eyes closed from passing out in the massaging walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Draxius swung his robe back on, as his fat belly expanded even further in between the saggy clothing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s split opening. He placed a hand on it, cradling it delicately as if he was pregnant and felt the stomach churning the unconscious Lucario into a pasty mesh during digestion. He sloshed it about, comforting him from his willing meal as his apprentice approached his master, kneeling down to the best of his abilities with his large yellow gut that sagged out to touch the floor when lowered. The Toxicroak within the bouncing belly continued to kick and trash inside, whining and sobbing in his muffled tone from no one to aid him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaster, what shall we do about the Golduck and Typhlosion remaining outside\u00e2\u0080\u00a6?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gyro asked.

Heaving his weight to one side, he flops over to land on his elbows and knees to present his brown rear end to your dazed delight. He waves his rump softly from side to side, giving your mind a good hint where his master wants to be pleased. Draxius also gestured his hand to bring Hex over to him, and Gyro accomplished the task by dragging the infatuated Toxicroak by his arm, releasing him in front of the small table his master was crouched upon. The Drowzee slipped his tongue between the crevice of his lips in eager anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now my little <i>froggy</i> friend, why don't you give master a quicklime little kiss to make him feel better.\" Draxius commanded Hex in his seductive calm tone, as he looked back at you from behind him. He gave his rear a good nudge at your direction before asking, \"And how about you satisfy my body by putting those cute little paws of yours between my cheeks, hmm?\" your tail wagged desperately from the order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind forced your head to nod happily, and in compliance, you crouched down to sit down and lifted your legs up. You hind paws press at his brown domes of flesh, rubbing back and forth to pamper his rump to shiver in sexual thrill. Your foot paws press into the pudge, as you felt his soft skin plump outward from the soft force to tickle your pads. You felt yourself giggle while he commanded your body to continue its purge. You willingly accept the offer, unacquainted with what will result if you do. Your paws squeeze into the palpitating pucker up to your ankles, stopping to feel the stale anus to begin its meal by dragging your legs in a gulp like feature. Hex, meanwhile, felt the Drowzee's tongue swirl throughout his mouth during their lengthened kiss. The Toxicroak shuddered under the mix of their saliva and heat, forcefully noticing his already satisfied cock to harden out once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe make out suddenly started to increase when Draxius widened his mouth to overtake Hex's face, and soon, his entire head! The purple frog tensed in the drooling warmth, and deliberately pushed himself further inward. Draxius groaned in appeasement in a muffled tone, as your waist welcomed itself into his ass, letting the rectum expand around your hips. Hex's head and your feet had entered the stomach together from both ends, pressing against each other for the two of you to enjoy. You flattered the frog anthro by squishing your pink paw pads against his cheeks from his blushing face, while his tongue flickered out to lick them inside the slippery dank chamber. The Drowzee's yellow and brown belly inevitably began to expand out, pressing against the wooden surface of the table!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Draxius slurped up the rest of the Toxicroak's trembling legs, sealing his oral meal when Hex's feet were trapped inside his puffed maw. And as for his anal meal, only your head remained, blushed and flattered from your warming treatment. \"<i>Ah</i>...! What a wonderful dinner for my appetite! Such a shame my little pooch that you can't last any longer as my meal. Oh well. There will be many more pokemon to hypnotize at least!\" Draxius spoke to you with a dribble leaking mouth. He grunted when he tensed his cheeks together, forcing your head to pop inside his rim, concealing your fate forever. As your body curled inside with Hex's to be digested together, Draxius moaned out in happy yet painful distress. His stomach had oozed outward, lifting the Drowzee a few inches from the table. His legs couldn't reach down to the table surface anymore, as the tabletop groaned from his recent weight. The legs broke like small sticks, slamming the psychic on the ground to joyfully roll onto his back on the tent floor, rubbing his orbed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Draxius rested his hands around his gurgling gut, as four other hands pressed themselves into his flab, aiding him into digesting the unconscious Lucario and Toxicroak. A Golduck and a Typhlosion, both with spellbound blank expressions, massaged their master's belly, satisfying his urges of fulfillment. Draxius thought to himself as he laid upon his bed pad during his treatment about how these two males will make wonderful additions to his fat, after he ate them when digestion was done of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm certain that will show that foolish frog about how much of a simple psychic pokemon I am.\"</i></span></div></div>",

You looked down at your flat belly, feeling it as it ached from a lack of nourishment. But, you weren't this hungry just a few seconds ago...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilting your head back up, you couldn't help but notice Draxius was waving his hands in strange waves, as they slowly made through softly through the air. Your heart began to pump heavily, while your stomach seemed to begin thinking for you. You felt starved of food, and your belly needed to be filled at that very moment! The Drowzee lazily grinned, accomplishing his spellbind. Then it finally hit you. He was controlling your body! And to your horror, you weren't the only he was affecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex stared deeply at his motioning hands as his tongue slipped out of his mouth to drip some of its drool to the floor. The Toxicroak turned towards you, croaking to itself as an audible gurgle echoed from his stomach. Before you could resist the urge for defense, Hex had already leaped at you, tackling you down against the tent flooring. After a deafening slam, he forcefully pinned his hands around your wrists, constraining them to cease their struggles. You look up at the hungry frog, seeing how he licked his salivating lips before he plunged them down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seized your muzzle inside of his croaking maw, swallowing in your head to be shrouded in the dank wet darkness. His tongue brushed under your growling chin, as your body helplessly flailed under his lean body. Finally, Draxius clapped his hands together, forcing Hex out of his hypnosis. \"That will be all for now, <i>Hex</i>. We don't want your friend to get <i>too far</i> down your throat before it's <i>too late</i>.\" The Drowzee said, while Hex was left to blink in confusion, unaware of what he had been doing. His pulled away, releasing your head from his jaws in a bridge of dribble to follow. He flicked the connecting strand away as you gag out his inner mouth fluids, crawling and kicking away from him. He blushed brightly as his brow lowered in disappointment. Shamefully, he raised a hand towards you, \"Oh, Lace...I...I'm sorry. I hadn't realized I was...eh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoughing out once more, you nudge his gesture away after assuring, \"Yeah, just stay a bit away from me...\" The Toxicroak glimmered a sympathetic expression as Draxius interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Hex, as you can see I'm not some simple psychic pokemon. I apologize for the sudden attack, however, please realize how much I was displeasured from your comment. I needed to show you what I could do...\" The Drowzee had both of his hands clasped together, as Gyro still remained sitting close by his master with his blank cold stare. Hex, distraught from his feral outburst slid a few inches from you, embarrassed and regretful. He finally answered, \"I didn't mean any offense. I was just wondering if you could be capable of doing such an...act.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxius rested back down upon his knees next to his Hypno apprentice at the table, sighing out, \"Well, although it is possible for me to control one's mind like this infection seems to have, I can admit that not even I can control hundreds of pokemon all at the same time for my bidding. Whoever this villain is, they are quite powerfully dangerous. I wouldn't want to meet this person, especially if my life depended on it. I do suspect, though, that this person might have help from others to perform this mass siege of domination.\" Your ears flicked up at the interesting theory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were curious enough to ask, \"Others may be involved?\" Draxius nodded, closing his eyes while tilting his hand at the back of wrist when he explained, \"I can sense certain 'static-like' signals from up north that are likely forcing the virus on pokemon. The strongest one is high up in the northern mountains that the other signals surround. My guess is that whoever, or whatever, you're searching for lies within those upper ridges of our island. However, the higher up you press on, the more infected are likely to attack you and your pack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp from his warning, until coughing out loud. Your mind felt a bit groggy, but you decided that it was just from your body recuperating from Draxius spell. The Hypno raised a brow as Hex stood up, bowing down in respect to the psychic. \"Thank you for the information and wisdom, Draxius. It was much of use for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was my pleasure, but Hex, I want you to promise you won't try to find trouble for yourself, if you know <i>what</i> I mean.\" Draxius told the Toxicroak. The anthro frog felt his cheeks glow a bit brighter as he rubbed the back of his head. He answered with a stammering voice, \"Oh! I would never try anything like that! Not especially since last time!\" They both chuckled to themselves as you were left out in the blue, not understanding what had happened of when they were talking about, but maybe Hex will tell you later. You had a mountain range to get to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxius and Gyro showed you out, as you found yourselves reunited with Gold and Jackal once more, and thankfully they didn't kill each other after you left them alone and unattended. Waving off, the original three of you set out, with Hex following close behind. You looked back at the Toxicroak, \"So are you finally going to keep up with us this time?\" Hex gave out a single shudder in response, finishing the sentence with, \"I recall having made it here first without you, and without my map. But yes, I plan on us having quite the <i>interesting adventure</i> here together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of you traveled down a dirt path, seeing the silhouettes of a mountain ridge, far off into the faded horizon. It was a long journey there, but you know you would make it there in no time, and you would be sure to be ready to stop the monster who started this mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>((Hex has joined your party!))</i></b></span></div></div>",

You try to ignore the pain, but Hex could clearly see that you were having a little trouble in keeping balance. Being at the front of the line, he walked a bit slower for Gold and Jackal to pass by, only to regain his speed once he was close to your side. Not wanting to cause any outbursts or problems, he spoke softly under his voice below the hearing ranges of the others, kindly asking, \"You don't seem like you're doing alright. What's the matter...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just thirsty. That's all.\" You lied to the Toxicroak. You didn't want everyone to slow down because of you, and you at least wanted to stop at a village or safe spot before you told anyone about your ill being. Hex quickly regained his composure and answered, \"You're probably dehydrated. Let's see if we can find a source of water for you.\" You nodded in agreement while keeping an eye out for a river or lake. Hex had kindly nudged Jackal and Gold to tell them about the entire situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter just a few minutes from your conversation, Gold luckily spotted a stream for you, and the four of you stopped an unpacked there. Jackal started a small fire to rest by as Gold gladly dove into the water, swirling through the water in complete bliss. The duck flipped over his back to rest on the surface of the water, floating in silence with closed eyes and a smirk along his beak. Hex sat across from Jackal, leaning against a small tree to catch a quick nap until you were ready to leave. You, at this point, cupped the cold rushing water into your hands to drink. Your neck throbbed at the cooling liquid when you continued to drink more and more of the water. However, your body was still signaling aches and pain, forcing you to lay down against your back, staring at the clouded blue sky for relaxation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your eyes closed, your ears picked up a peculiar sound, rippling out from the water. You figured that it was still Gold swimming around until you felt an odd snapping noise, with wet muscles clamping around your hind paws!

You quickly panic and exert several forceful kicks into its throat, and to your misfortune, the jelly-like substance sustained your pounding blows, doing nothing to aid in your freedom. As your hips sink in between its lips, you yell out to the others, warning them of the infected. Gold raised an eyelid to all of the commotion, and instantly widened his eyes recognized the danger. Dunking himself underwater, he jetted toward you at the stream's edge to help. Jackal stood up, distraught from the sudden outcry as Hex gasped in distress. Seeing how you were to be supported, you hope soon resides when the small tree behind Hex blinked open, reflecting a light lavender gaze from behind the Toxicroak!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bark out Hex's name, but the warning came too late when the Sudowoodo's branch arm forcefully swiped at him, slamming the tall anthro frog's spine to crash him into Jackal.

The amphibious duck leaped above the river surface and blasted a rapid jet of water to shove the devouring slug across the stream\u2019s edge, gagging your body out to release you! Your legs slipped out of its jelly-like jaws, while carrying strings of its saliva with them as they kicked up the ground to nudge your tail away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gastrodon plummeted into the muddy earth, smashing into the shallow watered gravel away from you to send wet pebbles to bolt in all directions. Relieved however scared, you fumble your limbs upon the forest ground to recover a full stance, striving to keep your entire wobbly balance upright. For whatever reason, your eyes still dragged down tiredly with your bones becoming more fragile. Hex was wrong about your dehydration. It was the venom of the Seviper\u2019s poison sting attack from yesterday that was the culprit! During your reflecting, Gold splashed out of the water, landing at the stream coast, yet breathing heavily in what seemed like vexation. His arms quivered within their tight grip to remain strong, as his legs buckled under his weight, showing like he pulled some muscles. Behind you was Hex and Jackal, fending off the Sudowoodo that took ferocious bites at the two anthros, chomping and gnashing its mouth in powerful brisk snaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tree-like infected stomped a leg down, erupting a groundbreaking earthquake through the forest flooring that unleashed launching dirt at the Typhlosion and Toxicroak. The two of them fell back, blinded by the debris that shrouded around them in a thick blanket of brown dust. The dusty clouds enveloped around to blur your vision from the entire attack. You staggered your way forward, rubbing the dirt from your eyes to regain full composure. With each slow footstep, your body dwelled deeper into the dust fumes, as your voice carried throughout, calling for Hex or Jackal. However, the gusting thin dirt caused your throat to convulse together, gagging at the dry stale air.

Together, the two of you backed away from the dust pouring crater, with Jackal\u2019s hand still pressed against your shoulder. He guided your mitigated frame to a tree as you limped your way to it. Balancing yourself against him, you sat yourself down to a mossy patch and watched him go back to towards the fight, approaching the Sudowoodo. Hex stumbled out of a pile of rubble, crawling out of the pile of dirt to spit some of it out. The Toxicroak supported his body atop his hands and knees, clearing his chest as he staggered up to an awkward nimble stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sudowoodo was surrounded by both sides. Jackal flared the mane of fire around his neck, enflaming the heat to flourish and dance at the back of his neck. Gray smoke puffed from his mouth in brumes of ash, as his own very eyes sensed the flaming ire of his rage. The infected anthro tree gulped and stepped back, only to stumble into a Toxicroak\u2019s grasp. Hex grappled his arms under the infected\u2019s arms, trapping it against his chest to squirm and thrash vigorously in an effort to escape the frog\u2019s clutches. The orange sac bubbled out from Hex\u2019s neck, as he happily croaked out an avaricious tone of hunger. The Sudowoodo\u2019s eyes swelled out in darkened dread as the wide lips expanded over its head, chomping the Toxicroak jaws together around the crested cranium to devour the infected pokemon head first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal ceased the ignited flames behind his neck, huffing to himself. Further away, you watched in a peculiar meddling way when observing the Sudowoodo\u2019s body leisurely make its way into Hex\u2019s bloated mouth. His cheeks puffed outward from having his mouth full, as his neck and chest throbbed a bulge to protrude out, rocking around in complete alarm. The Toxicroak\u2019s palms rested around the tree-morph\u2019s thin legs, as his knuckle claws leaked a transparent lavender liquid to exude out onto the bark-like skin of his prey. He had poisoned his victim into faint numbness, making his job all the more easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slim tree was slurped in like a thick noodle. Hex bit his flat teeth together after the thin stick-like legs plunged inward from one last ferocious swallow. The anthro purple frog gulped resoundingly, retaining the full pokemon with a boisterous belly to bounce out, nudging and wiggling in lazy shifts. Hex placed a clenched hand around his closed mouth, containing a belch that strived to explode out. However, his cheeks remained bloated and his face appeared to be drained of confidence, giving him an ill look. Looking to your left, Gold arched his back with a single arm holding up his laid out form. A light blue gut jiggled out while the duck dug a clawed finger around his beak, picking out any remaining jelly-like substance the Gastrodon had left. The infected slug stood no chance at escape, yet it continued its struggling endeavors for freedom of the tight organ sac until its last conscious breath exhaled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly pressured your legs against the ground, wincing at the stress your muscles were giving as you made your way up to stand. You wobble-stepped your way to Hex who was doing his best to calm his stomach down by pressing and kneading his hands through the tight round flab, groaning out in malaise. \u201cYou don\u2019t look so good, Hex. You looked happy and hungry when you were eating the infected pokemon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex scoffed out, \u201cI honestly dislike vore, though I do enjoy the tasting portion of the act, however the after-feeling of my stomach being swollen causes me to feel dreadfully sick. Being full is the discomfort that I cannot get over.\u201d The plump Toxicroak grumbled as he purposely fell onto his bum in the grass. He patted the curled up Sudowoodo from the outside, forcing it to pass out and end its writhing struggles. Although, Hex glared at you suddenly, giving you needles to prick at your back.</span></div></div>",

And back to your previous statement Jackal, I think you may be alright, but venom injected into you which could cause future problems. As for now though, it's not near as bad as poor Lace here. I think the poison sting hit something vital, like an artery so the toxin could travel much faster in him. Where is the bag of berries all of you had\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat damn Seviper ate it. They\u2019re all gone.\u201d Jackal grumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex raises a brow and inquires, \u201cInfected do not typically eat berries or natural food.\u201d Both you and Jackal peer your eyes over to the Golduck, who in turn jumps slightly from the wicked sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold's shoulders raise up closer to his neck as his tail wags awkwardly. \u201cI sort have\u2026might have\u2026thrown it at him.

We can hopefully find some aid for Lace there if the camp hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been overrun yet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He raised a brow towards Gold. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have you know that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t waste my time in masturbation <i>unlike some of us</i> who bother to do it right in front of others, especially right after they ate an infected. Honestly, how unfortunate of me to look over at you while you were eating that poor Gastrodon. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a buzz kill when it comes to any form of sexual tendencies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA red spark buzzed out from Gold\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forehead jewel, insinuating his anger from the comment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not trying to impress desperate men, <i>unlike some of us</i>.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You groaned in vexation in listening the two of the anthros argue over pointless topics. You were poisoned, weak, and slowly losing consciousness in your sickness, and needed medical help fast. Thankfully for you, Hex wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t one to hassle over useless topics, as he quickly ended the dispute with a flirtatious wink at Gold. The short Golduck grunted and wobbled eastward, moving his legs with a portion of difficulty from his expanded belly. The gay Toxicroak happily snickered to himself and placed a hand at your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow well can you walk? If you need anyone to carry you, just say so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He suggested. You gave a small smirk and walked forward, gesturing that you could keep your body up on your own. Hex gave a soft pat to your back and continued walking with the three of you, while a hand rested on his filled gut. You limped through a sandy dirt trail that stretched into the horizon with a small silhouette of a campsite in the background, signaling some kind of hope. Looking at Jackal, the Typhlosion certainly was beginning to feel the effects of the Seviper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Venom. His walking became more stressful to do, and he even had the occasional trip, missing his footing and stumble forward. He would always grunt out some vulgar response each time, after every slip up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a strange dead end to the thin road. The sandy trial transitioned into messy splotches, until finally disappearing into smudges and burnt spots scattered throughout the meadow. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLooks like there was a battle here\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hex said, investigating the damage to the land. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo my guess, it was between a fire type and a ground type.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Parts of the ground were torn up with deep cracks as smoldering soot covered pieces of plantation in the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, with the path destroyed, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have to cut through the tall grass of this savanna to get to the village in time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jackal advised. Everyone knew it was dangerous to go off-road into the wilderness, by reason of all of the infected that lurked in the uninhabited areas. Then again, being on a pathway lead you to be spotted in the open, causing you to be an easy target for attack. Nowhere seemed safe. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy traveling faster through this meadow, we can get there in a couple of hours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold whined bitterly to plop down on his bum, crossing his arms atop his belly in defiance. Gold hatefully answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh come on, like I could even run with this thing inside me. You can go ahead and get eaten in the tall grass; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be waiting here instead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jackal silently growled at the Golduck\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex knelt down next to the flustered duck, agreeing with him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cActually, I think our little fat friend is right on this one. Jackal, you should take Lace to the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat?! And let that dumb bird sit here on his lazy ass while I could be getting gang banged by a bunch of animals out there? You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got quite the nerve to\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Jackal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rant was interrupted by the calm Toxicroak, explaining, \u00e2\u0080\u009cListen Jackal, both Gold and I would only slow you down with our\u00e2\u0080\u00a6well\u00e2\u0080\u00a6<i>extra luggage</i>. Lace shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be held back because of us, and it would be best if you could take him there. He clearly can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make it on his own.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hex glanced worriedly to you. Your ears flipped back in shame for a response. Jackal snorted to himself until finally accepting the recommendation. The tall Toxicroak continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll wait for you right here later today whenever you return. In the mean time, Gold, you can help me travel back into the forest for some berry hunting, and with this, you can repay all of us from disposing of our medical bag.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold grumbled as he stood up, complaining out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather risk myself into being chomped up then be stranded alone with a seducing homosexual.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hex immediately grasped Gold\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulder, pulling the duck closer to his side to press against streak skin of his hips. Hex responded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNonsense! We could use the walk there as exercise to help us digest these infernal beasties. Now come quickly, <i>we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got work to do</i>.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Toxicroak sang out, as Gold dug his claws into the ground as he was unwillingly dragged away from you and Jackal. He whimpered as the frog took him into the dense forest.</span></div></div>",

It had been awhile since you and Jackal had departed from Hex and Gold, troubling you with the thought of something awful happening to them. An infected could easily chase down their belly-weighted bodies, and could probably outmatch their speed to force them into\u2026yikes\u2026you didn\u2019t enjoy to even think about the consequences of an infected capturing them. You tried to think positively and expect Hex was presumptively collecting food during which he would mockingly flirt with Gold, causing the duck to rant in an over-reactive tantrum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal kept the maroon pores on behind his neck extinguished, avoiding an accidental wildfire which would surely be a major dilemma to fix, especially since you both lacked the water type you left behind. The Typhlosion had taken the lead with his back turned to you, clearing an open path for you to stride through during your travel. Every now and then, you would either stumble because of a sudden jolt in the venom or almost trip over a twig or stone. He would look back just to be sure you weren\u2019t going to fall, and even kindly offered to let you lean against his side for balance if you really needed it. You assured Jackal you would be fine and that he was worrying too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour of this kind of venturing, Jackal broke the silence, \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t want to sound weird or anything\u2026but I guess I\u2019m sorry for the whole anger issue we had back at the hive. I might have let my ego get the best of me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scoffed at the apology, \u201cDon\u2019t be so naive. You just need to work on your anger management some.\u201d A few awkward quiet minutes drifted by, creating a weird chill around the two of you. Jackal slowed his walking speed, until finally, both of you stopped in place. He turned around, rubbing his arm oddly while he hesitated for the right words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal thankfully started off again, saying, \u201cI guess what I\u2019m trying to say is, I owe you twice for saving our skins, you know? We would\u2019ve been bug poop back there if you didn\u2019t rile me up, so I guess it\u2019s only fair that I keep going along with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eagerly grinned in interest before breaking out in a deep chuckle. Jackal stiffly waited for your response and reason for snickering to yourself. You finally blurted out the giggly feelings to reply, \u201cYou don\u2019t owe me anything. Remember the first infected we met together? I would\u2019ve been swallowed whole by that Ekans if you hadn\u2019t shown up to help me.\u201d You smirked at Jackal, and he reflected back the same assuring smile. \u201cWe cover each other\u2019s backs and that\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, there was a loud screech that squawked terribly close to you. The wind suddenly shifted, darting out in powerful forces that sent the tall grass, flaring in all directions. It flattened out when a bird pokemon flew above the two of you! Pink taloned legs landed close by on the debased turf, supporting a female avian to settle in a towering stance as her feather-like pink and yellow hair flowed in a long strand of glamor. Velvet eyes glimmered over her peach shaded beak, as they searched up and down your body, tempted to earn her piece. Both you and Jackal tensed at the piercing gaze she stabbed through your minds, as your chest could feel your heart beat against its ribcage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infected Pidgeot stood openly naked, adorning two feathered breasts to rest atop her flat stomach as they lowered down in a seductive hip frame that curved down her enticing legs. Jackal\u2019s hand pressed around your arm, trying to ease you back slowly from the bird as you watched her feet step through the grass. Her head occasionally bobbed to tilted sides when she strode closer to you, clearly interested in a scrumptious Lucario who looked too sick to put out much of a fight. Suddenly, Jackal popped a shot of fire at the Pidgeot, causing the bird to back away while the flames quickly scorched out in the air. She fumbled against the ground flooring to take flight with her wings. The sudden jolt of wind blew the tall grass in a frenzy once more as Jackal gripped your arm tighter to begin running in the other direction. The two of you bolted through the high thickets of grass and weeds within the field, having to skip over fallen logs, rocks, and even wind gusts of the pursuing Pidgeot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile in the frantic chase, Jackal\u2019s leg is caught by a vine, forcing him to the ground quickly as you skidded to a brief halt, looking back at your fallen friend. The Typhlosion, with his chest against the mossy dirt, stared back at the vine as it slowly snaked up his limb! Through the deep brush of the vegetation, a purple-eyed Bayleef poked its head out, smiling defiantly as it whipped out another plant tendril towards Jackal. Your running, plus the infected bird\u2019s attacks, were causing too much of a commotion to where other infected could hear. You and Jackal need to flee into hiding quickly in order to survive. However, before you can reach your friend for rescue, the Pidgeot landed in front of you, stepping closer and closer in agitated heavy steps, while her eyes glimmered annoyance in your evasion. Your body was fighting against you to be even able to withstand another battle with an infected, causing outcomes for you to seem quite grim.</span></div></div>",

This Pidgeot stood between you and your attacked friend, after just spending a reasonable conversation on protection. This bird was going down if it was the last thing you were going to do. You calmed yourself down, slowing your adrenaline when it began to develop its power. Aura began to fade around your arms, drifting to the wind of the prairie as the flames flickered out in a brief burst. The Pidgeot fanned out her wingspan, adorning her feathery limbs with a graceful lift. She bulleted forward, flying towards your placid position in a rapid dive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging a paw into the ground, you braced your body while flinging a powerful punch forward as the two of you collided into each other. Your fist struck her shoulder, as her beak scratched along your arm before knocking into you to fall over. You toppled down in a shriek of pain. The infected Pidgeot cried in terror as she fell on top of you. After hitting the ground, you held your wound while pushing against the Pidgeot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s body off from you as she trembled and flopped around in panic. Grasping around her neck, you pushed her head away from your face, but she held her grip with her wings upon your shoulders. She tossed and twitched around, but nothing would give. The infected would try the next best thing to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fight you, she could <i>seduce</i> you. She nudged her waist against your own, sliding her groin over your hidden sheath. You immediately gasped, involuntarily cherishing her alluring shoves across your crotch, which caused your discontented struggles to steadily debilitate away. It became more of a pain to ignore the pleasure than pushing the Pidgeot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s licking mouth away from your face. The puffed feathers around your forepaws felt somehow pleasant, and as for her breasts, they taunted your eyes while they bounced around in the infected bird\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggles. Your penis betrayed you, sprouting out of the loose sheath and began to thick out for a hard, stout size. Her nether-lips perched themselves atop the erect rod, marinating it with their leaking fluids. The Pidgeot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pre-cum burned its heat to your member, forcing your lust into submission by releasing your arms from her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile perked up at the edges of her beak, fully aware of your surrender to her sexual whims. Halting her groin rubs, she repositioned herself standing up, placing a leg by each of your sides to tower over you. Your blushed low eye-lidded face stared directly at her beautiful form, making you very uncomfortable in your impatience for non-treatment on your pulsating member. The infected Pidgeot licked her beak, lowering herself back down upon your shaft of meat to pierce between her vaginal lips. You barked at the sudden shift, shutting your eyes but relaxed back as she slowly slid it deep inside her. Your arms and legs twitched in stings of ecstasy, as she squeezed her thighs together, constricting your cock to throb inside the tight slick walls and forced your groan out. Jackal, meanwhile, was forced by the plant tentacles of the Bayleef to lie on top of his grass-type counterpart, grumbling as it tied his arms and legs down around the sides of the infected plant pokemon. The Bayleef had fixated the Typhlosion in a sixty-nine position, having his crotch and bum resting right in front of the horny infected\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face. His peach colored balls hung down in front of its mouth, beckoning the Bayleef to ride this Typhlosion to its limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt licked outward, jolting a surprised grunt from Jackal. The Bayleef\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cock rose up, poking Jackal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face in disgust. The plant-morph continued to make out with the Typhlosion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crotch, slurping its warm tongue around his sac, between his plump cheeks, and even inside his tailhole. With its back against the grassy flooring, it humped up into Jackal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s maw, stuffing his mouth with its manhood. Jackal gagged in muffled tones as it began to pump its meat inside his mouth, humping the member across his tongue and down his throat. The Bayleef pressed its tongue deep within his anus, smacking and slurping up his insides to cause poor Jackal to tremble in the sixty-nine rape course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to your dilemma, the Pidgeot hugged her wings around body, pressing her boisterous breasts over your chest while riding on top of your cock. She shoveled your dick up into her love tunnel. Her vagina spat out her clear heated juices across your waist, until finally, she reached her peak. She pulled her face away from yours, cawing out in passionate bliss to erupt out of her. You cummed your slimy contents into her pussy, squirting out your balls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 gift to her for all of her magnificent work, as you whimpered out from the warm explosion. Popping your knotted rod out, she let the thick white nectar drip down out of the crevices of her vagina. The mucky semen stranded down onto your satisfied crotch, collecting in small puddles to stick around your fur. The Pidgeot loomed her power over you, conveying her dominance upon your menial ejaculating body. She placed a taloned foot against the softening member, rubbing the cum spilled around it get a good sexual rouse out of you. Your body trembled at the scales rubbing into you sticky fur, growling out until she lifted her leg away to finish her meak prey. Humiliated and defeated, you braced yourself as her open beak came down around your hindpaws, scooping them inside her wet mouth while wrapping her tongue around them to pull them fully inward. The orgasm was too much for you to handle, and the Seviper venom took its toll on your strength. Before your eyes closed for the final time, you watched the stretching feathered cheeks of the Pidgeot take in your legs into her ever-salivating mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The infected Pidgeot finished her meal, gulping down the passed out Lucario\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head within her beak. Her bulges centered into the stomach, stretching her belly out in a soft dome to rest between her hips. She licked any remaining flavor off her mouth and spread her angelic wings to each end of her sides. She took flight, but a little less graceful with the added girth to her stomach. The bubble of flesh hung down below her, anchoring her down some as she struggled to find somewhere safe to perch for resting your digesting hide away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind the fluttering distant Pidgeot remained an infected male Bayleef, squeezing a Typhlosion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head in between its thighs to squish out the last of its hot seed into the fire-type\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mouth. The Typhlosion whimpered in muffled sobs, forced into drinking all of the sludgy white slime into his body as his crotch had been given a full unwilling bath. The Bayleef tossed the tuckered out pokemon away like useless garbage, turning around and satisfied with its pleasure. The fire pokemon crashed onto his back, groaning in the strange sensation he just encountered. His mouth spiddled out bubbling cum, while his unsatisfied groin dripped Bayleef drool. The Typhlosion, corrupted by his own lust, humped into the grass he laid on, gringing his throbbing cock through the cool soft ground until orgasming himself. The seed splattered all under the drained Typhlosion, staining his underbelly fur to become slick and clumped. He finally fell from hands and knees, splashing into his own puddle of cum, giving up any chance hope. He would become infected, and soon, the world.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Seviper venom was too much for your body to handle. Fighting would result in casual weak attacks from your aura, and the infected Pidgeot could easily overpower you afterwards. You quivered at the thought of how she captured and devoured you. An image of your black foot-paws slipping in between her vaginal folds flashed in your mind, picturing her feathered belly sagging out for her wings to rub. Your sheath thrummed at the thought, as the dirty part of your mind imagined her stroking her boobs together, tantalizing to the eye when she pleasured herself from her Lucario meal. You instantly shook the thought out of your head. Those thoughts are exactly what the Pidgeot wanted, and they would get you killed on accepting those terms. Running was the only good option. What you really needed was a cunning way to trick the infected avian in order to save your friend. You hoped Jackal could at least manage into not be eaten or forced into submission before you returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwirling to the side, you kick up your heels and bolt in a different direction. A scowl grew down on the Pidgeot\u2019s face while she watched you disappear into the tall grass. Pouncing up, she glided above the heightened brush, searching through the cluttered vegetation for her retreating prey. Seeing her shadow approaching, you dive under the grass, ripping some out and placing it over yourself. You hid, buried underneath the turf to watch her land close by. Under the grass pile, your vision was darkened except for a small peer hole shining in a bright stream of light. You peeked your eye through it, watching clawed pink bird feet step directly in front of it. Your heart shriveled back, as you held your breath, waiting for her to dig her beak through the grass to eat you. However, you could only hear sniffing, and her legs remained motionless. Looking up, you saw her head pointed up in the air, whiffing the air for your relatively close scent. She turned around, leaving her back facing you. This was your chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bound out from the grass, exerting a nimble leap toward the surprised Pidgeot to buckle down underneath you. You entrapped the avian by pressing her wings to their full span upon the flat landscape, using your weight to constrain her beneath you. Her body violently shook and thrashed in wild flings. She used her head to holler in distress and to peck at your evading head, almost stabbing you with her sharp beak. The downed feathered pennons lopped under your fore-paws as her legs kicked out to scratch you with her menacing talons. In a matter of desperation to stop her, you plunge your mouth down, encompassing her head inside your impressively stretching jaws. Your pack jaws strained over the size of her noggin, discovering in how difficult devouring a struggling victim could be. You couldn\u2019t understand on how infected ferals made it seem so simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeeding for a quick victory, you work your lips past her cawing neck to her shoulders, pinching her feathers against each of his sides. You swallowed toughly, gulping her contained upper body deep into your throat. Her feathered breasts squeezed inside your involuntarily watering mouth, much to your delight. Her wings fidget in a wild fritz, trembling within your clutches during the consumption of her bosom. You experimented with the weight of her tufted breasts by balancing them on your tongue, one teat at a time. You cupped your tongue under the soft domes, feeling their heat and flesh scooped inside your mouth to spread warm saliva through her feathers. The Pidgeot shivered in response as your tongue rubbed along their tips, nudging the nipples hidden through the soft downery. Her struggles loosened from the sexual rouse, which gave you the immediate opportunity to swallow the rest of her down. Her flat stomach slipped in, while you declined your head back in a steady motion to receive her body much more easily. Her waist nudges its way in, leaking out her lustful juices to slicken your mouth with its satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes rolled back as your hidden member panged with desire. Her scaled legs delivered themselves to you, gifting you their delicious flavor and texture during their declivity. They slide amongst your wet tongue, stretching your cheeks to bloat out as your neck and chest protruded. Her wiggling talons squirm for their last time in the open outside world, right before they\u2019re gobbled up and swallowed down. You heaved of breath of fresh air, sighing as your inner throat muscles work her struggling form into your stomach. You felt the expansion of your stomach stretch outward, exhibiting a fine yellow furred belly to glop in front of you. Your legs dithered in the feeling, and you took your hand-paws to wrap under the added weight, cradling the lovely bouncing globe. The infected Pidgeot thrashed inside, to the point of where you almost pitied the poor bird woman, thinking back that she used to be just like you until she had an untimely encounter of a feral to use her body. Your belly juggled in your small hug, giving you a good idea why infected love to eat whole struggling meals so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScorching fires sounded out in the background, while your nose twitched from the smell of smoke. You stumbled back through the grass in the direction you came from. Hopefully, Jackal was able to defeat the Bayleef, or at least stop it from infecting him\u2026</span></div></div>",

On all fours, the plant pokemon approached its captured prey, licking its chops when eyeing Jackal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s squirming body. Your stomach erupts a quite audible gurgle once your digestive juices began to work on the Pidgeot. The infected Bayleef quickly spins its head around from the loud sound, spotting a plump Lucario standing nearby. You angrily grunt to yourself as a vine shoots straight towards. Too fat and too poisoned, your body was easily captured within the coils of the plant tendril, encircling around your body for a tight constriction. You were unable to dodge the plant, consequently squeezed inside the Bayleef\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grasp to suffer for its amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mouth was muzzled up by his jaws being wrapped together, as tiny orange spores scattered over his body, causing the Typhlosion to tremble and shake before them. He was under the effects of the Bayleef\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stun spore attack! His eyes watered from the lack of his body response, forced into accepting the infected\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demands. You couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bear to see him in the emotional pain anymore, all up until the vine around you circled together painfully. You gagged at the tightening motion, while the tentacle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tip explored your writhing body. It slid its long side around your large belly, easing down towards your black legs to rouse them with gentle caresses. The spiraled tendril around the majority of your body began to ripple among your thin fur, guiding its coil to tug at your limbs. Finally, the nudging ceased and the vines dragged you fairly closer to the Bayleef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresented as offerings to the infected, the Bayleef\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tongue never broke away from licking its own mouth. You felt a loud clamp to sound out around you, as you looked down to see that the tendril\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tip had opened up into a small suction cup-like opening, sucking in\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your cock spasmed within the tentacle\u2019s tip. The vine\u2019s tip opening had enveloped your stout rod, squeezing your thick knot inside itself. Your entire body trembled under the surprising feeling, as Jackal was facing the same problem when his member had been snapped up into the vine\u2019s mouth. The Bayleef shook its tendrils which compelled the two of you to groan in unintentional enticement, while more vines emitted from its back. The extra tentacles coiled around your legs to lift them up, revealing your virgin pucker hole. Jackal wriggled within the tendrils\u2019 whirls, moaning as his ankles were tied separately to spread his legs wide apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis open bum was then defiled once a vine struck through his asshole. He growled within his tentacle muzzle, while more tears began to drip off his eyes. You whined as your felt a vine tip press at your own tailhole, nudging around your dark blue rim in light circles before pushing in with a brutal stab. Your legs jolted and then stretched downward as the appendage dug its way inside your rectum. You stretched them to their fullest extent from the sheer pleasure, wiggling your paws as your ears picked up Jackal\u2019s moaning from close by. The vine stopped, and the Bayleef began its cue. The plant tentacle head, cupped around your cock, began to pump it in slow gulping gestures. Its speed plunged your heated rod in powerful squeezes, squishing out strings of precum out of your tip. You cowered as the vine was literally milking your own dick, forcing all of your glistened spooge to spurt out inside of itself. Your Typhlosion companion suffered the exact same fate as his body had been dragged even closer to the Bayleef. The infected plant pokemon thrashed its tongue out to spread around Jackal\u2019s face, licking up his tears and muffled mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour anus numbed out from the constant pounds of your raping tendril, stretching out and pulsing with each hit. Your sac throbbed in appeasement, churning up a good batch of your cum ready to burst out. In response, you bucked your hips, blasting your boiling cum into the plant vine with a loud roar. Bulges bloated out from within the tentacle, traveling down into the Bayleef to squirt inside its belly. Its stomach received all of your slimy gifts in pudgy circles along the vine in a chain-like motion. Jackal shriveled his bound limbs together, whimpering after releasing his own orgasm into his cock absorbing tendril. The Bayleef murred as all of the hot seed spurted inside its belly, collecting a in a small white pool to broil inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter one last squirt, your seed (and energy) had been drained completely, leaving you as one vulnerable Lucario for this Bayleef to snack on. Your wrists and ankles could feel the tightening grip press around skin deeper, while a tendril violently tugged out of your ass, allowing a quick wincing grunt to emanate out of your mouth. Expecting for it to be all over, your head lowers down, signifying your defeat to await being sent inside the broth of semen swirling inside the Bayleef\u2019s underbelly. When all seemed lost, Jackal prevailed. The vines around Jackal\u2019s mouth began to glow a sickly orange with a powdery black outline to it, until finally, incinerating them into thin air! Flames bellowed out from his screaming jaws, covering and enveloping the plant tendrils around his body. The Bayleef spontaneously screeched in fear, stepping back as the tentacles around you quickly dropped your body mistakenly. The furious Typhlosion growled like a menacing monster, a sound you\u2019ve never heard from him before that sent your very soul to cringe with the Bayleef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal pounced to attack his grass counter-part, tumbling the Bayleef and himself to grind against the savanna in a mad sprawl. You staggered your heavy frame up, only to fall back down once again from your belly weight and poisoned body. You twitched in agony as your bones felt as if they were about to crumble away, as your organs throbbed inside in pulsating pain. You gagged out, finding it hard to keep the slightly wobbling Pidgeot inside your gut. You cracked an eye open to check on Jackal. Looking at him through a sideways-slanted point of view from the grass flooring, your moment of pain suddenly disappeared when your mind focused on one, peculiar thing. Jackal growled in a rouse, as his already satisfied cock began to wiggle back into an erection. It was still dripping small drops of cum. Jackal stood against the ground upon all fours, feeling bulges in his waist as his ass squeezed a Bayleef\u2019s head between his bulbous cheeks. Its long neck had been quickly slurped into his gaping hole, sliding inward like a funky noodle as its legs kicked and berated around the flooring. Jackal dug his claws into the dirt, gritting his fangs together as his anal meal was giving him quite the dirty treatment. His mane of fire blistered into infuriating spikes, as his legs bucked in small wavering humping motions. His belly began to grow in size as most of the infected plant pokemon entered his swallowing rim. He looked over to you, widening his gaze in embarrassment while his face flushed brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bayleef\u2019s hind quarters finally pressed inside the Typhlosion\u2019s rectum,  steadily making its way as a collection of bulges to travel into Jackal\u2019s stomach. His belly sagged outward, pressing against the prairie flooring to almost lift Jackal of his arms and legs! He instantly rolled onto his rump, letting the fat gut to expound out its greatness to the outside world. He pressed his hands to attempt to calm its grumbling and fumbling prey inside. His cock bounced against his girth, pulsating with the constant struggles that wiggled within the Typhlosion. Jackal gave you a quick glare, growling out, \u201cEverything that happened here\u2026<i>never happened</i>!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jackal trotted through the tall grass, pushing a pathway for himself in the planted brush involuntarily. His expanding belly was large enough to press out in front of him, parting the grass to separate between its girth. The Typhlosion\u2019s heavy steps crushed the underbrush beneath his hindpaws, cracking under such pressure. Jackal had a grin stretched along his muzzle, enjoying his recent and writhing meal inside his stomach. Out your entire group, Jackal seemed to be the one who enjoyed vore the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour legs stammer quite close behind the fat Typhlosion, attempting to sustain an equal balance between your poisoned muscles and sloshing gut weight. Your body wrenched in pain, and by the looks of it, you would be forced to stop and rest. Although, before you could even rasp out the words, your ankle gives out to tumble your body down to the earth. You fell against Jackal\u2019s back, while you wrapped your arms across his chest to keep you from falling any closer. But the force of the sudden impact jolted Jackal, as he was pulled back by your grasp from walking. His belly leaned against him and he began to teeter over. The both of you crash into the ground with a deafening <b>THWUMP</b>! The Typhlosion landed atop of you, crushing yet cushioning you in his belly fat. Your muffled and darkened surroundings shift around, as you could feel strange convulsions within the furry gut. It was the infected Bayleef, still curled up and wobbling inside the organ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut from all of the strange warmth, you kicked your legs out in distress that luckily hadn\u2019t been crushed by Jackal\u2019s body. Even this in turn hurt from the Seviper\u2019s venom. Jackal groaned and rolled himself off. The big lug released your body from underneath him as you struggled to get up. You were only able to get your hands to push before you fell back down, altogether drained. Jackal scooted himself over to lay next to you, asking, \u201c\u2026Lace? You okay? I didn\u2019t hurt you too bad right?\u201d You coughed as you rested against your back, staring at the sky. \u201cForget about t-that. It never happened, r-right?\u201d You quoted him from earlier. He scowled at you until you abruptly coughed again. \u201cI-I-I can\u2019t go\u2026any longer. I have to stop now\u2026\u201d Jackal worriedly looks at your frail body. Even your breathing was shallow throughout your motionless limbs. Jackal then scooped a hand under back, while his other arm picked your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold around my neck.\u201d He ordered you as his arms heaved your bloated mass up. He strained to lift you, but easily rested your back atop his belly. You did as he told you, wrapping your arms around his neck as he began to walk forward once more. You bounced with his movements on each step, as Jackal shuffled through the tall grass, the outline of the town just on the edge of hill in the distance. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Lace. We\u2019re nearly there\u2026\u201d The Typhlosion assured you. You gazed up at him, seeing him grit his teeth and grunt with agitated displeasure on some steps. The Seviper\u2019s poison was wearing him down too. His left arm struggled to keep your legs held up and folded around, while one of his legs stumbled every so often. He, too, suffered your physical discomfort, which amazed you in his confidence and drive to live. Out of the blue, a red blur zaps past Jackal, almost making you drop your body! He looked back seeing that an infected Scizor hovered above the tall grass behind him, giving off an evil purple glare. It eyed the two of you, finding that your bodies were not only fat and filling, but also weak and ready to eat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPre-cum leaked out the red bug\u2019s cunt, seeping down its shelled legs. The Scizor licked its mouth and bolted towards the both of you. Jackal growled, enflaming the mane on the back of his neck to jet out fire. The Scizor retreated from Jackal\u2019s back, looking for an opening. The Typhlosion stressed to continue running forward as the infected Scizor trailed him, licking its fanged lips while outstretching its claw hands. Launching forward, it buzzed over and caught Jackal by his ankles, timbering the fat fire-type to release you and fall face first into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis large belly pushed his limbs a bit up, causing him much difficulty to struggle. The Scizor happily hissed and lowered down to the downed Typhlosion, sticking out its tongue. It lapped at his back, digging into his short indigo fur, sliding up and down his spine. Its hand-claws clenched tightly around his legs to keep them in place as it fondled around them. Jackal whimpered as the female Scizor mounted on top of his body, placing her legs around his sides to begin sliding her bloomed folds along the ride. A trail of slick juices marinated the Typhlosion's backside, as the anthro bug leaned down to nibble along Jackal's throat. He shivered in response once the infected's abdomen rubbed upon his bum, seducing the fire-type to loosen up. You were a few meters away, watching from the ground as Jackal served no trouble to the Scizor\u2019s pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowling, you compress whatever energy you had, howling out a beam of aura from your mouth. The streaming blue energy struck the Scizor, blasting its body off of Jackal and into the wilderness. Jackal looked up, seeing you out of harm\u2019s way. Suddenly, your heart convulsed on you, dissipating in beats as your environment began to darken. Jackal barely managed to kneel up, limping over to you to grab your hand. Unable to carry you, he dragged you along the grass flooring, headed in the direction of the town. \u201c\u2026W-We\u2026we\u2019re almost t-there.\u201d He mentioned again. The two of your feeble frames exhaustingly approached the outskirts of the city, closing in on it for any form of hope.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Hex stared at the pond before him. The distant waters stretched flatly out to the trees and shoreline in the background. It was quiet, to the point where only the soft breeze fading past the Toxicroak\u2019s head emitted a whisper of sound. He inhaled the pond\u2019s scent, recognizing the distinct organic scent it gave off. Hex adored lakes. He reflected back to think of the days he would take Lilly out to a pond, where they would share a picnic together and swim in the water. Lilly always wanted to play with her older brother, begging with the same tone and face each time. And each time, Hex agreed and followed all of her rules for the game, and each time Lilly would win. Always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt reminded him of an early memory before the infection:<i> Hex trotted through the forest stream, splashing loudly knowing that his sister could hear him. The two frogs were playing another round of Hunt, a game similar to hide-and-seek. Lilly chose herself to be the predator, and it was her job to take down the prey, Hex. Hex continued pretending that he was unaware of the Croagunk\u2019s presence and slid behind a rock. He rested in knee-deep water, breathing loudly as he clenched his chest in complete exaggeration. He sighed out in a worriedly tone, \u201cThere\u2019s no way she could have kept up with me. I think I lost her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThink again\u2026!\u201d A female girl\u2019s voice yelled out. Hex opened fearful eyes to glare above his head, only to watch as the silhouette of a Croagunk hop off a branch of a tall tree to plummet towards him. He held up his hands in aguish as Lilly crashed down on top of the Toxicroak, gripping around his shoulders. Hex struggled and played around by wobbling his body in twists and turns. Lilly laughed as she began to playfully nibble on his shoulder, growling like a monster. Hex chuckled along with her, as he purposely threw himself off balance, landing on his back. He laid out on the shoreline of the creek, as Lilly walked on all fours over to her fallen brother. She roared and began to eat Hex, gnashing her teeth at his chest and arms for the Toxicroak to cry out, \u201cNo! Don\u2019t eat me! Please\u2026!\u201d Lilly responded by licking her lips while smiling, before she suddenly jumped on top of him and nibbled his neck. He gagged out in distress, yelling, \u201cNoooooo! *Bleh*\u201d He tilted his head back and closed his eyes, pretending to be dead and defeated. He even let his tongue hang out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly laughed and hugged her brother, \u201cAw. Too bad you lost again.\u201d She comforted Hex with a sweet tone. He lifted his head back up and stared deep into his sister\u2019s eyes. He responded, \u201cDarn, I thought I was going to get away this time too. Maybe I\u2019ll be a bit better at it the next time we play Hunt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly then pressed her face against her older brother\u2019s chest, nuzzling her body into his. Her arms wrapped around the Toxicroak\u2019s neck and hugged him deeply while smiling. On the stream shoreline, Hex rested his chin atop her head, as he returned the cuddle with his own hug. The two frogs had lain under the canopy of trees for long derived moments with closed eyes. Hex clenched his sister tight, listening and feeling her soft breathing, including the beating of her precious heart. Lilly spoke up, and Hex felt the shuffling movements under his jaw, \u201cHex\u2026Can we come back to the lake again tomorrow?\u201d Hex hugged her sister tighter to himself, whispering, \u201cOf course we can.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex dropped the memory to look down at his empty hands. Staring at his palms, he wondered if he would ever get to hold his sister again. Gold\u2019s snide voice instantly severed the Toxicroak\u2019s deep thoughts, grumbling out, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your hands? No asses around to grope, homo?\u201d The insult hurt, but Hex would let it slide. After all, he expected Gold\u2019s unnecessarily rude behavior to be extra agitated today, just because throughout Hex\u2019s entire walk the Golduck had complained the all way there. He scowled through most of the trip and any conversation starters Hex pitched out were immediately shot down after Gold would sneer the Toxicroak\u2019s orientation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold leaned his back pressure against the trunk of a tree, resting his hands around his sagging stomach. He stroked and comforted the light blue sphere, kneading through it as it had digested most of the Gastrodon due to the long walk. His clawed-webbed hands scratched across the front of his gut to feel an extra small layer of pudge to develop inside. Hex, too, lost a good deal of weight, for the infected Sudowoodo had broken down and transformed into a thick, soupy texture to stew inside the Toxicroak\u2019s stomach. A bit of belly fat still poked out of the Toxicroak's midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex reacted to Gold\u2019s insult by placing his hands around his own firm ass, rubbing along the plump cheeks. He answered sarcastically, \u201cI can never satisfy the touchy needs of my hands. It\u2019s utterly humiliating to deal with every day. They are an evil force that must be stopped!\u201d The Golduck huffed and looked away from Hex\u2019s rump pleasure while forcing himself off the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to go for a swim. I\u2019m warning you though, frog. If I catch you peeping at my body just once, I won\u2019t think twice before adding you to the Gastrodon\u2019s similar demise\u2026\u201d Gold hissed through his beak. And with that comment, he turned and stepped into the lake, walking through the water until it came up to his neck. Hex was very eager to completely disobey Gold and torture the amphibious duck. The Toxicroak snickered mischievously as dark thoughts swirled through his brain. He could sneak up on the Golduck underwater, pinning his underside as he stroked the bird\u2019s legs and tail. He could plant his mouth along Gold\u2019s crotch, giving the Golduck an unhappy submerged surprise. He could wrap an arm around the duck\u2019s neck to keep him still as the Toxicroak could use his other hand to stroke and feel Gold\u2019s belly. Hex decided against it. It would only make Hex\u2019s life worse for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex walked into the lake all the way up to have the surface of the water around his waist. The Toxicroak began to splash water on himself, bathing his body by stroking his arms and back far from Gold\u2019s spot in the pond. Water dripped off of the frog\u2019s purple skin, as he softly rubbed his fingertips along the amphibious, squishy texture of his flesh\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hex\u2019s eyes widened as he twisted his body to the voice\u2019s direction, having his arms crossed upon his chest to hold his shoulders. At the coast of the lake stood a Heracross, resting his rear on top of a fallen tree. The blue beetle sported golden eyes, just like Hex, and adorned his bug-like shelling masculinity. The beetle smiled at the alarmed Toxicroak, as he cocked his head to say seductively, \u201cOh, please don\u2019t stop the show already. It was just getting to the best part!\u201d Hex could feel the heat erupt in his face yet he attempted to keep his calm. Whoever this was, he certainly seemed interested in the Toxicroak, which Hex would of course feel flattered and creeped out by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want a show, then you can go ahead and find some other Toxicroak who is willing to give a free dance. I charge quite the amount for one to see my expertise.\u201d Hex replied. The Heracross smirked wider as he stepped off the log to walk up to the shoreline. He flirted again, \u201cI\u2019d pay a lot just to see that again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex blushed and began to step out of the shallows of the lake. As he approached the bug, he noticed twitching rod wiggling between the Heracross's legs. The Toxicroak\u2019s sheath practically screamed at the sight of its size. \u201cWell, you must be one man who is easily impressed.\u201d Hex raised a hand to the Heracross, \u201cMy name is Hex, a professional dancer.\u201d Hex joked out. But the beetle clasped both of his hands around Hex\u2019s single open hand, guiding the anthro frog closer to him. He stroked along Hex\u2019s arm to stop at the side of the Toxicroak\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Heracross introduced himself, \u201cRune, an impressed admirer.\u201d The bug\u2019s clawed hand rubbed his thumb finger along Hex\u2019s face. Hex deeply blushed again from the compliment and smiled brightly. Rune continued, \u201cYou know, this admirer has been waiting quite some time for a hot item like you to come around. As a professional, Mr. Hex, you must suffer from crowds of your fans that would give an arm just for some one-on-one time with you. Think of the stress of it all! How about I pay my fee for your show by loosening up some of your\u2026tension?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex was at a loss of words. He couldn\u2019t keep eye contact with Rune, yet the Heracross locked his gaze into Hex. Rune was just as tall as the purple frog, physically pertaining a somewhat straight and less narrow build, but Hex admitted that he felt a little intimidated by the beetle\u2019s power. He wasn\u2019t one to typically be attracted to bugs; however Rune changed all of that in just a moment. Even though Hex was deeply infatuated by the Heracross, he could still feel a hint of fear from Rune\u2019s advances. Gold, from afar, sat almost fully submerged in the water. The surface of the lake rose over his beak to the point where only his eyes and the top of his head remained overwater. Opening his lids, he noticed a Heracross standing in front of Hex, caressing the frog\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquinting, he was certain that the beetle wasn\u2019t infected due to its yellow eyes, but he couldn\u2019t help but feel a little anxious in what he wanted. The two lovers were too far away for Gold to hear the conversation take place. Like he cared. The Golduck noticed the erection growing from the Toxicroak\u2019s crotch, automatically signaling Gold of what they were talking so much about. That really grinded his gears. It made his negative feelings and stereotypes towards Hex seem even truer, and the Golduck would be sure to let Hex feel guilty for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRune nudged his groin against Hex, streaking his meat against the wet skin of Hex\u2019s calves. The Toxicroak shuddered under the Heracross\u2019s warmth. Rune\u2019s genitals brushed along Hex\u2019s legs to force another enticed murr from the frog. Hex\u2019s orange chin sac croaked madly, as sweat began to bead up through his pores. The blue beetle rose a brow while asking, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s ditch that duck friend of yours and head into a private place of mine. I\u2019ll make it worth your while\u2026\u201d Hex couldn\u2019t control his libido anymore. Hex took Rune\u2019s hands into his, looking over to Gold in the distance of the water. As he had feared, the Golduck had spotted him with Rune and would likely know Rune\u2019s intentions. Hex couldn\u2019t say no the Heracross\u2019s offer though. His horny mind circled around in agony, begging to be taken with this somehow attractive beetle. \u201cUm\u2026Gold!\u201d Hex called out to him, \u201c\u2026I\u2019ll be right back! I need to talk to my friend here\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the distance, Gold rolled his eyes. He yelled back, \u201cDon\u2019t bother coming back! If a butt humper is what you wanted, then you should go find an infected instead. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll like a sex whore, you desperate slut!\u201d Hex\u2019s heart shriveled. His eyes stared at the Golduck, slightly lowering as they began to tear up. That last comment\u2026that hurt. The Toxicroak\u2019s infatuated smile lowered down to a distraught frown, as Hex tried to find the right words to respond. He couldn\u2019t though, and he grasped Rune\u2019s hands even tighter. He tugged the Heracross to show him the way, and Rune happily obliged. Gold watched as the two gay anthros made their way back into the forest, out of sight. But before Hex disappeared behind the tree line, Gold was positive he saw a tear sliver down his cheek.</span></div></div>",

He wiped away the tear that had been pestering him the entire trip to Rune\u00e2\u0080\u0099s secluded spot. Footsteps approached Hex, and the Toxicroak looked up to his temporary partner. Rune let his sizable rod point out to the frog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, as he twitched it to poke Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cheek. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, now\u00e2\u0080\u00a6Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let that Golduck spoil our fun too. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be very pleased anyways with you as my little slut.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hex suddenly knew something was off. Rune had become much more dominant now, as his face gleamed of the eyes of a hunter. A clawed hand grasped the crest upon Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head, and yanked the frog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head closer to Rune\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mighty cock. The pole of girth jabbed into Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right cheek, squishing it outward as Rune began to growl out in arousement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blushed face writhed within the Heracross\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clutch, but quickly began to accept his whims and die in struggles. Hex lowered his eyelids halfway, as the tip of his tongue lazily sat at the crevice of his lips. He could care less who was in charge of who; all that mattered to the frog was relieving his mad desires with this surprisingly sexy creature that so willingly gave him his manhood. Yet, something held him back. Gold\u00e2\u0080\u0099s snide comments still hovered around the Toxicroak\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feelings, and their sting still burned his esteem. Rune began to frown, as he continued waiting for Hex to pleasure his master. The Heracross even poked his cock at Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lips and tongue tip, but the frog only continued to stare at the shaft, watching it throb in place as he continued to think about his actions. Rune wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother waiting for someone so incompliant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlright <i>whore</i>, let me make things easier for you. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to suck my dick until you basically <i>drown</i> in my cum, or I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be sure to give you something far worse than that. Do I need to remind you of a little inspiration\u00e2\u0080\u00a6?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rune hatefully said. He reached his other hand down, gripping his claws around Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cock. Hex croaked out soft whimpers of ecstasy, as the bug pummeled his cock with a powerful hand-job. Hex knew that having intercourse with Rune would probably be an unwise decision, but his dirty thoughts started to cloud sanity, confusing the frog of what to do. Pre-cum began to squirt out of his amphibian prick, lubricating Rune\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fist for a much more pleasurable ride. The Toxicroak found himself begin to moan, as he wrapped his hands on Rune\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulders just to brace himself in his wild jerking motions. Rune spoke out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow is my frog slut ready to serve me\u00e2\u0080\u00a6? If you still act disobedient, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to forcedly rape you and devour your cum-filled body like the worthless meat you are.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A tongue licked through his mandibles as sweat started to drip off Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nude body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex was at a mental tug-of-war match. He could either accept Rune\u00e2\u0080\u0099s demands and probably end up passed out in the middle of some unknown forest, leaking pools of bug sperm to squish out of his ass crack for any infected to stumble upon for an easy meal, or try and resist, which may end the frog in the same place except in Rune\u00e2\u0080\u0099 belly. Hex sobbed as his balls tensed up, blasting his own orgasm onto his chest and chin-sac. The hot white slime seeped and splattered across his body, forcing the Toxicroak to cry out in heavy breaths. Rune\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand tightened his grip on Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard cock, as the frog finally made his decision\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</span></div></div>",

This Heracross, as beautiful and tempting as he is, was still completely untrustworthy. The Toxicroak\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sanity eventually returned, forcing him to realize the danger at hand. Hex saw directly through Rune\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan once he gazed into the beetle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deviant golden eyes. What was once seen as a passionate yellow transformed into an evil flame, burning with greed and hatred. Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body is all Rune wanted, for a sex toy and as a plausible meal for this enraged bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthro frog shoved Rune off immediately; pushing the Heracross several feet away to descend onto its backside while the Toxicroak bolted up with his best effort. Hex heavily croaked out, straining to keep a stable stance from his sudden handjob orgasm. The remainder of the semen dripped from his cock\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head to spill out into the grass below him, involuntarily getting a sudden shudder to tremble down Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hind quarters. Rune buzzed his small flat wings at an audible and violent pace, using the terrifying sound to intimidate the incompliant frog before him. Hex gulped and got into a fighting position, while tensing his muscles and hands for whatever Rune may throw at him. The frog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reaction speed consequently failed once the Heracross sprouted forward at blinding speeds, using the hooked crest atop the beetle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head to jab around Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s undefended neck. Hex gagged out as he was dragged by the forceful head-butt, crashing his back into a tree. His throat sac cackled at the pain, as Rune pressured more power against the pinned Toxicroak to watch the anthro amphibian writhe and choke from the compression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing ceased from Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lungs, and his limbs twitched from ended blood flow. He was slowly dying. Rune\u00e2\u0080\u0099s menacing smile stretched out to the sides of his head, cherishing his victim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strives to live. After watching Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes roll back into his head, he released his head crest, dropping the Toxicroak to land on his rump roughly at the base of the tree, inhaling violently. Hex fluttered his eyes to focus again, just for Rune to slam his leg into the Toxicroak\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abdomen. Jabbed into his paunch that still contained a mostly digested Sudowoodo, Hex winced and fell over upon his head and knees, gagging and sobbing. Rune instantly lowered down to rest atop his bum, opening his legs wide for his unsatisfied member to throb once more. The dominant Heracross scorned, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou stupid, stupid, stupid frog. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve given me more reason just to kill you, and I guarantee it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be as enjoyable for what I had intended. When I say you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll suck my cock\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rune\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words trailed off as he forcibly grabbed the back of Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head, jamming it against his musky prick as he yelled, \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u00a6<i>you fuckin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 swallow the cock</i>!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust there and then, The Toxicroak watched the urethra open up, parting its vertical lips apart as the member began to grow at an alerting speed. The Toxicroak attempted to push away and resist the beckoning cock tip, but his recently sustained wounds ended his struggles. Hex whimpered a sorrowful croaking tone, once the hot flesh encased his inside, worming up his body like a snake and its meal. He knew exactly what happened to those cock vored, and from the position he was in, death was inevitable. He closed his eyes within the dark pink walls surrounded him, all the while his form slowly slid into the massive fleshy rod, drenching his sweating body with its squirting pre-cum. The hefty cock outstretched to take in his aching torso and entrapped arms, bulging a round lump to scoot down the impressive length<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRune cackled as he massaged his devouring prick, snickering out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMmmmmm\u00e2\u0080\u00a6you know what slut? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a little grateful you decided on resisting. Taking your body down through my dick feels way better than it fuckin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 your frog ass.

Tears beaded at his shut eyes, leaking out inside the absorbing penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d The defeated Toxicroak thought. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRune is right and Gold is right about me too.

Well, Hex, this is what you wanted, right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hex continued to sneer and insult himself through his demolishing guilt, as his loud sobs echoed inside the long gulping tunnel for Rune\u00e2\u0080\u0099s delight. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI-I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m nothing more\u00e2\u0080\u00a6but a t-t-tool\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Toxicroak\u00e2\u0080\u0099s waist descended, along with his hopes.</span></div></div>",

His taloned feet made sluggish stomps throughout the wet dirt, splattering over his newly washed, wet dripping legs. He plopped down against the grass to stare at the lake, pondering on the recent events of his last conversation with Hex. He actually felt...guilty. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDumb homo\u00e2\u0080\u00a6He just had to go and shoot his ass out so fast. I hope he gets the bad end of the deal, ending up being banged by some infected with that dumb bug. Hell, he can get gulped and digested to the thing for all I care\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gold muttered out loud. He truly didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean it however. The Golduck somewhere deep inside him and past his arrogant personality rested a connection to Hex. After Gold had witnessed the teamwork you and Jackal presented through a grudge during the Seviper attack, it was revealed to him that there was still hope within non infected pokemon. Left alone with the deep maple woods, Hex was the only person Gold could rely on, and the duck clearly could have Hex as a companion to survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn orange leaf broke off a branch hovering over Gold, and the leaflet floated down towards him, unaware of its presence. It softly landed against his forehead, balancing at the tip end of his red jewel. The water type crossed his eyes to stare into the carrot-colored blur canopying over his face. With a brief huff of air, he forced the leaf to swish off his head. Coincidentally, the wind kicked in, blowing the leaf to smack Gold right in the face, forcing the duck to quack in surprise and charge his jewel by accident. It sparked as the Golduck forced the energy out too powerfully. A small red explosion spackled out, sending soot to smear the entire upper body of Gold and causing him to panic wildly. He hurtfully rubbed and swiped the grey dust off, coughing in the little clouds of smoke. Just then, his ankle tripped over a small rock hidden within the murky coast, tumbling the poor duck to slam into the water face first. He spurted from the pond\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surface to march out of the water and back onto land, arriving at the half-burned leaf. He raised a foot to stomp it, eager to destroy the pesky puny thing, until his rage began to clear away. He lowered his leg slowly back down away from the leaf. The Golduck nudged a talon against the leaflet, poking it a few inches along the ground to reveal that there was a sharp rock hidden beneath it. If Gold had stomped his leg down, he would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ended up with another painful result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cheeks blushed when he remembered his frustration with Hex, and he gripped his head tightly to flail it around and scream in anger. He growled and trudged into the forest from the Heracross\u00e2\u0080\u0099 position, mumbling quite the amount of vulgar words to reach Hex once more. He was done with this forest, and contemplating whether or not to apologize to the Toxicroak. He hissed through his beak, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I find that frog, I swear I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d His sentence disappeared. He had let go of his anger for the time being. For once, he put himself in Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spot and wondered what it would feel like to live in a world where you today could easily be your last,  your family is lost, you are looked down upon and insulted for who you are, and a stranger lends a hand for a moment of comfort\u00e2\u0080\u00a6<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold stopped dead in his tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gulped solemnly out aloud, finally coming to understand why Hex randomly decided to go with the Heracross. It was to be the only part of him that was left from this life. Gold was able to gain his walking speed again, fearing his actions again and prepared for a depressed, sad sight for the Toxicroak. Although, Gold pushed away a low branch, only to find something far dear worst for Hex\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</span></div></div>",

The Heracross sat far in front of him, resting against his rump with closed eyes and a joyful expression shining from his face. Lowering the Golduck\u2019s eyesight, the duck\u2019s gaze was fixed on something else entirely. A pair of Toxicroak feet wriggled in between the urethra of a colossal penis, erecting out of the Heracross as a stout bulge sprouting from its sides shifted and bounced inside. Even the beetle\u2019s sac had expanded to an alienated proportion, vaporing its essence to drift past Gold\u2019s small beak nostrils. A sick, swirling motion began to rumble in his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frog footpaws eventually disappeared behind the gulping-like lips, enveloping Hex\u2019s entire body to slide down into the musky genitals waiting to imprison him. To Hex\u2019s point of view, he felt a pucker open and tunnel him downward into a small, compacted container, with slick mushy walls squeezing and massaging his form. He instantly curled himself up within the orb, which Hex was definitely aware of where he was now. A pool of white slime began to rise within the ovular organ, sinking his body in the boiling cum up to his shoulders. The Toxicroak softly croaked to himself, as the thick goo began to work around his body, weakening him to transform his body into itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the outside world, Gold gawked at the large ball sac wobble around the new lump stretching inside. The Heracross moaned in painful bliss, falling against his back to cry aloud from the overflowing pleasure that tensed in the sensation. The Golduck shook away the disturbing sight and stepped up to cock voring beetle. The bug\u2019s eyes still remained closed, as his massive prick pointed directly towards the sky, throbbing and ejecting out fat globs of pre to splat around the grassy ground. Gold knew Hex was unable to escape, and his time was running short. The only way to force the Toxicroak out was to\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold didn\u2019t even dare to continue, but he realized that he was Hex\u2019s only way to survive. He scowled and hatefully swore, \u201c\u2026That frog better become my personal and eternal butler if I do this for him\u2026\u201d He approached closer to the twitching cock, feeling its body heat ray its warmth to Gold\u2019s body. The duck trembled under the heat, and gulped a heavy load down his throat. Ever so slowly, he reached out to the large shaft, lightly placing his hands on the sticky flesh. He tensed up after feeling it wobble at his touch, and he definitely would dread what was about to occur next. He began to stroke the pole of flesh, masturbating it tense up in satisfying enticement. The only way to free Hex, was to <i>ejaculate</i> him out before he was digested into cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold looked over to his apparent handjob victim, seeing how the Heracross remained into his own horny dream state, not even noticing Gold\u2019s doing. The duck gagged out in displeasure, while he hugged his arms around the sweltering penis, bouncing up and down to hurry the process up. The large blue ball sac resting under the thriving prick swirled and churned cum inside, and Gold was unable to know if Hex was still even alive or a pool of semen. The Golduck braced himself and opened his mouth, sticking his tongue towards the wall of meat. He cried out in his mind, \u201c\u2026That frog better freakin\u2019 worship me after this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe resentfully brushed his tongue along the lengthened cock, choking at its powerful taste. The massive shaft instantly froze, heating up at the speed of the moment. This was it. Gold looked up to see the urethra spit out\u2026</span></div></div>",

Gold felt slightly comforted to see his, \"friend\", survive, but in turn felt incredibly grossed out seeing Hex's face slathered in the Heracross' cum. The bulge within the mighty prick continued to push upward, pushing out a small portion of Hex's body one nudge at a time, while Rune cried madly out loud. His orgasm was clogged inside the ever-stretching member due to the frog body covering its end. His shut eyelids squeezed even tighter together as his legs kicked out in a painful, yet ecstatic rampage. Gold, now mortified, released the stick pole of meat to back away, gazing at the bubbling bulge forming in the cock's center. The semen collected together, pursuing upward to force Hex's body to shoot out of the urethra. The pressure blasted the Toxicroak at a tremendous force, reacting with a massive white slime explosion to shoot out from under the tossed frog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex landed atop his back on the ground, shrieking at the brief pain of the crash. The Golduck quickly rushed over to the fallen anthro, gripping his arm to pull Hex back onto his feet. \"C'mon ya <i>idiot</i>! We're bolting from that <i>freak</i>!\" Gold yelled to the distraught Toxicroak. Hex's eyes were still half closed, as groans still throbbed out from his throat sac. Gold growled and gripped his clawed hand even tighter on the frog's arm, yanking the semen covered Toxicroak to follow him as he dashed through the woods. As Gold ran deeper into the forest, with Hex weakly stammering behind, he listened to the echoed shouts of the Heracross off in the distant background, as the beetle's orgasm continued to blast out the thick pale ropes of his seed around.</span></div></div>",

Behind them, a pair of amphibious hindpaws weakly stammer to even follow along. Rain lightly sprinkled along the ground and canopies around the hurrying anthros. Gold couldn\u2019t remember how long they had been running. The sky, what was once an orange sunset, had grown jet black with rain clouds to blanket the star speckled sky, smothering the moon of its glow. Darkness shrouded the dampened woods, as Gold listened to the distant roars of thunder rumble in the horizon. They needed shelter, and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Gold also heard an audible splash erupt behind him. Dirty water drenched his backside, forcing the duck to burrow his heels into the ground for a brief halt. He spun around, sending a miniscule amount of energy to create a light to his forehead jewel so it wouldn\u2019t overload another blast due to the crack you had dented into it. The Golduck\u2019s red light revealed Hex, lying against the mud while croaking a helpless, woeful tone. Exhausted and emotionally destroyed, he wallowed within his tripped state. Gold rolled his eyes and demanded, \u201cGive me a break, ya big baby. Get up or I leave you here in the middle of the storm.\u201d However, the Toxicroak didn\u2019t budge, and remained to sobbing in his own anguish. Gold looked over the Toxicroak\u2019s body to witness scattered bruises and crease marks the Heracross\u2019 brutal hands made, as sharp tingles began trickling down his spine from the sight. Gold blamed the cold wind for the sudden wince. He held back his temper to realize the horrible trauma Hex was experiencing, figuring that he would have to drag the distraught frog away into solitude. Sighing loudly, he reached his hands out to the Toxicroak, lifting Hex up back to his feet. Gold ventured deeper into the woods while Hex slowly trailed behind, continuing to croak in sorrow as his weak fingers hooked around Gold\u2019s guiding hands. At last, the Golduck noticed a large nook opening at the basin of a sturdy tree which would act as a perfect cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold led his depressed companion into the small hole from the rain, as the two curled up within the small confined shelter. The ominous gap within the tree\u2019s underside worked as a small muddy burrow, while rainwater occasionally dripped inside for a knee-deep puddle and thick roots held the muddy walls back. Hex cried out, \u201c\u2026G-Gold\u2026you were right about me. I am\u2026desperate.\u201d The duck turned to look at the frog, watching Hex\u2019s head droop down as he rubbed his arms together. He kept his agony up, \u201c\u2026I am ashamed of who I have become. Just look at me.\u201d He opened his body up, revealing all of the mud, wounds, and beetle cum covering his trembling body. Even to Gold, the duck was embraced with a sense of pity, feeling the distress the Toxicroak was explaining; although he endeavored the best he could to hide behind his grumpy behavior. The quivering croaks continued, \u201cI\u2019m <i>disgusting</i>. I\u2019m a filthy slut who deprives himself the joys of life with h-his perverted s-s-sick desires\u2026sniff\u2026y-you were right about me all this time, and I h-have been a fool to not see it. Lilly would be ashamed of this\u2026this\u2026monster that you see here. U-ugh\u2026even Lace and Jackal would look down on me once they witnessed everything that happened this evening. I am a fool. A fool you should have to die by t-that v-v-vile Heracross\u2026\u201d He cringed closer down, screaming in misery after pouring his heart out. Gold, silent throughout the entire dilemma, stared in horror at the Sobbing Toxicroak. He never would\u2019ve expected something like this to break out of Hex. Once gulping down a tough swallow, Gold cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Uh\u2026You know\u2026I\u2019m actually the wrong one.\u201d The Golduck softly uttered, hopefully to comfort the Toxicroak\u2019s dissipating sobs. Gold had caught the frog\u2019s attention, as Hex\u2019s face slowly raised out of his cupped hands to stare deeply at the Golduck nuzzled up a few inches away. His golden, tear-filled eyes gazed at Gold, as his mouth barely managed to ask, \u201c\u2026W-what\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duck cleared his throat a second time, stressing out for the right words to say. \u201c\u2026Well, uh\u2026You deserve an apology. Watching that happy charm you always kept, and that optimistic point on life\u2026I loathed it. I hated it, because I-I didn\u2019t have it and\u2026\u201d Gold trailed off, tapping his claw tips together awkwardly while listening to the muffled patter of the rain. The ambient taps on the wood never ceased to distract him or make the situation any less weird. He dared a brisk look at Hex for the moment, catching his eye that the Toxicroak\u2019s sobs and sniffs had ended, as the frog rubbed the droplets from his glowing cheeks away. The yellow eyes never blinked, as their stare froze against the duck like concrete. Gold returned to his sentence. \u201cA-and\u2026and\u2026this infection has taken a toll on us. On everybody. So it isn\u2019t your fault for just wanting someone\u2026especially what you\u2019ve been through with your sister and all. Besides, your sister would probably want that for you anyways. I\u2019ve never had the ch-chance to, uh, meet her but she sounds nice. Oh, and as for Lace and Jackal, you can forget about them hating you. If it\u2019s anyone they hate, it\u2019s me. I only seem to cause trouble for them. So, you have no reason to hate yourself, especially after what I\u2019ve been doing to you, so uh\u2026What I\u2019m saying is that\u2026I\u2019m\u2026<i>sorry</i>\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

They tugged him much closer to Hex, cuddling the duck deeply into the wet frog body slathered in various liquids. Gold\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face was enveloped by the orange throat sac, causing it to stretch around and bloat like a balloon as it croaked wildly. Hex was purring, smiling slightly with closed drenched eyes. His sobs were replaced with a noticeable purr, croaking softly as the frog nudged his warmth over Gold. The duck attempted to push Hex, but to no prevail. He was stuck against the slippery amphibian whether he liked it or not. Gold, praying to be released, suppressedly spoke through the croaking sac, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOkay, okay! Calm down! You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to go around crushin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 me! Sheesh, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already infected or something.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if by the instance of the moment, Gold was free from Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hug, leaving him to plop against his rump in the muddy pool of water. The Toxicroak\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes widened to their fullest extents, as Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smile stretched even farther along his face. He exclaimed with joy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGold! That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just it! Maybe that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why so many anthros have been so easily seduced and brainwashed by vore. I mean, take a moment to think. Before the infection started or was known, vore was only a trait that few pokemon even practiced. Carnivorous pokemon were the only ones to even use the tactic, and that was just oral and needed to survive.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hex grappled his hands on Gold\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulders, yanking the duck right back to him. His face pressed a little too close for Gold\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comfort, yet the frog wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cease his barrage of happiness. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo one used vore for pleasure! It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only to this moment that people have randomly used it for its physical appeal, and for whatever reason people know how to use it on their very first try, like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s instinct or something along those lines!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold looked at the insane frog bewilderedly, asking softly, \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u00a6And that means\u00e2\u0080\u00a6?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex joyfully answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see, Gold? It means we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already technically infected!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gold didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even have the slightest clue on why that was good news, when all of a sudden, his concentration is broken once Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lips pecked themselves against Gold\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth. The duck cried out through his muffled lips, as Hex deeply and powerfully kissed the Golduck with all of his heart. Luckily for Gold, the Toxicroak retracted his smiling mouth away, as Gold gagged out any droplets of Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s saliva. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe psychic pokemon that at fault here are sending signals from their minds to brainwash everyone on the island, however, its only when one comes into contact with the actual disease for these signals to take control of your body. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe that I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t discover this before! They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using our fetishes and desires to succumb so easily to their trap. Oh, Gold! You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re simply brilliant!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gold knew what was coming next. Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms opened up again, forcing the small duck into another skeleton-crushing hug. Gold growled but decided it was best to let this one slide. The last thing he wanted to do was to push Hex over his depressive limit again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold willingly welcomed the arms to stroke against his sides, as Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body heat was strangely cozy. The Golduck leaned his body tighter to Hex, all the while the Toxicroak nuzzled his head at the side of Gold\u00e2\u0080\u0099s throat. Their amphibious forms pressed together, collectively coming together like a zipper in the middle of a storm, sharing their brief moment of comfort. Gold placed his webbed hands on the frog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chest, gesturing the hug had its time. Hex sighed as he released the duck, watching the Golduck turn its back to him and curl up for sleep. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get our bags back at the pond tomorrow morning, if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still there by the end of this storm. After that, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go back to the trail to meet up with Lace and Jackal, if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still alive and not bouncing in some feral\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stomach.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s smile shrank back to a content smirk, while he lowered onto his back for long-awaited rest. As he closed his eyes, the Toxicroak whispered within the nook of the tree trunk, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood night, Gold.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold grumbled back in response. But as he laid there in his dirty puddle, the cold forest air delivered multiple shivers down the duck\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body, making him cringe under the frosty breeze. It was then that he remembered the warmth of Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hug, which could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve worked wonders on a good night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sleep. For once, Gold missed Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s compassion. The two anthros dwindled into a deep slumber, sleeping through the onslaught of thunder and rain.</span></div></div>",

Lightning crackled along the sky, bursting violent flashes to flicker throughout the cover of dark clouds. You were still cradled against his body, as you felt his fur drench from the massive outpour, dripping water across his entire heaving form. Air tunneled in and out of his lungs, while the arms that clutched you tightly began to waver under stress. Through your faint eyes, you stare at the exhausted Typhlosion, lingering around to find which direction the village was hiding through the film of rain. Thunder roared in the distance, and as a response, Jackal roared out too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice bellowed through the malevolent winds and sleet. The outcry echoed throughout the drenched landscape, only to be silenced with another explosion of thunder. Incapable of running any faster, his feet trudge through the murky puddles as his arms begin to slip along your slickened fur. His heavy unbalanced stomps shake his fat stomach, coercing you to bounce atop the soft chub with its slow rocking motions. \"...J-Jackal.\" You mustered the strength left in your voice to say. \"...I can manage to walk on my own from this point.\" The Typhlosion forced himself to stop, almost falling over from the damp soil. He tiredly looked down at your face, staring up at him in the same manner. The two of you sat there, battling each other's reasons with your eyes, when all of a sudden, Jackal closed his before sighing out. You felt your entire body shift in gravity, while your legs reach out to the ground, lazily placing your hindpaws to the muddy earth. The Typhlosion's guide you your entire way up, worriedly grasping your sides as you stagger your way back to a stance. After steadying yourself in an awkward posture, you look over to find that the fire-type's dampened hands haven't released you yet. You look back up to his unsure eyes, begging him, \"Let go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hands travel down your arms, sliding across your damp matted fur to arrive at your hands, as Jackal forced them to cup around the forepaws. Past his trickling muzzle, he promised, \"Hey. Don't push yourself too hard.\" You did your best to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. But listen, we haven't always been on the best of terms at times. If we actually survive this night, I'll do whatever you want, whenever you want.\" You answered back. Your face became much more stern-looking as you tightly grasped his hands closer. \"I know this is a little sudden, but you mean a lot to me. We've gone through some tough times in our days together and I never treated for who you were.\" Jackal's face began to heat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Typhlosion fumbled his mouth for words while looking away from you, responding in a quieter tone, \"...Uh, thanks. You matter to me too. I guess you set me straight when we first met so...yeah...we got each other's backs right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yanked him closer to you, uttering, \"I mean it. I wanted to say this just in case things go south. You've done too much for me to even get to this point, risking yourself and it killed me when you were carrying me just now. I've had a lot of time to think, so for now, I wanted to say that I'm sor-\" He slapped your hands before you could finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his heavily blushed face, he grew angry and yelled back, \"Shut up! Let's just find this village for you. Gah, what are you?! A total sap...?\" His voice trembled as he spun around from you rapidly after finishing his sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could've been just the rain, but you were positive you saw tears form under his eyes. He marched on through the storm, huffing smoke from his nostrils. Exhaling softly, you trailed behind the infuriated Typhlosion as you arrived at a foggy frame in the distance. To your delight, it was a short stone wall, built about a meter high that spanned into darkness of the murky weather. Close to it was an opening with a fallen sign title, labeled, \"Aldanwood.\"</span></div></div>",

The lead colored mist seeped through the landscape, clouding the entire area to the point where neither you nor Jackal could see past your muzzles. Jackal's fur tensed, as the pores on the back of his neck began to glow in tension. He crept slowly through the rain, with you following close behind in quirky struggles, staring ahead at the translucent outlines of demolished buildings. The crashing winds and flushing rain carried the fog along in a fast paced blow-out, making it impossible to see or hear anything close by. The Typhlosion hollered through the storm's rage, \"C'mon! We need to find a building that's still standing through this hell storm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eased yourself closer to Jackal, as he hooked his arm around yours. Both of you were about to fly off the ground at the gust's speed, almost carrying you away with the monsoon. However, the longer you traveled forward, lightning bolt through the puffed sky, emitting light to guide your way closer to the silhouette of a long house. Jackal gripped your arm again, signaling to keep going. But during your stumbles, another strike of light flashed, revealing a purple-eyed Magmar roaming far off. The Typhlosion's clutch tightened at the sight and pulled you along as he urged his walking speed faster. You splatter the mud with your pawsteps, creating a low growl to rumble behind the fog. The infected Magmar listened out to the soft splashes emanating from behind the cloak of rolling mist, sneaking forward for the intriguing sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and Jackal finally arrive at the flat house, finding it to be boarded up and sealed off from the outside.  Jackal looked over at the front of the building, during which lightning struck again, allowing the drenched Typhlosion to see a medic symbol to be painted at the wall. He smiled and cheered, \"Hey! It's a nursery!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere and then, Jackal was forced to the ground from a red and yellow blur, causing him to cry out before slamming into the mud. The Magmar had tackled him to bind his arms against the soaked soil, resting atop his fat belly while its tongue rubbed around his beaked mouth. The Typhlosion spat fire at the infected feral, seemingly to do nothing to his fire-type opponent. He suddenly gasped as a random warm bump poked at his spherical fuzzy gut. The Magmar's glistening rod trembled at the touch of Jackal's slickened fur, growing at a massive length to squirt out pre-juices. Out of the grey, you come sprinting forward with aura in hands, casting the lava duck off of your companion. The Magmar crashed into the muddy flooring as you shot out another blast of aura, launching a ball of blue flames, sending the infected far off into the rubble of another building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the hard beating rainfall, you look back at Jackal, staring at his frantic eyes. You pad your way over to him, helping him hoist his chubby body upright. Using another punch of energy, you blast open the doorway to the medic house. The wooden panels crumble under the heat of your aura, creating a wide enough hole for the two of you to climb inside. Within the sheltered room, multiple beds stretched across the long room in an orderly row, with tables, smashed berries, and operating tools scattered across the floor. Jackal luckily found a snuffed torch, lighting it against with a quick huff. The orange glow brightened the ominous room, sending the darkness to hide in the many creaks and corners. The only sound that could be heard was the muffled patters of the raindrops and rumbles of the thunder outside. Your body was drained of strength, forcing you to rest your dampened bum against one of the clothed beds. Jackal called out, \"Is anyone here? We have a sick person here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few brief moments of listening, a shuffle withheld in another room caused your long ears to twitch. Heavy footsteps eased their way closer to the room you and Jackal were in. Out in the open doorway stood fat pink-furred legs, holding up a chubby black and pink cow against its quarters. Obese breasts rested upon the bovine's fat belly, and sagging out of that gut was a bloated utter with dangling meaty teats. A Miltank stood before, but once your eyes finished examining her body, they perked up to see...</span></div></div>",

You struggled to get up from the bed, only to grunt in pain as you plopped back down on the mattress, exhausted and groaning. Jackal stepped, placing his hands atop his fat gut after saying, \"Don't worry. We're not here to hurt you. We ran into some infected on the way here, but my friend has been poisoned...Are you a nurse? C-can you help him...? Erk.\" Jackal suddenly fell to one knee, suffering from the Seviper's poison just now. The Miltank gulped and stammered to say, \"...U-umm...Why yes I am. J-Just wait one moment. Star! Star, please come out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRumbling shifts fumbled within the muffled walls, until finally a Luxray peered over the opening. her frame was much leaner than the Miltank, as a leather eyepatch stretched over her left eye. The one-eyed Luxray asked, \"Yes Bell? Who are these two...?\u00c2\u009d The Miltank, Bell, gestured the cat to follow her as she answered, \"Travelers to my best guess. Come help me lift this one onto a bed.\"\u00c2\u009d Star followed Bell to Jackal, hoisting the fat Typhlosion on both ends to drag him over onto the bed next you  with painful effort. They struggled to slide him onto the long cushion, heaving his groaning body fully on his back as they both exhaled in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBell began to light some candles, ordering, \"Star, could you please board up that hole? We do not need any more guests to come barging inside, especially the infected.\" The Luxray hurried over to the hole you had made to get inside, and slid a large bookcase in front of it. The howling wind and rain ceased its entrance as the opening was covered, and Star paced back to Bell for more directions. Bell looked down at your cold dripping body, softly speaking out, \"You poor thing. Star, we're going to need warm towels for these two. They'll freeze to death before they die of the poison.\" As Star walked into a different room, Bell asked the Jackal, \"What form of poison were you infected with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seviper v-venom.\"\u00c2\u009d Jackal coughed out. Bell called out in response, \"Star, gather some Pecha berries while you're at it!\" The Luxray returned with the needed blankets and berries, as Bell began to mash the fruit into a pasty mesh within a bowl as Star kindly wrapped the warm cloth around both you and Jackal. She tucked the end around your sides, sympathetically asking, \"...So what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pressured out in deep stress to whisper, \"L-Lace.\" She smiled back, answering, \"Lace...That's a nice name for a Lucario.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat Miltank hurried over to Jackal, jiggling her udder and breasts to distract you in the process, before she started to scoop the pink paste. She poured the Pecha berry mesh into Jackal's lightly opened mouth as he happily swallowed it in return. \"Th-thank you...\" He muttered as the Bell poured the medicine into your own mouth. It tasted sweet and cool, as the warm blanket around you soothed your paining senses. Your eyelids slowly lower down as the loud explosions of thunder disappear. Star looks worried as she exclaims to Bell, \"Are we losing him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Miltank simply patted your head as she replied, \"Don't worry. He's just falling asleep. He needs the rest for the night to sleep this venom off, so hrr...<i>h-hphk</i>...\" Her voice also trailed off as you drifted into a deep, long awaited slumber.</span></div></div>",

Sweat dripped from your head as your lungs inhaled and exhaled air at a fast deep rate. You were still lying within the medic bed, as daylight peered through any creases and nooks along the boarded building in strings of yellow. Your eyes lowered down to find Star's hands placed around your belly, as the Luxray's face begins to blush madly. Star retrieved her hands away, looking away while hiding her glowing face. \"Er...u-uh, sorry to wake you. I d-didn't think you'd be up by now, heh, ummm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar shook away her embarrassment and regained her serious composure to look back at you with her single eye. \"I was able to collect some berries that help ease digestion. I mashed them up and helped your body swallow down, so I wanted to make sure that th-they um...\" Her blush returned into her cheeks. \"Y-You know, to m-m-make sure that they get inside and spread throughout the s-stomach and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at you in midsentence, watching you smile back at her. She stretched her rosy cheeks into a comfortable smile too as she sat up from the side of the bed. \"I'll go inform Bell you're awake.\" The lithe Luxray sat up, turning to walk until she bumps into a large round sphere of fat. Jackal clenched his gut from the bounce as he growled, \"Ow...watch it, <i>cat</i>.\" He tightened the grip to cease the furry orb's jiggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar lost her smile as her face grew a bright strawberry red that was brighter than the sun itself. \"S-sorry!\" Her legs begin to fidget against one another as her breathing seemed to intensify. The Luxray looked she had to go to the bathroom or something. \"Y-your boyfriend is awake now though, so I'll just be going...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal's face lit up like Star's, as a fanged scowl gritted against his jaws while the Luxray made her way around the chubby Typhlosion and into a different room. Jackal grumbled under his breath during her exit, \"He's not my boyfriend, and I don't swing that way, sister.\" He ignored what had just happened as he gave a swift punch into your belly, forcing a quick jolt of friendly pain into your paunch. You gag a bit as he smiled brightly, \"Holy shit man, you're alive. I would've been pretty pissed off if I did all that work last night for nothing! Do you know how much you weigh with that big bird inside you? Man, I thought my back would break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to chuckle through your pain as you sit up all the way. You smirk back as Jackal grinned in a deviant way. He sneered, \"So Lace, remember how you said you would do anything I want, whenever I want it...?\" Here it comes. You reluctantly nod as Jackal stepped closer to you. He grabbed you by the fur of your chest, tugging you even closer as he smiled with a toothy grin. \"Here's how things are going to play out. You will never mention what happened back in the prairie with that Bayleef, even about how I ate it. Oh, and when I ever eat anything, I expect a full-on belly rub from you until I tell you to stop. It's a little aggravating trying to do anything with these infected ferals constantly struggling within my gut. Well, not that I don't enjoy them doing that too, but I like to speed up the process and your empty hands could work magic on that. You will also notify me as Jackal, not Jack, but as Jackal. If my arms get tired of carrying anything, you'll carry it for me. If my shoulders ache, you'll massage them. You're gonna do anything I say when I say it. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause for a while, slightly regretting what you had promised Jackal last night. That was quite the deal breaker there to commit yourself into servitude for the hot-headed badger, but you actually doubt you or him would follow through with it. Knowing him however, he was worked up in a mood, and he would only berate you or complain if you refused. With a roll of your eyes, you mutter, \"Yeah. Fine, whatever you say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Typhlosion suddenly embraces you with a deep hug, pulling you into his warm grasp. \"Then it's good to have you back, buddy!\" You return the hug by wrapping your own arms over his backside. Over his shoulder, you notice Bell and Star on the opposite side of the room, staring at the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not interrupting anything are we...?\" Bell's voice snickered out. You could feel the heat rise in Jackal's face as his head was on your shoulder from the hug. He forcefully pushes you back with his hands in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No you weren't! He was just hugging me cause I saved his life! Hahah...\" His eyes snap towards your own, signaling for you to agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lower your eyelids down in a leer at how much of a child he was being before looking to the two women. \"I just couldn't help myself. I would dead if he hadn't been so strong.\" Jackal doesn't sense your sarcasm and actually responds with smug smile, huffing to himself with the satisfying story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar asked, \"Seems like you two have been through a lot together. What's your story?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal eases himself down to sit next to you on the same bed. The base boards groaned under his weight as he takes charge, \"Heh, you could say that. We're out to save the world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou interject to give a more proper response. \"We're actually on our way to create a cure for the infection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar sat on the bed across from you, staring in disbelief with Bell as she asked, \"Really? Have you found anything? Do you know how to stop it?!\" The Luxray's voice heightened, but Bell simply patted her shoulder to calm the cat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Miltank assured, \"Pardon my friend here, it's just that we've locked ourselves inside this household for so long we have no idea what's going outside anymore. We were nurses here before the infection started. But ever since our town was overrun, we haven't really been able to hear any news. There used to be more of us in this town, but one by one, the villagers would grow impatient and go out in search for help. It's gotten to the point where Star and I are the only ones left...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod solemnly before telling them, \"And we're here to change that. Here's what we've been through...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You had just revealed your past with setting out from your home, meeting Jackal, going to Redeemer's Grotto, meeting Gold and Hex, discovering things concerning the infection, the Seviper's poison, and finally to the point of how you arrived in Aldanwood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar growled as her cat-like eye thinned in rage. \"I had to abandon my village, my friends and family. I had to leave them to die because of this infection, and now I have to know that they were raped to have even become infected? What sick twisted monster starts something as destructive as this? Who is he?!\" She screamed at you. Bell hugged her thick arms tightly around the one-eyed Luxray desperately, stroking her sides to settle her anger. Tears were on the verge of Star's eye, as her eyepatch suddenly darkened with a wet spot. You did your best to not watch her cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cleared your throat, answering in a hoarse tone, \"...We do not specifically know who's behind this, but mark my words, we'll find him. We will stop him.\" The four of you sit in silence for a long moment. The lingering quiet pained everyone in the awkwardness as Jackal nudges your side with his elbow. He said, \"You slept way too long. It's past the afternoon and already evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was out for almost an entire day?\" You replied in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar nodded and answered, \"That's right. The Seviper's poison sting had been injected into your lung. It's miraculous that you had even made it to Aldanwood alive.\" That fact was a little discontenting, but it proved that you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go down so easily in this journey, so it gave you a little confidence on what events lie ahead. Your belly had actually gone down half way, including Jackal's, as the Pidgeot and recent medicine gave you an astounding amount of energy! You were rejuvenated and felt better than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slide yourself off the bed, leaning your paws down to touch the cold wooden flooring. You wince at the temperature and attempt to balance up to stand. It was a little troubling from your legs being inactive for a while, and Jackal sat up and suggested that he could help you, however you pass the gesture off to come to a full and powerful posture. You stand bright and tall, eager to take on the rest of your quest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou happily announced, \"Thank you very much. If it were not for you, Bell and Star, I'd be dead right now. I promise I'll make up your time and stop this menace.\" You gesture Jackal to follow out to the bookcase. You drag the massive furniture away and exit the hole with your companion. From the outside, you bow down to the Miltank and Luxray, thanking them again as you head off with Jackal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could even exit the destroyed town gate, you heard loud footsteps beat behind you. Turning around, you and Jackal gaze out to find Bell and Star with bags rush over to you along the prairie grass. Star arrived first to you, because the poor obese cow had trouble catching up, as the eyepatched Luxray smiled back to you. \"Remember how you told us the story about that one underground town, Redeemer's Grotto? Do you think they could use another medic or two within their little town?\" You understood what the happy cat was implying. (You can repay us back for saving your life by showing us to Redeemer's Grotto.) So you respond with a sly grin, \"I guess they could make some room for two nurses. Jackal and I will be happy to show you where it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Miltank finally arrived, wheezing some as she carried her luggage full of tent supplies, berries, and blankets. You kindly take Star's bag for her, as Jackal does the same for Bell, and the four of you head out to meet up Hex and Gold, who hopefully were still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>((Bell has joined your party!))</i></b><br>\r\n<b><i>((Star has joined your party!))</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The mist after the rough rainstorm steamed white clouds from the grass, as the sky was a pewter white-grey, floating puffs of cotton drifting by. Dew dripped from the vegetation while puddles waved in the slight cold wind. You smile as a rainbow stretched across the skyline above the forest far off in the distance, glimmering a form of hope you can't feel anywhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we're in for some good times.\" Jackal's voice said behind you. The Typhlosion stood nearby, as the four members of your party stood at the top of a tall hill, looking down at the rolls and mounds of land awaiting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirk back as you swing your head, motioning to go on. Your group venture through the plains, which gave both you and Jackal a shiver to think back at the horrible experiences you two had to go through. You remembered the horrible feeling of dying, whereas Jackal was mainly pertained into thinking about the Bayleef and what it had done to him. His rump squeezed together from the thought. However, he replaced the memory with your speech to him about what he meant to you. He shyly smiled at the thought, feeling blood begin to build in his cheeks as he peered over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Lace.\" The Typhlosion slowly sang out. \"There's still a little bit of Bayleef left in my stomach, and it's a little stuck around the edges. Could you help me shift it around some, so I can digest it better?\" You looked back at him as he clenched a hand around his belly, tugging at the flab. You roll your eyes and arrive at his side. The two of you continue walking forward, but you raise an arm and begin circling the forepaw around his soft gut. He grinned as he closed his eyes, murring silently as you pleasure his stomach. Oddly enough, his thin fur felt actually pleasant, as his pudgy fat squished down under your hand's force. You add a little more pressure and slow your movements, savoring the feeling to cause a short growl out of Jackal. The Typhlosion peeked an eye open, as you stare at the sliver of his eye glare back at you with a sweet face to smile with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes suddenly widen once he realizes what kind of face he was making. He diverts his attention away from you with a deep blush and walks forward a few more steps in front of you, forcing his face into hiding as you look at his backside. The pores of his neck slightly ignite in embarrassed heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jackal disappeared behind a wall of fog, only to come flying right back out of it! His body crashed into a pool of mud as Bell clasps her hands over her mouth and yell in terror, nudging closer to Star who was behind you. Out from the steaming mist came lumbering footsteps, causing minor tremors to shake the ground beneath your feet. A massive fleshy belly blemished out of the fog, revealing a colossal Snorlax to protrude out its flabby body. The creases of its eyes glow purple, while its gut growls like thunder. This <i>thing</i> was three times your size in height and width.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp and get into a battle stance as Star leans in closer, bolting static to spark from her hands and mouth.</span></div></div>",

After giving her a nod, both you and the Luxray bolt forward, unleashing the fury of your powered punches to your infected foe. The Snorlax winces as the arms are forced into its fat belly, squishing inward yet weakening the blow with the plush blubber. You gasp your arm bounces back away from the massive gut to force you and Star onto your backs from the retracted force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rebounded to the ground, gagging out as your back slammed against the wet ground. You were ready to get up for a better strategy, until suddenly, a large shadow darkens above you. You gaze up in horror as the silhouette of the Snorlax's foot looms over your body. The stubby leg launches downward, smothering your body under its soft sole with a loud stomp. You gag out again as you were grinded against the grass flooring, squeezed underfoot from the Snorlax's excruciating weight. Its foot rubs you further into the ground, twisting and shifting as the Snorlax's releases a deep chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it steps off from you and trudges its heavy form over to Star, fallen from being bounced of the infected's sloshing belly. She screams as the fat hand clasps around her body, hoisting her body up to eye level. The slanted eyes stare into your writhing form while the Snorlax licked its chops in glee. It opens its maw wide open, forcing the struggling Luxray to peer down into the slimy cave anticipating her filling. She is plunged head first into the mouth, as the Snorlax releases her from its clawed hand. It sucks and slurps the cat's furry body, as her other half rests outside the Snorlax's tightened lips, kicking her legs and flailing her thin tail in mad swishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe broad tongue spills in between her legs, sliding up her groin to cause an unwilling growl to emit from Star's mouth. The obese feral gulped with tremendous force, swallowing the entire Luxray down its throat. You watch from the ground as the Snorlax belches out loud from its feline snack, only to find a Miltank crying for her devoured friend. The Snorlax instantly grabs Bell, during which its other hand snatches you up. Raised up to the Snorlax's hot mouth, its thick lips pucker over Bell's sagging udder, sucking against the sac of liquids like a milk bottle to force Bell to tremble and moan from the feeling. Milk flushed into the infected's mouth, streaming down its throat to splash onto Star was she wriggles in displeasure within the open fleshy walls of its stomach. Drinking the last of the white cream down, the Snorlax tosses in the pleasured cow inside, snapping its jaws around her fat body to swallow her down in a single thick gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGurgles throb within its belly, and its cheeks bloat out. You close your eyes and wince as the Snorlax belches out loud again, while the stench of milk clouds over you. Slobber also unleashes from its dank throat, splattering over your body to your disgust. There and then, you were raised up with the claw-digits pinched around the scruff of your neck, hovering you over the throbbing hole below you. You whimper aloud before you were dropped into the Snorlax's mouth, falling down past its tongue and into its slimy throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land with a loud splat as the meaty wet walls clench around you, dragging you down further into the hot darkness. You whine as your body is tightened up within the esophagus, sinking down into the depths of the infected's stomach. You slide in between Star and Bell; both furry bodies slathered in thick saliva. Each of them sob silently as the stomach bounces and jiggles, tumbling all of you inside the slimy sac as the Snorlax walks over to the unconscious Typhlosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Snorlax releases one final burp after the Typhlosion's legs seeped down its throat. It grunted happily from a four-course meal to sit down with another tremor to rumble the ground by the heavy impact. Its belly protruded out a bit more, and twitched from the struggles within its stomach. The Snorlax pressed its hands into the impressive flab, stroking its churning stomach as its digestive juices boil the four anthros inside to break their hides down. Their squirms soon slur into motionlessness, ending their pleas and roars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Snorlax smiles as the belly responds with a bubbly gurgle, while the clouds in the sky smother the rainbow in the distance.</i></span></div></div>",

Star nods and dashes forward, sending a thunderbolt to jet out to the colossal infected, erupting a static explosion to crackle out. The Snorlax grunted in pain as Star twisted around send another bolt of lightning through the smoke cloud. You, in the meantime, compress your hands together to focus enough energy to swirl in your grasp. Glowing aura encircles into an orb, flashing out in flames to flicker off your power. You smirked as your body was packed with new energy thanks to your recent digestion, and you release that energy in a sizable aura sphere towards your opponent. Star sends a thunder punch into its thigh to stagger the infected Snorlax, hopping back for your aura sphere to collide into its belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Snorlax roared out as its entire blubbery form twisted along the blue orb like a bullet, being dragged against the ground as the aura sphere exploded into a firework of blue flames! The impact hauled the fat lard to its knees, covered in scattered burns and soot. Both you and Star dash to the downed infected, collecting aura in your arms and lightning in the Luxray's arms. You simultaneously jump upward, punching the Snorlax square in his face together. An accompaniment of blue flames and static electricity unleashed in a combustion of colors and heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Snorlax flew back, unconscious and smothered in ashes as it slammed its heavy body against the ground, causing a small earthquake from the collision. You land on the ground despondently with Star, as the Luxray heaves out air in relief. Sweat dabbed the fur of her forehead, yet she cheered, \"...H-Holy shit. I helped you do that?!\" She looked down at her hands, crackling with volts. She smiled and tackled a hug around you. Static still surrounded her body, and the shock slightly tazed you in her grapple of happiness. She chuckled and released you from feeling you wince, regretfully snickering, \"Oops. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Staaaaar!\" A voice hollered to the two of you. The Luxray was suddenly encompassed with thick cow arms, squished into a hug from Bell. The shorter cow hugged the one-eyed cat, \"How dare you just rush ahead like that! I thought I would lose you! Just because th-there's an infected doesn't mean you h-have to act so reckless.\" The Miltank pressured onto Star with tears welling up in her eyes. Star looked down at her friend, continuing a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Bell, but I want to make sure you're safe. We both know that you can't fight, and you're the world to me. I won't let an infected anywhere near you when I'm around.\" Star assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Miltank reflected Star's smile and answered, \"That's just it. I'd hate for you to be gobbled up by some monster.\" She clutched the Luxray's fur tighter as Star's face came closer with hers. \"Sometimes, I just hate the fact that I love you.\" Their lips suddenly came into contact, which shocked you a bit, and this wasn't from Star's static this time. Star submitted to the kiss, enveloping the cow's mouth by her own. You were certain that they even danced each other's tongues together. Apparently, Star and Bell were more than just friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk away from the lesbians' make out with their lips, avoiding the odd moment to find Jackal, groaning with his back inside a crater from his crash. You nudged him awake as the Typhlosion hoist his body upright. \"Ergh. Alright, where's that fatass? I wanna teach that tubby fatso a lesson when you mess with-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cut him off, \"Calm down there bucko. And who are you calling tubby, <i>tubby</i>?\" You imply his slight pudge by poking at his plush belly. He growls in return while you help him to a stand. His jaw suddenly drops as he gawks at the Luxray and Miltank before, swirling their mouths over each other during their loud moans. You smile at him and pat his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let em' be.\" You said to him as you approach the lesbian couple. Star breaks away from the kiss, wiping her mouth of the cow's saliva to answer, \"Sorry about that too. We couldn't help ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of you regroup and press on through the prairie! Bell gives a swift kick to the knocked out Snorlax, striking a hoof into its belly with a satisified, \"Hmph.\"</span></div></div>",

A long grin curved along his beak, as the duck was experiencing a wonderful dream within his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gold locked his eyes on what he was looking at. The Golduck was situated along the shallow end of a coastline. Water bobbed the duck from his torso down, while the sudden intoxicating scent of the beach filled his beak nostrils. He inhaled the salty air, loosening his muscles in his favorite biome. Gold had heard of beaches, but never had the time or effort to find one. He figured the lake he lived was as good as it got, yet for whatever reason, his mind picked out the details of the ocean from stories he had heard and placed him here for his utmost fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud splash suddenly interrupted his calm state, frightening the duck to jolt immediately. Out from the coast's surface laid a Lapras, beached against the sandy waters as it purred silently. Gold stared into its lowered eyes, finding them to glow a purple florescent color. The Golduck tensed up from the sight, as the beached Lapras began to move. Instead getting closer to Gold, the water-horse rolled back onto its shell's backside, revealing the Lapras' peachy underside the Golduck instead. The duck's eyes widened as his ball sac twitched from the presentation. In between her hind flippers pulsed her long vagina, moist with a clear slimy liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infected Lapras gestured her short tail, motioning it to beckon Gold over. The Golduck gulped loudly, questioning on whether or not to obey her. The Lapras suddenly released a slow murr, echoing out like a whale's ambient voice as she closed her lavender eyes, throbbing her cunt's lips together in anticipation. Under the seawater, Gold's rod sprang up, pressing against his belly from the mere sight. Gold felt his face grow hot as he willingly began to drift in the waves towards the horny Lapras, eager for a closer look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lapras cooed as the Golduck approached her, licking her tongue across her cheeks. Gold arrived at the coast, slowly stepping up to the rolled over water-horse as he fingered around his twitching cock. He sniffed the air of the musk of her arousal and trembled from the aroma. Her nether-lips opened up wider, seeping with pre as the Lapras nudged her hind flippers again, calling the sex-driven duck closer. Gold gulped again as he climbed on her stubby tail, grappling his way over to her crotch. Her moist underside was still soaked in the saltwater, causing Gold to slip his greedy hands along her dolphin-like hide. The duck finally made his stop, crouched around the swollen folds that throb beneath him. The Lapras' heat clouds over him, forcing the Golduck to fidget in uncomfortable pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold's relentless member slapped against his abdomen again, but Gold knew he couldn't possibly give enough satisfaction to this large Lapras with his cock. Although Gold was impressed with his lengthened size, the cock would only be a small nub compared to the infected's massive body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold grew an idea inside his perverted little head. Without expecting any consequences, he began to press his entire head within the Lapras' vaginal walls, causing a low groan to emit her mouth. The Lapras swung her head back, happily murring as the Golduck willingly unbirthed himself deep into her pussy. He did his best to crawl inside the oozing tight walls of her groin, slipping down into her hot depths. The pussy's lips gulped down Gold's waist, allowing the duck to hump his desires away at the slimy flesh, drilling his member brutally against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water-horse wiggled her fins in complete physical joy, growling a low tone as her vagina squirted out more of her love juices, splattering over the swirling duck inside her. The Golduck purposefully twists and turns, continuing to rock his hips into her vaginal walls for his predator's enjoyment. Gold groaned aloud, as his balls twitch with the intense heat in his crotch. Seed erupted from his cock, shooting out over himself and across the throbbing fleshy walls to tense up for one more squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lapras cried out, ejecting her orgasm around the unbirthed Golduck as his bulge centered up into her womb. The Lapras leaked cum out of her lower-lips, seeping the stick fluids to drip down to the sandy ground. The infected Lapras hauled her body forward, teetering her weight so she could land her underside against the ground once more. She then slid her way back into the ocean, as her bloomed folds pulsate from her satisfaction while her belly throbbed a small lump. Gold, now inside the infected's womb, found himself trapped within the vibrating walls, constricting and forming around his body. They squeezed his writhing form to their full potential, forcing Gold to begin humping his cum-covered crotch for another round of an orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled as the organ began to compact and work on his body, as he felt himself slowly absorbing into the meaty slick walls. Outside, the Lapras cooed again as she swam down into the dark depths of the ocean floor, feeling the Golduck's fake struggles whisk away.</i></span></div></div>",

The duck grumbled gibberish words as he nudged his body and limbs some, feeling disappointed that such a wondrous dream had to end. Although, Gold smiled at the familiar tight sensation in between his legs. His morning wood sprouted with glee, glistening with pre from the pleasuring thoughts of the Lapras overnight. The twitching rod gave off soft humps to a walled object, beading out more of the clear fluid by the cock's lips. Gold murred softly in return as he cozied up closer into the warmth surrounding his tired form, all the while of having his eyes remained shut. Something was peculiar to Gold though. What was so warming that shadowed over his body?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold regretted to have ever opened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex's arms were crossed around his backside, hugging the Golduck deeply into the Toxicroak's chest. Gold's rod was actually riding up along Hex's leg, smearing a strand of precum along the froggy skin. Hex was staring down at Gold with lowered eyes, compassionately striking their sight through Gold's horrified expression. Gold's webbed hands lay clutched against the frog's chest as his head was placed along the shoulder. Hex craned his head down to peck a kiss atop Gold's forehead, softly whispering, \"Good morning my little lovebird. I see it that you slept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a webbed hand came down on Hex's face, smacking the anthro toad's cheek. The Golduck forced himself off of the shrieking Toxicroak, crawling away backwards to the other side of the hole. As Hex rubbed the side of his face in distraught, Gold hissed, \"<i>What the hell do you think you're doing</i>?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex attempted to calm himself down from the sudden strike, answering, \"...I'll have you know that anything involving your cuddling was not my intention. Whatever dream state you where in had you tossing and turning frantically, flopping your boner to clock back and forth like an animal. You finally calmed down after I held you in place.\" Hex's face suddenly brightened up, smiling his bright white teeth. \"But I have to say, you acted just so cute when you nuzzled into my arms that I practically melted away! Yes, I hugged my arms around you. But you were shivering throughout your humping spree, so I did what I could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold's face transitioned into a glowing red as he cupped his hands around his continuously throbbing cock. \"...J-Just stay away from me.\" The duck couldn't help but feel embarrassed and responsible for the whole incident. The dream of the unbirthing Lapras had made him quite horny and Hex's story was all the more believable. Suddenly, Hex began to eye at Gold's concealed crotch, evolving his soft smile into a predatory gleam. Gold gulped as the Toxicroak got onto his hands and knees to evidently crawl towards the backed away bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Gold,I'm positive that you want me to repay you for your actions from rescuing me from that dastardly cock. Risking your own male phobia, you saved my, so again, I must repay you.\" He approached the huddled duck even closer, never losing his locked vision on Gold. Gold gulped as he scooted himself back against the wall, whimpering somewhat. With a line a precum still slathered against Hex's leg side, the Toxicroak swiped it up with a single purple finger, letting the slime droop at the tip. He scraped the the strand with his tongue, murring at the taste and swallowed it down to be followed by a pleasured croak. \"Mmmmm...do you know how good you taste? I can only imagine what your actual cum must taste like. I bet the flavor would be utterly <i>intoxicating</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold scowled, warning, \"I said stay away from me, you freak. I want you to repay me but not by whoring yourself out. Gah, did you learn nothing yesterday? I like chicks...\" Gold raised a leg as he continued, \"...<i>not dudes</i>!!!\" Gold's taloned foot came launching towards Hex, striking the frog again at his cheek. The sheer force sent Hex to fly from his hands and knees to his backside, smashing into the muddy earth to splash over his body. Gold didn't mean to kick so hard, but it was too late to change that. Hex rose up silently with a hand cupped over the side of his face. He lifted it off to stare into his palm, and to Gold and Hex's horror, rested droplets of blood against it. Three long red dashes stretched over Hex's left cheek, dripping a thin strand to curtain his lower jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared deeply at Gold for a matter of seconds, but before the duck could say anything, he climbed out of the hole to leave Gold alone within the nook.</span></div></div>",

H-Hey, wait up!\u201d The duck quacked out as he awkwardly paced towards his companion, struggling with his present erection for a stumbling look. His aslant jog allowed him to catch up to the frog with its back turned to him. Gold tried assuring Hex again, \u201cListen Hex, I-I\u2019m sorry about the whole, eh, scratch thing. I mean, you were just freaking me out and, um, I kind of went a little overboard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex remained silent, never facing the short duck for a second. He simply stared ahead and trudged in the direction of the pond. Gold continued his guilt trip, \u201c\u2026Come on, man. Give me a break here. I was trying to warn you but you just\u2026just kept coming at me. And I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex had suddenly spun around, raising a hand to smack Gold. Gold froze still at the sight and scooted his head at his shoulder, expecting to be hit. The hand never came though, forcing the Golduck to peek an eye open. Tears welled up in Hex\u2019s bright eyes as his arm trembled in the air. Gold was washed over in awe as the Toxicroak\u2019s risen hand curled into a fist, only to retreat down by Hex\u2019s side again in a slow manner. The frog closed his tear filled eyes and walked away, shaking his head softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold loosened up for a moment, taking the time to get over the terrifying memory. His heartbeat returned to its steady beat as his lungs breathed out once again. He stood there, dumbfounded, while watching the outline of a Toxicroak disappear behind an encampment of trees. He looked down to the soiled ground, taking quick notice of the blood still smeared along the talons of his right foot. Stepping into a nearby puddle, he splashed water onto the hard digits, wiggling them about to cleanse them of the red stains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed out and bolted once again. The Golduck flashed through the dampened trees and moist earth, hopping over each log and fallen branch to reach his friend yet again. Gold was even shocked that he was calling Hex his friend. He dug his heel talons into the ground, halting his speed to a short stop at the pond\u2019s coast. Searching around the rim of the body of water, he easily spotted the Toxicroak a bit a ways off, scooping his satchel into his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold hadn\u2019t noticed that a faint smile curved along his beak as he resumed his pursuit for Hex. He skidded up to the frog, asking, \u201cYou know, we could still go berry hunting. We didn\u2019t get that many since we had that run-in with that Heracross, so what do ya say?\u201d Hex continued his silence. Gold groaned out, \u201c...We could go out swimming.\u201d Still, not even a huff from Hex sounded it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold had enough of this. Hex was acting childish, and it creeped Gold out that he wasn\u2019t in his normal jolly attitude anymore. He pounced forward, tackling the Toxicroak from behind. Hex twisted around and landed against his rump while Gold sat against his lap, easing himself close the surprised frog\u2019s face. He yelled, \u201cJust talk to me, dammit! I\u2019ve already said I was sorry and that hurting you was an accident!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned his torso back, nudging his groin closer to Hex. His blushed face looked away as he said, \u201c\u2026Y-You can just do whatever you where gonna do back at the hole, okay?\u201d Gold knew he was going to hate every second of it, until suddenly, he felt himself get pushed upon his backside. He quacked in shock as Hex stood above the cowering duck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex scrunched his brow as he glared down at Gold. His shadowy tall appearance intimidated the Golduck somewhat as Hex\u2019s voice seemed to demonically hiss out, \u201c<i>That\u2019s</i> what you think I need? Your permission to pleasure you?\u201d He mounted himself over the duck, pressing his face a little close for Gold\u2019s comfort. Hex resumed his angry rant, \u201cIf I wanted to fuck your little body than I would have raped you over and over again throughout this entire trek. I\u2019m not typically angry about the scratch either, however I must say that I\u2019m a little ticked off about that as well, but in any case I\u2019m really furious about the fact that I thought you had changed. Isn\u2019t that funny? I figured that our little bonding time overnight and this morning\u2019s mix up that you had actually changed your pesky little ways. But I was wrong. <i>Horribly wrong</i>. You\u2019re the same since the beginning of our time together, save for the constant apologies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex stood up again over the horrified Golduck, as he plopped his foot against the duck\u2019s soft member. \u201cYou think I\u2019ll feel better if I perform any sexual treatments to your body just because you\u2019re a <i>guy</i> and I\u2019m a <i>homosexual</i>?\u201d Hex weighted down tremendous pressure down unto Gold\u2019s crotch, creating a recoiling howl to quack out of the duck\u2019s mouth. \u201cI\u2019m not angry at your resistance to me. I\u2019m simply angry the fact I may suffer the last minutes of my life with an easy tempered, rude, puny, self-conscious, arrogant, face-kicking duck that manipulates me into thinking that I had him as a <i>friend</i>. If I truly loved you Gold, I\u2019m positive that I would have confessed it to you long ago.\u201d More salty tears beaded at the Toxicroak\u2019s eyes as he removed his foot off of Gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duck released a sigh of relief as he cupped his webbed hands around his member, endeavoring to nourish it back to comfort from having Hex\u2019s leg weight down against it. Suddenly, there was a ruffle in the leaves, tensing Gold up back to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut came a Roserade woman, about the stout size as Gold was, sporting quite a feminine figure. Hex looked back to stare into her\u2026</span></div></div>",

Her voice seemed as elegant as the fragrance of her flowers striking both males' noses. The mind-bending aroma infatuated Gold into complete adoration by the sudden appearance of a Roserade appearing from the foliage. Luckily for the awe struck duck, her eyesight fit Gold's perfectly well, comparing them together for no difference in height. Whoever this Roserade was, he wanted to meet her. \"Forgive me for interrupting that...<i>deep</i> conversation, but I couldn't help but overhear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flower woman steps over to Hex, and as the two of them notice, she lacks any real hinds and relied on her leg stalks to move about. Although, they seemed to move freely along the ground like any other bipedal pokemon. She raises her right arm, having a bouquet of crimson flowers along with it. The Toxicroak stared back at her with confused eyes, wondering how he was supposed to shake a bundle of flowers or who this Roserade even was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles with a gentle face, mentioning up to the frog, \"Where are my manners? My name is Eden. And from what I overheard, I'm supposing that you must be Gold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex peers over to the real Gold to witness the duck's face growing hot. The Golduck broke Eden's arm gesture by stepping in between her and Hex, pointing at her with a single finger. \"What makes ya think he's Gold?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Roserade lowers her yellow eyelids as she mumbles in distaste, \"I said I was only listening, not watching. But wait, does this mean that you...are... <i>Gold</i> the <i>Golduck</i>?\" She closes her eyes fully as she silently snickers, placing her bouquet arms up to hide her face. She struggles to even resist the temptation to laugh, giving a small jab at Gold's self-esteem. He was willing to ignore it for the Roserade's majestic looks, smell, and voice. Even her laugh drew him in closer to her. She finally got over her laughter binge as she gets out on the verge of chuckling, \"...Heh-heh. Well that's a little unique. Excuse me for laughing but I couldn't help myself. It's just...unexpected, that's all. I think it's a cute name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe called Gold cute. His face feels a tinge of warmth upon reddening up as his smug smile glides along his beak. He crosses his arms behind his head to look casual as he shows off whatever muscles he exaggerated in having. \"Well, I sorta came up with it on my own...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice, but I was actually going to chat with your Toxicroak friend. He seems to be the one with the problem.\" She simply nudges Gold off to the side and continues to chat with Hex. The Toxicroak solemnly stares down at her, at first to gauge if she was a threat or not. A lot was happening in his mind right now, he was at a point of dismissing anything told or asked of him. \"Forgive the mix-up. Hex, then, in your argument you mentioned that Gold never changed after something between the two of you last night. What exactly does-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing happened last night!\" The duck interrupted yet again by hopping in front of Eden. \"We, we, uh, accepted each as friends, that's all!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Roserade lost her smirk as she said with a bit of confusion, \"Erhm. That's nice of you two, but I was asking Hex so...\" She tugs the Golduck away once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" The frog mutters, breaking his silence for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEden tilts her head. \"Hm? I introduced myself just a moment ago. My name is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know of your name, Miss Eden...but I want to know what kind of person you are.\" The Toxicroak assures her in almost a demanding way. \"Why are you inquiring about us. The last individual was rather nefarious. I'm rather on-edge, so I think it's best if you move on wherever you came from, this is certainly not your business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEden pauses in thought for a moment, before closing her eyes and smiling. With a nod of her head, she tucks her arms behind her back to appear as peaceful as possible. \"Hex, I know this is sudden, but if you're going to argue in my forest, I should least help out so neither of you don't attract any ferals here with all of that noise. So let me help resolve this. I am only here to help. When I listened to you argue over a relationship. From what I know so far, you should at least forgive for whatever he did, because he seems sincere through all of his apologies. Despite his issues, he knows he made a mistake and only wants to see you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up, hold up, hold up.\" Gold stopped in mid-sentence when shook his hands about. \"He's got a damn good point. I wasn't even thinkin' about it 'til now but just who the hell do you think you are? I should'a been askin' the questions here, but I guess your good looks distracted m-\" The Golduck pauses suddenly as he scans his eyes past her torso. Eden's chest hardly poked out at all, with leaf cups shrouding her chest. Gold scrunchs his brow in confusion. \"Wait. Are you a...<i>dude</i>?\" He bluntly asks aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEden was immediately distracted by the question as she quickly flashes a look to the duck, \"<i>I beg your pardon</i>?\" It was one thing to interrupt her a lot, but this was a full-on mistake by him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold points a single finger at her chest, asking again, \"Are you a guy? I'm looking at your chest but I don't see any tits. Are you just hidin' them that well or somethin'?\" That was Eden's breaking point. Three finger-like vine tips poke out of her flower bundles, shooting out to stretch their way over to the shocked Golduck. The tendrils coil around Gold like multiple snakes, tightening their grip to asphyxiate the air out of him. He gags out in shock as the Roserade lift him up in the air with ease and tosses the duck directly face first into a thick tree trunk. After a deafening sound, the plant tentacles rewrap around the pained Golduck again, twirling him over so his rump sticks out in the air some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me one moment Hex...\" The woman mentions to the Toxicroak to enact a punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPropelled in midair, Eden's victim suffers multiple blows to his exposed rear by having any free vines begin whipping his cheeks about. He quacks loudly after each tendril comes smacking down, leaving red glowing lines to bruise his bottom as Eden stares in anger for his flat-chested comments. Hex watches all that took place, trying to hold back a smile in watching the Golduck's spanking torture. Sure, the frog hated Gold on several occasions, and sure, Gold was the rudest person he ever had to talk to, but from what Hex remembers, there was still a genuine person deep inside that insulting ego. Gold wouldn't have come back for Hex and help to fight Rune, especially with what...took place. Gold fought his stigma when it truly mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex places a hand atop Eden's white flower blossom hair, eliciting the Roserade to cease her attacks and stare up at him. \"Thank you, Eden.\" Hex finally spoke out. \"You made me realize something.\" The flower woman drops the duck to hit the ground, making him quack again in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex steps his way over to Gold, who was now sitting along the grass to stroke his sore butt. He grumbles out insults to the vines that freed him lowly. The Toxicroak squats down to get himself closer eye-level with the duck, getting Gold's attention. He stares into Gold's eyes, making the Golduck feel a little awkward from being close to Hex as he rubs his own rump. Hex gave off a slight smile, \"I'm sorry for overreacting from before.\" Hex sighs out as he rests down on his knees further. \"Gold, what I'm really angry at is the fact that you're so eager to push me away. But...perhaps it does not help that I egg you on with subject matter that make you uncomfortable. I need to respect your boundaries before you respect mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold felt his face flush red just as badly as his bum did. \"Eh? Uhh...well...okay. Sorry that I...push you away I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex smiles as he leans in closer, \"Although you <i>did</i> say something about a handjob.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold jolts up just to fall upon his back, trying to crawl away until the Toxicroak. The duck huffs out, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa! That was from before!  You had your chance! We're cool now, right? Right?! You just said-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex chuckles, \"Sorry, that was a mean joke. I'll be sure to keep my distance from you in cases like this however.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah sure fine, whatever! Just don't get all mopey like that again man. It was...weird and scary.\" Gold retorts, catching his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwh, I'm sorry. I guess we were both being a tad immature.\" Hex mutters, making sure his face was clean of any dried tears. He smiles to Gold, offering a hand to help the duck back up. \"Here, no handjob needed. How about just a platonic hug?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold glances about to Hex's face and the hand, shuddering out. \"...Fine. <i>Just</i> a hug. And only one!\" Hex immediately dives for the duck, grappling him in a tight loving squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal~\" Hex softly cheers. Gold grumbles as he wraps his arms around the joyful frog, bombarded with that warm fuzzy feeling again. It was that same warmth he missed last night, except this time, it felt a little warmer. Gold figured it was just from the outside day temperature. He nuzzles himself deeper in the frog's grasp as Hex slid his lengthy arms down to Gold's lower back. Hex pressea his cheek against Gold's, croaking happily during the mutual hug that left Gold feeling awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold knew it was cheesy, but he couldn't help it. He loved cuddling, even if it was Hex. No one ever bothered to cuddle him, yet here he was, in the tight arms of someone who would die for him; not that Gold would ever admit it out loud. \"A-Alright! Alright! I'm good.\" He huffs in defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the background, Eden watched the caressing males from a distance, pondering if she helped Hex overcome his emotions with her words, or by torturing the Golduck. She looks down at her chest, poking a vine tip at one of her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe worriedly asks herself, \"Are they really <i>that</i> small...?\"</span></div></div>",

Hex whined out as he clenched his hands into a fist, clasping a soft round object into his hands. He plopped the item out, smiling as he stared into the Pecha berry. It was his favorite kind of fruit, in fact, it seemed like his constant cravings for one were more of an addiction than a liking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sniffed at the ripe berry, taking the wonderful scent into his nostrils. The frog shuddered from the heavenly sweet aroma vaporing off the fruit. He was just about to take a nibble, when all of a sudden, a webbed-clawed hand plopped it right out of Hex's palm! Hex gnashed his teeth violently when he missed his bite, hurting his jaws into a sharp pain as Gold inspected the Pecha berry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I think I know these. <i>Pechy</i> berries, right? I haven't eaten one of these in awhile.\" Hex, as he held his wincing jaw, looked over to find the duck's beak taking a huge chomp into the fruit, carelessly ripping off a huge chunk as wasted juice dripped from the fruit's crater and Gold's chewing maw. \"Oh yeah...\" the duck answered in distaste, \"...They weren't that good.\" Gold managed to eat and swallow the rest of Hex's berry, as the Toxicroak watched with distraught eyes of his snack descending as a small lump down into Gold's belly. The duck patted his abdomen and looked back. He smiled happily as he opened his leather bag, revealing all of the fruits he collected. \"Check it and weep, frog! I know I got more berries than you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex held back his steaming rage, thinking demonic thoughts of approaching Gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hey Gold, guess what?\" He would ask the duck as Gold continued to chew his favorite meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...?\" Gold would reply, spilling valuable juice to the dirty soil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex smiled and grabbed the Golduck from under his arms. He evilly croaked out, \"I forgot how Golducks taste.\" He licked his lips and shoved Gold down his maw, stretching over his struggling meal as Gold cried out in muffled tones. To defy the duck even more, Hex clasped his hand around Gold's cock, actually giving Gold the handjob Hex wasn't allowed to give. Gold's legs and tail thrashed wildly as the Toxicroak licked over Gold's belly. After a few more gulps, only Gold's tail struck out. Hex chuckled in a rippling suppressed sound as he slid that in like a thick noodle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak burped out a loud juicy belch as he hatefully spoke, \"Oh yeah...I forgot that they taste bad.\" He placed his froggy hands along his bouncing purple belly, jiggling his prey up and down while Gold whined within the acid filled stomach.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex shook the thought away, no matter how much he enjoyed it and looked back to Gold. The Toxicroak closed his eyes as he smiled at the Golduck, cupping a hand atop the Golduck's head and rubbing it. \"You probably did stash more than I did.\" Gold smirked back as a Roserade came from the bushes behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEden asked the two, \"Ready to go?\" Hex had actually asked Eden to escort them back to the prairie since she was native to this forest and knew the location of the fields. The Toxicroak just needed to collect the berries he promised to gather so he could meet up with you and Lace. He felt a little excited to be with you again, hoping that you made to the village and back safe and sound. To be honest, he was already expecting you be curled up in some infected's gut, boiling up as it pleasured itself with the struggling Lucario inside it. The Toxicroak was positive if he ever saw you again, the very second of it will be him kissing you and clenching you tightly as he sobbed out tears of joy; Oh, and Jackal too of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was urgent that he told you his recent discovery on the infection, and hurriedly answered Eden, \"Yes, could you show us the way now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded as Gold grumbled, \"...Do we <i>have</i> to bring her along? She's got a big temper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEden spun around with her plant-like face glowing red in ferocity, \"Oh. And you don't?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold began to shine his red forehead jewel in agitation as he hissed back, \"Ya see, it's that right there that makes me second guess your-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex wrapped an arm around Gold's back, placing his hand on the soft shoulder as he pressed the duck to his side to stop him from causing another whiplash spanking scene. \"Don't worry Gold, I won't let her hurt you.\" Hex chuckled as the three began to walk ahead. Eden glared at the duck before huffing to herself, turning her look away to ignore Gold. For some reason, Gold felt like Hex was lying to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes of silent walking, Hex sang out, \"How about we have a conversation to pass the time?\" No one objected or complied with the idea. Eden and Gold swung an iron curtain between the two of them. Gold felt Hex's hand clench tightly around his shoulder, pressuring the Golduck to rub even closer to the Toxicroak's side. \"Gold, why don't you tell me what you were dreaming about last night? It must've been nice since you were humping my leg all throughout it.\" Gold caught Eden smiling, listening in on the question to see how he would answer. He knew that <i>she knew</i> it would embarrass him, and he even suspected Hex knew it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Golduck responded with a smile, knowing how to counteract it. He answered with a smug tone, \"I had deep sweaty sex with a sexy-ass Lapras before she unbirthed my willing body. I orgasmed, like, three times in her womb before I fainted inside the cum filling organ.\" He caught Eden to suddenly gag in sickness as he continued, \"You would think my dick wouldn't be big enough, however in my dream it was the length of my arm and as <i>thick</i> as <i>Eden</i>.\" He was insinuating that she was fat. (Which she clearly isn't.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Golduck noticed the Roserade's face to grow hot, as her retracted finger vines curled into fists as she tried to sustain her temper. Her rage was just what Gold wanted, and she would never let him win. Out of nowhere, a blue blur flashed through the bushes, tackling Hex to ground as the Toxicroak screamed. A recognizable Heracross pinned the frog beneath him, as he chuckled like an evil maniac, \"I finally found you my stupid little slut! Did you miss me?! Did you miss my cock?!? Of course your froggy ass did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRune cackled like an animal as Hex struggled beneath the crazy beetle. Just then, vines quickly wrapped around the Heracross, lifting him off Hex to hover in the air. Rune panicked and yelled, \"Grrrraaaaaaaah! Let me go! Let me go you dumb-fuckers so I can <i>kill</i> this fuckin' frog!\" Hex planted a hand at his heaving chest, scared out of his mind as he looked over at Eden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks Eden...\" The Toxicroak was able to call out. The Roserade looked worried however as she looked back at Hex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those aren't my vines, Hex.\" She answered in an ominous tone. The three look over as the plant tendrils gripping Rune stretched over into a wall of hedges, retracting back to bring the wriggling Heracross into the shrouding vegetation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...No, no, no! <i>Please</i>! <i>Nnnnnnooo</i>-\" His pleas are cut short with garbled speech, as wet smacks and swallowing sounds emit around instead. Out from the bushes came a large pokemon, vibrating the ground some as it stepped into view. It was a large and chubby Tropius, with two Heracross sticking out of its mouth and kicking. Its large fat brown gut protruded out into a nice pudgy sphere, as it stood atop two thick legs with packed brown arms to rub the bulges of Rune's swallowed body. Its long thick neck stretched up as the thriving blue beetle legs sink down after a terrifying gulp. Rune's body forms together inside the Tropius' mighty belly, as it placed its hands to sink its fingers and palms into the soft flesh. Thee Tropius' stomach jiggled madly as it released a suppressed belch to rumble the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three non-infected anthros stared deeply at the massive growing cock expanding out, revealing the long pole of musky brown flesh as a large sac swung below it which contained cum-producing orbs the size of beach balls. Clear slime oozed from the tip as the Tropius reflected its purple eyes, surprised to find three potential meals, toys, or possibly both.</span></div></div>",

Gold was however able to evade the vine descending down towards him, giving the duck a moment of attack to release a cannon shot of water to blast the Tropius which sent the fat beast to drag back a feet beg. It borrowed its tense legs to brace itself from the wet impact, managing to keep its stance from the water attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tropius grinned as it uncrossed its shielding cakey arms, swiping off the foolish water attack that did no damage to the grass-type. However, the Golduck didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect it to, so that only he had given Eden a clean opening to attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tropius\u00e2\u0080\u0099 violet eyes bulged out as the Roserade\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vines twirled around it, spiraling over its chubby brown form into a tight constriction. She mocked the feral by grinning back, as it had done earlier, and squeezed the Tropius to grunt in pain. Eden then forcefully raised her bouquet arms, heaving the infected\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obese body to lift up and arc over the Roserade as she yelled with her swinging motions. The Tropius crashed into the ground with a deafening tremor.  Eden struggled to hoist the Tropius again, forcing the plant creature to slam into the earth once more to cause a deep wail from its weakening body. Gold rushed over to Hex seeing that Eden was capable of distracting the Tropius, finding the frog to groan in disorientation while laying on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak felt his arm being tugged, bringing him back into reality to see Gold clinging to it. The Golduck sneered in the depending moment, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGet up ya dumb toad! Are ya trying to make yourself an easy snack? Get up!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hex and Gold struggled to get him back to a stand, yet they accomplish the task once Hex staggered to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, another explosion of dirt boomed, quaking the ground as Eden tossed the Tropius one last time before giving out. She released her vines and fell to her knees, exhausted from flinging the heavy mass over and over again. The infected Tropius rolled into a tree, smashing its head against the tough trunk. It bellowed a miserable, however angry, tone, shaking its head while it resumes to stand back up. Hex bloated his cheeks, spitting out a venomous sludge bomb to burst at the feral\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face. It howled as it clawed at the purple poisonous goo that stung it eyes, stomping back to ram into the tree yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the fierce shift, the tree broke under the force as the obese brown creature fell atop it, taking it down with it for a final tremor to rumble the earth. It writhed somewhat along the ground until it passed out to the Toxicroak\u00e2\u0080\u0099s venom, earning the team their victory! Gold smirked a cocky smile until Hex hugged the Golduck, picking Gold off the ground, happy just to be alive and not digesting inside the feral\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gut. Eden wiped the sweat off her forehead after rising back up to a full stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glared over at Hex, asking through her soft pants, \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u00a6Did you know Rune?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the Heracross\u00e2\u0080\u0099 name, Hex flashed his look at the Roserade as Gold squirmed in the frog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tight grip, shocked that Eden knew his plausible killer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cY-yes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6I do. He persuaded me into almost having\u00e2\u0080\u00a6eh, intercourse with him before I resisted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hex clenched Gold closer to him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe devoured me with\u00e2\u0080\u00a6his c-cock. I would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve died if it hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been for Gold.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dangling duck ceased his struggles to look directly at Hex in eye level. He questioned, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou resisted? But, you went with that beetle to clearly have\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gold faded off in his statement, seeing that he had misjudged the Toxicroak. Sex wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always on Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind, and that was an eye opener for Gold. The Golduck gave an awkward smile and nuzzled closer into his amphibian friend. Hex opened his mouth, but Gold took away his chance by hissing, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you say anything involving either of our private parts, then the hug ends.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hex zipped his mouth shut, finding amusement that the Golduck practically knew what he was going to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEden walked over to the cuddling couple, returning to the topic, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI see. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t surprise me that he almost got away with it. That psychopath seduces anyone he sees before he rapes and eats them. He does the same thing with infected which is just\u00e2\u0080\u00a6sickly barbaric. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve managed to keep my virginity from him, and as it looks\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d She looked back to see the unconscious Tropius\u00e2\u0080\u0099 belly continue to wriggle, \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u00a6he had this coming to him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three trekked off into their path again, arriving at the prairie to hopefully meet you.</span></div></div>",

Bell had a hand cupped around the inner side of Star\u2019s thigh, tickling around with the hoof to force out loud giggles and wobbles from the cat. The cow slid the hand slowly upward, gaining a little close distance that Star couldn\u2019t control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough her painful snickering squirms, she muttered with an irritated yet joyful voice, \u201cHeh hee hee heh\u2026Bell, stop it! Not right in front of these two. You\u2019ve never been this playful before\u2026hee hee, I said stop it, ha ha ha!\u201d She attempted to swat Bell\u2019s groping hand away, only giving the Miltank all the more reason to pursue further. The cow\u2019s hoof hand scooped under Star\u2019s groin, startling the Luxray into writhing a little more uncomfortably as her chuckling slurred into moans and growls once the hoof fiddled itself around. Jackal\u2019s eyes widened as he looked away, but that couldn\u2019t stop him from hearing the entire process. The quick wet squelches, the cat-like growls, and the bovine behind him, snickering as she pleasured her mate. You looked away with Jackal, yet you noticed a little bulge endeavoring to exit the Typhlosion\u2019s sheath. Jackal grunted as he tried to think unhappy disgusting thoughts. An image of Gold appeared in his mind, and his cock shrank back into his body. Jackal suddenly smiled, letting you wonder what he was thinking about, but your best guess it was something about the lesbians behind him that made him happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar somehow managed to pull Bell\u2019s fondling hand away, assuring the cow, \u201c\u2026Hurr, Bell, please\u2026We can do this when we settle for the night, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBell grinned before replying in a seductive tone, \u201cWe\u2019ve been trapped inside that cabin for far too long. Forgive me that I\u2019m excited to be out in the hot sun with you. Once we\u2019re in our tents afterwards, you\u2019re body is mine for the <i>entire</i> night.\u201d Star blushed and nestled her furry hip against Bell\u2019s side during their walk. The Miltank was about a head or more shorter than the Luxray, standing up straight would bring her line of sight around Star\u2019s shoulders. Even in her stout size, Bell seemed to come out on top is the dominating one in the relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you go blind in one eye? Were you born with it?\u201d Jackal excessively called out, trying to change the subject before his boner returned. You glare at him for such a weird personal question, but he only glares back as the two of you look at the cat for her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave off a soft smile that almost caused you to melt as she spoke, \u201cI don\u2019t mind telling you. When I was just a Shinx in my village in the mountains, we\u2019re all trained strictly as soldiers where gender or age is undivided. Every child had to go through the Apprenticeship, which is what the process was called. It typically continued until you evolved into a Luxio or showed that your capability with electricity was powerful and stable enough.  Our village was strong and disciplined; it was amazing that it had ever been overrun. Anyways, at the end of the Apprenticeship, one must climb the top of the mountain of the range during a storm, and \u2018<i>catch a lightning bolt</i>,\u2019 meaning that we have to be struck by a bolt and send it out before it can damage you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw where this was going. Star stared at you and Jackal as she folded the eyepatch flip up, revealing the foggy pale eye underneath. \u201cI was struck in the eye as I stared up at the storm, waiting for a bolt. At the brink of death, I was more worried that my village would be ashamed of me of my return than of my own safety. I fled; too humiliated to face my friends, teachers, and especially my parents. Heh, I almost starved to death as I trekked from the mountain and to the plains. I luckily found Aldanwood and collapsed in front of the medic hut.\u201d She smiled at the Miltank at her side. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where Bell found me. She cared for me until I got better, but after watching her help others without using harsh laws or violence, I swore to become a nurse like her. She\u2019s raised me ever since then, and here I am, a fully grown Luxray and after fighting that Snorlax, it seems I haven\u2019t let that training in my Shinx years go to waste, eh?\u201d She leaned over and pecked a kiss onto Bell\u2019s cheek, whispering, \u201c<i>Thank you</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back ahead the trail as the cat flipped the eyepatch back down. Something suddenly caught your eye. In the distance, there was a silhouetted figure approaching you, but the fog patches left by the storm were still present.

You felt the large torso move with his bellowing voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlright, get on your knees or I crush your friends like toothpicks!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal snorted at the order as he approached the Nidoking. He looked back to his surprise to find the Luxray, down against the ground with worry gleaming in her eye. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPlease\u00e2\u0080\u00a6just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hurt her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Star begged as Jackal stared back at you. The Nidoking grinned before he pressured his muscles against you and the Miltank, constricting you tightly enough to bark out in misery. Star yelled to Jackal, \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust do what he says!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Typhlosion grumbled as his flames extinguished and rested against his knees. Suddenly, A Nidoqueen pops out from the tall grass and quickly grapples the two surrendering anthros into her thick arms. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGot them, Krade!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She chuckled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrade the Nidoking never ceased his grin as he looked over his caught prisoners. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTheir bodies just look scrumptious! Who do I start with first?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He asked, looking between the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar yelled, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t eat us!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nidoqueen grunted and headbutted Jackal and Star, quickly putting them in unconsciousness. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll think start with this cat. Her furry little body will feel great in my ass.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She dropped the Luxray and Typhlosion to the ground, leaning and squatting over Star to plop her fat rump over the cat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face. She lifted her tail before her anus swallowed in Star\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBell cried out as she struggled within Krade\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grip, shaking her thick body for the Nidoking to look over. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh my, your body has so much meat on it! You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to the best for last my fat cow!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He dropped her and immediately sat atop the Miltank. She struggled harded from beneath his heavy weight, but the Nidoking showed no signs of any trouble holding her down. His obese tongue suddenly lures its way to your face, scraping up over you muzzle to drag thick saliva with it. You gag at the smell as your view is suddenly plopped into his open maw. You were being eaten!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis large arms overpowered your kicks and thrashes as your body is sent down deeper and deeper into the fleshy hot cave. His squelching innards echo around your ears while your chest is being explored by Krade\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tongue. His speech was slightly garbled from your mouth-filling body as he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMmmmmmmm\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.who would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve thought Lucarios tasted so amazing, Nerelle? How\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it coming along for you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rump had already been sucked inside the Nidoqueen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ass for Nerelle to answer back, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have no idea how great she feels! Oh! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m already getting wet\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d The reached her hands to cup over her breasts for her to toss around and clench as the Luxray\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legs and tail swallowed in. Her pussy is lined with pre, beading out as her face grows immensely hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrade finishes gulping your hips down and tops his meal off once your legs slide down his meaty throat. Your footpaws writhe in discomfort as his tongue plays with them, toiling around over your paw pads and slurping them down. You growl in anger as your body collects together within his dank gut. You beat at the tight slimy walls, yelling out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me out! We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to stop the infection!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrade answers with a loud burp and a slapping hand onto his new round belly. He toys with you by juggling the gut around as he taunted back, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah right. Stopping the infection in this prairie? That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where the cure is? You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re simply just mad that we got to you first and now you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re gonna die inside my might stomach. Ferals or not, your bodies will feed me and my sister all the same.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Your ears flip down as you struggle even harder. You constantly wriggle, however nothing seems to work against him. His hands continue to roll over your round prison, pressing in his claw digits to poke at your pathetic form. You were so close into meeting up with Hex and Gold, and this is how you fail your mission? By being easily slid down this Nidoking\u00e2\u0080\u0099s jaws that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even infected. Your power soon begins to deplete, and your only hope is that Hex can carry out your mission for you. You were clearly not able to do such a task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did you know, Hex and Gold were too busy being cock vored and raped by a Tropius in the woods, soon to be nothing more than cum and another feral. The sloshing fluids of the stomach begin to pour into the stomach, showering your whimpering body as you pass out in the massaged Nidoking\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Miltank groaned as her body slid up and down the ground, pumping at a brisk pace as Krade hammered into her body. His thick cock tunneled into her waist, jabbing through her vagina to cause a loud moo from her mouth to jab out. An abdominal bulge protruded from her belly, forcing the cow to feel the rod of heat poke out inside of her, digging around her vaginal walls. She groaned as her udder sloshed with her bouncing gut as the Nidoking continued to rape her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thick hands groped over her large breasts, tossing them around to squirt milk to stream out of the pink nipples. Nerelle chuckled as she rubbed her newly fat gut, sloshing the Luxray inside. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, nothing like another filling meal. The infected had it right with eating others! How can anyone resist swallowing up other? Hey, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hog the cow all for yourself, Krade, cause I want a turn with her body.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nidoking heaved air as his sweat slickened itself over the Miltank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body, pounding her fat jiggling form over and over again to put the cow over her edge. The blushing Miltank yelled as her pussy convulsed with itself. She came to her climax while Krade volcanoed his seed into her love tunnel. Her voice carried out while th Nidoking yanked his ejaculating member out to spurt the ropes of cum over her pulsing body. She moaned as the Nidoqueen mounted on top of her, forced into kissing her mate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ingester for a long durable scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNerelle hugged their thick bodies together, mouth against mouth, boobs against boobs, with tail in tail. Bell groaned unhappily as the Nidoqueen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tongue violated her mouth. Nerelle broke away her kiss, snickering out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour milky hide will feel great in my belly. You can digest away with that little submissive feline.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Nerelle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s maw gaped over the Miltank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head, swallowing the tuckered out cow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head for an easy meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrade lapped his tongue over the Typhlosion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s footpaws, stirring the fire-type awake which was good for him anyway. He loved struggling prey, just like the Lucario he ate.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You were just able to see an outline of what appeared to appear to be a type of bird. You halt, as the rest of your party does the same for whatever was approaching them. The mist suddenly swirled past them, disappearing away from the fierce wind of the avian\u2019s wingspan. You gaze up to find a bird that was easily three times your size, towering over you as it flapped its spiked yellow wings to lower its colossal size down. The sharp feathers fanned out for a terrifying look, as black underlying downery stretched beneath them. An extensive orange beak stabbed out of the bird\u2019s face like a needle, as its orange scaled legs lowered down to rest its large perching feet along the prairie grass in front of your pack, glimmering large pearly talons. To whatever strange part of your mind that was curious enough to look, your eyes focus between the avian\u2019s black feathered thighs to find a bloated ball sac in a shroud of yellow feathers, poking out a meaty red bulge to glisten in the daylight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp at the intimidating bird\u2019s mass, as its red eyes stare down at the four of you. Its deep male tone echoed out around the plain\u2019s hills, \u201cYou, the Lucario. Is your name by any chance Lace?\u201d Your spinal fur jolted as you hide a fearful swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Yes. Why?\u201d You raise your voice out for the giant falcon to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts thin beak suddenly smiled, as the crimson of its eyes shined like fire. \u201cAh, I\u2019ve finally found you!\u201d Just then, a large bird foot came stomping down at your body, smashing into the dirt as you bark in agony. You are jammed forcefully under its sole, with your head being squished in between its toes. Jackal gasped and ignited the flames along his back, growling smoke through his muzzle as the bird presented himself as an enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe avian bellowed out, \u201cAw, you think you can save your little friend? Do any of you even know who I am? I am Herox the Zapdos, the legendary beast of electricity!\u201d The Zapdos craned down to glare down at you, pressing and pulling his large bird foot above you, chuckling out, \u201cIt has come to my master\u2019s understanding that there is a Lucario out to stop the infection. This trampled dog has caused quite the number of foils in my master\u2019s wishes, and has undertaken me with the task of capturing this runt! After just a day of searching, I have finally found you my little pooch.\u201d When Herox mentioned his master, he was implying to the one controlling the ferals!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grumble as you squirm under his foot, unable to move any limbs from his painful leg weight. Star yelled out in anger, \u201cYou\u2019re working for him?! You traitorous bastard!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerox glared to the cat girl, \u201cYou think I asked for this chaos? You think I enjoy being a psychic\u2019s <i>pet</i> when I, of all pokemon, am a legendary? Of course not, but I\u2019ve seen its power, and even I know that I could not defeat it. My master gave me the gracious option to keep my mind if I became a loyal servant. This is only me doing what I\u2019m told so I may survive.\u201d He glared back down to you, \u201cHowever, I tend to enjoy my master\u2019s orders. I get to eat all the puny pokemon I want and slide them down my cock if I wish to make them into my frothy seed. How do you like it down there, Lace? If you submit, I might possibly let you and your friends live. I can take you to my master, who would be very pleased to meet you and punish you for your misdeeds, or I could infect you and allow you to join our wondrous campaign.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder under the smooth foot, wondering which option was better or more merciful. Jackal, however, jumped out to the Zapdos to howl out a ball of fire to your captor. Herox huffed and tilted his head for the attack to miss while spreading his gaping wingspan, erupting a web of bolts of lightning to scatter over your friends and shock them violently. Even Star cried out in pain as the voltage overwhelmed her. She toppled to her hands and knees as Bell slammed down on the ground, heaving air as smoke puffed from her body. Jackal tiredly gagged as his body was smothered in burnt smudges, forcing the Typhlosion to fall upon his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerox bursts into laughter, watching your team fall from a single attack. If you struggled to survive, he could easily snap you up in that beak of his. You just watched his horrifying power, and he just mentioned he was incapable of defeating the psychic pokemon. How would it be possible for you to do it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whimpered as you came called out your plea\u2026</span></div></div>",

The Zapdos frowned at your statement, receiving an emotional stab to its heart. Herox lifted his taloned foot, only to bring it down upon your body for a bone-cringing stomp. You cried out as the scaled sole squished your body deeper into the gravely earth. It slowly shifted side to side to grind your writhing form around, forcing more gags and painful coughs from your lungs. It was entirely impossible to breathe, and your friends were forced to watch in their weakened states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerox frown transitioned into a smile. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, if I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pleasure myself with infecting you willingly, then I suppose you get the honor of swimming in my stomach acids then!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He cooed down to you. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut do you have any idea of how good your furry little writhing body feels beneath my foot? I wish there were two of you so I can tie you underneath my soles with rope and wear you all day. Or maybe I could squish that little body of yours to the point where your organs squirt out of your mouth! So many choices, I can hardly decide!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis large hind paw rose up again, pushing back down powerfully to dig you into a bird foot-shaped crater. The ruthless foot rose and fell over and over again, giving the view of the orange smooth sole to shrink and grow in your sight during the stomping barrage. You bark out with each crumble, finding it hard to stay conscious as you struggle in your fleshy prison. Herox laughed while he sent off another storm of bolts, striking your team to cry out from the burning static. Star and Bell fainted under the voltage, but Jackal remained awake through his agonizing pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the Zapdos stomped down at you one final time, allowing your mind to get a jumpstart back into reality.  The taloned paw clenched around your limp body, picking you off the ground so Herox could nip his beak tip onto you. Releasing the curled foot around you, he flung his head up, tossing you high in the air for you to spiral out of control. After the soft ascent came to a stop, gravity worked its way in to cause your descent back down. You watched below at the slimy dark tunnel welcoming you inside. The Zapdos beak had opened up for you to neatly plop into, landing on his tongue for a somehow comfy splat. The thick tongue cushioned your fall, but your life would still find its end as the Zapdos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 mouth muscles rolled over your body to blanket you in his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMmmmmmm\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Herox mumbled through is wet licks. He loved your taste. Suddenly, another tiny ball of fire shot out, hitting his chest but only to die out. The feathers were barely smudged. Through the black outline eyes, Herox spotted the Typhlosion continuing his efforts to save you. Within the beak, you were swallowed down the Zapdos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 throat, slipping further towards the stomach. You could hear the muffled bubbling emitting from it, scaring you into how your life came to this point. The valve opening constricts you into the slimy chamber, dumping you into a large pool of fizzling enzymes. You splash in the spacious stomach, as it begins to wobble closer to you as you weakly bob the hot fluids. They squish around you, finding their way up your body until you are fully immobilized in the fleshy walls. You can feel the boiling liquids tingle around your saliva-coated fur, foaming at your meaty hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Herox bellowed another laugh after an echoing belch. He swatted the soot of his feathered torso with his large wing before chuckling out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI take it that you want your friend back. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m surprised you would bother to follow someone as weak as yourself to stop such an apocalypse. His pathetic quest ends here, in my sloshing belly!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Her poked a feathery digit at a wobbling lump poking from his abdomen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSee this insignificant bulge? That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your little leader, begging for mercy by a mere pet of the overlord. His body was very delicious, especially after I tenderized his meaty body with my stomps. Would you like to get a closer look at your friend?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal widened his tear filled eyes, finding himself engulfed into darkness. He screamed and hollered, wriggling in pure fear as fleshy oozing walls dragged him deeper into the pitch black emptiness. A life inflicting swallow rumbled around him, sending his struggling tired form down to join your demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The two wobbling lumps whined as the fluids overtook them, giving the Zapdos a pleasuring shiver of arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStruggle all you want my food, but you will soon become nothing more but the pudge of my gut\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d He looked down at the fallen Luxray and Miltank remaining unconscious, disappointing Herox greatly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no fun eating them or torturing them when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not awake. Ah, I know! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take you to my master! We could use a few more ferals in the mountains, and maybe you can get promoted into being my cock massagers. After all, I took care of that pesky Lucario and most of his pack, so why not earn a little prize out of it. I look forward to you, my soon-to-be slaves\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clutched his taloned feet around the two faint bodies, picking them up with him as he took to the skies. The lay cradled atop the three scrunched toes with a back toe on top to lock them in place to avoid falling. A loud gurgle emanated from the Zapdos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 belly, giving Herox a joyful smile in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lucario and Typhlosion quickly digested in the large stomach as the Zapdos disappeared over the mountain pass.</i></span></div></div>",

Bruises patched across most of your body, and a line of blood wept down the lower lip of your muzzle. The Zapdos had his back turned to you, too gullible about your defeat and submission by his own cockiness, and it will be his downfall. Pressing your hands hard against the ground, you are barely capable of raising your upper body to a struggling upright position as your leg muscles scream in the pain of the slightest of motions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou growl out, chomping your teeth together with eager force as you command your legs to stand. Doing so, you manage to get to a full stand that groaned in misbalance. Herox was completely distracted in dominating your fellow followers by eliciting yet another web of voltage, electrocuting them over and over as he cawed in amusement. Glimmering aura seared along your arms from your anger, flaring powerfully as your stammering steps begin to increase in speed. The pain begins to numb away as you develop you run into a full-on sprint towards the large bird, growling out as a cape of aura begins to crackle with ignited energy once you approach Herox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zapdos cooed as he raised a taloned foot to crush Star who was writhing in her paralyzed state, crammed into familiar footprint shaped crater you had been jammed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou puny animals haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the slightest comprehension of how weak you are. How can you stop something as grand as my master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plans if you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t-<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><i>Aaaaaaaaccck</i></font>!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blue explosion erupted from the Zapdos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 backside, injuring his spine to initiate a fur spiking howl of agony. He twisted around, panicking as he flapped his massive wings in a wild manner to send random bolts to shoot out uncontrollably. Smoke fumed from his back while Herox continued to look around for his sudden attacker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to him, you were had clung onto his fan-feathered tail, holding tightly as you unleashed another aura blast to the backside of his head. Herox shrieked again as his wings cupped around the burning wound enflamed around his cranium, only to receive a ball of fire blast into his open crying beak. Jackal smirked to see his attack hit his target, dashing over to help Star up. The Luxray groaned when lifted from her diminished crater, holding her head with her eye closed as her body jolted from Herox\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attacks still. Jackal brought back up to her feet until he returned battle realizing she was okay. The Typhlosion ordered to take after Bell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s care in the meantime, seeing that Star was an electric type and could barely move. The Luxray nodded and stammered over to the fallen cow. Jackal growled as he crouched down to all fours, pouncing out and grasping Herox\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ignited his mane at full ferocity, singeing the Zapdos even greater while your punches pummeled against his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ambush was too sudden for Herox to have noticed, placing the large bird into a mad panic as he flailed his body around. He flung his tail, forcing your body to fly off as he released electricity throughout his body, shocking Jackal to yell and let go. The electrocuted Typhlosion crashed into the ground as darkness shrouded suddenly surrounded. He looked up to see the darkened outline of a large parching foot that was fully prepared to smash underneath the taloned paw. Herox\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice boomed, \u00e2\u0080\u009c<i>You pesky, stupid, vile brats! I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give you the honor to even slide down my gullet. I will squish you all like the grime you are!</i>\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal winced and waited for the talons to come down and crush him, however, a sudden whipping sound echoed out. Jackal peeked his eyes open to see vines gripped around Herox\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ankles, only to yank them back to cause the large Zapdos anthro to topple down. He crashed into the ground to both your and Jackal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surprise, investigating the plant tendrils to stretch down over to a Roserade, and for a bigger surprise, Hex and Gold were standing next to her!</span></div></div>",

Again, bolts of lightning scattered out from his feathers, sending the energized matter through the vines to shock the Roserade violently. She cried a short yet harsh shrill from the hurtful voltage, but she managed to sustain her grip around the Zapdos\u2019 legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoever she was, you were just glad she was willing to help out. Her strength seemed like she could take a few hits and barely wince. With Herox down, Hex rushed in with Gold towards the stable bird simultaneously, releasing their attacks as they passed the Zapdos\u2019 sides. Gold splattered water over most of the avian\u2019s body, dousing the electric feathers to shock themselves instead! The Toxicroak jabbed his poisonous knuckle claws into the bird\u2019s side, raking down a long cut as he ran past Herox while spitting out multiple balls of venom over the Zapdos\u2019 wet form. Herox growled from the counter-attacks, shocking the Roserade one last time to force her vines off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe howled and retracted back the long tendrils to fall to the ground, twitching harmfully in quick spasms. Herox kicked Gold away, as his wing swatted Hex into the ground. He growled cruelly before threatening, \u201cHrrrregh\u2026hrrrregh\u2026You\u2019re the other fools following this mutt? Fine, then you can <i>die</i> with this mutt!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the scene ensue, you pack together an array of aura into your palms, charging up a cannon to unleash at the Zapdos. There others were compliant enough to continue to battle, charging the Zapdos again through his storm of electricity. Gold fell to the ground, unable to control his body from the sheer shock as the Roserade toppled down with him. Jackal managed to release a flamethrower, breathing the flames over Herox to force him back a few steps, before Jackal himself passed out in the electricity. Hex shot out a few poison sting darts, jabbing up Herox\u2019s legs all until a long orange beak came down atop the frog. Hex croaked in horror as he found himself the slimy jaws of the Zapdos. Herox gave out muffled laughs as he licked over the Toxicroak\u2019s body, feeling the frog squirm and writhe in the squelching mouth muscles. The tall avian gave a deep swallow, gulping down Hex!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a thunder bolt attack came jolting towards Herox, bursting the ball of electricity into the legendary\u2019s abdomen. Herox quickly sputtered from the sudden damage, coughing out Hex\u2019s slicken body to hit the ground as the Herox tried to recuperate from the attack. He stared down at Star, finding the sparks jolting from her hands. Her legs muscles gave out, crumbling the Luxray to tumble down along with everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHreh ha ha ha ha ha! Oh my, I didn\u2019t expect the whole lot of you to pack such a punch, but I\u2019m afraid my title still stands as a god of thunderstorms. It\u2019s going to take more than just electrified water, a little poison, and a few flames to take me down.\u201d He chuckled out. He approached the fallen members, ready to consume his large dinner before he looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere you were, with a glowing pact of obscene amounts of aura, ready to be released. Herox opened his beak, but you cared not for what he had to say. You roar out as an exploding beam of your energy jets towards the Zapdos, striking his chest to drag the colossal bird along the prairie flooring for an extensive stretching crater line. The cannon of aura even was able to shoot Herox straight through a large hill before the beam lost its contained line, exploding to send a gigantic bubble of smoke and blue flames to scatter. You tremble to your knees, watching the tower of smoke fume from behind the demolished hill. After a few loud breathing moments, your waiting finally ends as wings strike out from the burning rubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerox screeched loudly, with patches of his feathers missing and bloody scraped along his chest. He heaved the death-like air, coughing out as he struggled to climb out of the debris. His bloody red glare stared into you again, filled with unimaginable rage as his wings fluttered for support. \u201c<i>\u2026Hreeegh. Hreeegh. Hreeegh\u2026Y-y-you mangy dog. I\u2019ll g-get you for th-th-this\u2026Just you wait\u2026With the aid of m-my master, I will r-raise an entire army against you. Your death will be my entire existence in life, as well as my master\u2019s, so b-be prepared for your last pr-prayers, Lace\u2026</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glared his deathly gaze over at your party, who seem to be adjusting back up again. The wounded Zapdos took flight, wavering over to you and your team once more. \u201cBut not before I steal some of your precious friends to use them against you later!\u201d His talons opened up, ready to capture any of who tread close to them. You dive to the ground, feeling the incredible force of the wind pass by you. You look up to see Herox disappearing over the horizon\u2019s edge, vanishing in the thick white clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle was over. You look around to see if Herox actually did capture anyone, but to what you saw, no one seemed to be gone. Hex had Gold clutched in his arms as they lay in the grass, which must have meant he pushed the Golduck to the ground with him to save them both. You were surprised the duck wasn\u2019t struggling to get out of another male\u2019s grip. Jackal had Star underneath him, meaning the same situation likewise. The Roserade kneeled back up, shaking her head from the disorientation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, sorry\u2026\u201d Jackal stuttered to say out loud. He suggestively positioned himself over the Luxray girl, pinning her to the ground as she blushed in response. He wobbles off her as she stands up quickly, frantically searching around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Bell?\u201d She asked. Only you and Jackal looked around; the others had no clue who she was talking about. She asked again, except much more scared and loud, \u201c<i>Where\u2019s Bell</i>?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did she know that the Miltank was in Herox\u2019s clutches, tightly wound in his feet as she struggled with weak force. Herox grinned at his prisoner\u2019s squirms. He would find a good place to infect her, and find the right moment to use her\u2026</span></div></div>",

The next few chapters are nothing but boring character dialogue!)</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Your teeth sink into the blue flesh, tearing it away from its source to chew the juicy substance in your jaws. The Oran berry's flavor seeps in, filling your tasteful hunger with great satisfaction. The flavor practically rejuvenates you, giving you the needed strength to continue your berry binge. You scarf down the fruit desperately as you rest along a rock, chomping down the Oran berry until someone sits next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex plopped his rump to your side, stating, \u201cOh my, I didn\u2019t know you loved Oran berries that much. If I had known that then I would\u2019ve collected more for my strong little friend. May I sit next to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded and the Toxicroak fully relaxed back, having a berry in his own hand while you replied, \u201cI\u2019m completely drained of energy. That aura cannon burned up all the strength I got from that Pidgeot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPidgeot?\u201d Hex asked before setting his berry down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waved your paw in a gesture, \u201cJust another infected I was forced to eat. Jackal and I met quite the number of them on the way to the village. We were lucky enough to stumble onto Aldanwood where Bell and Star nourished us back onto our feet. How was your trip? You really did gather a resourceful amount of berries.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to talk to you about that.\u201d You instantly felt the Toxicroak\u2019s arms wrap around you, pulling you in for yet another Hex hug. This time however, he actually planted his lips onto yours! You grunt in surprise as Hex seemed to enjoy the moment a bit too well. He retracts his head, emding his kiss before he smiled brightly, \u201cSorry, but I\u2019m thrilled to know you\u2019re safe and sound. I\u2019m simply keeping a promise to myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026No, that\u2019s alright. To be fair, I\u2019m really glad to see that you\u2019re doing okay too.\u201d You answer. You swallow the rest of your ration of food and ask Hex, \u201cSo, did Gold give you any trouble?\u201d You knew the two were off at bad terms with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex chuckled as he continued to eat, \u201cOh, actually, he\u2019s been quite the traveling partner. I presume that we have found a common ground, and Gold actually has a\u2026tender side to him.\u201d That really surprised you. You wondered if you would ever get Gold to like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the short Roserade approached you. She raised a bouquet arm to you, welcoming, \u201cYou must be Lace. Hex has told me a little about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise a forepaw, unsure how the shake would play out until her vines suddenly protrude out from the flowers, softly wrapping around your hand for a brief tug. \u201cUm, has he now?\u201d You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives off a slight bow. \u201cMy name is Eden. I led Hex and Gold so they could safely leave the forest, although there was a run-in on an infected, but nothing we couldn\u2019t handle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHappy to hear it.\u201d You gratefully respond. However, Eden suddenly leans in closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI meant to ask you, Lace. You wouldn\u2019t mind if I tagged along, would you? I\u2019d prefer stick with a group then try to fend for myself in an infected-filled forest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex smiled brightly, like a child and this meant he could have a friend come over to his house to play. The Toxicroak urged you, \u201cThat would be delightful! Lace, Eden\u2019s abilities would greatly aid our long task, and the more pokemon we get to go onboard with this, the better.\u201d He clasped his hands over yours, tightening over them desperately. You were a little discomforted by the sudden panic, but you had little reason to deny Eden or why you even had to make that decision. It was Eden's choice, yet everyone made it seem like you were in charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course she can\u2026\u201d You said. Hex cheered and wrapped an arm around your back with his other over Eden\u2019s, pulling the two of you in for a group squeeze. The Roserade awkwardly smirked and you winked at her, as if to say, <i>this happens a lot so get used to it</i>. Hex undid his arm bind before he sat up from the rock. \u201cNow if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a Typhlosion to kiss for a safe return and a Luxray to meet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could leave, you call out, \u201cBe careful around her Hex. She\u2019s been through a lot.\u201d He nodded and ventured over to the other circle of party members, as they had been gathered around a campfire that Jackal had prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEden stole Hex\u2019s spot on the rock to look at you, \u201cSo, do you really think you\u2019ll be able to stop this infection? I mean, everyone wants to, it\u2019s just that, it seems like it\u2019s impossible, you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched the others laugh and converse over the fire, finding comfort that they're living in stability. You smile and answer, \u201cYeah, I think we can.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Jackal struggled to push the snuggling frog away without hurting him. His mouth finally disconnected with Hex\u2019s, allowing the Typhlosion to cough out any saliva that may have mixed between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Erugh\u2026C\u2019mon Hex! What was that for?\u201d Jackal yelled, scooting back some from the frog\u2019s presence. He, Gold, and Star circled around a pile of burning debris Jackal had set up, all until Hex randomly embraced the fire-type. Gold snickered whereas Star said nothing. In fact, she was off in her own world as she sat along the grass, looking away from everyone. Her legs curled up against her chest with her arms crossed over to hold herself in place. She stared off into the sky\u2019s edge as her head leaned against her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex gave off his signature smirk as he sat incredibly close to the distraught Typhlosion. He answered in a coy tone, \u201cI\u2019m simply showing my gratitude for your return and for Lace\u2019s protection. I can\u2019t tell you how happy I am to see the two of you in one piece.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal grumbled, \u201cA simple \u2018<i>nice to see you</i>\u2019 would\u2019ve sufficed.\u201d Jackal gasped as an amphibious purple finger probed at his abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJackal, is that a little pudge I feel? Are you going to let yourself go and become one of those adorable chubby types?\u201d Hex began to suggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal let his face envelop into a florescent red, arguing back, \u201cWha\u2026No! It\u2019s just left over from an infected yesterday evening!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then why are you still eating berries? Shouldn\u2019t you be full?\u201d Hex pointed at the Cheri berries Jackal had clasped in his hands. Jackal winced at the comment, looking at the handful of fruit. He grumbled as he poured them back into Hex\u2019s bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex\u2019s smile quickly degraded into a depressing scowl. He tried to give back the berries, apologizing, \u201cOh, Jackal, please don\u2019t put them back! I was only kidding. <i>Sigh</i>\u2026I\u2019m sorry. I went too far on that one, but please do take them back. If you\u2019re hungry then you need to eat.\u201d The Toxicroak regretted his statements as Jackal stared into his sincere golden eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolled his own in return and grabbed only a few of the berries back. Hex smiled as he got back up. Only after taking a few steps, he plopped down next to Star, who at this point continued her silent isolation. Hex sighed once more and placed his hand on her shoulder. She shrugged it quickly off. It was obvious she still mourned her loss and will never bother to talk, but Hex was positive for her to hear him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I may still be wriggling around in a Zapdos\u2019 belly right now if it weren\u2019t for you. That thunderbolt really packed a punch, and at the right moment.\u201d He mentioned. She barely moved as a response. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve introduced myself. My name is Hex, and that brat over there is Gold.\u201d He pointed at the Golduck that replied with a flirtatious grin at Star. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Hex was kind enough to offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe mumbled after a few long moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, Hex continued to smile, \u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t quite catch that. Did you say <i>Rawr</i>? I mean, I know you\u2019re a cat and everything but I would have guessed that your parents would have been a little more creative than that.\u201d And there it was, what Hex was attempting so hard to achieve. Through the darkness that Star had tucked her head into was a faint smile, endeavoring to hold itself back. The Toxicroak continued his joke, prepared to see her finally come out from her symbolic hole. \u201cI mean, thank goodness I wasn\u2019t named after what natural born noises I make. What child should be cursed into being named Croak? It has a different meaning to the name if you know what I\u2019m talking about. However, Gold I think your name should\u2019ve been Quack though. Its separate meanings fit you perfectly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Gold hissed in response. Jackal chuckled in return when all of a sudden; a female voice snickered with them. The three glance over to the Luxray, watching her shoulders tremble as her voice rippled through her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer faint smile showcased itself to everyone once she lifted her head. She looked at Hex with her eye, repeating, \u201c\u2026I said my name is <i>Star</i>.\u201d Her voice softly carried out in just above a whisper\u2019s octave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s more like it. You certainly saved my skin with the legendary, and I must simply show my gratitude.\u201d He got down to his knees, staring up at Star before asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite kind of berry. Just name it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar focused on the frog, using her soft voice again, \u201c\u2026I like Nanab berries.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNanab berries it is.\u201d The Toxicroak sung. He pillaged his bag and plucked out a few of the orange and yellow fruits, taking the long segments over to the Luxray. After handing them over, she started to nibble them down slowly as Hex placed his hand against her back. She didn\u2019t force it away this time. As the cat munched down her snack, Hex tried to comfort her feelings. \u201cI lost my sister a few days ago when she became infected. I luckily stopped the feral that was\u2026doing things to her, but I was too late when it had started its, orgasm. A single drop of that infernal seed was still able to corrupt her and steal her away from me. And for awhile, I was so infuriated, not at the infected, but with myself for not having been able to come to her rescue sooner. I had trouble in dealing with her loss, not knowing what chaos she would ensue or what her fate would ever be. However, the only way I could distract myself from her was knowing that I could still save her. If we succeed into stopping this psychic soon, then I can finally reunite with my sister. That's what drives me. I'm sure you'll find your drive soon enough for your friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar swallowed the bit of fruit in her mouth, answering in a fearful sound, \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if she was turned into an infected. That damn Zapdos could\u2019ve eaten her already and\u2026.then\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex tensed his hand, caressing his fingers along her spinal fur, \u201cThen the only thing you can do is either let yourself fall down into depression as you await the day the infected find you, or hope that your friend is safe and find a cure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar nudged closer to Hex, refusing to eat the remainder of her food. \u201c\u2026It isn\u2019t f-fair\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak patted her back as he nuzzled with her. \u201cI know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mean time, Gold scooted closer to Jackal to whisper in an envious tone, \u201cHow do gay men always woo the girls better than straight men?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeats me.\u201d He replied before chomping down on some fruit. He looked over to you who was sitting with Eden, talking together about something he couldn\u2019t hear. \u201c<i>Beats me</i>.\u201d</span></div></div>",

After arriving at the camp set, Jackal pats his hand to his side, beckoning you to sit beside him. You plop down as he leisurely lazes down to prop his torso up by his arms. \u201cI\u2019m a little famished from the Zapdos battle today and I\u2019m having trouble with eating these berries\u2026\u201d He gives a single wink, gesturing of what he was implying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForced into doing what he says, you take a Cheri berry into your palm, raising it over his mouth to feed the Typhlosion. His hand suddenly grabs your wrist powerfully, squeezing as he threatens, \u201c<i>Slowly</i>.\u201d You sigh as you lower the red fruit softly into his mouth. His front teeth bite down to chip it off the vine tip and chews the berry with joyful delicacy. Gold raises a brow, including Hex as the two stared at you. What on earth had happened in the plains yesterday for you to randomly do this? That\u2019s your best guess in what they were thinking. Star remained having her head nestled against the Toxicroak\u2019s chest, struggling to stay awake as Hex\u2019s warmth was to calming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal murred after you plopped another berry into his mouth, letting Hex have his moment, \u201cI would\u2019ve figured Lace being the dominant one in the relationship. What changed between the two of last night? Did you finally sleep together and find out that Jackal actually takes top?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your hand inches away from Jackal\u2019s face, you could feel the hot temperatures expelling from it. His face had turned red again, except the brightest that you had ever seen it from the beginning of your trip. His voice growled in an evil sound, \u201cI\u2019m going to be generous enough to <i>not</i> kill for saying that. But mark my words, toad, I have <i>ways</i> of revenge if you make such a snide comment again. I\u2019m not <i>sleeping</i> with Lace, I\u2019m not his <i>boyfriend</i>, and I\u2019m not <i>gay</i>. <i>Got it</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex waved his hand. \u201cYep, your aggressiveness shows you\u2019re the dominant one.\u201d The Typhlosion\u2019s mane ignited. Out of nowhere, he puffed out a large cloud of smoke, enveloping Hex\u2019s face. He gagged out while releasing Star to fall against the ground. He coughed and struggled for clean air, chuckling out, \u201cOkay, I deserved that too.\u201d Star crossed her arms over her legs again, returning to her sulking state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJackal, watch yourself.\u201d You warned him. Jackal grunted and laid back down, doing his best to hold back his temper. \u201cNow before we kill ourselves, we need to know our next tactic. Star asked if we could show her to Redeemer\u2019s Grotto in return for helping me and Jackal.\u201d You looked over to the mourning cat. \u201c\u2026Do you still want that?\u201d She paused until nodding. \u201cWell, once we drop off Star, we can inform the Village Chief all that we know about the infection. I\u2019ll request a few soldiers to help us once we scale up the mountains from there to reach the psychic. We approach the psychic, interrogate it for whatever it may know and probably kill it for its actions. It\u2019s not exactly a great plan, but its all I got to face something that we don\u2019t know about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone seems to nod as Hex raises a hand. He states, \u201cI say a good checkpoint to reach is Draxius\u2019 tent. We can settle there before it gets dark and head directly back to Redeemer\u2019s Grotto. I have recently discovered an issue revolving around the infection.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears perk up. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you once we reach the tent.\u201d Hex assures you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen we should clear up camp as soon as possible. I have no doubt Herox will send out his reinforcements to come searching for us.\u201d You say. Everyone agrees and begins to pack.</span></div></div>",

The campfire was put out quickly and everyone had collected their gear together a little too eagerly. Figuring that they could all stay in the humble abode and cozy setting of Draxius\u00e2\u0080\u0099 security, many were ready within mere minutes. The venture through the rest of plains wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very life threatening or time consuming either. Yes, there were a few encounters with infected such as a Salamance, a Ninjask afterwards, and later a Staraptor, however, seeing that the feral had to face six opponents at the same time, they were sent fleeing the scene quickly. You were quickly making progress through the patchy forest when yet another feral had attacked.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ninetales growled in animosity as her bundle of tails thrash in a mad spree. Jackal had pinned the purple-eyed kitsune down, licking his lips as he eyed her like a feral would. Star and Eden looked away in disgust, waiting for the Typhlosion to get over with it as Gold locked his hungry gaze in jealousy. Hex managed to comfort the girls as they locked in closer with him, while Jackal had ordered you to hold her legs and tails down, (which was not an easy task.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mouth rolled over her muzzle, taking in her head as her feminine body began to slide into his throat. The Typhlosion murred at his easily caught meal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flavor, licking over her bright fur as her meaty figure relentlessly slid down his gullet. You scoffed at Jackal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pleasure, unwillingly noticing Gold fingering over his sheath as the naked female was quickly gulped down. Releasing your pinning section, only a few tails managed to remain wriggling out from the fire-type\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bloated maw all until they too were slurped into his stomach. He blurted out a good belch before his hands slapped around the sides of his belly, wobbling it happily as his prey struggled inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll teach her\u00e2\u0080\u00a6!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jackal gloated out as he massaged his bouncing stomach. Star and Eden release Hex, and continue to follow the frog as the three pass the newly fat Typhlosion, ignoring him in return. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAw c\u00e2\u0080\u0099mon! You make it look like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m the bad guy! She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s was infected and she could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve snatched someone up or called for more of her beasty friends to show up. I say I did more good than harm!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold walked by him, having trouble with a boner. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYa could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve waited awhile so we could give her a nice welcoming party, if ya catch my drift.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Golduck snickered. Just then, vines whipped around and slapped the backside of Gold\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head painfully hard. He quacked out loud as he looked at Eden who glared at him for his evil comment. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u00a6I hate that stupid woman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That mumbling comment was rewarded with a second whipping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex brushed away a branch, opening his hand to point to a field. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere it is my friends, Draxius\u00e2\u0080\u0099 camp.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The two females blew a sigh in relief in knowing the walking trip was over. They day had already reached sunset from your abrupt sleep, traveling, Herox, and battles for the trip back to the Drowzee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home. The tent was still incredibly large with smaller tents connected to the four corners. Tall torches lined the entrance that was concealed with a wooden pallet, where your team would soon arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex knocks against the door as the familiar slot opens along the door. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe would like to see Master Draxius concerning the infection.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hex informed Gyro. The Hypno\u00e2\u0080\u0099s signature blank expression nodded as the slit closed. You wondered if you had to go through the entire process again. All of a sudden, you heard the Drowzee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice carry out through the carpet walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGyro! Show some respect! You should know that these guests have the right to enter or leave as they please! Honestly, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like you lack any form of character or empathy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The slot opened up again, revealing Draxius\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lowered calm eyes. He must have been standing tippy-toe style to even reach his line of sight through the door sliver. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! Quite the revelation! It is my favorite band of traveling adventurers. Please, do come in!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door unlocks, and everyone slowly pours in. The rooms are all walled by curtains hooked into the clothed ceiling, with lanterns to scatter the place for a luminescent tranquility vibe that lit the tent. Gyro, as always, stood without any form of clothing, which was perfectly normal in your world. Whereas for Draxius, the Drowzee displayed a navy-blue hooded robe with Unknown symbols long it, patterning down for an elegant formal appearance. The psychic dipped his head, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWelcome Hex and Lace. What brings you back into my happy residence?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind, I would like for us to converse at the main room over the table.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Toxicroak asked as he nodded his head back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, indeed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Drowzee ordered Gyro to show them your group the way, as you were led to a flat square table within the largest center room of the tent. There, to your surprise, was a female anthro Abra, who was quite tall for her stage form. She was just as tall as you. She sat along the edge of the wooden desk, lightly swishing her tail side to side. Her body was mostly covered in crimson sashes with the same Unknown shapes Draxius wore. The dress-like fabric lowered down to the straw sandles tied around her feet. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEveryone, this is Yuli. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fellow pokemon that I have recently been discussing what you have learned about the contamination so far. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a powerful and diligent psychic who I deem worthy to help us in our rebellion against the infected. Now, I make it that you have recently discovered something, Hex?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes Draxius.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Toxicroak answered, kneeling at the table. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt has come to my attention that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already infected.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears stab upward as Jackal abruptly yells, \u00e2\u0080\u009c<i>What</i>?!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex resumed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBefore the infection, oral vore was as natural as blinking for carnivorous pokemon. It is only until now that vore has evolved. Whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s oral, anal, vaginal, or urethral, non-infected have a sudden instinct for it and use it will. Honestly, how many of us typically ate living things whole before the infection had presumably began?\u00e2\u0080\u009d No one answered, however, Draxius raised his hand in response with a creepy smile. You shuddered from what that meant. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you see now? The psychic has already sent impulses to our brains that suggest vore and sexual seduction are simply reasonable things. It makes it easier for the ferals to collect their prize, be it a nice stuffed belly or a new infected to trail with it. Whoever we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dealing with had plenty of time to come up with this, and their dastardly plans have destroyed many of our villages and families in such a cruel fashion. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re infected, but the only way the psychic can actually control our minds, is by a physical connection. And what is the easiest part of the body that can easily disperse into another? Their fluids, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where they kick in. Once they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in you, the psychic is technically a part of you, which makes you exceptionally susceptible to its whims. It has also come to our attention that Herox the Zapdos is working for the one who plagues our land.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c<i>I could\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve told you that</i>.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yuli the Abra stated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was the first legendary to fall under the disease creator. His first order was to dispose of the other legendary birds, Embis the Moltres, and Terra the Articuno. They were devoured by Herox, and the Ho-oh and Lugia remain as infected ferals that patrol the northern mountains, guarding Herox\u00e2\u0080\u0099s master along with other non-infected followers that send out the psychic signals. I do not yet understand why this creator has sent this disease for such an indescribably reason, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m certain we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find out if your team continue their pursuit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex nodded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe defeated Herox once, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be sure to finish him next time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxius slowly clapped his hands together. He answered in a sly grin, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou never cease to bewilder me, Hex. You seem to have flipped this infection over in a matter of a week. I congratulate you and wish you the best of luck!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He suddenly rose his pudgy form up, proclaiming, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I see that all of you are quite tired from your long travel. I have a few rooms open for you to unpack your things. Stay as long as you wish! I cannot have my proud fighters weak or worried!\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span></div></div>",

Only a large futon was placed as piece of furniture. Anything else was just a candle lying in a plate. Jackal groaned as his heavy mass tumbled onto the cushion, convulsing its plushy form around his fat belly. He began to rub it again as he asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, drop the bag and help me with this Ninetales, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s giving me a hard time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You grumble as you set your satchel down.

Go find someone else who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take your company, like Hex or the lesbian chick!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He growled. You were shocked to see his reaction, but he was clearly serious. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI said <i>get out</i>.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say a word as you pick your satchel back up and exit the room. But before you left, you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but notice the small member hardening under Jackal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concealing belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you were kicked out of Jackal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room tonight, and must find a replacement. Everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s image popped into your head for a potential bedmate. Gold was out of the question and Eden was a complete stranger. So was the Abra girl and Draxius gave you the plain creeps. Star was still depressed and wanting her alone time and Hex seemed a little touchy, especially at night. You scanned the main tent room that led to all the others, wondering which one to pick. To make matters worse, you had quite the uncomfortable bulge trying to sprout out between your legs. This whole talk of vore, seduction, sex, and belly rubbing has suddenly made you a little horny. Hex was probably right on his theory of already being infected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>(The next couple of choices will be a style reappearing later in the series.

Hers hums disappear, giving you the cue to move inside. You brush away the curtain concealing her room and enter, finding Eden with a mirror, using her vines to hold it in place behind and little above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA joyful smile glimmered out from her face, all before she cheered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, Lace! Perfect! You can help me with this atrocious fold at the back of my head. It seems that a flower petal was creased back which is absolutely annoying me from its pesky misbalance. It won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop poking me and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m on the verge of just ripping the entire petal out! Would you be a dear and fold it back before I literally lose my head?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at the plant woman for a bit before nodding bashfully. You set your satchel down and walk over to her backside. She was right, a flower petal was out of distortion. You clasp a hand over its edge, bending it back upright to entice a giggle from Eden by the ticklish feeling. She breathed a sigh of relief afterwards, thanking you, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, it feels better already. Thank you, Lace, for fixing that. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell you how annoying it felt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo problem.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You answer back. She sets the mirror back down and twirls around to face you, giving you a good view of her body for you to finally analyze. She was short, and just about Gold\u00e2\u0080\u0099s height. Her backside was caped with two long leaflets where as her head adorned the white rose your recently perfected. Her arms were stretched out long to end with bouquets of flowers; one red and one blue. Her chest was\u00e2\u0080\u00a6very flat. Breasts weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t present unless your squinted your eyes carefully to make out the bulges of her dark green chest. Lowering down as a curved abdomen that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily fat, however it did distend out for a soft length. Finally, her legs ended with long green studs of rolled leaves, tipping at the end with sharp points instead of any form of feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, how rude of me. You never got to explain why you came in here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Her voice snapped you back in reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, right, well, as it turns out, Jackal kicked me out of his room because of his temper and I need a place to bunk and\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d You begin to say. You wondered how you could finish your sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo you came to me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Eden finished your statement for you. You inadvertently nod as a reply for her to ponder at your presence. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOkay\u00e2\u0080\u00a6um. Alright. The bed seems to be for only one pokemon, but I guess we could\u00e2\u0080\u00a6sleep together.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks.

You are suggestively sprawled over her, having your hands gripped around her \u00e2\u0080\u009cwrists\u00e2\u0080\u009d with your groin hovering above her legs. Her pink eyes widened into open circles, unable to solve the action that just took place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was far too generic. Impossible even. An actual cliche took place, and you're simply blushing at the cheeks as your hormones suddenly tackle your senses, urging you to take her there on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp as you needed to act fast before she suddenly whips you all the way out of the room!</span></div></div>",

Her florescent aroma whisks by your nosetip, tempting you to inhale the natural bliss emitting from her flowered body. Your forepaws couldn't help but savor the waxy feeling on her plant body, lightly grimacing around to feel the sensual texture glide under your pads. The soft contact with her body created a sudden shiver to tremble down your spine, warning you of the arousal trying to poke out from your sheath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...o-okay.\" Eden responded much later throughout the entire awkward moment. You stared into her pink eyes, noticing the curious sparkle to them as neither of you bothered to move. You couldn't hold back. You'd give her a reason to be in this situation. Be it your animal desire or the sudden realization in how beautiful this Roserade proved to be, you lowered your mouth to make contact with each other's lips, connecting your heads together as Eden appeared to be willing to your embrace. Your kiss lasted longer than you expected. The Roserade would dig her tongue over yours, blending your saliva together in a mixture of passionate enticement that funneled across your body. In the spur of the moment, your hands slide up along her sides, feeling her soft texture to elicit groans out of her smooching mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe breaks from the kiss, but never breaks her gaze on you. \"...Eh...So was there a reason...why you just did that?\" Her face was innocent, blushing brightly for it to glow on your own face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'm a little awestruck at the moment...heh...but hey, you returned the kiss so don't go pinning everything on me. M-Maybe it was just our...naturality?\" You respond hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Roserade giggled instantly, chuckling out, \"You're the one who's <i>pinning</i> me. And...naturality? What's that?\" You had no idea what you were talking about. Maybe a better reason would've been <i>instincts</i>, or <i>habits of nature</i>. It mattered not. You rolled Eden with you over the bed, sitting up straight with her at the edge of the bed with dangling legs hanging over its side. The two of you were silent, staring solemnly at the tent walls across from you. You had no idea what to say, or even what to do. At first, you were simply just going to stay here for a simple night of rest, and now look at what you've done!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEden peers her pink gaze over to you, smiling a bit too mischievously. She seemed to know that you were never going to answer her. The Roserade's body quickly advanced you, feeling her mouth lock back together again for another session of making out. You fell back from a light push as she quite thrillingly climbed on top of you during your long and very wet kiss. Her vine fingers began to emit out of their bundles, stretching around to slide among your bodies, intertwining them in a bound moment of bliss and pleasure. You moan a little in return as she lowers her head down to your crotch, wrapping her lips over the head of your doghood. Your fangs clench roughly together as your hands grip the bed tightly, feeling the Roserade's mouth and slick, inner-cheek walls roam over your hardening cock as her vines continued to explore your fuzzy body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou release pants of arousal once Eden sucks and pumps her head over your now fully erect cock, licking its underside feverishly with great power as a vine of her own tickled her lower folds. Your legs twitch while your paws scrunch and stretch from a sudden jump of pleasure volt through your nervous system. Your tail happily wagged under you as her vines held you down somewhat comfortably. Your member certainly was taking Eden's sudden blowjob nicely, feeling its pressure rise to it tips in a fast manner. Her drool dripped from your cock and seeped over your ball sac and groin, forcing you to bark out while your sensation rose to its maximum capabilities. A flood of white goo flooded Eden's mouth as you breathe inexhaustibly to the air around you. Eden swallowed down your hot seed with a little too much effort, enjoying its odd taste and feeling, shivering in excitement as she felt it slide down her throat. She plops her watering mouth away from the spurting cock, licking over her lips before wiping any leftover liquids away with her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had quite the tension to release, didn't you?\" The Roserade asked in a happy octave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough all of the pants of air, you nod and answer, \"...Everyone expects me to be some kind of leader in this.\" You wipe your hands over your face as you sit back up. \"People are looking up to me and expect to know what to do. They want me to take charge, but...I don't know if that's me. I don't want to be known as the leader who everyone has to report to...It just seems like, we're all in this together, you know? I figured we really hadn't the need for a leader.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEden smiles back as her vines retract from your body and back to their hidey-holes. \"...Lace, from what I've seen in just this past day, you have great qualities for leadership. You're able to band this entire group of different misfits together to stop a tragedy, and you've survived along with others for a long time! You have made the biggest impact I have seen a leader produce, so don't worry about being looked up to...It just means we got your back, alright? That battle with Herox for example. Together, we were able to defeat a legendary bird and send him scurrying off to his master. And it was because of you we were able to do that, so never let your self esteem get trampled by anyone, got it?\" You stare into those pink eyes again, discovering yourself to be within one of Eden's hugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin happily, \"I suppose you're right.\" You wrap an arm around her and give her a softer kiss on the cheek. She chuckles a bit as the two of you snuggle under the covers together, switching back and forth in stories of past experiences. You found out how she met Hex and Gold while you explained the day you set out to cure the infection. Without even realizing it, the both of you soon passed out into deep slumber, holding each other for a night to always remember.</span></div></div>",

Quickly making your way over to the next curtain door, you clear your throat for Star to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small shuffle sounded out in return, which must have meant she was still in her quiet phase. Figuring that it would be best to provide her with some company for the night, you push through the cloth and approach the futon. To your surprise, it wasn\u2019t the Luxray sitting in the bed, but was the Abra woman! Yuli stared at you in surprised slanted eyes once you had entered. You accidentally take a fast note of her body\u2019s appearance. Her slender figure was still somewhat concealed in the velvety crimson robe that was tightly wound over her body. The sides luckily were hiding her brown breasts underneath, although, due to the fact that she was laying down away from you, her groin\u2019s underside shined out her golden skin and tempting the nether-lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that she saw you stare at her somewhat naked body, you turn your head with a brief motion, struggling for words, \u201cU-uh\u2026Uh\u2026I-I-I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m terribly sorry, I thought that\u2026you were someone else.

You halt as your ears listen. \u201cDon\u2019t mind me, but I was actually looking forward to have a chat with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a tingling sensation pulsating in your sheath, while you regretfully twist back around, asking, \u201cTo chat about what exactly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe curled a small smirk as she loosened her shoulders. Her silky robe slides down her arms, down to her hips to reveal her gifted orbs. Her breasts sit openly for your eyes to devour their senses into as they perked at quite the large unsuppressed size with dark chocolate nipples pointing outward and hard. Her waistline was unjustifiably arousing as she opened her legs somewhat. The Abra\u2019s tail brushed softly to the bed and pat the edge, beckoning you to sit by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>You</i>, of course.\u201d Yuli taunted. \u201cDraxius has told me a little about you and how your mind could be manipulated easily by his psychic abilities.

It was almost impossible for you to restrain yourself by running or diving straight towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood before the naked psychic with your own nude physique, kneeling down over her atop the cushioned bed to rest above her. The warmth over her body cascaded onto you, sending tingling quakes to jolt at your bones. Her eyes never left your gaze, however, you were too preoccupied eyeing her toned body to even bother to notice it. Yuli\u2019s grin veered into a long smile at the sight of your interest. She purposely puffs her plated chest out some, as your eager hand float down to cup over the voluptuous brown orbs. They were too large for your hands. The <i>perfect</i> size. Her tough nipples jabbed into your padded palms, poking into the pink soft flesh for a rumble to emit from her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick snag, you grope her globing breasts to force a joyful moan to perk into your ears. You veer your own smile as your scooping tactics quicken and gain force. You roll her precious cleavage around, rewarded with louder sounds to emit as arms locked around your backside, and soon, her legs too. Your hands perform their best job to toy with her chest, all the while, your prick stabs out from its hiding place to squeeze between your abdomen and her own. Your two, flat yellow stomachs grind against each other, jetting your pre-cum between the empty crevices to bubble out some. Out of the sudden moment, your hips initiate soft humps all on their own to spit more of your cock\u2019s brewing contents onto this sexy female. Your tails wag in equal motions as her lips come close to yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whispers through her hot pants, \u201cDraxius was right. You are nothing but a <i>dog</i>. You\u2019re telling me this is the infamous incorruptible Lace? I honestly doubt that title from seeing such an advance by a hero of distaste by the lust of the apocalypse. If Draxius was right about your kinky desires, is he right about your simple mind seduction too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling sweat begin to bead, you desperately attempt to comprehend her words. Was this some kind of trick or something? She seemed to be as eager as you were, and you couldn\u2019t wait another minute to penetrate this stranger. However, she must have been a strong psychic to be in cahoots with Draxius\u2019 powers. Does that mean she could basically control you and boost your sexual senses with a similar mind-rape attack?

The sound thrilled your ears to listen the strict noise, and you wanted to hear it again. Your hands performed another ghastly grope, compelling Yuli to chirp out a sound each time your palms tensed over her lustrous brown breasts. The nipples continue to poke into your padded forepaws, hardened to their tips in arousal as her folds throb at the presence of your cock hovering over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Abra grins and glares at you, raising a brow in much more curious interest as arms and legs crossed over your backside clench a bit tighter. She kicks off the sandals among her feet to rub a hindpaw to glide along your tail. In return, you attempt to stifle back moans yourself, finding it impossible to do so as you release your murr of pleasure. Yuli teased in a desired octave, \"Let's play a game then, shall we? The two of us are going to see who cums first, and whoever <i>does</i> orgasm will be deemed as the submissive one. There are <i>no</i> rules...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe psychic's proposition did sound very interesting, including fun. However there was a hint of fear calling out within your mind, begging you to not to do this. You had no clue for why such a thought existed and what bad events could lead out of this decision, so you simply shrug it off and press your forehead against Yuli's. \"You're on.\" You answer with a cocky smile. Just then, you felt your entire body flip over, landing you right on your back as the Abra pinned you down with ease. Yuli licked her lips as she nudged her groin against your own, sliding her blooming sexline over your hardened cock to rouse a soft growl out of your muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly realize the situation and grab the Abra by the shoulders, yanking her down to wrap your lips over her mouth to dig your tongue inside the Abra's maw. Her eyes widened but quickly closed, giving off a muffled and enticed murr as her crotch rubbing attack ceases. She was completely too busy being distracted by your kiss to care for your submission. Quick as your hands are, they rtract back over her breasts to twirl there bouncing texture, sliding around to maximize Yuli's pleasure. Before you could clasp a hand over her vagina for a clear win, her eyes flash open once again, scrunching her brow in anger as her hands go right back to pinning you down. Her tail quickly guided itself down to your rump, squeezing in between your large cheeks and pierce inside your pucker. You growl louder as her tail entered and dragged out of your anus, expanding it with large, pummeling pounds. Her pussy began to slicken with pre, oozing over her hot nether walls to grind over your length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cheeks blush as the Abra appeared to have the winning position as your balls tighten in bliss. You roar while rolling with her body over the bed, trying to get on top of her...</span></div></div>",

She gasps, realizing that you've actually pulled her into a position she can barely get out of. Her body squirms to twist you over, however, knowing that you could finally force her into submission, you align your cock's tightened head at the basin of her open folds. Slowly slipping it in, you knew it would force her to surrender under your control. In compliance, Yuli groans loudly as your length shifts its entire size up along her vaginal walls that throb at its partner's presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou accidentally set loose a grouse of enjoyment yourself, finding her tightness gripping around your penetrating member to pulsate its hot anticipation around it. You shudder from the warmth, gripping her legs closer for a balanced brace for the next move. Your groin initiates its pumping action, sliding in and out in short movements until gaining velocity and distance. The wet slaps emit almost as loud as the groaning Abra you're pleasuring. Her hands go from struggling against your arms to roughly gripping them and fingering through your fur, discovering the wondrous embrace from your crotches. Her legs cross behind your back, closing you in deeper into her as Yuli's tail swirls in circles against your rear, having been hooked under your rocking waist of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel sweat build up under you fur, moistening your body including the never-ending humps you shovel into the Abra's underside. Your fangs grit together while your thoughts panic at the thought that you may actually just cum before her by your own move. Yuli certainly had shown to be the more seduced one though, submitting fully as her hands scooped over her rolling tits, kneading the breasts and pinching around the dark brown nipples perking out of them. She was biting her bottom lip as you defile her pussy, ramming into her on the bed for the bedsheets to stain under your precum leaking out, along with the mass of sweat build-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou point your head to the ceiling, growling as your balls twitched in the moment of almost exploding your cum out. Thankfully, the Abra suddenly screams, sending the wet feeling of her underside reverberate throughout her sex driven form and wincing wildly by her orgasm. You grin in the fact that you had won, giving you the time to finally release your burning tension. Cum blasted into her, filling up her love cavern in a splotchy and grimy mess of white seed. Yuli smiled with her tongue slightly out, twitching her legs as her lower quarters are injected with your semen. Your knot bulges inside her nether lips, squirting out any more shots that remain within before you slide the length back out, letting it flop out and slap back down to your furry ball sac. The Abra fingers the cum a bit to smear it around as her face remains perpetuatingly glowing red. You crash down against the dampened bed, sighing out soft groan as Yuli cuddles her warm body up to yours, rubbing the side of her upon your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the covers finally pulled, you wrap an arm around the Abra and peck a kiss at her forehead. Yuli murrs at the action, smiling up to you. \"...hreh...heh...I stand corrected...It seems as though you're better suited at your job than I am...\" She gives your cheek a single lick before the two of you pass out in a sensual and burning bond together.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Your eyes grant the transparent morning light through the tent cloth by opening softly, and your mouth began the day with a relaxing yawn. Your forepaws rise up to rub your face and wake you. Getting a good grasp on your senses, you sit up in the bed with your limbs outstretched for a long period of time, relaxing your muscles from the delightful sleep after last night's activity. Looking down to your side, you notice Yuli was no longer in bed and that only the dented crease of the mattress was the only evidence she had ever been there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon find the Abra at the other end of the room, staring towards a mirror on a wooden cabinet as she places her crimson silk robe back onto her slender figure. It still amazed you how beautiful she truly was. Yuli ties her belt through the robe and releases a soft sigh. Her glare darts to yours through the mirror, catching you staring as she dresses herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pervert.\" She whispers sarcastically. You grin and slide out of bed, walking (and stumbling from just waking up) to wrap your arms around the Abra from behind so you could pull her closer into you. She giggles as a response, but attempts to sound as mature as possible doing so. You felt as if she always wanted to appear as an intimidating intellectual who suffered from showing any trace of actual affection. Last night seemed more like a test for than anything pleasuring. Although, you felt like you were starting to chip away her hard casing and get to the softer soul that remained trapped inside her cold shell. She started, \"Well, I do hope that you enjoyed yesterday's little activity. My, uh, apologies if it seemed too threatening or forced. My only true reason for it was to test how someone such as yourself survives a long trek to stop an apocalypse based on temptation and hunger. And to put it bluntly, you're very easy to seduce and lack much trustworthiness to accomplish such a thing. However...\" The Abra trailed off, lost in deep thought. You could see the very minuscule edges of her lips curl to what appeared to be an actual smile from her. \"You can control yourself with enough heart, for the most part at least, and determination will certainly see you through with this quest to the end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nose her neck and answer with a bright smile, \"I'm flattered. Your critique means a lot. So are you suggesting that last night was only satisfying because you learned my sense of control and nothing else...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face shows a hint of pink on her cheeks as she shakes her head some. \"I suppose it was fun.\" The Abra admitted to the guilty pleasure with a seemingly larger grin. Her body turned to face you, showcasing her piercing hazel sight for you to stare down into. You could even see your reflection through the awe-inducing bronze of her eyes. With a mere motion, your mouth leaned into her own within your hug, creating wet contact to connect together. Your lips and tongues press deeply into each other, endeavoring to mix with the other partner so desperately. You felt the Abra's arms struggle in confidence to wrap around your backside, but with a little nudge of the mouth, you motivate Yuli enough for her to squeeze tightly in. You smile after breaking your kiss with her and wipe a small drop of your saliva from her chin. Through the psychic's hidden panic, she looks away a tad, smiling as brightly as you this time as her tail swishes from side to side in curling, uncertain gestures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what the hell.\" Yuli abjectly said out loud as her hands uncup your back to rise up to her chest. Silently, she spread open the crease opening of her rope more, letting the collar go limp and slide to her shoulders with her round breasts sticking out in the open. Your heart skips a beat from the act and you look up to her in excitement and nervousness. She quietly answered your crazed expression, \"What? You're not too bad at being delicate with my chest. If you don't want to, I can always just put the robe back on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears twitch as your tail wags frenziedly. With a nod and a forehead kiss, you softly place your forepaws over the brown globes, letting them fit neatly into your palms. The darker nipples poke into your pads again, rousing you quite a bit as you begin to circle her cleavage steadily. The soft sensation and weight of her boobs overwhelmed your desires and joy, forcing you to murr quietly with a slightly open muzzle. Your eyes close with Yuli's, enjoying the brief moment you could have with her while her thighs grind a little into each other. Her yellow three-digited hands plant themselves over the topsides of your forepaws, letting your grope session end by pulling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hhhhhh...that's enough for now. If you keep this up, you're going to me wet again.\" The Abra mentioned with an adorable smirk. It was an entirely new personality you've witnessed since your first encounter with her. There was just something special about the Abra you couldn't put your finger on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms brush over her lithe back as you answer, \"You're just so unbelievably beautiful.\" Her face practically froze in place from that. There wasn't a blush, or a sense of joy from her expression. The only way you could describe was the look in her eyes, like regretful sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Yuli started off with quietly. She closed her eyes and breathed heavily and soothingly for a moment before continuing, \"...Thank you. But this entire relationship between us...it doesn't need to happen. It won't happen.\" Her old attitude was back. \"You're a brave person, Lace, and with a good heart and cause to back it up. And there's a person out there who's out there struggling with the horrors of our world that mirror your precise intentions on saving it. There's someone out there for you. But that person isn't me...\" Her hand brushes the side of your face. \"I'm not the kind of woman you think I am. If you truly knew me, you would understand that you and I can't be as close as you'd like...that I'd like too even. But...when this is over, I wouldn't mind seeing you again, to catch up on things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood there quietly for a minute. You were unsure about your feelings towards Yuli and what may conspire after you leave Draxius' tent. It was simply too early to tell and Yuli appeared to be scared of getting too attached to you. \"Alright.\" Her eyes made a change to a slight hope at your answer. \"But you gotta promise me you won't end up as some feral fodder, fair enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuli scoffs at the idea, only smiling at you again some before leaning in to kiss your nose. \"Hmph. I should be the one telling you that. You're the one endangering yourself on purpose out there. And believe me, you'll never have to worry about ferals when it comes to me.\" She said with actual seriousness. But she attempts to sound friendly and say, \"Go on out. I'm sure some of your friends are up and awake, eager to see you, Lace.\" No arguments for that. Grabbing your bag that you dropped on the floor last night, you exit through the room cloth while feeling the odd sense of Yuli staring at you during your leave.</span></div></div>",

The Drowzee smiles as he passes by you with a steaming cup of tea. \"Don't worry about our food rations. We have an entire garden in the back with a surplus of ingredients; go on and feast while you can!\" He sets the teacup down next to you for you to drink before walking away to chat with Hex. Everyone was awake at this point, conversing over by a different table as you just happily watch them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a warm moment to see your party happily enjoy themselves in this unstressful time they had together. Suddenly, you heard another chair scooch across from you to see Yuli resting down at the table with you. She flips open a book and takes a sip from her own cup of warm tea, reading through the pages quietly for a moment before stating, \"Good morning Lace. How was your rest last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin and relax back in your seat, just staring at the tall Abra with amusement, \"Is that how we're doing this? Just pretending that it never happened?\" You chuckled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuli took a moment to just sit silently looking at her book, even though you knew she wasn't really reading it, and sighed. \"...I simply just want things to be 'settled' between us. No, that's not the correct word.\" She struggles to figure out that right way to make it sound like a professional, mature excuse to talk to you. \"...Things should remain 'mellow' between us. Is that the way to use it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small range of snickers force out of your mouth as you can't bear to look at her. You rub over your face as you reply, \"Yes Yuli, that's a decent word for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Abra blushes and places her book down, crossing her smooth legs to the point where you can hear her skin slide loudly against each other, and pouts somewhat. \"Just because we will not be 'together' in a relationship does not mean I cannot simply enjoy myself for some friendly idle conversation with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally are able to contain your giddiness as you take the time to smile at her. \"That's fine by me. What would you like to talk about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuli flashes you a look, \"What is your course of plan on this expedition?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're heading back towards Redeemer's Grotto if you've heard of it, to take a small bit of refuge there to drop the Luxray, Star, off. And hopefully we can persuade the Village Chief there to lend us soldiers to aid us when we head to the mountains together to stop whoever or whatever is causing this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuli raises a brow, \"So, you're just going to gather several foolish citizens who have been living under a rock all of this time to go out and battle against a supreme force that has caused a wide array of destruction and horror around this entire island with your nose stuck up high to beat it with your mere fists?\" The honesty was a bit brutal, to the point where you almost shrank into your chair. \"I'm not saying that you should not help save everyone and 'cure' this epidemic, but you will not go far if you think you can just walk to that psychic's front door and just punch them into submission. Anyone who has ever dared to go to those mountains have either died or become just another slobbery monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scoot in closer, \"Then what else is there that we can do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Abra sighs, crossing her arms now and reclining back. After a moment of silence, she whispers, \"I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you just return staring at the table without another sound, contemplating on what was to come. Suddenly, you hear the sound of one of Yuli's sandals slipping off to feel the side of her footpaw slide up along your ankle. You flash her a look this time, smiling some as she blushes and glances away to avoid eye-contact. You sneer, \"Whatever happened with our <i>mellow</i> relationship?\" You begin to rub your own forepaw against hers, feeling her two front digits occasionally pinch at you affectionately underneath the table for no one to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I merely...accidentally bumped your leg and I'm looking for my sandal again.\" Yuli lies and nudges your legs a few times as she fidgets pleasurably in her seat before sliding the sandal back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact, I meant to ask you, but why do you wear clothes? I know some Pokemon need them for cold weather or think it's stylish but...in these times? Clothes like that are useless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuli looks at her teacup, troubled with thoughts, \"I wear them only in Draxius' tent. It's just a tradition we have to wear these robes around each other. I also respect him since he's a far superior psychic that I am, so I cover my body for less of a distraction.\" The Abra suddenly gives you a wink. \"That, and they're very comfy and sleek. I noticed how much you enjoyed them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reflect a smile, \"They are very silky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Abra sighs again, sips up the last of her tea and takes her book with her, giving you a bow. For a moment there, it was as if she truly wanted to tell you something. \"Good luck on your quest Lace. I'm certain our paths will cross again.\" Before you could even say goodbye, Yuli heads off into her room without looking back.</span></div></div>",

Spending you time within the psychic's home made you reflect on how peaceful and wonderful life had been before this crisis, back when you could look forward to the next day instead of worrying if you would make it to that point. You stretch your legs out some in preparation for the long walk ahead, along with any battles that may come your way on the travel there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxius, Gyro, and even Yuli stand outside at the entrance of the home, saying their goodbye and 'good lucks' to you and everyone else. You would have offered for the psychic's to tag along, but their abilities may have been useless against this master villain hiding out there in the darkened heights of the mountains. You had already talked it out with the woman you actually slept with last night before departing with the rest of the group, confirming that you should just keep it to yourself and focus on the task at hand right now, but you knew you would be together with her soon enough hopefully. As you finally depart, your team heads out into the directions of the mountains in the distance, but not to fight the psychic just yet. You still needed to swing by Redeemer's Grotto to tell them the revelations you discovered about the infection, along with the hopes of gaining some of the city's troops so you wouldn't be outmatched by the psychic. You glance over to Star remembering that the original plan was to drop her safely off there as well, but you hoped she would change her mind about it. The Luxray had already proven to be a valuable asset, plus you've grown to enjoy her company along the trip. Perhaps through time she could feel better and bond with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You remain ahead most of the group, silently looking forward the whole way through passing the dense forest and following a dirt path that supposedly lead to a village according to Draxius. However, he didn't know if it was abandoned or safe there anymore. Either way, you still planned on setting that as a good checkpoint to head to. But as you were calmly walking, a familiar heat approached you from behind as Jackal walks a bit faster to catch up to your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire type didn't say anything at first, or even glance at you for that matter. His eyes keep a firm aim around at the forested environment looking out for ferals, but mainly just to pass the time trying to find the right words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou speak first, \"Hey.\" The last time you saw the Typhlosion was when he kicked you out of the room in a mad dispute over nothing. You wonder if it affected anything about your friendship with him, but seeing as he wanted to obviously talk with you, it was a good sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" He responds, but avoids his eyes away still. You glance down at his gut to see that it had worked nicely on the Ninetales feral he had devoured yesterday, the same stomach he became so enraged over last night of when he forced you out mid-rub. Jackal awkwardly paused for a moment before continuing, \"...I'm sorry, uh, about you know. Last night, and...stuff...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then rubs at the back of his head, scratching it some as you reply with a smile, \"Don't worry about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal's face burned a bit red as his voice got quieter. \"Thanks...so like, we're still buds, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" You keep your answers short and simple, waiting for the real questions the Typhlosion wanted to ask you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe in fact did so, mustering the courage to say, \"Soooo...how'd you enjoy your night? I kind of heard some stuff in the other room with, well, you-know-who. I wasn't really expecting you to, you know, <i>bang</i> her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin and flash a look at him, \"One thing led to another, but yeah, it was really wonderful. Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! U-Uh. Well well well...uh...it's just. <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Fuck, what do I say?</font> It's cool.\" He stutters and frantically panics of what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...cool?\" You mockingly retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour friend's cheeks flare even more red as his struggles for words become humorously more difficult. \"W-Well, uh, it's just that I didn't know you liked her, that's all. You sort of just met her, but to each his own, I-I guess.\" The poor Typhlosion's voice was shaking and you almost thought he was beginning to sweat for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pat a hand against his back, rubbing it some before returning it to  your side, \"Don't worry about it. I'm still the same guy you met at Jade Gorge.\" Jackal calms down some he keeps a tight grip around the satchel of his bag. Peering back at the others behind you to see if they were listening in, you spot Eden and Gold loudly arguing with each other about something to do with the clouds. You swear they could rant against each other about anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would some <i>flat-chested</i> plant know about the weather, huh? It isn't going to rain anytime soon.\" The Golduck quacks out with confidence and anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Roserade quickly gives Gold's cheek a firm smack with one of her vine whips, huffing back, \"Excuse me? I can tell by the moisture in the air! Plants thrive based on what's in nature, and how dare you think some 'chest size' has anything to do with it! How would a useless piece of scum like you understand anything about rainclouds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Golduck rubs the red mark left on his face with a shut eye, growling back, \"I'm a water-type if I need to remind you, you pesky little weed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFarther back was Star and Hex quietly walking with each other as the frog explains past times before he lived in the swamp and how he came to learn different natural ingredients could cure different illnesses. The Luxray calmly listened with her tail even wagging some behind, keeping her eyes glued to the Toxicroak while he dramatically used body language and fancy descriptions for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head away and change the subject before anything became too awkward with Jackal by saying, \"So how'd you sleep? Did the feral give you any trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal scoffs, \"Please, that bitch gave up its fight as soon as is was guzzled down and trapped. Heh, I'm pretty sure I'm getting stronger with every feral I beat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And <i>tubbier</i>.\" You joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Typhlosion looks down at his soft belly, pinching at the slight pudge there, \"You think so?\" You didn't know if he was insulted or complemented by the comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, but it's cute in a way. You seem to really like belly rubs, and so does Star. You should ask her for some.\" You chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal's face ignites again, along with the flames on his mane just a bit. He peeks over at the Luxray, having his voice almost stutter, \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured from how I woke up in the nursery that one time and I found her hands on me like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal grunts, \"H-Hey, now wait a minute, don't lie to me about stuff like that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour smile stretches out long on your muzzle, \"Oh I wouldn't dream of it Jackal. In no way do I think she'll find you attractive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Typhlosion sighs out, \"Oh, whew, that's a relie- Hey, what do you mean by that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snicker and continue walking along the path, avoiding in giving a straight answer to Jackal. Maybe you were serious. Maybe you were kidding. Who really knows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the most part, the trek was beginning to look nice and easy for your group. The only time you met confrontations with ferals was just one at a time, and with a whole group of companions to fend them off, ferals seem to pose little of a threat. They either ran away from being outnumbered, or were quickly beaten unconscious from the group. Although, as much as Jackal or Gold wanted to eat their defeated prey, it would only slow the group down so they merely left the knocked out ferals on the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were proud to make it through most of the forest with plenty of the day left, arriving at...</span></div></div>",

You had noticed from before the sudden transitioning of the types of trees changing, with many of them dying or leafless at this point along with the scattered puddles and patches of fungus and moss out around the path. At last though, your group had arrived at the coast of a large, flat lake of murky mud and black sludge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tar pits occasionally bubble and releases fumes of steam and toxicity that you can even vapor out from the surface of the gunk. Poorly built wooden walkways were built in several angling paths over the sea of sludge to maneuver people and carts over easily, but with the recent infection, you truly doubt anyone has been around long enough to do any of the repairs for the wooden bridges. You spot several holes along the walkways, with wooden beams rotting and decaying away, along with some damage that looks like fights were held atop these bridges, most likely from pokemon using these to get over the tar pits to escape ferals but were forced to fight there. This bog was in worse of a shape than the swamp Hex lived in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal places his hands on his hips, shaking his head, \"There's no way in Hell am I walking over these things.\" You check back on everyone else in fact, and their reactions are all typically the same with unsure expressions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex then points out, \"With our numbers like this, we'd have to only cross one to two at a time on the pathways, and even then we would have to step carefully on the planks. I suggest we may want to find a way around this or at least a safer alternative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only sigh with a groan, answering, \"I suppose you're right...let's g-\" You are then cut off by a loud shout carrying off in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar's ears flip up and she worriedly asks, \"Wh-what was that?\" Squinting your eyes to try and pinpoint where the yell had come from, you then spot a group of three anthros close to the other side of the bog. One was of a Typhlosion from what you curiously question, that is until you noticed that its a shiny Pokemon with a crimson backside of fur instead of the traditional dark blue. Judging from its physique, it appeared to be a woman. Next to her was chubby Grotle which you could easily tell was a male as well the third anthro; a well built Rhydon. Although, you quickly notice that all three of them are distressed about something when you then notice that the Rhydon and had fallen through some of the boards of a walkway and landed in the tar! He angrily roars and struggles in the thick sludge that only made him sink in deeper with his two companions doing their best to try and reach him and pull him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step forward and place your hands around your mouth for an audible call, \"Hey are you three okay over there? Do you need any help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the tar pits, the Typhlosion and Grotle glance up to see you and a whole pack of others behind you which in fact startles them. The Grotle worriedly asks his companion next to him, \"Who...wh-who are those guys? Do you think they're those bandits from earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe retorts, \"I dunno...They're not the same kind of Pokemon, but they could still be in that clan for all I know. Listen Clubs, you keep trying to get Jab out and just leave everything to me.\" The red Typhlosion then gets up from her knees and calls back, \"Hey buddy, we're taking care of ourselves here, so ya might as well turn around and leave! We don't want any trouble with ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would hope not, but it seems trouble has already found you. Do you think you can pull him out on your own?\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire-type crosses her arms and grumbles, \"Of course we can, now like I said, ya need to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Please</i>! Could you help us? I can barely even reach him, let alone pull him out! He'll drown in there if you don't!\" The Grotle interrupts with a distraught and desperate plea with tears almost in his eyes. The Typhlosion glares at him for awhile and looks back down at their Rhydon friend who was already halfway in the tar dragging him slowly down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large reptile barks out at his traveling partners as he trashes within the gunk, \"Would you two stop bickering and get me out of here! If they're offering to help, then just take it already you bastards! I don't have all day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Typhlosion just shakes her head, \"Fine fine, but if these guys prove to be an issue and we're all raped and eaten, it's all on you two.\" She then returns to yelling back to you, \"Alright, if you <i>really</i> want to help us, then hurry your asses over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod as Hex steps up next to you with a hand on your shoulder, \"I think you should send at most two people. If the boards broke under him alone, you can't be too careful if you're rushing over there with the weight of two people.\" You agree with the Toxicroak until all of you notice something. Several howls and growls emit out from deep within the wilderness and darkening trees as several violet dots appear that only seem to grow larger and closer with each passing moment. The sudden ground softly resulting footsteps to rumble throughout the floor signifying several ferals all attracted to the commotion happening at the tar pits, that maybe yelling for communication wasn't the best idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tense up with your group as you look over to the trio on the other side, mirroring very similar reactions to the horde that was soon to come. The Rhydon stuck in the tar stares with fearful eyes as he sees the glowing purple dots through the wave of dead tress glowing brighter and making their way towards them only has his lips shuddering to speak. Without even looking at his friends and focusing his gaze at the faint moving figures far away that snarl and stomp their way to, he whines out, \"P-Pull me out...pull me out, pull me out, <i>pull meee ooouuut. Right. Now</i>!\" The Typhlosion and Grotle get back on their knees, outstretching their arms down over the walkway edge to try and grab their friend's own reaching arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith time running out, you're prepared to head over there yourself before Eden's voice shudders out, \"G-Guys...behind us!\" Peering back, the same situation was at hand. Several ferals were dashing out of trees and from the forest path behind you to all attack in unison, making your numbers completely meaningless now from this ambush. Are ferals truly this smart? You didn't put too much thought into it as you would need to suggest who to stay and fight the ferals from the rear, and who would go out onto the tar pit walkways to help the other group. You automatically nominate Jackal to go since he's most likely the one with the most strength at the time, and you ponder of who should go with him. You could risk your own life and go across with him, but would the others be okay without you? Perhaps Hex could go with Jackal since he was the leanest and tallest. He would definitely be able to reach the Rhydon in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those facts in mind, you decide that...</span></div></div>",

We're sticking to the plan and heading over to the other group.\" You explain to the Typhlosion as you glance back at the others. \"Your job is to stay here and hold those ferals off until we pull him out of the tar.\" Hex, Eden, Gold, and Star look uneasy about the situation, but eventually feel confident enough in your plan and agree to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel Jackal tugging at your arm, grunting, \"Well let's not waste any time then.\" He starts to head over to the staircase to the walkways as you trail behind him quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you ascend the stairs, you glance back to see Hex wave to you both and calls out, \"Be careful now! Don't end up in any tar or stomachs, you hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold jabbed an elbow into the Toxicroak's side and quacks angrily, \"They'll be fine, but <i>we</i> won't be unless ya turn around help us fight these sicko's off, <i>ya hear me</i>?!\" The frog glances one last worried look at the two of you making it across the tar pits before turning around and fending off all of the ferals trying to bypass them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you and Jackal cross the walkways together in a cautious sprint, tensing every time the wooden boards creak under your pounding steps. Several close calls occur as soft snaps and wobbly sections seem to almost give away under you, but less times than what Jackal had to go through. Being probably the heaviest of your group members, he had taken it to himself to be the lead point just in case the boards couldn't support the weight. If Jackal could make it across, then more than likely you could, and you would be there right behind the Typhlosion just in case it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose thoughts come at the worst time though when you suddenly halt in your dash to the other group once Jackal brakes to a complete stop abruptly. You try glancing over his shoulder and ask, \"What's wrong Jackal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Typhlosion clears his throat some, looking around from where he was standing to reply, \"Well...uh, heh, uhm I think this wooden board is going to give away right under me, I could hear splitting wood and feel a crack in this thing under my foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down to see the wooden plank was indeed a bit split in the middle, and anymore sudden weight difference can have it completely break. You sigh and look over at the trio in trouble, with the female Typhlosion and male Grotle too busy fighting ferals to pull their friend out from the murky tar. Seeing no other way and no time, you explain, \"Then I guess you better take your hindpaw carefully off as slow as possible, but we don't have a lot of time left. But don't worry, I'll catch you if you fall, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bead of sweat drops from his forehead as he makes a single nervous laugh, \"Oh, heh, yeah sure. It's not like I'm super fucking worried or anything.\" He shuts his eyes close and grits his teeth tightly together, taking the paw off the board to hear the wood ache and groan underneath until he immediately takes an entire step back to let the plank snap and fall down into the gunk below. The Typhlosion releases a heavy sigh of relief, rubbing the sweat from his forehead as he flashes a smile back to you over his shoulder in reassurance. Giving a small step over the empty panel of the walkway, several boards then crumple beneath him to send the fat Typhlosion falling down! The wood snaps loudly and Jackal's body falls heavily down, yet he manages to grab the edge of the hole in a desperate lunge, growling out with a worried look, \"Gahh...<i>shit</i>!\" He does his best to try and hold on while his legs kick and thrash wildly in the air just inches from the bubbling tar down below. The struggling fire-type glances down to see the broken wooden boards sinking actually quickly in the blackish gunk, sending chills up his usually warm body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bark out once you see this and circle around the hole, doing your best not to have anymore boards break from your weight to not end up like Jackal. \"Don't worry buddy, I got you! Just, uh, hang on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal grumbles as he endeavors to claw his way back up, \"I wasn't planning on just letting go if that's what you were thinking!\" You squat down and grab Jackal's outstretched arms, tugging his pudgy body up the best you can as his legs still struggle to kick off of anything for extra support. But thankfully, you manage to heave Jackal back onto his knees on the walkway for the Typhlosion to hold his chest to calm his heart down from the close call. Looking up at you, he pants, \"Whew...Remind me to make it up to you after all of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes and help Jackal back upright. Close to the trio you were sent to aid, the both of you continue onward until your stop in your tracks with two purple-eyed figures blocking your path. An infected Breloom stands on the walkway with a drooling mouth and wobbling cock that oozes out pre onto the wooden boards, paired up with a female Pidgeotto that glides past the mushroom creature to aim towards Jackal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Typhlosion's mane ignites as he prepares to fight the bird closing in on him from the air with the Breloom being your opponent to deal with for now. No one had time for this, and you needed to take care of this quickly and efficiently.</span></div></div>",

Squatting some as you charge your power, blue fire forms in a ball at your pressing hands as orange flames flare at the back of Jackal's mane just right behind you. You two would have to do your best to not burn away the walkways underneath you, as well as for the rest of the whole way so that the others in your group could make it across. The hungry Breloom roars out and charges forward without any hesitation. Its tongue hangs out from its mouth while showing off some of its fangs to you in preparation in eating you, but you had other plans then to die today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Breloom's leg actually stomp on one of the wooden boards to suddenly smash through it, halting the feral's charge for it to look down and notice that it was stuck. Trying to desperately pull out, you used the opportunity to launch the Aura Sphere directly into the mushroom creature to send it howling and spiraling away in a trail of smoke. The feral flies off of the walkway and directly into the bubbling tar to never be seen again. You feel a bit guilty for killing it, because after all, you wanted to find a cure and save anyone who's become infected. But there wasn't much more that could've been done for the Breloom. You just hoped that whoever used to be that Breloom wasn't in there anymore once the infection took over his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly feel a large weight woosh right over your head from behind you after a soot-covered Pidgeotto is flung right into the tar as well. It's swirling purple eyes and groaning beak is the last thing you see of it before it sinks into the squelching muck. Checking back on Jackal, you spot him merely swatting his palms together to rub of his own soot off before he looks to you with a disgruntled look, \"What? You didn't think I could handle some dumb bird?\" And takes the lead on the walkways again as he elbows your side while jogging a bit forward, \"C'mon, you were in such a rush before. Move it, mutt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet again, the two of you were making progress towards the three other anthros. With no other interruptions, you at last arrive close in front of them to see the Typhlosion and Grotle both knock a Tyranitar close to the edge of the walkway as it teeters over some and struggles not to fall back. The female fire-type smashes her body weight against the large beast to have the Tyranitar roaring as it fell off of the edge. The Rhydon sitting in the tar below sees a shadow looming over him, making him fearfully gasp as he sees the towering body of the large reptile timbering over the edge headed towards him. He wriggles and whimpers to get out off the way, or at least to squirm over to the side some to avoid being pummeled down and eternally sent into the muck. Thankfully, the Tyranitar smacks into the tar right next to the Rhydon to sink down into the stuff, but just as soon as the Rhydon gives a sigh of relief, he feels the Tyranitar's hand grab his leg within the tar to try and pull him down! The struggle is back on as the reptiles kick and claw it out underneath the black putty, with only the Rhydon's head barely sticking out of the slime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately dive against the wooden boards with your upper body hanging off of the edge with your arms extended. \"Grab on!\" You order as Jackal gets down and does the same with hands outstretched. The Rhydon notices the two strangers but wasn't going to question them. His arms emerge out of the gunk from fighting off the Tyranitar to trying and struggling to reach your own. The shiny Typhlosion and Grotle don't hesitate on your true motives either, and get down to help to. All four of you grab him, two for each arm, and heave back to try and pull the thick dino out. The gluing black tar stuck and tugged back viciously, to where with even four people it was difficult to just not have him sink in any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female Typhlosion growls, \"Grhhhhhh...! Th-Thanks for stopping by you two, because there's no way Clubs or I would be able to get this fatso out! The name's Cherry...and this heavy fool is Jabber. Damn, Jabber! How much do you fucking weigh?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJabber, the Rhydon, whines out as he does his best to pull up. \"Sh-Shut up! You're all just weak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClubs the Grotle worriedly asks, \"Ch-Cherry, why isn't this working? There's no way this tar can be this thick and strong!\" You would have to agree with the shy guy. This tar was practically sentient, and driven to do anything in its power to suck this guy down. Just what was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJabber shudders, \"I-It's moving all around me! I-I-I think it's grabbing me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCherry growls back, \"It's just goo, you big oaf! It isn't alive, and it isn't trying to...oh no...\" Her crimson eyes widen as the four of you stare at the Rhydon's body to discover the explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks at all of your eyes, confused, \"Wh-What? Why are you guys staring at me like that?\" Jabber looks down at his body to see some of the slime emerge around his body out from the black tar, being closer to a greyish tint. Two purple eyes even glimmer out from the thick gunk as a purplish slime-like tongue rubs over Jabber's belly and chest. He tenses up to see that an infected Muk was in the tar, and eating him! \"Ah-Ahhhh! Ah crap! P-Pull me out! Get it off me! D-Do something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all fight in a tug-of-war match against the slime monster as its own hands shift out of the tar and glue themselves against the wriggling Rhydon. Glancing around, you notice that not just the Muk was awakened within the tar, because several more infected Muk and Grimer began to shift through the tar or slide along the walkways towards both the group you were with at the moment, as well as towards the coast of the tar pits where the rest of your group was battling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal looks to you for help, \"This isn't good. We either have to give up on this guy and make sure we can just make it out of here alive, or find a way to outmatch this guy. My fire would only singe the fatso with the Muk if I attack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not giving up on anyone, Jackal.\" You assure him as you try to come up with a plan. The Muk was massive in size, and it was probably even larger underneath the submerging tar. Apparently the toxic gunk added to its size and strength, and with being a feral and all, its power outmatched other simpler Muk and Grimer. This thing would need to take a big hit to be able to stun it or force it back.</span></div></div>",

The Typhlosion flashes you a look as the Rhydon panics with less people help pulling. You suddenly hop down over the boardwalk edge to force a gasp out of Jackal as he sees you actually land on top of Jabber, making it far harder to pull him up with the extra weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJabber growls worriedly as he writhes his head under your hindpaws, \"H-Hey! Get off! What are you doing?!\" You don't answer him as you crouch down whilst standing on the Rhydon's shoulders to power up a fistful of aura. Punching down, you strike the Muk square in its face to make it howl and shrink back into the tar a bit. You immediately hop off Jabber and back onto the boardwalk to grab his arm once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pull him, now!\" You order as you and the other three yank with all of your might at his raised arms. The plan works since the Rhydon begins to slip out of the Muk's whining mouth to lift back up towards the walkway. He desperately claws onto the edge, scrambling his limbs around like a scared spider when trying to pry himself completely out of the tar. The Muk growls and reaches its maw at him once again, but with Jabber out now, Jackal and Cherry work together to spit flames down at the feral. The Typhlosion duo scorch the Muk's slimy girth dry to have it yelp and submerge back deep into the tar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJabber waddles on all fours and kisses the floor repeatedly, \"Oh I'm alive! I'm alive alive alive alive aliiiive!\" Clubs eagerly kneels down and slaps at the Rhydon's backside while weeping happily, \"Oh Jabber! You scared me half to death! Watch where you step next time! I don't know what I'd do without you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two large dino's get up together and hug it out as all of you get a chance to take a short breather. Just then, several gloppy howls sound out around you. Your head looks around as you perform a full circle turn-around to see many Grimer ferals slowly sliding towards all of you; each of them smacking their lips and ready to charge all at once. Jabber grips Clubs closer into a hug and whines, \"We're dead! Ohh we're so dead dead deeead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get ready to fight off the ferals in front of you as Jackal and Cherry ready themselves at the rear to take on the others across the way. Glancing over to the terrified reptiles squishing each other in between all of the fighters, you growl out, \"Don't just stand there, we need everybody to fight!\" A Grimer lunges towards you that you drive away by a strong kick to send it into the tar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClubs just flashes a mortified face and shudders, \"W-We're just farmers! I don't know h-how to f-fight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe excuse makes you groan as you spot nearly five more Grimer quickening their pace in a rush towards you. You gulp and hope for your best until a massive stream of water crashes into their sides and sends them all washing away back over the edges of the boardwalk. Looking ahead, you see Gold dashing along the boards in a very quick sprint, giving you a bit of relief for help, even if it <i>was</i> Gold. You wave to him and happily call at him, \"Thanks for the help Gold! We could re-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're interrupted as the Golduck simply dashes right past you while exclaiming in a fast tone, \"Yeah you're welcome! Bye!\" He passes by Jackal and Cherry as well, erupting more water from his beak to just casually wash the other Grimer away so he could continue down the boardwalk. You peer over to see Hex, Star, and Eden running along the walkways as well with scared expressions. A wave of ferals were in pursuit, running along the wooden boards behind them with drooling maws. The pressure from all of the frantic chasing and weight of bodies was causing the boardwalk structures to crumble one after the other, causing unfortunate ferals to plummet to their dooms in the heavy tar. You start to walk backwards before turning around completely into a run as well, tapping Jackal and Cherry's shoulder and mentioning, \"Time to go...!\" They look over and begin to do the same as you immediately with the same feeling of rushed concern while Jabber and Clubs try to keep up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing along the entire walkway as it zigs and zags over the tar pits, you hope nothing would break underneath you or the others, for that meant life was over for the poor fallen sap. Thankfully though you make it across to fresh land after descending a small wooden staircase with the others trailing behind you. After everyone crosses, Cherry is wise enough to turn around and erupts several blast of fire at the boardwalk. The old dry wood burns easily to have it crumble away and splat into the tar, so you and Jackal both join her to use your flames to burn out any support beams or walkways that connect to the exit staircase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ferals along the walkways roar as they come to a stopping point, with their way to their intended meals stand across a good space away with tar and littered burning debris inside the murky sludge. You and the group see that it's safe to move ahead in a bit of hurry so you can make some distance with the ferals...</span></div></div>",

The group had made quite a bit of distance from the tar pits together, and after slowing a bit down along a thicket of forest trees, it was unanimous to take a break to catch some breaths. You rest your backside against a tree trunk to survey the others in front of you, noting that no one was left behind and everyone appeared to be perfectly fine if you looked past their constant heaving of air. Jackal slumps against the same tree you're on and slides down onto his rump to sit as he looks over to you, \"Hahh...wheeeww...gotta hand it to ya, Lace. You managed to get that tubster out and everyone's safe and sound. You got some crazy last minute plans, but they certainly work in the long run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scoff, \"Look who's calling who a tubster.\" Jackal hardly seems phased, and in fact, he grins in a bit of tired chuckle from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well fuck you too, ingrate. That's the last time I ever give you credit for anything.\" He says through his snickering teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check on over to the trio you helped to see Clubs and Jabber clinging onto one another with Cherry apparently harassing them about something. Getting off from the tree in a short lean, you make your way over to the scared dino's while listening in mid-way through the shiny Typhlosion's little fit. \"...of you two know what 'watch your step' means?! I didn't just say that because I like the way it rings off my tongue. I was saying it for the sole purpose of the chance of what happened! And oh whaddya know. Guess what? It <i>happened</i>. You blindly just step firmly into a hole and topple over like a swan diver <i>right</i> into the tar. Geez...if those other people didn't show up, you two would've been as good as dead. Heck, maybe even me. It's not my responsibility to take care of two strangers I hardly know. Gah, this job sucks.\" She groans and pinches her scrunched together brow in anger with tight shut eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJabber remains silent while biting his lip, but Clubs spoke up, \"H-Hey! It was an accident! You don't have to be angry at us. It's not our fault those ferals came after us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to butt-in and interrupt, \"Uhm, hey there? Can I talk to you three for a sec?\" You ask with a bit of a wave of your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Grotle stands up and actually squeezes you in a tight hug. \"Oh of course! I meant to say this earlier, but we kind of had infected on our tails. Thank you sooooooo much for pulling Jabber out! You're a saint; a savior!\" You gasp out loud as a powerful and crushing hug compacts around you from the large Grotle's arms. He swings you back and forth in a loving embrace that has your lungs burning with pain and your eyes bulging from their sockets. You can only wince out of your closed throat. \"Gh-Ghff....ff...!\" Clubs even resorts to pecking several kisses to you right on your cheeks, muzzle, and forehead, showing you his appreciation in all the ways he could fathom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, he releases you so you could cough out and stagger a bit. \"<i>Ghakkk</i>! U-Uh, no problem. I-I <i>kkhhuuaaachhkk</i>! I wanted to ask you some questions...\" After catching your breath again, you look over to the crimson Typhlosion and point to her bandana. \"You're part of Redeemer's Grotto, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCherry raises a brow a picks a hand at her maroon bandana with the Redeemer's logo right on it. \"Huh? Yeah, I'm a relay runner for them. I deliver messages and packages for certain outsiders. What about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to deliver a message for the chief. Just tell him it's from Lace, and he should listen.\" You tell her, but before you can explain your message, she interrupts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Holy crap...you're Lace the Dragon Slayer!\" Your pupils give a look of sheer confusion as they peer at Jabber and Clubs who just shrug their shoulders. Cherry continues, \"Are you saying you're <i>the</i> Lace who took down the Aerodactyl at the neighboring canyon? I heard you took that thing down single-handedly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clear your throat with your ears folding back some, \"Uh, yeah, I suppose I did. I mean it wasn't li-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, dog. That means you're probably the Lucario I heard about that liberated that hive too!\" The Typhlosion begins to grow immensely excited. \"There was a mass hive that Redeemer's Grotto always got word on that was kidnapping people. We tried to send some troops there, but never got word of them, so we just assumed the worse. But apparently a Lucario that was taken there who broke out and caused a mass riot before burning a large majority of that place down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cheeks become rosy while you rub your arm, \"W-Well, that wasn't just m-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! And! There's a story that you fought a legendary! Someone sighted one of the flying ancient birds limply soaring through the air from afar, but had clear burns from aura fire. Did you seriously take one of those on? Was it...infected?!\" Cherry asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop her right then and there. \"Whoa whoa whoa, alright. I think it's time for me to explain some things to you, and it has to deal with how the infection spreads and who's responsible for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCherry gives you a very concerned look, \"Someone...made the infection?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlopping a seat on the floor, you gesture for the Typhlosion to sit down with you. \"Take a seat. It's a long story.\"</span></div></div>",

You and the entire group were sitting around in a large circle to explain the events thus far, and hopefully Cherry would receive it all, believe it, and deliver it for you. She finally speaks and ask, \"Okay okay okay. So, like, let me get this straight. This whole thing really <i>isn't</i> an infection, and it's more of a brainwashing mind spell this...god-psychic is doing from the top of a mountain? And he's controlling all of these victims to rape people so he can control them when their mind's weak and the fluids from the victims get to another, so that makes them easy to locate? Like...I just...I don't get it. Who the Hell is that freaky and convoluted to think of something like that? Let alone pull it off...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex adds, \"Well, it's just a theory. But we have good enough reason that that's just the case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Oh great. It's <i>good enough</i>.\" She responds with a bit of a sassy tone with her arm slapping her thigh. \"Well let's just take the whole Redeemer's army up this mountain so we can take on this psychic chillin' up a mountain that for some reason wouldn't be able to just control our minds to clusterfuck one another right then and there just because, it's good enough. I don't see that absurd or stupid in <i>any</i> fashion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar gives her own unimpressed feedback to the Typhlosion, \"Your sarcasm is very touching.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCherry huffs back with crossed arms, \"Listen, maybe you've had enough time to process this stuff all for awhile, but I just got dumped with all of it in one go, so <i>saaaw-reee</i> if I'm a bit skeptical about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care if you doubt any of it.\" You explain to Cherry. \"I just need you to tell it to your chief. It's extremely important that you do. We're on our way there, but something tells me you're not a fan with sticking to groups.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Typhlosion rises back up and wipes the dirt off her knees, \"Well you're definitely right about that. Those two boneheads taught me otherwise.\" She gives Clubs and Jabber a look to make them feel a sense of guilt before she turns and sighs, \"...Ughh...fine. I'll tell him all the crazy shit you told me. But don't be surprised if he doesn't believe you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begins to jog through the forest away from all of you as she calls back, \"Good luck with beating this 'psychic' though. If you killed a dragon, why not a god too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a cue for everyone to slowly rise seeing as they should probably move too. Gold grumbles through his beak, \"Geez, a little bitchy much? We risk our lives to go through that and she doesn't show an ounce of gratitude or concern for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEden retorts, \"Well she probably just looks out for herself Gold. Besides, I don't recall you having to go through all of the things Lace has. Isn't that right, leader?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't call me that.\" You sigh as Jackal yells, \"Hey! What about me? I've been doin' it since day one with him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex chuckles as he nudges an elbow at Jackal's side, \"Oh Jacky, we already know about how you and Lace have been doing each other~\" The Typhlosion's teeth nearly crack like chalk from the fierce and grinding clench he was seething through his mouth as his cheeks flare red. The Toxicroak can't help but croak happily and pet his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over to Clubs and Jabber, the two are consoling one another before you ask them, \"You said you two were farmers, correct? Do you live in a village near here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, we do.\" Jabber answers as he points down in a direction, \"There's a town not too far from here that we live in. Clubs and I had gone out to go gather some more seeds from outside since we're running low...but, we didn't think there'd be ferals as far as the tar pits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems weird for farmers like yourselves to run out of seeds. Did you just not get enough out of your harvests?\" You inquire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Grotle and Rhydon simply just give each other uneasy looks until Clubs explains, \"Well...it's just that...w-we do, but they're just stolen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex lifts a brow, \"Stolen? Who steals them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Listen...\" Jabber says, \"Can we just explain this when we're back at our home? I r-really don't want to be out here in the wild with more of those <i>things</i> outside now that I know they want to rape me to become one of them.\" You simply agree to that offer with everyone feeling just about the same. It'll be nice to be back into a fortified town with people again, and you got lucky to come across a runner to go deliver the news even if she was rude. So you weren't in too much of a hurry to get to Redeemer's Grotto.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A wide wooden and stone gate stands before you with a tall wall isolating the area. The bricking appeared to be in a rushed job with very uneven bricks and slabs all cemented together for a quick fortification. Plenty of places looked like this when the infection first began, when towns heard of the tales and threats of ferals and their encroaching spread, they began immediate work to fortify their towns or homes as quickly as possible. Clubs the Grotle looks back over his shoulder since you and your group were following him, \"This is Hedgen, our hometown. It might not uh, look like much once we're inside, but it's definitely a nice place to stay in and we don't have too many problems when it comes to ferals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou note the fact that the town as literally at the bottom rim of a mountain, and from where you stood, you can spot several rolling hills along the mountainside with railroad tracks and mineshafts. \"It's a mining town?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJabber replies, \"For the most part. But it was also a very economic town in general. We used to have great agriculture for plants and food, and even a mass lumberyard. Guess it all didn't matter though with what's happened now though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you know that isn't true.\" Clubs expresses back with sincerity. \"People need supplies, food, and resources more than ever now. We just need a safe route and delivery team to help get towns back up and running.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar asks behind them, \"I thought you said you didn't have problems with ferals...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well we don't but...you'll see why.\" It got a little unnerving that the Grotle nor Rhydon would reveal anything about their situation, but you had to trust them if you wanted to get inside the town. Besides, they didn't seem hostile, especially since you saved their lives. There was little reason they would turn on you. But Star remains unconvinced by that answer by flashing you a quiet look about the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the gate, Clubs and Jabber get the cue to come inside but your group is stopped by the entrance by a lone Slowbro guard. The pink chubster gives the Grotle a look and asks, \"H-Hey, who are these guys? You know what'll happen if we take outsiders in...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClubs puts a hand on the Slowbro's shoulder and gestures at you, \"Yeah, but these guys could help us with our problem. They already saved Jabber and I at the tar pits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Slowbro didn't appear to be convinced as all he was armed with was a measly club. \"...The tar pits? Why did you go all the way that far?! I dunno if Bronze is gonna like this-\"  He's cut off by a different and much deeper voice once a large bone covers his mouth, \"Don't worry Horris. I'm fine with it.\" A lone Marowak stands before you at the gate as he sets his large bone back down, using it as a cane to balance his weight on. Even though he was hunched over a bit and appeared weak, he certainly wasn't that old to be needing one. He certainly wasn't young and he did have a bit of a potbelly on him, his body seemed in good enough condition to keep itself up plenty, after all that large femur bone must've been heavy. His hazel gaze fixates on you and your group before he shows off the gate to his town, tiredly saying, \"Please, come inside. We welcome you to Hedgen.\" He turns to enter the gates with the three hometown citizens following in suit with worried faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you take a step inside, Jackal grabs your arm, \"Okay, we seriously need to discuss this first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar agrees as her hands cup at her hips. Her eye portraying that something about this felt off, \"Jackal's right. These guys are hiding something and we might be walking into a trap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn while wiping off Jackal's arm. \"Well what do you suppose we do, just stand here or go around this town and attempt to scale this mountain on our own? We need to get over it if we want to get back to Redeemer's Grotto, unless we want to walk around the whole entire range which could take days. Maybe even weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex yawns out, \"Hrrroooaaagghhh. I concur. I think this town is hiding something, but they can only discuss it once they're inside. There may be an outside force here that's causing some sort of issue, and the best thing to do is at least figure out what it is. Besides, we helped their farmers. What malicious thoughts could they possibly have towards us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Golduck at his side pouts and sits down on his rump with crossed arms. \"Ughh, another one of these group discussions. You people can't fully agree on anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEden snaps back, \"Oh, like you're one to talk. What ingenious plan do you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Head inside. Relax a little. Enjoy a night's rest in an actual bed, or a sauna if they got that. Maybe meet a nice prostitute while I'm at it. If the locals are hostile once we're in, then I beat em' up and still stick to my earlier plan.\" Gold quacks back with a smug grin on his beak. Eden merely whips his cheek with a vine to make him yelp in surprise and fall over onto his side. She huffs, \"You're unbelievable...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar does make the point though, \"That's just it. What if the villagers do actually pull something? Do we take on a whole village? We don't know how many people are in there or what we're dealing with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to convince the Luxray with, \"Listen, as they said, they're a town meant for resources. They have miners, lumbers, and farmers it seems. Does that sound like a militarized force to you? And they have mines throughout the cave. That means we could possibly just have to walk through the mountain. It would cut down a lot of time and walking, and we could navigate it if we had one of their miners lead us through or give us directions once inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar sighs and simply admits defeat. \"Alright Lace, you're the boss. I trust you enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa whoa whoa, I never agreed to be a leader in all of this.\" You retort back. You had no clue that she thought of you that way, but the others begin to increase that popular opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex croaks. \"I would have assumed you were the leader of this little pack anyway. Your consent doesn't seem to be the case here, Lace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to Jackal in hopes he'd disagree with them, but he just shrugs, \"Hey man, I think my first words when joinin' ya was that I'd follow you. People follow leaders man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach a forepaw to rub down your face, \"Listen, I never asked to be some kind of...leader in this. There is no leader in this group. We all work together, and that's the general consensus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex giggles and lifts his hand up, \"Well then. Everyone in favor of inducting Lace as the group leader, say 'aye'.\" A resounding motion of raised arms and a chorus of 'aye' came from everyone. Heck, even Gold from the ground did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hint of embarrassment was shown on your face as you figure out there was no escaping this. \"E-Err, let's just change the subject. Rather, let's do a vote on what we do next. Those in favor for going into town to use the mines as a shortcut?\" You lift your hand, as does Jackal and Hex. But Gold, Eden, and Star don't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar offers, \"Well if we're doing a vote, who's in favor of not just blindly going into town to get gangbanged but whatever's happening in there?\" Star and Eden raise their arms, but the Golduck remains unsided. \"Gold, you didn't even vote.\" The Luxray huffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duck whines as he tiredly stretches on the ground, as if he was going to take a nap right on the grass path. \"Hrrrrrgghh, ugh, both of your plans just involve more walking and little-to-no prostitutes. I vote for my own plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEden whips his ankles together and raises him up high, causing the Golduck to writhe and quack wildly in the air, \"Overruled. You have to be the tie we need if we want to win the vote. I'll let you go if you vote for us~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal grunts, \"H-Hey! That's no fair! Well if you're bribing the vote, then Lace should count for two votes since he's the leader.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exhale with a whine and your ears flatten some, \"...Please stop bringing that up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold sways back and forth in a frantic manner, swiping his clawed hands about and missing Eden's ensnaring vines, \"Grrrrr! Fine! Jeez! I vote for whatever gets me in a bed faster to at least relax! Arceus knows I need a private break from all of you people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex brightens up, \"Then that would be for Lace's plan! Sorry ladies~\" He chuckles happily as Eden drops Gold flat on the ground, crossing her bouquet arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Roserade huffs, \"Why am I <i>not</i> surprised. Gold can never satisfy women in what they want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal cups a hand over his mouth to keep a chuckle in. Apparently the burn was even a little too hot for the Typhlosion. But Gold didn't partake in the stifled laughter whatsoever, and raises a clawed fist from the ground, \"Ohhhohhhhoh. You're on, bitch. What does a fuckin' plant know anything about-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vote's over.\" You interrupt before grabbing Gold's vengeful hand, hauling him back up to a stand for him to jerk his wrist out of your grasp and grumble to himself before you continue, \"We're going into Hedgen, and we'll try to convince them to go through their mine if it'll cut us some time and distance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luxray sighs, running a hand on her forehead, \"...Alright, fine. Just please make sure you know what you're doing when you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't endanger all of us if I wasn't sure. Look, we can just go in, keep our eyes peeled, and stick together. We can leave if things get too close for comfort. Okay?\" You suggest. The Luxray and Roserade simply nod their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut from the doorway of Hedgen, Bronze the Marowak keeps the door open, \"Are any of you coming? Or are you leaving? I assume you have questions, and I'll be eager to answer. Do not worry, it is safe within these walls. But the trees have...ears. We cannot dilly-dally out in the open like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be right there.\" You answer. Looking to your companions, they all put their faith in you, and you all step through the gates.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Scared people. Several villagers are scattered around the nice-looking quiet town, but many of their expressions showcase their concern, with some type of fear of you. Bronze is leading you towards a quint little cottage as he mentions, \"There is my home, we can talk there.\" Your group remains silent as well from all of the eyes observing them like other-worldly creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar can't help but whisper into your ear, \"Laaaaaaaaaaace...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab her hand behind you to squeeze, \"Just keep walking. We'll be fine if we're all together in the house.\" You release her hand when all of you make to his door. Just then, a voice from the villagers calls out, \"Monsters!\" A sudden stone is thrown from in the midst of the crowd to fly right towards you. Gasping and preparing to take the hit, the rock clacks away to the floor after Bronze deflects it with his large bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" He calls out. \"These people are not Damien's. They have brought Clubs and Jabber back to our town safe and sound. They don't mean any harm.\" Jackal looks over to you to mouth the word, 'Damien?' at you, but you merely shrug in confusion as to who that was. The village people seem to become more calm and murmur to each other while dispersing, going about their day once more. The Marowak turns to you and gestures his head, \"My apologies for that. Please, come in. You must be tired if you dealt with ferals at the tar pits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opens the door for all of you to funnel inside. The place was certainly cozy with a wooden structure and fine stone slabs along a fireplace that was roasting. A young Piplup maid bows to the Marowak, \"Welcome back Mr. Bronze. Shall I fix the guests anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Marowak bows to her and turns to all of you, \"Thirsty? Famished, anyone?\" All of you shake your head in the uneasiness of the situation. \"Bah, well please fetch me some tea, dear.\" The penguin bows again and heads off through double doors into a kitchen. Bronze walks to a velvet chair and slumps into it with both hands on his bone staff, resting it up in front of him. \"Well then. Make yourselves at home. I have plenty of seats in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll six of you cautiously take your spots for whatever chairs or stools there were in the living room area. You begin the conversation right off the bat. \"What's going on in this town? Who's Damien?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBronze sighs as he grips his cane, \"A fool is the best way to describe him. But he is a fool with power.\" He points to a painting on a wall right above the fireplace. It is a framed portrait of a Houndoom. \"The person you see there is Aldan. He was the original owner of this manor and the sole reason this town, and another, exists.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar sits a bit up from the sound of the dog's name, \"Wait, you mean...Aldanwood? I-I'm from there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBronze continues, \"Indeed I do. It was named after him after he founded it several years ago. He was a part of a lumber service that helped this small mining town grow economically, as well as supplying homes for refugees in return for their workload. He was a great man, greater than anyone I have ever known. He began a small lumberyard here long ago that was able to help support our mines from collapsing and aiding our excavation. His business grew, as well as his popularity. He had gone onto craft new towns outside of this one in an effort to benefit not just his own citizens, like Aldanwood for instance. I never liked the name of the place, and neither did he. It was too on the nose, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply just ask, \"What...does this have to do with Damien?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Marowak clears his throat before explaining, \"Damien is Aldan's son. His only son.\" The Piplup girl returns with a tea set on a tray. She lays it out on a table for the Marowak as he thanks her, \"Just leave it there. I can pour it myself. You can return to your duties upstairs.\" After bowing and leaving, Bronze pours his tea and sips it to continue, \"Aldan was out during the construction of another town when...<i>it</i> happened. The infection was spreading across other towns when we caught word of it, especially since outsiders of other towns fled to this one. After days of dealing with the first wave of ferals, the village agreed to begin construction of the outer wall you saw outside to keep the infected at bay as we did our best to defend it. But it was a difficult time. Without Aldan, the villagers didn't know who to turn to for leadership. But Damien still remained in the town and he took the role of his father and the lumberyard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was wrong with Damien?\" You ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was young. Stupid. Reckless. And most of all, merciless.\" The Marowak says with a very serious and angered tone. \"His priorities did not lie in the protection of Hedgen. But saw it as his own personal empire. He rationed the food poorly. Only those who went out on <i>hunts</i> with him were allowed the large enough rations to stay strong and full. Anyone else was just given a pathetic excuse for a meal. His excuse was if you're nothing but food to the ferals, than why do you deserve to have food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEden grows more curious. \"What do you mean by, hunts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He goes out and -finds- ferals. He and his hunting pack rape them, torture them, kill them, or even eat them themselves. The monsters had become victims to their own perversion. Damien has become no better than they have. He doesn't do it to rid the area of ferals. Rather, it's to show his dominance. That lousy mutt feels the need to physically show that his youth and name does not make him strong. It's his own will.\" The Marowak answers as he pours himself some more tea to idly swirl in his cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to take the news as best you can, \"What happened to Aldan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do not know.\" Bronze sighs in displeasure. \"We waited for his return, but with communication difficult from how dangerous the world has become, we never did get any word on his where-abouts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar curls her tail around in her lap, tugging at it in her own hands, \"That's...terrible. Why didn't you fight back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBronze shifts a glare at the one-eyed Luxray, \"We did. After too much abuse to the villagers from Damien and his corrupted followers, the rest of the town rebelled and chased him out of town. But that hasn't stopped him...now he wants our town back. In his head, it is still his.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is he?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His father's lumberyard outside of town. He's made the place into a well-fortified fortress now since he still has followers. Their numbers have grown since then, and he's convinced many people to join his gang of ruffians. Every now and then, we are raided by them. They steal our resources, pillage some of our buildings, kidnap some of our people, and even take our precious and limited farm food. It's why you found Clubs and Jabber out looking for more seeds. We lacked enough to plant to keep everyone well-fed. If you hadn't shown up, we would've been heartbroken over Clubs and Jabber's loss, but also potentially doomed without their farmwork and the seeds they collected. We are in your gracious debt.\" The Marowak sips more of his tea before setting the empty cup down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why haven't you defended your town then? Did you even try to take down that lumber place?\" Jackal questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBronze snaps back, \"The last time we did that, I became a cripple.\" Now that you thought about it, he was indeed too young to look as withered as he did. From the glow of the fire, you could see the faint scars all around his body. \"You saw those people outside. Do we look like soldiers? We could hardly protect ourselves when it was just Damien and a few when he lived in this town. How are we supposed to take him on now that he outmatches us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can help.\" You reply. Jackal slowly turn his head with widening eyes and a bit of a tilt, Clearly he didn't enjoy your sudden volunteering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold sits up a bit yelling, \"Hey hey hey! <i>Whaaat</i>?! Uhm. I thought we did things by a vote. Wasn't that a thing? I say it should be a thing. I vote that this whole political dog shit ain't our problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal agrees, \"Yeah, I'd prefer it if we put a bit more thought into it before we-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of <i>you</i> don't have to do anything.\" You cut the Typhlosion off before looking back over to the Marowak and continuing while you take a stand, \"<i>I'm</i> going to try and stop him. It's my intention to save this world one monster at a time, infected or not. I told you before Jackal. No one gets left behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBronze smiles weakly to try and hide some overwhelmed feelings. \"Y-You...don't have to do that. But this town would be forever in your debt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Golduck raises a brow then, \"Oh so can I like, sit this one out then? I mean if you want to go alone and get yourself killed, go for it buddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar scowls at Gold before warning you, \"Lace, you're being far too hasty. You need to think about what you're going to do before you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do have a plan.\" You say to cease her concern. \"And I'm going over to their hideout, today.\"</span></div></div>",

Cause there's no point in reasoning with someone who doesn't seem to understand the concept of reason.\" Your Typhlosion partner explains to you as you sit crouched against some bushes. You don't answer him as you stare ahead at the apparent fortress Bronze had mentioned to you. After your meeting with Bronze inside the manor in Hedgen, you had gone out with the agreement for the Marowak to lead you to the lumber camp Damien and his gang reside in. Your group decided to hang back at the village under your recommendation, but Jackal was too stubborn to let that happen. He tagged along with you, complaining along the whole trip. He nudges at your side, \"But at least give me a sign that you're at least listening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please be quiet. I don't anyone to hear you.\" You answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal grumbles some but huffs in a whisper to himself, \"Fair enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind you, Bronze creeps low and whispers, \"Alright...are you sure you want to go through with this? This is the only time I've managed to get this close to the place without being seen or caught. I can't make any promises I can do it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine. They don't know anything about me, and from what you told me, they're welcoming anyone that wishes to join their cause and kill ferals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Typhlosion gulps and glances over to you. \"Yeah but...you don't <i>actually</i> enjoy killing ferals, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give Jackal a small wink and a toothy grin which drains his face to become pale until you assure him, \"Of course not. But what's done is done. There wasn't nothing else I could do for the ones I've had to take care of.\" Reflecting back on all of the infected you've harmed or killed, it did become worrisome that you were enjoying it when you devoured them. A sudden insatiable hunger just grows inside you, and it seems logical to just eat them. However powerful this psychic was, its influence was surely great, but avoidable with the right morality and willpower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal huffs, \"So what's your plan then? You go up to them saying, 'Hi, I'm a bloodthirsty monster just like you guys. Can I join your creep-club?' and expecting them to welcome you with open arms?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something along those lines.\" You mention back to him before standing up and walking forward to the lumber camp. Jackal hurriedly gets up to try and match your pace with a nervous frown on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBronze whispers as he slowly steps back, \"I'm headed back to the village now...good luck you two...you're more than our town deserves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look to see the lumber yard is just ahead with the sun actually beginning to set over the shaded horizon of pine trees. Hopefully you could meet back up with your team during nightfall. Perhaps late at night would be the best time to tear this place down. Looking over to Jackal, you explain to him, \"It might be best if I do all of the talking when we meet these people. Who knows what they're like, and I don't want us giving two different stories that makes us look suspicious. If they take joy in eating ferals, they probably do so to spies as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Typhlosion shudders at the thought and just grunts, \"O-Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting closer to the gate of it, you see a massive fenced structure of tree logs raised high and tall, maybe two or three stories high with the tops of the logs sharped in spikes. A patrolling Bibarel walking along a balcony behind the fence glances over and spots two silhouettes approaching the encampment, making him yell out, \"Hey! Halt right there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jackal stop in place as you hint quietly to him, \"Don't try to seem cowardly. Just act casual, and act confident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud bell rings and several more guards arrive at the top of the fence structure to peer over, with a couple more stepping out through the opening gates, all equipped with spears. A Jolteon guard close to you ignites his fur to static with electricity, bringing some light to the scene to highlight both you and Jackal for the others to see. The beaver atop the gates yells out, \"Who are you two? Why have you come here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A couple of neighbors wanting to know who blew up their way home.\" You explain to him to get an odd look, even from Jackal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....What?\" He asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friend and I live past the tar pits closeby. He and I were hunting together, only to come back to the tar pits to get across just to see most of the walkways destroyed. I want to know if any of your men had something to do with that, because now we're having a tough time getting back home. The routes around the pits are too crowded with ferals to get by.\" You explain to him; the other guards giving weary looks to one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bibarel huffs, \"Too bad for you. None of my men would do a thing like that since we use those walkways too. Now beat it, before we-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now Bigby, don't be so harsh.\" A roaming voice from behind the beaver states that has the Bibarel, Bigby, freeze in place. A black hand cups over his shoulder with a young Houndour approaching at his side, smiling down at you and your friend. \"We heard a commotion from the tar pits and investigated the area. Someone or some people really stirred some of the local ferals up in that area. Sorry to hear about your home though. Perhaps we could discuss it inside over some ale? It's awfully chilly out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much appreciated.\" You state with a grin. You motion for Jackal to follow you with who you assume is Damien to announce, \"Let them inside. Have them meet me in the saloon~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beaver just defeatedly growls, \"...Y-Yes sir...\" With much disgust, the other guards allow you to pass and enter inside the camp with Jackal. Many unconvinced eyes stare at you with each step you take, but you only seem to have to get Damien's opinion over theirs. Hopefully that won't be too difficult...</span></div></div>",

Many tough looking Pokemon reside inside the saloon area at a large bar with kegs of ale and liquor, scattered about at tables that are either drinking, boasting, or arm wrestling. Sometimes all three. There's even a section in the middle of the room that's a short pit in a hexagonal shape with a dome of fenced wood over it, with thin logs and sticks woven together to make for a caged small arena of sorts with a sandy dirt floor and two large gates at each side. You preferred not to know what goes on down there, and the openings of the roof of it was probably for the guards to watch whatever sport took place in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBigby the Bibarel is the one to lead you up a short staircase the ends with a lounge area balcony that looks over the entire saloon with several bits of cushioned furniture and tables there, along with Damien the Houndour. The fat beaver in front of you steps aside with his arm gesturing you to enter, but a firm scowl is locked on his face when you and Jackal pass. Damien is relaxed on a plush couch with his arms spread and holding the back of it; his legs kicked up and crossed atop a close table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wags his tail and with a toothy grin, welcomes you, \"May I introduce you to my humble home and family. Please, sit my guests! I have much I want to talk to you about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take your seat with an adjacent couch with Jackal nervously and quietly sitting right next to you. \"Thanks.\" You answer with Damien leaning forward some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you like furniture? It's stuffed from the coats of a local Mareep girl we keep around in the basement. A feisty lass she is, and grows plenty of fluffy wool. At first we did it to her just to keep her busty body naked, but then I had the genius idea to make some actual use of it all and her! Pretty neat, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do your best not to deck the bastard then and there and simply chuckle to try and blanket a growl, \"...Remind me to thank her for the nice ass treatment. Makes me wish I had this stuff back at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh riiiiight! Your home. Sorry to hear about the tar pit walkways going down and all. I have my men searching for the fuckers who tore it down at the moment. Just give them a bit of time, and they'll find them~\" Damien answers and snickers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a Lopunny woman makes her way up to the steps of the balcony with a tray of drinks, quietly stepping towards the Houndour who eagerly stares at her with a cruel grin. She sets a thick mug of ale at the table by Damien and quietly mentions, \"There you go, Damien. Filled to overflow the top just like you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young canine smiles with his fangs and suddenly cups an arm around the bunny to tug her in close to him, almost falling onto the couch with him. \"Oh Daisy...you're so good to me. What did I ever do to deserve such a wonderful slut like you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl can't even look Damien in the eyes, just stuttering weakly, \"J-Just treating me well, D-Damien. Anything else I can get you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spot his hand snaking down to her brown rump, squeezing an ass cheek to get an unwilling squeak from the Lopunny with him sneering, \"How thoughtful of you my beautiful bitch! Just get my two new guests here something to quench their thirst~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tries to fight off his hand to turn away with a fake smile to head down the stairs, but he suddenly pops her rear with a swift spank that leaves a glowing mark there on her cheeks. \"...And head to my quarters later tonight, won't you? I need to show you how much I <i>appreciate</i> your work~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lopunny doesn't look back at him, but you can see the expression of dread on her face as she just silently nods and heads back down in a bit of a hurried pace. You feels something oddly familiar about the Lopunny, but you're brought back to the issue at hand once Damien's attention is back on you. He takes a large swig of his drink and loses the smile on his face, \"So. Care to explain to me that in all my years that I've been in this area, I've never seen or heard a trace of you two 'neighbors' in my land.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reply with the straightest face you can manage, \"We're a bit of travelers of sorts. We simply nest out in a spot until its dry of some resources or too over-crowded with ferals for our tastes. The tar pits made a good way to fence off intruders and other ferals. We manage on our own as hunters during the days. It's how we've managed to live so long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, hunters for survival or for sport?\" Damien asks with a bit of intrigue and swirling his drink in his cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit of both.\" You say with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Houndour sets the drink down, but something tells you that he probably wouldn't even be legal to drink liquor at all. He looks and feels like he could just be an older teen. But his expression is less hostile at this point, \"Mmmhhmmm. Well, perhaps I should actually introduce myself. The name's Damien, and this is my lovely family.\" He turns to look over his shoulder, past the balcony fence that overlooks the entire large room of other guards and punks. \"From the bedrock to the summit!\" He calls out loudly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire crowd littered about immediately stop what they were doing, slamming their fists to a surface near them in unison to cry out, \"From the bedrock to the summit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien gives a small wave for the men to resume their actions with him glancing back at you, \"A strong crowd that does whatever it wants, when it wants. I keep them in-line. And who might you two be?\" His eyes particularly peer over to Jackal who hasn't said a word, and more importantly, didn't look confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Lance, and this is my partner, Zack.\" You explain. Jackal opens his mouth to speak, but immediately interrupt with, \"He doesn't talk much!\" The Typhlosion simply shuts his mouth and just plays along, looking rather disgruntled off to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien nods his head, \"Hmmm, alright <i>Lance</i>. Mind if I ask you why you suspected of my men tearing the walkways down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried going to some town nearby for some questions, but the cowards wouldn't let me in or talk to me. They mentioned your group, so I figured I'd check.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you're talking Hedgen.\" Damien huffs before tilting his cup over his head, ramping down an entire mugs' worth of ale down his mouth to slam the cup back down, exhaling greatly. \"Hmph. That village is a place for good-for-nothing townsfolk who can't help themselves or anyone without discipline. I used to run that place, you know, but they couldn't see my vision eye-to-eye. Bastards tried casting me out, but luckily I've gotten several people to understand my campaign.\" He stands up and rubs over his flat stomach, showing a bit of his abs. \"With a bit of time, I got this place up and running as a base of operations. My men and I built this mill as we wanted to, all without the townsfolk's help who left us to die in the outside wilderness with the infected. But I'm not like them. I know where I fit on the scale of society and nature. From the bedrock I rose to the summit, I became the top of the food chain. Not the ferals. The infected are <i>scared</i> of this land. We go out and hunt <i>them</i> to take the fight back. Unlike the worthless souls of Hedgen, including this fucked-up planet. This world has gone out of order as of late, but I'm going to set it back how it should be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks over his men and continues, \"These men know where they stand in the natural order, and they'll follow me to the top where I belong. We'll plow anyone who stands in our way of what we deserve underneath us, because if you can't take what you want, you don't deserve to even try or live. I will never be a castaway again. I will be better than anyone who looks down on me. As will these men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien glances back to you and grins. \"From the bedrock to the summit is our code. Our creed if you will. We're gonna become a fierce army that takes back that town and use it for what it's meant for. Restart the mines. Control the entire mountain there from top to bottom. Clean the entire area of ferals with hunting parties. And that should be fun with the amount of people we have. We'll make sure we rape the Hell outta those freaks to never think about a cock or pussy again. Any weakling who can't adapt to our standards will be forced to mine or eaten. If they won't benefit us, eating them certainly will. That way they're not such a waste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal gives you an uneasy look and you struggle to remain seated in your chair. Everything about this young brat made you want to shove him off the balcony right off the spot, but that was simply a suicide attempt with how many people you and Jack would have to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien stares at you to get your reaction, adding, \"So Lance and Zack. You want to join us in our trek uphill, plunder what you want, fuck any girl you have your eyes on, eat any shithead who messes with you, or would you prefer being on the opposite of that spectrum. We fuck you up to our hearts' content and throw you out like garbage when we're done or digested you with the others who decided that they were, 'above our cause'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up, ready to choke the runt out on the spot until you're interrupted when the Lopunny slave girl comes back. She quietly sets two drinks on the table and gives a bow. She heads back down and you're left looking down at the drink with Damien and Jackal's eyes on you. Taking the mug of golden booze, you think about splashing the spoiled Houndour with it, only to just raise it up some to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From the bedrock to the summit.\" You say before chugging a thick swig of your beverage.</span></div></div>",

Oddly enough, a mere sip of the liquor was harder to get down than the first feral you ate. Your eyes unfocus some and blink a bit, unsure of how to handle such a strong drink, yet you manage your stance and composure enough to convince Damien otherwise. The Houndour claps his hands in congratulations, \"Atta' boy~!\" He looks over to 'Zack' who looks a little dumbfounded and later took a cup up quickly to chug it down. Maybe Jackal was a more common drinker or simply had more of a tough drive than you, because he swallowed the pint with ease down into his belly. He smacks the cup down on the table leaving nothing in it but suds. He wipes his mouth with an arm before patting his gut to leave Damien chuckling, and later, laughing. \"Hahahahaaa. I like you two boys! Oh but I shouldn't say that now should I? You're men! Men apart of my lovely, caring family that can enjoy life like the rest of us <i>civilized</i> people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe takes his own heavy swing of his cup and set it down. He sighs with an open maw and floppy dog tongue with a face of complete satisfaction on his face like he just accomplished something great. \"I don't know what it is, but I think I can really enjoy you two. Oh, and speaking of enjoying two...~\" The Houndour grins when looking ahead that you look over your shoulder to see what it was. The same Lopunny girl comes back with more drinks and two other companions; both of them Persians. Damien murrs out with extended arms, \"Ah, my precious bitches. C'mere you lovelies~\" Both of the cats saunter past you and give mischievous looks to you before settling on the couch with Damien, one in each of his arms at his sides. Cuddling up to him, you discover that they look practically identical. Their heights and age look the same with the only difference being that one was female with a blue gemstone on its head with the other being male with a red gemstone. They purr with curling tails and rest their hands against Damien's chest and sides, stroking at his masculine and lithe figure while flashing you naughty glances. The Houndour continues, \"These two are the most prized possessions a lucky dog like me could ever have. Meet the twins! This lovely goddess laying next to my right is Sapphire...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue gemstoned Persian murrls out, \"Hi there cuties~\" She says to you and Jackal, followed with a wink and a stuck-out tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And the seductive devil here to my left is Ruby.\" Damien adds when nudging up along the red gemstoned Persian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pleasure to meet you two. Are these the latest toys for the group? I love fresh takes, especially when they're nice young men~\" Ruby says while tracing his fingers over Damien's abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal gulps silently to himself before Damien interrupts with bellowing laughter, \"Hahaha! Oh you wish Roobz. I'm the only nice young man you need~\" The Houndour leans his mouth over to expose his teeth, grazing them over the male Persian's neck to force Ruby to release a much needed 'mrrrowl' of pleasure from his mouth. Damien then glances back to the both of you and explains, \"No, actually, they're not. But you were right about them being new. They've just joined a moment ago after just a simple conversation! And I plan on getting to know them a bit better. The mysterious but dashing Lucario is Lance, and that tubby Typhlosion is Zack. Apparently doesn't talk too much though, so maybe you could coax him to socialize a bit more~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire smiles and slowly slides off of Damien to crawl on her hands and knees low on the table between the two parties. Her face expresses a hungry look as she's prowling with sauntering hips like an actual cat. Her breasts drag over the flat surface of the table underneath her as he blue eyes lock to Jackal. Licking her lips, she purrs aloud, \"Oooooh, I bet I could make him sing. I like it when I can make big men moan higher than a girl can~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly rises up from her knees to show off her naked breasts adorning her chest and glides her hands up along her curvy sides to cup over the round mounds. Jackal's face flares red with his jaw craned open slightly, truly unable to say anything either way as the Persian bites her bottom lip. \"Heehee. Are you sure I can't keep him as my cat toy~? He looks so cute when I can make him flush hot like that by just teasing him. Mmhhh. Do you think he'd jizz if I just touched him? He looks so desperate for a woman. Let me see where his weak spot is~\" She slides off of the counter and begins to shift over onto Jackal's lap, getting his mane of fire to erupt a blazing heat behind him with nose lightly bleeding a bit from having the attractive feline welcome herself over onto him. His hands weakly go over to cup against the side of her thighs while her own plant against his wide tummy to smush into the taut pudge a bit. \"Ohh, he's definitely a big fella. Certainly hasn't missed out on a meal or brawl. But let's see just how <i>big</i> you really are~!\" Her rear end begins to swirl around on top of his lap to get Jackal to look over to you with worry and reddened cheeks. A small bit of blood even leak over the end of his snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to stop her by suggesting, \"U-Uh, er, heh actually, I wouldn't bother. He's pretty small when it comes to length.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal's mane gives an obvious flare of its flames and he grits his teeth in a scowl. He didn't seem to enjoy wanting rescue that way. Damien laughs. \"Hohohooooooo...oh Lance. Way to demoralize your poor friend there, cause damn. Does that mean you two have fun with one another~? Maybe you should have Ruby then if men are what you want. I guarantee he'll milk you dry to where you could just die in joy~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male Persian stands up at the sound of this, showing his obvious twinky build with a taut and cute rump on him, little to no muscle on him. His grin is wide to one side of his face, and each step he takes towards you is in front of the other paw. Dancing his tail behind him, he murrs, \"Kitties need their milk. But I like feeding from my meat straws in private. Maybe I can get to know you more, Lance, uncover some naughty secrets about you~\" His hands rest on his hips while leaning to one side. His own tongue runs over his mouth as you're left with your own problem. Jackal is too busy struggling to fight off the other Persian's advances, grunting and murring with glee as her soft, thin-furred form courses over him in a chest to chest slow lap dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien shows off his teeth from a smirk to say, \"Oh well, I was going to invite Lance upstairs to the balcony and show him <i>the game</i>. You should get a real kick out of it, Lancey boy. But if you want to play with either of my precious cats, go right ahead. You can see me afterwards to discuss your living arrangements and have some fun! Just remember. If my bitches are unhappy, I'm unhappy. Don't make me unhappy. Give em' a real treat and they'll treat you just fine~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're given a tough choice now as you look between all three of your options here. You see the playful female cat straddled on Jackal and getting him to lose his focus and composure. But her just teasing him would just all be in good fun, right? Clearly Jackal would want it. Probably a bit more. But you wouldn't want him saying something stupid either to get you both caught so you could simply take Sapphire away somewhere private. You could have some fun yourself that way if you wanted to. Then there's Ruby who has a brow raised at you and that same grin on his face. It seemed insincere however, and it was obvious he didn't trust you just yet. It might be good to head with him somewhere and get yourself on his good side, but who knows what he was planning. Then there was Damien himself. It would be wise to go along with him, but that leaves Jackal all alone with both of the Persians, and with Sapphire's work on him and Ruby's caution about you both, maybe that wouldn't be such a good idea either. Then again, Jackal would flip if a man tried to advance him in any way, so maybe he would be okay then actually? All he had to do was keep his trap shut.

Jackal's sexual tension could be sacrificed when it came to the goal of stopping this Houndour. You needed to learn all that you could about him and his fortress before you and the others could take it all down, with the exact same happening for him as well. You sit up from your seat with hands on your hips, retorting back, \"Maybe I'll show your cats how a Lucario really does it another time. I'm interested in what this <i>game</i> is actually. Is it something you guys do for fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Houndour's expression changes to an intrigued one as he begins to head off and away from the couch, \"Hehheh...something like that!\" He cups an arm around Ruby to secure a quick kiss to the male Persian, murring quietly afterwards to the cat's ear, \"I'll leave you two to the poor chubby bastard over there. But keep him around, alright~? That goes for the Lucario too. I'd actually like to keep a new set of recruits for once. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feline passes a glance to the canine, brushing the arm away with a hand as he struts off to join his sister. You can't help but notice his eyes glaring at you for a moment when he continues by you, all before reaching Jackal. Damien pats his own side and begins to head for some stairs. \"C'mon! Allow me to show you one of my favorite parts about my family and my home.\" His tail swaggers about behind him as you follow him without much delay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind, your ears catch the sounds of Ruby's voice murring, \"Well well now, big boy, looks like I need to-\" He's suddenly cut off by Jackal angrily retorting, \"Oh <i>HELL</i> no!\" with a lot of thrashing in his seat. Seems like he didn't enjoy the male's company all that much. You can only pray that it was the right choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ascend the stairs, walking past other aggressive looking men with a major lack of women around. Perhaps it's because women probably wouldn't be around to just freely roam or drink...they'd be handled differently by the 'fellow' brethren. It only convinces you it was a good idea to leave behind the other members of the group like Star and Eden, and it encourages you all the more to slam Damien's skull against your fist. Damien quietly continues to head up level by level, gifting you enough time to see just how many people he's claimed in his cause, which was nothing more than a cult. It worries you just how many men there are that seem just as vile as Damien, gambling, drinking, patrolling the halls with unfamiliar looks on their faces when they notice you with their leader. The constant glances slow you down some, only to feel something big and furry shove against your back to force you forward a few steps. You twist around to see the brown gut of the Houndour leader's guard, Bigby. The Bibarel doesn't smile or anything, and merely tips his head to get you moving. \"Don't stop now. You heard the boss.\" You scowl back at him some, knowing that he was probably going to be a problem later on. But no use in starting a fight. Turning back around, you head off to where Damien went up to find yourself out on a balcony with him now. You were several floors high in the wooden lumber mill, seeing a good bit of the pine forest around. But something was directly below the fenced patio that looked to be an assortment of bushes. A coach is laid close to the guard railing of the balcony with Damien already lounging along it, keeping a leg crossed over the other and an arm lazed over the back of it with a large bronze gong next to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger dog smile at you and tosses his head to get you over. You stand in front of the coach but have yet to sit in it. You curiously look over the fence to see what exactly was there to see, only to have the Houndour explain, \"So...sadly not everyone in my family gets along...and sometimes they even go as far to think of themselves and <i>only</i> for themselves. That doesn't fly with me. So we've created a little punishment for those who wish to sink themselves back down to the bedrock. It's the game~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a maze. Tall brick walls covered in overgrown ivy make a circular labyrinth to navigate through, and some areas were completely concealed with brick ceilings and what looked like dens. Many grunts and growls echoed from the walls, with some of the ivy along the walls shifting with movement in the rounding alleyways and paths that you aren't quick enough to fully see. But you had a good idea what was in that maze. You turn to look at the fang-grinning Houndour with Bigby behind him, arms crossed, standing behind his boss with a rather smug look to rile a reaction. You clear your throat, \"So...poor bastards get thrown in there, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien is quick to snap by leaning forward with a single finger jetting out to banter at you, \"No, <i>useless</i> bastards get thrown in there! Cowards. Traitors. And especially <i>thieves</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So just taking something equates to execution, huh?\" You retort, but Damien doesn't budge his expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's even eager to answer, \"Abso-fucking-lutely. Because when you're a thief, you're no better than a killer. Perhaps even worse. Because when you steal something vital from someone like our food or supplies? That's essentially just making life harder on us, y'know? You're a parasite slowly picking us off. It's a slow death. Those who steal get the same treatment as they do with their victims...\" He glances back a Bigby, nodding to him to get the large and chubby beaver to ring a bell. You hear shuffling above them as Damien walks over to the fence, leaning against it with you. \"...a slow demise. Stewing in some animal's gut down there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Staraptor bandit suddenly flies off the roof from the canopy above you, carrying another person with him. It was a Manectric, strapped in a black rubber harness, muzzle, and overall suit to cease any powerful electrical attacks he could use against his captor. He's struggling madly, trying to fight off the hold of the avian with his mouth barking, \"G-Ggrrrmphh!! Fuck...gnnh, you Damien!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Houndour merely smiles and waves to the bound dog before calmly talking to your way, eyes locked on his prisoner, \"That's Saul. I liked Saul some, until one of my fellow men caught him sneaking out a cart of fruit and vegetables that weren't really his to take. After asking him nicely where he was going to take a good amount of our food to, he decided not to answer and challenged me directly instead. Call it self-defense~. So now here we are. Teaching this parasite a thing or two of what food really is. You ready Saul~?\" He calls out with the last sentence. The Manectric merely curses at him again before being dropped into the labyrinth below. He yelps and rolls along the dirt before staggering up awkwardly. His arms were belted behind his back that he was having obvious trouble with to get off. Damien points a finger to Bigby to get the beaver to click a small clock to start it ticking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Manectric down below growls out with a furious bark, \"I'm gonna kill you, you stupid brat! You're lucking none of the other men have done it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why didn't you kill me when we had that little tussle? Oh right. It's because I handed you your own ass after I beat the shit out of it. Tell ya what! If you get out of the maze, you can get another chance to kill me! If you prove that you're above being feral chow, I'd love to dine on you myself~\" The hellhound says with a cocky grin, swatting his tail about in a happy dance. \"Bigby! It's dinner time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bibarel happily takes a mallet from the table with the clock and bashes the large gong, sending a tremoring noise that alerts all of the infected Pokemon in the maze. They roar in unison with their meal's heart dropping. He panicks and picks a direction to go in. The walls are too high for him to get over, and his electricity fizzles to weak amounts with the black rubber straps belting along most of his body. You and Damien both watch him when he's close enough to balcony to see over the walls, finding dead end after dead end with your own eyes as you attempt to solve the maze yourself with a higher view. But then it hits you. Looking along the whole maze, you don't see any exits points. There are some openings along the outer edges, but the first couple of ones you reverse-track also lead to just dead ends. There aren't any paths leading to those. This wasn't a maze. It was a permanent trap. You turn to look at the Houndour's face when it wasn't focusing on you, and it was this twisted sense of beauty in his eyes. The sudden yelp of the Manectric brings you back to look down and out to the maze to try and find him, and you can see the tip of his head looking at something before turning and running; and something eagerly gave chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to tell, but you discover it was an infected Granbull, a male one by what you saw, cornering Saul into a wall with no way around the drooling best. \"H-Haghh f-fuck! Get the fuck away fr-MMmmGHK!!!\" He was pounced instantly, pinned to the ground out of your view, but with the whines, dirt being kicked up, and the muffled tone of the Manectric, it was far too evident what was happening. You were rather glad you didn't have to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop the time Bigby.\" Damien says, sighing with his head cupped into his hand. \"...Dare I ask, what's the time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A minute, forty-one seconds.\" The beaver huffs with a baffled look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien shakes his head, \"Arceus, what a fucking pathetic run. Sorry if that bored you, Lance. Usually people do better than that. Ohh well. Carve it in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance over to see the infected Granbull pawing at its wobbling round belly, gurgling out ambiently along the maze walls to trot over somewhere to relax in wherever its den was in the place before you hear a wood panel turn over behind you. Bigby draws out a knife and carves Saul's name and time into it, under where the other 'players' were. You scan the panel. Dozens of names line the huge board. All with times. All of them labeled, 'The Losers'.</span></div></div>",

You turn to look at his grinning face when you make it to the bottom of the staircase with his hands on his hips, \"So! I don't have to worry ever tossing you in the maze, right?\" You glare back at him with the Bibarel guard of his standing right there, glaring ahead at you for your answer from over Damien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow your pride and grin back, shaking your head, \"Mmhhh...probably not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! I can have Bigby show you the ropes here, probably take you to your quarters to get a room set up with your 'phlosion buddy and-\" Damien begins to explain before you cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa-whoa uh, you know, uh, I can't stay here...\" From what you said, Damien tilts his head with his head cocked some. There was a sick moment of silence from him as you have to continue, \"...at least, not for tonight! Cause Zack and I have to get our stuff from our own hideout home! We have some important things, not a lot that we can just carry over here before we you know, settle in here. I should go find him to get our things and we'll be back tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can come back tonight.\" A sultry male voice purrs out. You attention is brought forth to Ruby, the Persian that saunters his way over to the trio of you. His tail curls happily with his face as sly and his tone. \"...You said you just lived past those tar pits right? That's hardly far away~\" He lifts a brow himself with his one-sided smile and locked eyes. Just perfect. Last thing you needed was being constrained by this cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien adds on to the idea, \"Yeah the sun's still out! No need for you to be out so long, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do your best not to defy the bandit leader. \"Yeah, uh, sure! I guess we can get back tonight if hurry. I better go look for that big oaf before it gets dark-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby chimes in, \"Oh, he's probably off having some fun with my sis. No need to waste time dragging him along. I can just come with you and help you take what you need. I overheard it wasn't much to carry~? So it shouldn't be a problem then. Call it cat-curiousity, but it'd be nice to know where you two have been hiding under our nose all this time. But we're all friends here, right~?\" Even more perfect. There didn't seem to be any way out of this, and surely the Houndour would choose his favorite slut over some stranger he met moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bibarel even opens his dumb mouth, \"Yeah, you're friend's in good hands. Ruby'll keep you good company too~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou retain a sigh and nod, \"...Alright, I guess that could work. But just remember to keep up.\" You head down some more steps that go down to the main atrium of the bandit mill with Ruby tagging along. The slutty cat waves his master 'ta-ta' and murrs close to the back of your ear, \"Right behind you~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you go through the main room, you can't help but catch a few images of things. Like the several men getting served at the bar by that Lopunny girl, a large pit in the center closed off by wooden bars domed over ahead to act as a caged fighting ring. Two men are going at it each other with their fists with the crowd outside placing their bets on one or the other. You even get a glimpse of Jackal relaxing in the back of the room where Ruby's female counterpart was with him down on her knees, hands cupped to her breasts, rolling them around his twitching shaft and lapping at its head. His head is rolled back with closed eyes and an open mouth, clearly enjoying it like the time of his life. He was unable to see you, and Ruby placed his hand to your back to keep you moving forward to where the main gate outside would be. Looks like you wouldn't get the chance to talk to him. You just hope that he'd be alright by himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack outside during the sunset, the forest is dark and orange, lit up by the fire of the horizon. You probably wouldn't get the chance to have a full plan with your team back at Hedgen if you want to make it back tonight. But then again, you set yourself up for this. You'd just have to find a way to take care of the untrusting cat following you and meet up with the others. Whatever you'd come up with. The assault on the lumber mill would have to be soon at night, or else something might happen to Jackal should 'Lance' and Ruby never return. The wooden gate closes behind you, and you were alone with Ruby, standing there in the wilderness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat states without coyness in his voice this time, \"Show me this home of yours, or you're going to regret wasting Damien's time.\" It was clear he planned on ridding your facade and of course deal with you were you to be an imposter. You're already walking through the pine forest away from the lumber mill with cat refusing to walk anywhere else other than behind you to see if you pull anything, and you have yet to answer him. Saying anything might just rouse more suspicion, but you certainly had to deal with him soon. The farther you'd lead him away from Hedgen, the less of time you'd have to meet up with the others and figure out a way to get Jackal back and deal with Damien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez. Do you usually attempt to scare the hell out of newbies? Relax cat.\" You retort back, as if it would actually cease Ruby's caution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could try to gain his trust during the walk towards the tarpits, or you could just attempt to take him on right now. Might even sneak a hit or two to get the advantage...</span></div></div>",

Getting him to settle down first and earn more of your trust along the way would be the best course of action first. And what better way than having a talk with him? It'd only make things worse if you're just awkwardly dead silent the whole trip. As you walk through the forest in a general direction you think the tar pits are in far off, you turn your head over your shoulder some to ask, \"...So what's your story with Damien?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" The Persian asks a few paces away. You can hear the grass crunch underneath each step of his hindpaws, knowing he was well too far from you for a good punch or kick. \"I'm his favorite bitch. What's there for you to not get~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no. That's not what I meant. How did you meet him?\" You ask with clear indication this time. The Persian remains silent for a good bit before speaking aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I've known him since we were kids. We grew up in Hedgen, a town close to here. We were a trio of delinquents, you could say, with my twin sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head to continue walking forward with a sudden brush of air going by. It was getting colder and darker outside. The sunset wouldn't last too much longer with how dim of an orange the sky burned. \"He seems pretty young to be leadin' a band of men out here in the wilderness with the infected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't let his age and size fool you, mutt. He can do more than just kick and rape your big blue ass~\" The cat grunts with a smile as his arms cross over his chest. His red eyes gaze at your rump during your steps as you would love more than anything than to sneer that insult down, but Ruby continues, \"There's a reason why things are they way they are, you know. Damien didn't just claimed leadership. He earned it. Back when we were just kits and puppies, he was the leader of our little trio of thieves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one's ever fought him for the alpha spot?\" You inquire, only to be shot down immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat laughs, \"He's had more fights like that than he has for sparring. Plenty of the men have challenged him or got overconfident with his ruling. And each one lost and joined those flat abs of his~\" It bothers you that he's never been beaten apparently, even when thinking about the clearly large and powerful Pokemon in his family of bandits and crooks. But you've overcome impossible odds. Surely you could take him, right? Even Ruby was thinking on the subject, snickering, \"You can challenge him too if you think you're up for it. Damien would probably take you and your Typhy friend on simultaneously and still make meals out of the both of you. Hehehe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you'd miss me if that was the case.\" You try to deflect the subject of your demise, humoring the cat instead of protesting against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby takes the bait and scoffs with a grin, \"Oh, would I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around, but you remain to walk backwards as you face the cat directly with a cocked brow, \"Would you~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis gets the Persian to cock a smile of his own some. With half-lidded eyes and a smirk scrunched over to one side of his face, he murrs, \"...Mmmh, I guess I would...~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin back at him before pivoting around once more to continue your travel. It wasn't like you had a clue where you were going, but the Persian's mind was now on something other than wondering where your nonexistent den was. You even play with the idea of swaying your tail back and forth since the perverted cat already mentioned your ass. It was a treat the cat would definitely take notice to and enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your chest meets Ruby's own as the cat's back hits a tree. No words are exchanged between the two of your once your muzzle locks to his mouth, twining you together into a deep kiss that certainly riles the Persian up. The two of you had been walking and talking still, but it was clear you won him over with enough advances. He truly was a bitch when it came to pleasuring another male, but maybe it helped that you were a strong and capable canine like his lovable Damien. His hands are immediately wrapped around you, clinging to you as if it was for dear life that digs his claws into you some. However, you brace the pain by hungrily working your tongue in his mouth to elicit a muffled mewl of pleasure vibrating the wet walls around your probing muscle. Ruby was actually getting along with you a hell of a lot more as you continued to chat with him from your walk, but you may have gone overboard with your teases and likability, resulting in him nearly pouncing you down to fuck your brains out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't one to just turn down the offer however. Banging him was probably the best way to get him on your side of things for once. His sandpapery tongue wallows out to take control of your own tongue, but you eagerly wrestle it back. Your tongue was thicker and stronger than his own which makes it easy to pin against his cheek walls and obscure most of the room in his mouth. \"M-Mmmphhrrrhpphh...!!!\" He moans loud in the kiss as he begins to grind his lithe, curvy figure against you. His claws seize at your body with those thighs of his wiggling happily. A firm erection was even sporting out, and yours wasn't too far off from a full boner either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hhrrhhh...~\" You happily exhale out as your hands roam at his lovely sides to get handfuls of his body. It wasn't like you were going to complain about things were going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...But perhaps you should think twice about it? Because as nice as it sounded to rail this cat, it was nighttime at this point, deep in a dark forest that already proved to have infected roaming around. You don't want to be caught by some feral when you're balls deep in this cat, but your libido implored the idea. A twisted pleasure in the threat of getting caught as you were doing it, but you attempt to shake the idea away. Why on earth would you like that...? The remembrance that the psychic villain at large behind this infection was using their influence on all Pokemon to get them into their more animalistic desires comes to mind.</span></div></div>",

The situation was beginning to win your lust over, yet you fight it, knowing fully well you didn't have any time to waste here if you want to warn your group and get Jackal back. Plus, you swore you heard a noise distantly out from behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby however is panting heavily with his hands exploring around at your head, running his clawtips along your noggin, muzzle, and neck with his chest rumbling from his pleasant purrs. \"PrrRRrrrrRRrrr...you're keeping me waiting, you bastard...\" He moans into your ear before biting it softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as you'd like to return the favor, you begin to push away from him, unpinning the Persian from the tree that he had his back to shake your head. \"N-No...hold up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" He groans with a clear distaste, keeping his hands on you with an angry look of disappointment on his face. \"I don't think you realize that when I want something, I get i-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou silence him with your own hand by cupping his mouth with it, retorting in a lower voice, \"No no, shhh!\" He glares ahead at you with pinched brows, wriggling his short snout that tickles your palms in his whiskers, but he does indeed remain quiet as the two of you listen out for a brief moment. Nothing but the rustling of trees sounds out in the cold wind, yet there was a sudden shift farther off on the ground. Ruby slaps your hand away, only then to twist you around and slam his back to your own. \"Agh! Wha-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If there's an infected out there, it can't sneak up on both of us, right? Goodness...I so looking forward to tonight too.\" He grumbles as he stares ahead, surveying the area in the darkness. You try to do the same, acting as eyes for one another's backs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reply with readied fists and a flick of your previously nibbled ear, \"You sure we'll be able to see this thing? It's complete blackness out there.\" Even with some moonlight, the trees obscure the sky to where the infected could be in front of you and you wouldn't even notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see clearly in the dark with my feline eyes. Can't say the same for you, pooch. Just look for a pair of purple dots. Their eyes fucking glow no matter what.\" Ruby answers as his claws are fully unsheathed out. His long tail idly brushes on one of your legs as he adds, \"And after we gut this thing, I'm straddling on top of you and going to town, whether we have another infected audience or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou huff at that before igniting your fists with your flaming aura, illuminating some of the forest area before you in a flickering blue light. Nothing moving or purple eyed catches your attention, yet you continue to hear something shifting in the environment, like brushing smooth flesh. It was becoming louder, ever-so-faintly that really confuses your ears. It was only until you hear a branch that you fling your head upwards to surely enough catch a pair of glowing violet orbs glaring down at you. \"Above us!\" You say before ramming yourself against Ruby, tackling the cat down to the ground away from the large predator landing right where you once stood. It was massive in size, landing in a collected thud, yet its upper body remains upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising up to your hindpaws, the growling Persian below you grabs your hand and helps himself up to a full stance as well to face off with your now common enemy. The burning aura around your palms brightens to reveal a large unraveled snake body before you, rising up to a naga torso to an infected Serperior. The grass snake was rather large in both width, length, and muscle. Its drooling jaws spread apart with long white fangs dripping with its hot saliva unlatching from the roof of its mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>HhhHHHHSSSSSSSSS...!!!</i>\" The hiss was violently loud that gets Ruby to retort, \"Awh shut your trap. Let's slit this thing's throat and be done with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're rather unsure about just charging at this naga head on given its sheer size. Its coiling length was thicker than plenty of other nagas around, probably just showing evidence of how many meals its had to pack its hide. Even its upper body was intimidating though, with buff arms that hadn't been underutilized with an obviously flat male chest in broad pecs. But with the help of Ruby, you were certain that you could take it down. Even with a lithe figure, the cat was most likely capable of speed, and has been in more than just a single tussle in his life if he was one of Damien's men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing as though you were a part of your group, you begin to plan out, \"Alright. We need to stay on opposite sides of it. So I need you to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rip its guts out? Way ahead of you puppy~!\" The Persian growls before darting on ahead, clearly not following your sudden act of leadership. The infected Serperior lunges its upper body towards the cat, but Ruby was fairly quick enough to leap over it and rake his claws along its back in the process. It hisses in pain before swinging its mighty tail to smash into the cat, flinging the Persian over to a tree. Ruby yowls out, only to land his hindpaws on the tree to rebound back with another jump and get an extra rake across the Serperior's cheek. Landing with a roll, the snake goes for another reach of its tail in an attempt to nab Ruby's leg, only to receive a deafening uppercut of your aura-burning fist to its jaw. The snake slumps back in a daze as you ready an Aura Sphere between your palms, ready to blast the snake away with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Serperior growls with a hand cupping its jaw, glaring ahead at you with a clear disdain of punishing you for that hit. Before it can lunge, you blast your projectile towards with a close enough range that would most likely hit it. However, Ruby tackles the snake's upper body to swing it over to the side, causing your attack to completely miss and blast a tree behind the naga. You silently curse the cat as he drapes his legs around the snake's upper sides to crush between his thighs as he goes to claw away at its face and chest. The infected hisses as its hands go to try and pry the riled Persian off, struggling to not have those claws puncture anything vital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan as you're forced to go help, only to hear the violent snap of wood begin to rip and tear. You turn to the tree trunk you erupted an Aura Sphere against, seeing the tall thing of nature beginning to teeter over towards you. Diving off to the side, you hit the dirt with the timbering tree slamming down just inches from your tail and legs that wince upwards from the impact. Your heart skips a beat before you rise back up to a stand with a large tree trunk in your way of Ruby and the infected serpent fighting on the ground at the other side. Hopping up onto the fallen trunk, you're ready to help, only to have the cat's slung body slam into you after being tossed off the infected. Your back meets the ground once again as Ruby is hurled away in a roll farther off from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour spinal cord clearly didn't enjoy the fall, nor did your ribs appreciate the new ache from the cat's impact either, but all of that had to be ignored with the large Serperior now slithering over the fallen tree with its purple eyes glaring down at you purposely. You begin to stagger up, needing to think of how you want to approach it next...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0From the large snake easily towering over you with clenched fists and coils spilling over the fallen tree to get to you slowly, it was obvious that you needed all the help you could get to take this thing down; even if that meant forcing Ruby to cooperate. You roll back up onto your hindpaws to retreat back to the fallen Persian. Ruby was on the ground groaning aloud with snarled fangs, and you reach a hand to pull him back up, \"C'mon, get up!\" You exclaim for him to hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slaps your hand away and begins to stagger up on his own, \"I'm working on that you bitch. Now don't get in my wa-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have time for this. With your hands yanking on his sides, you force the Persian up onto his own hindpaws and growl, \"You wanna take this thing down fast? Then work with me, dammit!\" You exclaim as you glance at it. \"I'm gonna get the thing to focus and lunge at me. I need you behind it to attack its exposed back when it does. Think you can do that, or do you need your boyfriend Damien's help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph.\" Ruby scoffs to finally see some control from you. \"Easy. Try not to get chomped, pup. I'm not helping you if you get snagged~\" The Serperior angrily hisses and approaches the two of you, signalling Ruby to scatter off to the side. The naga is ready to go after the runner, but a small Aura Blast from your palms grazes its arms to make it howl out and grab the burn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand before it with aura-flaming fists, ready for it to make a move. \"That's right. I'm the one you want. C'mere...\" You glance some to see if Ruby was around, but the Persian was long gone out of your view. You could only hope that the Persian was following through with the plan...instead of actually bailing on you to leave you to fight alone with the serpent. The Serperior glares at you with its violet gaze as its rumbles a deep and unpleasant hiss. Clearly you pissed it off, and it wouldn't take you lightly anymore. It was closing the distance from between you and itself, slithering far strongly and quicker then your legs were stepping backwards. The closer it gets, the harder it would be to dodge out of its way, and the naga knew this. You begin to feel with worry about the sudden plan you made, because even if Ruby followed through with it, you still might have the long white fangs you can see outstretching from its maw in you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....HhhhhhhhhhhhhHHHHSSS!!!\" It hisses before making its move the moment you take a final step, lunging quickly with spread jaws. Just then, Ruby leaps off from a branch with a mewling hiss of his own, raking the Serperior's back on his way down with his clawed fingers. You luckily had thrown a punch to connect with the thing's snout to luckily have its jaws miss and snap closed right next to your face. Its upper body suddenly arcs upwards from the stinging lines on its back, fully exposing its abdomen out for you to charge another aura-building punch. Your blue flaming fist drills into the naga's abdomen, with the muscles taking a lot of the blow, but muscles or not, the force sends the snake backwards. Ruby leaps out of its teetering way for it to slam onto the earth by its own heavy weight. And together, both of you run of up to its growling head to deliver a firm and simultaneous kick to both sides of its skull for an immediate knock out of its senses. Its lengthy body and arms flop in place, but the naga is pounded out of reality and lies there limply. Its fingers and tailtip twitch, yet that's about as much of a response you and Ruby get out of it as you stand there waiting for it to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exhales more and put your hands to your knees, huffing, \"I think...I think we got it... Good job, Ruby.\" You stare at the snake's closed eyes and partly open mouth to see if it would wake, but you don't get an immediate response from the Persian. \"Ruby?\" You ask when looking up, only to see the male feline stepping over the snake and sauntering his way to you with those swaying hips. The slutty cat suddenly drapes his arms around you, pressing himself right to your chest and opens his smiling mouth. There, it locks with your own muzzle to zip a sudden kiss with you. The cat purrs, lapping his rough tongue to your thick canine one while brushing flat stomachs together in his swaying dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmhhhrr~\" The happy Persian purrs, lightly digging his claws at your back before plucking his mouth off from yours to stare his red eyes at you. \"This doesn't make us friends, but take that as a compliment for doing a good enough job to be alive and well still~\" His fingers trace at your spinal crease with those half-lidded eyes showing their slight admiration before he lets you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a team effort.\" You retort, wiping your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft. It was, but you're lucky that I was even willing to do what you say. Damien's the only one that gets to bark orders at me, pup, and you'd be so dead right now if I didn't follow your stupid idea. You should be thanking me, Lance~\" The Persian purrs, lightly walking back over to the snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold your arm to feel the stress it went through with those punches, but you reply to the confident and selfish cat with, \"Right, but so should you. I don't act as bait for just anyone, and I'd hate to see something awfully terrible happen to you.\" That was a lie of course, but you had to get on his good side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby flicks his tail at you. \"Hmhmhm...trying to flatter me, pup? Many men have tried, but only once succeeded. But I'll keep the thought in mind~\" He smiles at you from over his shoulder before taking his attention to the defeated Serperior. \"Poor Thrashie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thrashie...?\" You say as you approach Ruby's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat explains, \"This is Thrash. Or at least, I'm pretty sure it is. The snake bastard was a part of the family. Only a naga like him was so focused on his looks and body. Muscle-flexing numbskull. He went out alone one night to prove a point that he could bring back any infected alive to Damien, and now look at the dumb cocky bastard. He just ended up like one of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...I'm...sorry.\" You mutter when looking down at the snake, thinking back on every feral you've met was once just a person. Ruby suddenly laughs some though to take you out of the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry? Don't sweat it, pup. I never really liked the guy. In fact, it's pretty ironic, ain't it~? We all made bets that he either got eaten or fucked by a stupid feral. Guess I have some winnings to collect. I had a hunch the big worm was always a whiny sub hungry for dick in his mouth~\" The Persian chuckles to himself at the misery of his fallen comrade before heading to his tail. Picking it up, he orders, \"C'mon and help me drag this back to the camp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" You ask, lightly shocked. Not only did Ruby seem to not care about Thrash's infection, but he went out of his way to say the snake was nothing more than just meat to carry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby huffs, \"It isn't every day we catch a feral alive. It'd be great proof for me to claim my bet winnings, plus we can toss it in the games or just cook up some Serperior stew. The big guy's big. Let's not have his dumb exercise habits go to waste, right~?\" The cat looks out to where the lumber camp's direction would be in, adding, \"Fuck your stuff. We can go out when there's daylight tomorrow. What we have is even better, e-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hand suddenly clenches the cat's head to cut his sentence off as you force his skull to smash into a nearby tree with a thrusting lunge of your arm. His head breaks through the bark of the tree with a wooden crunch, dazing his senses to drop the snake's tail before his body completely crumples right next to it. You didn't want to hear another word he had to say. Ruby was knocked out instantaneously as you stand there before your two quiet enemies. You didn't know which one was worst. One being just a hungry animal bent on devouring or infecting others against its will, or the other being a manipulative, uncaring asshole bent on the benefit for himself and his cruel leader. Either way, you accomplished surviving the battle with the snake and successfully taking care of your evil escort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but we're not going to either place just yet.\" You exhale angrily before scooping your arms around the unconscious cat, slinging him over your shoulder to carry. \"Gotta get back to Hedgen and warn the others. We're getting Jackal out of there, and we're stopping that leader of yours.\" You grunt to your quiet prisoner. With a glance to the Serperior, feeling as though you should say something in a way to pity Thrash, but you remember that he was just one of Damien's men. Someone like that probably wasn't a good person, but you justify saving him from being chopped up like livestock as decent enough sympathy for what happened to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell yourself just to reassure your own goal thus far, \"I'm gonna put an end to the ferals, and the world's going to go back to order. No matter what...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking forward, you try to head towards the direction to the path that leads to Hedgen with the Persian bobbing over on your shoulder...</span></div></div>",

The wooden chair underneath creaks and stomps its front legs from being tilted back from the duck's lounging back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and explain, \"Yeah, I don't like Jackal being there, and if I show back up there in the morning without their leader's most prized lover, well...\" Your voice trails off, knowing that things have now become dire. Some time has skipped since your encounter with the Serperior naga. After knocking Ruby out, you carried him all the way to Hedgen to see your team and Bronze, that town's Marowak mayor. Together, all of you reside in the old sheriff's office of the town which had a jail cell to toss Ruby into whenever he would come to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar sighs as she runs a hand over his forehead, sitting on top of a bar, \"Lace, this is crazy. I was against you heading there at all, especially alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...I was going to do so regardless.\" You answer back which doesn't seem to help the Luxray's qualms at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEden speaks up, \"How about next time you wanna go out and be the hero, <i>everybody</i> comes with you.\" The Roserade was glancing over her shoulder at you before going back to reading through one of the old books left at the office of prisoner check-ins and check-outs. \"No real point in this being a team effort if there's no team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I'm here with you all.\" You explain. \"It's not like we all could've just walked right into that place. You should've seen how many of those bandits there were and what they...do to others... I had to infiltrate alone or else they would've just attacked us, and now, I know just what we're dealing with and what the camp is like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBronze clears his throat while tapping at his bone staff on the floor impatiently, \"And...ahem...how do you plan on just magically taking out Damien's men all in one night?\" The Marowak clearly doubted your incursion and worried for the safety of his village. Should you fail, Damien might see it as an attack from Hedgen, and respond with a raid of his own to the town. \"The people of this village are under grave threat should you choose to act against Damien. It's obvious that we took you in, and we don't need another reason for that damn Houndour to want us dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you had to convince the mayor himself, \"Most of the lumber mill is made out of the wood it's produced. The thing is just a big fire trap, so if we start a large fire from multiple points at the mill, both outside and inside, we can topple the whole thing down. That would take away the bandits' fortress there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBronze shakes his head, \"Of course we've thought about burning that place down, but there's too many men that could easily stop us. A fire at the mill isn't going to create a big enough confusion to panic men like them and make them disperse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but infected will.\" You answer back, leaning more forward on the table you had your hands against. \"They keep living infected in there for games that they have. If we sneak in there, the bandits will have a fire tearing down their building, infected running around, and <i>us</i> to fight with. They fear Damien the most, right? Well I'm going after him. We'll take out their base, their ranks, and their leader. Whoever's left could be manageable for your town, right? The main threats to you would be gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Errr...well...\" The mayor mumbles, scratching at the back of his head that this was actually going to be executed. \"...Lace, I need to know for sure that...you promise that you'll defeat Damien?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare dead in the eyes to assure him the deed will be done. \"I promise. He won't be a problem to your town by the morning, whether that means he's tossed into your jail or if I have to take matters into my own hands to make sure he won't hurt another person again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I...thank you...\" Bronze says, still struck how this was actually happening at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex's coy voice picks up from the fray, \"Buuuuut that's only if we do it tonight. Although I'd prefer this whole ordeal to have been dealt with differently and our hand is...being forced here considering the circumstances, I'm with you on this, Lace. I want our Typhlosion back, and I want that evil pup gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar picks up with arms crossed on her chest and her single eye giving you a personal look, \"Lace, wherever you go, I go. Being alone is the last thing I want, and the first thing I want is for the entire gang to be together again. Let's get Jackal, beat this guy, and we can all move on from this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEden adds, \"I, personally, want to pound this asshole into oblivion. Count me the hell in~\" The Roserade even whips her vines from her flowers slightly with a clear grin of getting to hit Damien and his men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour group turns to Gold who was back to lounging in his chair; his legs were on a table with his chair tilted back and only standing on two. An arm was slung behind his chair along with his head rolled back at the top. But the Golduck was aware he needed to speak up and grumbles, \"....Yyyyyeeeeaaahhh, I guess you guys could use my help. I think if we just left now, I'd start to miss that hot-headed chubster. Plus those bandit dudes don't seem to know how to treat a woman so, aight, count me in. You can all thank me later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome members are ready to scoff at the duck's arrogance, but Bronze also seems to add, \"I would like to help you as well. Your friend does not need to be trapped there, and you're doing all that you can to help a town of strangers. The least we could do in return is offer what we can to make sure this is seen through to the end, once and for all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure, Bronze?\" You ask the Marowak, \"You don't need to push yourself to the point where you'll just endanger yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mayor chuckles at this and stomps his bone club down at the floorboards to reassure, \"I may need some help keeping myself balanced, but I promise you that when I hit, I hit <i>incredibly</i> hard. I'll be teaching Damien and his men some manners~\" You're more than happy to take his help, but Bronze also mentions, \"I have a suggestion for you as well to help destroy and burn the mill. Causing a fire and making sure it spreads without any of the bandits discovering it or snuffing it all out might be troublesome. As you know, Hedgen grew from being a lumber and mining town, and despite both of them being abandoned since the infection, our town is situated at the rim of the mountain. Our mineshafts are still right here, with plenty of the equipment and resources for it scattered about in storage areas. I'm certain that we still have kegs of blastpowder used for excavating the mountain and mines left. We can roll the barrels of this blastpowder to the mill and ignite them to make for immediate chaos and burning the wood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a great idea actually...!\" You exclaim. Having the kegs scattered around at the base would make for a great diversion and confusion against the bandits. The problem was, the kegs would only be able to blow up just the outer walls. \"...Bronze, would there be a way for us to get the kegs <i>inside</i> the mill? We'd have to bail of course to not be caught in the explosions, but do you think Damien would buy that Hedgen were offering them a gift of barrels of ale to have to appease them from destroying the town? You and some villagers take the barrels to the gates and t-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Marowak shakes his head to deny the idea. \"Even a blind person would know what were in those kegs. The blastpowder is easy to catch its scent, and it's quite unique. Damien would catch on, and he certainly wouldn't even think to have the kegs to just be immediately allowed in through the gates without having someone look inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn...\" You mutter, wondering if there was just some kind of way to sneak the kegs all about in the mill without any bandits seeing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then however, a small Piplup maid that worked under Bronze in his home stepped out from the hall with the jail cells, bowing before all of you. \"U-Uhm, Sir Bronze? The...Persian prisoner...is awake now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Marowak smiles and nods, \"Thank you dearie, for watching him. You may return home and turn in early tonight. We can handle this from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Sir Bronze. Have a good night.\" She bows again and begins to walk away shyly, all without flashing you a look before disappearing the entrance door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to head into the hall where Ruby was being held with Bronze following close behind, knowing that you wanted to have a 'talk' with the cat. The Marowak asks you, \"What exactly do you hope to get out of him, mind I ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever I need to get out of him.\"</span></div></div>",

You growl out, \"Comfortable?\" The Persian flashes you a look with those red eyes that could send daggers into your spine and heart. He was sitting on the floor, riding his back close to the far wall away from you inside the cell, yanking on the chains that bound his wrists behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ruby suddenly purrs with a confident smile and half-lidded eyes, \"I've been in tighter situations, don't you worry, pup.

You'd have a <i>fucking retarded expression</i> of crossed eyes and a flopped tongue, with the golden engraving of <i>Dumb Bitchfuck</i> right under it, and we'd make each one of your friends and villagers <i>line the fuck up</i> to bow before it and kiss Damien's paws, pleading with their <i>stupid lives</i> to <i>him</i> not to <i>FUCKING JOIN YOU ON THAT WALL!!!</i>\" Ruby screams, panting in breath almost with a rapid heartbeat, glaring at you with thoughts of going at your throat with his claws right there and then had he get his wrists free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe presses against the bars, facing off against you with his blood boiling. \"Hhhh...hhhh...you fucked up. You fucked up so big, Lucario, you're too stupid to even understand. You should've just gone back to whatever hole you and that fat fuck of a Typhlosion randomly crawled out of, because now, hohohooohh... now you get to face whatever lovely punishment Damien gets to give you and everyone you love when he finds out that you dared to even harm me in any way. You're so <i>fucking</i> dead, oh you are <i>SO fucking DEAD~!!!</i> Ahahahahhaaahh-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drill a punch in between the bars of the cell to sink your fist into the cat's stomach, making him gag on his own words and crumple down onto his knees. \"You leave Damien to me, don't you worry. He'll be joining you in this prison, if he cooperates enough. Otherwise, I might feed him into his own game.\" You threaten back, leaving Ruby choking and coughing some before bearing his teeth together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBronze from behind you speaks up, \"Lace...may I make a request?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name it.\" You reply while looking down at the pathetic feline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we can...I'd like for us to be able to save some prisoners the bandits have themselves. I know that they keep some people alive to...do things to them...\" The Marowak says with disgust and sadness, but Ruby starts chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat is back to looking up at you, and his glance fixates on Bronze afterwards, \"You want to take our toys, eh? Finders keepers, old man. You were using them, and it's all they're good for now anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-They are people. Innocent people that you force into-\" Bronze growls back with a stomp of his staff again, but the Persian talks over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not people anymore, geezer, not after what we did to 'em hehheh. Now they're just dick-hungry husks with enough drugs and sex to keep their minds broken and their holes numb to fuck. And after my Damien comes and saves me, you can join their ranks. I always wanted a piece of your pathetic big brown ass. I'd probably be the most action you've ever had in centuries you fucking skeleton. It would be merciful to make you our sex slave than what's probably going to happen to this Lucario you befriended.\" The cat laughs to himself again, keeping away from the bars this time so you can't punch him. His attention goes back to you, \"...You hear that, Lance? You're fucking screwed no matter what, all of you are. Oh I can't wait to eat your stupid 'phlosion <i>boyfriend</i> fuck right in front of you and make you lick my stomach, crying that I don't have you join it. I want you <i>skinned alive</i>. I want your pelt as my <i>fucking blanket</i> every night to sleep with. I want your bones as the <i>fucking room decorations</i>. I want this entire town <i>burned down with all of its people</i>. <i>I WANT YOU ALL FUCKING DEAD!!!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms slip past the bars, but Ruby easily steps back another time to have himself be out of your reach, making him laugh maniacally all the more. However, you send a simple pulse of your aura to blast the Persian completely off his paws. The feline anthro's back smashes against the wall behind him, making him yelp and slump onto the ground as he was before. \"Sit down and be quiet. My name isn't Lance.\" You retort unhappily but unimpressed with Ruby's threats. There was no good into letting his maddening fantasies get in the way of what you needed tonight. \"You're going to tell me exactly where your people keep any prisoners or slaves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ghhkkk...p-psshh...why would I tell you shit...?! I don't need to tell you where it is...cause you're gonna be locked down there, with all the other sluts in a pitch black room, fucked daily until you're dead!\" Ruby growls out more dryly, now just furious than insanely joyous on the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBronze places a hand on your shoulder, \"We're getting nowhere with this...and beating him will do none of us any good.\" He glances back at Ruby and mutters, \"Well, maybe some of us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, knowing that the Marowak was probably right, but there was suddenly a knock down the hall. You glance over to see Hex standing there, leaned against a wall with his knuckles rolling against it. The coy frog mentions, \"Sorry, but I couldn't help but watch. Do you think I can take the cat out for a spin~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Marowak huffs with confusion, \"What do you hope to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak passes by with his sauntering walk, tapping his orange knuckle clawtip at his bone skull chin with a croaking murrs, \"I have my ways, good sir. You two can go back with the others. I won't be long with the Persian, so let me into his cell. I can get you the location of the prisoners.\" The frog licks around the poison tipped claw as he just thinks about what he'll get to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure about this Hex?\" You ask him, having the key ready to let the Toxicroak in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe confident amphibian gives you a look to assure you of his confidence. \"I won't get too ugly. After I'm done with him, you'll have all that you need to know, and he's going to do it with a dumb smile on his face...~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you put your faith into Hex, wondering what he'd exactly do to Ruby, but frankly, you can rest easy without ever finding out what it was. Opening the cell door while making sure Ruby stayed in his battered place against the wall, you allow Hex to stride inside with the gate closing behind him. \"Give us a holler when you're done, or if anything bad happens, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frog suddenly smooches your cheek on his way out, \"Don't forget to lock the door behind me, he might try to run. If you hear any growling or moaning, don't worry about that either. I'm the least of your worries right now~\" The Toxicroak stands before Ruby with the dazed cat looking up at him as you close and lock the cell door, keeping the key with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be too rough now.\" You say with Bronze being unsure about this, but you guide him back into the other room where the others were, closing the wooden door to the cell hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you do, you can hear Ruby growl, \"...And who the fuck are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex's charming voice rings with glee, \"Your new best friend! And we're gonna share each other's secrets...~\"</span></div></div>",

A dark thought you have is that what if Ruby somehow got the better of Hex? What if the cat was straddled on the frog, sitting on his member and riding the Toxicroak's rod? What if he got out of his restraints? What if he was doing something awful to Hex? You tap your leg impatiently before you pick up on Star's voice somewhere in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, you see the eye-patched Luxray talking with Bronze at a set of chairs, \"This is the sheriff's office...right? So what happened to the sheriff? Or any of the people that worked here to keep the peace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBronze sighs, clenching both hands at the peak of his bone staff. \"...The sheriff is with Damien. Bigby was a promising man that enjoyed order, but something about Damien corrupted his way of thinking. I think the amount of power and influence he had seduced our sheriff into joining his ranks when Damien began Hedgen's mutiny after the beginning of the infection. Any officer under Bigby that didn't join him as well...well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to finish that statement, I'm sorry.\" The Luxray mentions, putting a hand on top of his own to ease his worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not fret. I am just glad our prayers have been answered. I don't know what we would've done if your group hadn't shown up. What you're all going to do tonight, please...believe me when I say that we all owe you our lives. We could never repay you, should we succeed in destroying the bandits tonight.\" Bronze assures, thanking Star and your group for what you'd do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worries you that the old sheriff of the town is now Damien's right hand man, and seems to be in charge of the other bandit guards. Just another reason for you to have a distaste for the large beaver. Just then, Hex's voice rings out from the hall, \"Oooohhh, yoohooooo!\" You can hear tapping of metal bars, getting you to slide off the table, arrive in the hall with the cell keys ready. \"Ah, Lace, I'm all done! And I have some interesting news~\" The frog says with a delighted smile and a shake of his hips while holding onto the metal bars to be as close to you as he can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Really...? That's great, give me a sec.\" You stutter before fiddling with the keys. You glance past Hex just to see Ruby on the floor. Strangely, the Persian had fully dilated eyes, full with black pupils and vivid red irises. The Persian groans and moans, drooling out of his smiling mouth with a tongue flopped out. His knees are bending inward to rub against one another as he just wallows his head about like he was tired, but crazy. \"Is...he...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex answers with his mischievous grin, \"Tripping balls? Yes~\" The frog idly croaks with his orange throat sac bulging out repeatedly with his happy tune. \"I doused him with a bit of my poison that I've been naturally churning up just for him. Instead of numbing his body, I've numbed his willpower. With some alluring words, and maybe one too many injections, he was happy to start boasting to his new best friend about all the prisoners they specifically keep downstairs under the mill!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlocking the door to let the frog on in, you ask him as he steps out, \"Downstairs? Wait, there's an underground section to the mill?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly! There's a few cellar doors out in the forest that lead into the underground bit of the mill, and we can find these easily because they usually just have a guard or two randomly standing on top of them, covered in foliage.\" The frog pats your cheek and kicks the cell door closed behind him. \"Soooo, we just surprise attack those guards we find that are separated from outside of the wall of the mill. Get some of us down into the tunnels to lead the prisoners out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to add, \"...And we can roll the powder kegs down there as well, spreading them around...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then we blow the mill sky high right from underneath them~!\" Hex cheers, croaking with closed eyes with hands on his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cup the Toxicroak's smiling cheeks with both hands and show your gratitude, \"Hex, do you know that you're the greatest...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get a toss of his hand and a turn of his head, \"Hmhmhm...maybe just a little bit. I'd hate to toot my own horn, Lace~\" The tall Toxicroak drapes you in a hug that lifts you off your hindpaws before he sets you back down. \"Let's tell the others, and get that hot-head of ours back with those prisoners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we all know the plan?\" You ask around to the people in the room. You were at a table with your team and some of Bronze's villagers circled around at a map of the mill layout you had drawn. You had discussed who was going where to make sure all was set for tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex raises a hand, \"You and I will sneak into the mill together to find Jackal and to release the infected they have in their pins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar raises a hand, \"I'm heading down with some of the volunteers here to help people lay the powder kegs around in the underground tunnels. I'll ignite 'em when I get your signal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEden adds, \"Gold and I will go to the prisoners' quarters, where we'll lead them about before the blasts go off.\" Gold flicks a thumbs up at you from across the room as he's casually leaned against a wall. He appeared to be annoyed, but at least he was sticking around and doing his part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBronze taps his bone staff at the ground and mentions, \"And I shall be outside with the other villagers scattered around the mill, lying in wait for the blasts to go off before we go on our assault and burn the mill down effectively. Any bandits that attempt to escape the fire will be met with a wall of people bent on their surrender or capture. I and some others will personally remain at the walls to take out any scouts and keep a look out for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClear with everyone, you nod and rise up from the table you were leaning on. \"Then we're all good. Get your things, say what you need to with one another, and stick together. Tonight, Damien and his crew are going to get what's coming to them...\" The villagers nod, chanting their confirmation with Bronze.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This was it. This was the battle to finish off Damien's camp, all in one go. It felt odd how you only just discovered the camp's existence since arriving at Hedgen, but considering just the mere day you've had of experience with it, you can certainly understand why it needed to be dealt with sooner rather than later. It was a curious thought of wondering just about how long everyone else was affected by Damien's gang, and how they ever got by. Regardless, it all came down to tonight. The sky was a pitch dark, with clouds obscuring most of the starlight above. Not even the moon was visible, with all but a faint glow cascading from the dark clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand there in the dark forest with other villagers slowly circling with what would be the lumber mill of Damien's camp far off, remaining out of view from the guards posted around. Several of the volunteers cart and roll all the powder kegs they had found in the mineshaft supply from the mountain, and ready themselves to take it to any spots they're told that would lead into the underground tunnels underneath the mill. Bronze steps right up next to you, tapping his bone staff at the grass below. \"Whhhhh....\" He sighs out before glancing to you, \"...Are you nervous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter if I am or not.\" You explain. You were getting the job done either way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. The blind confidence of the young.\" The Marowak mayor retorts with both hands clenching the top of his club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a good look at him, and nothing seemed wrinkled or worn down. He was slightly hunched over and could have a bit trouble with balance, but otherwise he didn't seem to old. His flesh was taut and healthy despite his handicap. \"You don't mind if I ask...how old you are, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah...! Let's just say if I made a bad decision if I was young, you could probably be the age of my grandchild.\" Bronze retorts, smiling some. \"Don't let looks fool you. Sure I'm old, but I'm not <i>that</i> old. I'm finely aged is all. But the same principle applies to Damien. He may be young and lean, but he's more of an animal than the infected are. Watch yourself should you ever meet him in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I plan on meeting him. I haven't made it this far to be taken down by some brat.\" You retort. Your mind lingers, and you can't help but feel a sudden hungry drive to devour him, sending him to your stomach to wallow and whine as you sit there rubbing your taut yellow gut, witnessing every minute of his passing to join your body. You almost grin in a drunken, evil daze at the thought, but you shake it away. It's strange, but you feel the sense of enjoying vore more than you have since the beginning of your journey. You pass this off as just the psychic mastermind trying harder to influence you, or perhaps you truly were hungry. Either way, you ignore the feeling and remain headstrong on what the real goal is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBronze however exhales with a hand brushing over his skulled smooth head. \"I certainly hope that isn't true. I've lived both a good and rough life. This infection was rather...unneeded for how I get to experience life, but I've done well with what I can. However, I don't want it all to just end up with me being captured by these people...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think anyone wants to get eaten by these guys, so-\" You were adding, but Bronze shakes his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be a mercy. I believe the last words I ever heard Damien tell me directly before he was banished from the town was, 'I'm going to fuck your bent-over ass until you're torn in half.' or something along those lines.\" His golden eyes glance to you with a stern voice, heeding, \"And you heard that Persian in his cell. They're more interested in violating me with their...sexual deviances than their hunger. They've become lost like so many others by indulging in their dark pleasures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set a hand on his shoulder and assure him, \"No one's forcing you to do this with us. You can stay back at your manor, or take refuge on the mountain should things go sour here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brushes your hand away and laughs to himself, \"Be less worried about me and more about your own hide. You're the one who hurt his favorite pet and lied about who you are, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" You mutter. An ear of yours twitches anxiously thinking that you'd probably get the worst of any punishment to anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBronze smiles to himself, \"Sorry, didn't mean to worry you about anything. I'm confident there's a chance we can accomplish this. Something about you just seems as though...you can achieve anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I certainly hope that's the case.\" You reply back to the mayor. \"We'll get your people out, and no one's gonna have to worry about Damien eating or enslaving anyone. Not even you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. I enjoy being a mayor, and the thought of having some sense of control and community again sounds nice.\" The Marowak says with a rather calm look to him. It didn't seem like he had any real nerves against the situation, and this helps to calm you some as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Star's voice picks up from afar to call your name, \"Hey, Lace!\" The Luxray lightly jogs over to you from where she was to explain, \"...Some of the villagers found a couple of lone guards. Turns out that they were standing on a hidden doorway just like that Persian mentioned; they lead right down into some tunnels. They even cowarded out and fessed up about two other cellar door entrances that we have people moving in on now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's...great actually! Did Hex get to those guards that fast?\" You ask her with Bronze perking up at the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat whips her starred tail and grins, leaning one hip out with a single finger swirling the air. \"Hey, I have my own questioning methods to get things out of people.\" She purrs some, causing crackling static from her hand. \"But to be honest, they saw just how many people they were going up against, I think they nearly pissed themselves. They told us without much resistance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBronze grunts, \"Just shows you how much honor these awful people have.\" He taps his staff at the ground again in his angry retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stirring croak signals you that Hex finally caught up with you, padding up with hands on his hips and a delighted glare on his face. \"Ah, there you are Lace. Ready to snoop right on in~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just about.\" You say, giving his side a firm pat and flashing a quick smile to show you're good for the mission. You turn to Star and explain, \"As soon as you get confirmation that the prisoners are out, don't hold back in igniting any of the kegs. Hex and I will be expecting it, and this needs to be done as fast as possible. The sooner and more clustered they are together with all of the confusion, the better. If they find out we're here already, Damien can start ordering his men on what to do. We don't need guards searching downstairs or outside, so better to take the chance to blow the mill up than the plan being discovered and stopped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luxray crosses her arms, giving a concerned look before closing her eyes and sighing, \"...Alright Lace. I'll put my trust in you. Just, come back in one piece, okay? I don't need you missing anything should we blow the place up and you're dickin' around on the floor level.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flash her a thumbs up, \"Deal. I'm putting my trust in you as well that you'll make the best call no matter what happens. Got all that, too, Bronze?\" The Marowak nods his head, ready to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex suddenly pulls you into his arm, squeezing sides together as he pats your chest with the other free hand, reassuring Star, \"Don't worry dearie, he'll be under my care when we're in that mill. I didn't survive in an infected-filled swamp for a long time for nothing. I can be quite stealthy when I need to be, like I wasn't even ever there~\" The Toxicroak winks with his smile, getting Star to roll her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. But the same goes for you, Hex. One piece.\" The cat says with another flick of her tail. She makes sure to point to Hex directly when repeating her 'one piece' bit and back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amphibian huffs, cupping a hand to his own puffed chest, \"I can't have my good looks ruined, now can I? Hmhm, I'm good to go whenever you are, Lucario. Unless you want to bail and I can handle these fools alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a chance.\" You state back before slipping out of Hex's arm, only to then say...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>[There are bonus options available depending on who you had Lace sleep with back in Draxius' tent, if it was Hex or Star.

Both you and Hex were hidden behind the backs of trees, keeping a close glance at how the patrols work. There was a balcony along the interior rim of the walls, just at their peaks that had single guards traverse by repeatedly in a rotation. Not only that, but some bandits even walk around on the outside perimeter of the wall at the ground level. There were only a few gates through the wall. A large one at the front, two at the sides, and of course the large maze at the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex points to the side gate that you can see in your view and mentions, \"You're seeing the pattern as well, correct? At times there's parts where the guards at different levels lap one another, leaving a few moments of no one being able to look out. I think if we time things correctly and move quickly, I can scale up one of the walls, take out anyone that I need to, and open the gate for you to let you in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're positive you can do that?\" You ask of the Toxicroak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex simply raises his knuckle claws with poisoned tips and quietly croaks, \"Just watch me. Those fools already seem like they're half asleep already since it's so late at night. Give me just a moment, dearie, and run right in when you can~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't even stop the frog, because once he had his window after two guards pass around the wall, he immediately began sprinting towards the wall in long steps to cover as much ground as he could. Up against the wall now, he was out of view of two other guards standing above the gate, giving him the opportunity to dig his two knuckle claws into the wood to climb up the logs. He quietly works one hand up to hoist himself up as he lightly kicks up against the wall in order to scale. A Rhyhorn and a Gurdurr stand there at the top, completely unaware with the Rhyhorn emitting a large yawn. \"Hhhhooouuugghhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gurdurr grumbles, \"Don't you damn yawn at me, you know that I might....too....hhhrraaaghhh...goddammit.\" After yawning himself, he flashes a look to his fellow guard. \"I'm gonna pass the fuck out if you keep that up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry man, I didn't catch much sleep last night. I got too busy with Daisy and some drinks to catch up on my Z's.\" The fat behemoth mumbles back before recounting his previous venture. \"Heh...she's got a rockin' body. It was about damn time I had a turn with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gurdurr scoffs at this. \"Psh. Daisy's the favorite. I've hardly had time with her. But I guess I know what I'm doin' after tonight, heh heh, ya know what I mean~?\" The only answer he'd get however is the Rhyhorn suddenly slumping onto his back on the wooden balcony above the gate, shaking from his large weight. \"Eh?!\" The fighter would mention before seeing the big dino just snooze with an open mouth and closed eyes. He growls, \"Are you kidding me? Did you just fall asleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA croak murrs behind him before Hex's hand cups around the Gurdurr's mouth to pull him in close and muffle his speech. \"And you will be too~\" The stealthy Toxicroak had slipped venom into the Rhyhorn during their discussion, and now the remaining guard would feel the sudden sting of Hex's knuckle claw pinching at his back before a numbing poison injects there as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Grrmmphk! Mmph...?!\" The Gurdurr growls out with wide eyes and tensing muscles. Hex would've had a problem on his hands if he hadn't injected sooner, and those fighting eyes would roll up with drooped eyelids over time, leaving Hex to lay the Gurdurr down. Successful in taking the two guards out, Hex immediately hops down from the balcony onto a ladder and descends to where the lever of the gate was. It opens up, leaving you the brief moment to dash from behind the tree you were hiding over to the wall in hopes to make there in time. You don't think you were spotted as you make it past the door, but muffled chatter between two other guards making their perimeter walk around the outside of the wall could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, both you and Hex try to close the doors shut with the guards passing by. You can hear their steps stopping outside, and you lay an ear up against the doors to listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were two voices, both male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, did someone just leave or come in...?\" One asks, leaving you to stare at Hex who didn't know what to say considering the only people who should've answered are passed out up on the balcony above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clear your throat and grunt in whatever voice you can, \"Yeah, just came right back in. Needed a piss break...\" You quietly just wait there in worry and add, \"...Why, got a problem with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a grumbled huff from the outside, and the two guards continue on their way, resuming their conversation. It gives you the relief to sigh and close your eyes before feeling Hex pat your side. \"Atta' boy~\" The frog sings silently before the two of you can finally progress now that you're behind the wall. Inside, there was the large fort building where the lumber-work used to take place, now retroactively turned into the main hub of the bandits. Several small tents and cabins are scattered around outside the main building however, most likely being their living quarters. You can even see some campfires with some of the men circled around them, having boasting chats and drinking from kegs of ale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're ready to crouch down and sneak through the tents, but Hex merely grabs your shoulder to stand you back up straight. \"We're gonna get caught if we look like that, stalking and crawling around everywhere.\" The Toxicroak huffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think we should just walk right on inside?\" You retort, but only to receive a nod from the frog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed! Look at how many of these guys there are. You think they really know everyone in the group? They don't keep track of every single person that joins, and you're new, right? Some people saw you with Damien, and we're pretty far away for them to really notice us. If we casually just walk to the building, I really doubt that anyone would stop you. And I doubt they have anything against Toxicroaks being amongst them either.\" Hex explains with hands on his hips. You wanted to argue the logic, but it was a short distance to the building, and around the doorway to it was open. People would see you regardless if you were crouched suspiciously or casually walking there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and mutter in agreement, getting the frog to grin. Together, you head towards one of the smaller entrances at the side of the building to go through, avoiding the main entrance for sure, as well as avoiding any eye contact. It was a straight path to the door you needed to get to, yet you couldn't help but feel the pressure that maybe there were some eyes on you two. And yet miraculously, you make it to the side doors without a problem. You'd be ready to celebrate with a smile towards Hex, but you suddenly meet chest to stomach with a large furry fellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big Ursaring bumped into you from how quickly you had made it into the door with the Toxicroak, leaving you to hit your back against the closed door and the bear to stumble back with a mug dropping from his hand. It smashes against the floor with a puddle of beer with the large male growling, \"Ey! Watch it!\" He snarls down with clenched fangs and angry eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo much for a clean and quiet entrance. You were ready to apologize until he growls, \"...Wait, who the fuck are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lance...?\" You mutter as an answer before tensing yourself some more. \"And who the fuck are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear huffs from his nostrils, \"Oh yeah, you're the puny pooch I saw with Damien earlier tonight, with that 'phlosion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, I am. Really nice to meet'cha.\" You say to appear aggressive. \"Sorry about the drink. I'm sure my Typh friend will get you another one if I could find him. You wouldn't know where the chubby bastard is, would ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear scratches at his chest some, \"Yeesh, aren't you the grumpy fellow. I think I saw him upstairs in the back with some other guys, bein' weird. But I'm less concerned about you...\" He mutters with his eyes glancing to the frog beside you. He brushes a hand to your chest and forces you away from Hex as he gets up close and personal with the amphibian. \"...and more about you. I don't remember seeing any damn Toxicroak in these parts. And you weren't with him earlier this evening. Who the hell are you? We're not taking in guests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're not...?\" The frog, cupping a hand to his cheek. \"I could've sworn it would've been alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see the bear ready to grab the frog, but you intervene, leaping up and crossing your arms from behind around at the Ursaring's neck. \"Ghakk!!\" He exclaims as you choke his neck and make his spine bend back, leaving his front easily exposed for Hex to inject him with both of his claws. \"Hnk! Wh-What the f-ffuuuuuhhuuoohhckk...\" The bear's eyelids droop with the poison going into his system fast from Hex stressfully pumping it into him with both claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chubby bear slumps, incredibly hard for you to carry. \"H-Hfff...\" You wheeze out, staggering some to keep the big guy's upper back and shoulders from hitting the ground too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that could've gone better. Sorry.\" The Toxicroak mentions before glancing over at the door, hearing more bandits approach it. The frog flashes his eyes to you, worried, but you just toss your head to gesture him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just get outta here. You heard the guy, start looking upstairs in the back for Jackal. I'll catch up with you after I deal with this.\" You mention to him, thinking of how you could explain this. Hex begins to take a few steps back, unsure to leave, but the sound of the door opening makes him slip away through another door in the hall, having to abandon you and go it alone...</span></div></div>",

He stands there to see you trying to hold one of his fellow bandits up that was left groaning an unresponsive. Before he could make any clear accusation however, you pipe with some kind of reasoning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh, think the big tough guy had one too many pints...\" You say, struggling to hold the groaning Ursaring up. The Pyroar bandit glances over to see the smashed drink of beer on the floor, and it was apparently all that was needed to convince him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. I told Graves I'd fucking kick his teeth in if he got this drunk. C'mere, I'll help him up.\" The lion states, sighing and taking one of the Ursaring's arms, apparently who was named Graves. \"I am <i>not</i> taking this guy to his tent. His tentmate already told me the dick's impossible to sleep with when he's drunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fake a smirk and help the lion get the bear up some with an arm of his draped around your back. \"Where do ya wanna dump him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, just this way where he's not gonna be a bother to anyone.\" Both you and Pyroar head down the hall and go through a series of doors. The lion apparently didn't bother asking who you were which you completely are fine with, and any other bandit that saw you was more focused on the groaning Ursaring passed off as wasted. The bear occasionally bobbed his head tried to fight off your arm, perhaps still conscious of the situation, but the poison kept his mind subdued to not have your cover blown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you arrive into a tool room that was used to house axes, hammers, and other things to use for working with wood. \"Just lay him up on one of these tables.\" The Pyroar mutters, hauling the big bear onto his back on the table surface. \"There, he'll be out of the way from pestering anybody else. Thanks for tryin' to deal with him.\" He turns to you in fact, with the buff feline having to look down at you from being taller. \"In fact, I don't think we met? James.\" The lion extends his hand of all things, wanting to shake on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollecting the big hand, you gesture back with a shake and mutter, \"Uh, Lance. I'm one of the new guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooohhh, yeah, I heard a couple of the guys mention you. Welcome to the family. I heard you got to be on good terms from Damien just by comin' in. He's not usually in the mood to do that sort of stuff. Whadja say to get on his good side?\" The lion says with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, er, I can't say for sure actually. Maybe he was just buzzed...?\" You tried to excuse. The lion laughs at this though with closed eyes. Apparently you were getting on James' good side as well. \"Gotta get used to saying the 'family' thing though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion finishes his sensible chuckle. \"Heh, yeah it was weird for me at the beginning. Ever since I left Hedgen, I figured that I'd hate it here. But it's not entirely bad. You just gotta know who not to piss off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat one statement takes your interest and you ask, \"You're originally from Hedgen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! You know the place? Well, I found and stayed there before that place got really divisive, I should say. There was a lot of tension between a lot of the residents, where the mayor wanted one thing, Damien wanted the other. When Damien left, some of us just went with him.\" He explains casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I ask why?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking on it, the Pyroar answers, \"Uh, I mean, I didn't go with him at first. But there was still a lot of hostility left in the villagers with one another. Mayor Bronze had to figure out how to ration what food we could, and the number of infected attacking were becoming a staggering rate. When I heard of how Damien was handling himself with the others though at this mill, I couldn't believe. Yeah, things can be rough, but it's a better life here than it was in Hedgen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never really had the chance to talk things out with Bronze about how everything went down prior to Damien's exile. But then again, you only got his side of the story. There may have been things he left out or lied over just to vilify Damien to you. You were unsure, but after thinking about your encounter with the Houndour, you doubt that Bronze would need to lie to you about how evil he was. \"Oh, damn... Sorry to hear about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, it ain't a problem. Not everyone agrees with Damien, but to be honest, we're kind of scared shitless of him. Anyone that's ever challenged him on anything get it pretty bad...\" The lion admits, nervously scratching at his cheek. \"Not that you heard this from me! But you're new and all, and it's better to know this stuff early. Don't piss Damien off. Yeah, he's young, but the guy's more of an animal than the infected are. He'll kill you in whatever way he wants if you challenge him about anything. He's taken men out that have all simultaneously took him on. So a lot of guys just does as he says. If they're being a dick about anything and acting tough, it's usually just for appearances. Although, we do have our fair share of complete pricks. I don't like the idea of sleeping in a tent with a guy that rapes infected, but I'd rather have that than being in some faulty town that can't even protect itself from its own people or the infected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually appreciate this a lot, James. You've...certainly opened my eyes to something.\" You mention before thinking hard about this. Not all of the bandits here are cruel people, but just people acting out of fear from the greater evil they're forced to stay with. Despite you disagreeing with their choice of following Damien, in an apocalyptical world like this where the slightest mistake can have you devoured or having your mind erased to that of a savage beast, it was a pretty easy choice to want to stay with the vast numbers of people in the heavily fortified settlement for safety, no matter how you had to act to be able to do so. Still, there were sex slaves and probably worse things in this place. They still needed to be set free, and Damien needed to go down, along with any other severe potential bad person here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it...! Just glad I can help the new guy learn the ropes.\" The Pyroar said before glancing up and smiling more. \"Oh hey Bigby, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fur spikes up with your ears straightening. You turn to see Damien's right-hand man, Bigby, standing there by the doorway. The Bibarel was leaned against it with crossed arms and a rather unhappy look to him as he was staring right at you. \"Apparently more than we initially thought...\" He mutters, perhaps a jab at his suspicions against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, have you met the new guy, Lance?\" The Pyroar mentions, giving a pat your shoulder, unaware of the tension between you and the beaver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure I did James.\" He says with a scowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion tenses his brows and mumbles, \"Oh...well, Graves got drunk so we just set him d-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, James.\" The large beaver asks, interrupting the Pyroar. \"How about you go gather some of the men to the arena. A fight's gonna start soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Oh? Who's...in it?\" The lion mutters with a hint of fear in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you'll be surprised. Now go on.\" The Bibarel orders the large feline to get a move on. The Pyroar notices the gravity of the beaver's mood and simply just quietly leaves. You're ready to just leave with him, but Bigby closes the door behind James and glares at your with his scowl. \"...What are you doing back here...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see that you're not getting out of this situation without coming up with something, so you retort, \"I was supposed to come back, remember? I didn't have much to get, and we didn't have to go out too far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind telling me where Ruby is?\" The beaver grunts, stepping forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's...somewhere I guess? I don't keep track of him. He led me in through the gate and went to go find his darling Damien or so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit.\" He growls, far more angry. You can see his arm extend out, taking one of the sledgehammers from the wall of tools at the side, approaching you with it. \"I've been at the main gate all night, and you two never showed up. I come by just to tell Damien there's nothing to report, and yet, strangely, here you are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can sense that it didn't matter what you say anymore, Bigby's not going to believe you. \"I don't want to fight you.\" You say, raising your fists up and taking steps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but I do.\" He huffs before opening his mouth suddenly shooting a ray of water out. The Water Gun splashes against your face to make you stagger back, and it gave the beaver enough time to take a mighty swing of that hammer to collide into your wet head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hhungk...!!\" You yelp aloud with a shaking jaw and staggering steps, sent keeling over onto your side onto the floor with your ears ringing and your vision blurry. \"U-Ughnh....\" Groaning on the ground, your skull pounds repeatedly from the impact it had on your head, with your world going dizzy and out of focus. You look up to see the silhouette of the beaver tower over you before he lifts up a thick leg to stomp down on your head. The world goes black and quiet, and your senses are completely knocked out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i></i>Bigby growls with his buckteeth gnashing together in his frown when staring down at the motionless Lucario traitor before him. \"Bitch dog. I never trusted you from the start, and I was right about you. I don't know what you did with Ruby, but I know <i>exactly</i> with what I'm gonna do with you...\" Grabbing your ankle after tossing the hammer, he begins to walk out of the tool room while dragging you along the ground by your leg to deal with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe doesn't even take proper care of his prisoner, walking up stairs and letting the back of your head bang against each one as if the hammer swing wasn't enough for your skull. Whatever Bigby had planned for you, it might just be the end of you...</span></div></div>",

He squats down with spread thighs, resting his elbows on his knees. Having been separated from his Lucario companion, the Toxicroak is left on his own in this vast area as he surveys below. It seemed to be where most of the chopped trees would be placed on a conveyor to be sliced and diced, hand-operated by the past workers. However, production seems to have been at a standstill considering the current situation of bandits now running the place. Apparently they didn't need anything built anymore with the lifestyle they have. Hex can even spot many barrels and kegs of their alcohol that they have, making him wonder what they'll do when they run out. It seemed like only temporary good living. A living that was literally going to crash and burn soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lace oh Lace, where could you be...?\" Hex idly murmurs to himself while glancing around the place below. Concealed in the shadows of the rafters high above, he was confident no one would look to see him there. After the dilemma he had escaped from earlier, he went back to see if his Lucario partner was still around, however, unable to see Lace at all. \"Although I suppose he'd be more concerned about me more than himself. Well, guess I just have to find that flaming oaf first before I have to go out find the 'cario too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, he spots a Zebstrika cross a walkway the frog was above, watching the horse travel with hooved steps clopping against the wooden panels. The frog doesn't see anyone nearby or on the walkway the male horse was going along, and decides he could get some answers from the lone bandit. He just had to choose how to handle the horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak could only produce so much of his venom, and he used most of its potency into taking down the previous guards so quickly. He'd have to restrain himself after this, or just start now and use other tactics to take care of the horse...</span></div></div>",

The Toxicroak waits until the Zebstrika completely passes underneath on the walkway to shoot out a Poison Sting attack, sending a thin pin needle into the back of the stallion's neck. \"Ahh!\" He exclaims, twisting around and darting his eyes about. \"Who did that? Who's there...?\" The Zebstrika never thinks to look up, and instead, feels his hand around at the back of his neck, eventually plucking out the needle which gets him to cringe in place. \"Agh...a needle...?\" The horse grunts when inspecting the the thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex glares his eyes. Apparently the big guy needed more juice to take him down more. Despite the Toxicroak seeing the Zebstrika blinking funny from the venom, the frog decides its safer to just shoot him again with another. This one hitting him directly in the chest. \"Hhkk!\" He exclaims, falling onto his back. He pulls the pin out from this pecs, growling, \"Wh-Who's there! Come and face....f-face....m-mmeeeeeeyyyeee...?\" The world for him began to blur and become more vivid, the poison finally kicking in. His body felt heavy, warm even. He could essentially take a nap right here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak however stops this from happening after hopping down onto the walkway and approaching his victim. \"Sorry about that, fella. I was lookin' for a friend of mine and I figured you could help. You were the first one I found alone anyway, so you're better than nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-Who you callin' nothin'...?!\" The drugged horse groans, blinking awkwardly and rolling his head about. \"I don't...know you...how'd you get in here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhh...\" The frog states, putting a finger to the Zebstrika's lips. \"I'm looking for a Typhlosion. Have ya seen him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Uhhn...a Typhlosion...?\" He groans, trying to get up but Hex plants a hand flat to his chest, sending him back down every time. \"...ghhahh...I-I think...I saw one...down this walkway, in the hall...door on the...right or left?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex rolls his eyes, croaking idly and just glancing down at the wasted horse below him with half-lidded eyes. \"Well which is it? Right or left?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I dunno...\" The horse exhales out, drooling out of his mouth now. \"Wh-Who are you...again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a friend! Now I need you to remember, which door-\" The Toxicroak however stops once he sees the Zebstrika flop his head back with a tongue out, completely unconscious. The poison was really kicking in now at his neck, completely numbing his mind. \"...A bit too late for that.\" The frog sighs, stepping over the Zebstrika and just continuing forward as the horse mentioned. Opening a door and leaving the large room he was in, he was now in a smaller room, acting as an access point to get to several other rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now which one should I...\" Hex trails off to see that there's three doors on both sides of the room, left and right. He scowls, wishing the Zebstrika was awake so he can feel his neck being wrung in the frog's hands. \"Well for the love of quite literally anything ever, he wasn't a help at all. Now I just have to guess...\" The frog remained rather ticked he would just have to try door after door, unsure of who or what was behind them. But, he got himself tied up into this mess. \"The things I do for that flaming oaf. I'm getting a blowjob from that closeted hothead after all this is said and done, hmph.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frog saunters his way to the far left door, deciding to randomly go through that one first. Slowly clicking the knob, the Toxicroak manages to crack it open to peer inside. He can see a desk with tools on it, with some kind of object there being crafted. Unsure of what it all is, the door suddenly opens all of the way with Hex's view completely obscured by a cyan middle. A heavy, slurred voice bellows out, \"No peeking!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex glances up to an even taller frog than himself. And a quite <i>wider</i> one at that. Standing before him was an incredibly broad, gutted Seismitoad. The thick black lumps of his brows smack together angrily, buzzing with his red eyes glaring down at Hex, all before becoming suddenly more confused an innocent. \"Oh...? Another froggy...like Bingo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak was left standing there before clearing his throat, \"Why, yes, that is what I am after all. It's nice to see another amphibious...friend?\" Even Hex was confused, only to see a large and dim-witted smile spread on the Seismitoad's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Heh. Hehhhh. Bingo has not seen another froggy around here before. Heh.\" The Seismitoad's eyelids lower with his wide smile creeping out more and he nervously pokes two fingers together. Hex catches on that this big fellow isn't exactly...like other people in the head, to which the Toxicroak would describe to be rather 'simplistic'. But perhaps he can play off Bingo's traits to get out of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thaaat's....because I'm new! I actually just started staying here in this place after meeting Damien. I'm just a little lost. Apologies for interrupting you on whatever you were doing! I'll just be going-\" The Seismitoad suddenly forces the Toxicroak to stumble inside the room Hex was in by grabbing him by the shoulders' the toad was massive in stature, and he certainly didn't lack in power. His strength could easily lift up Hex with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nono! Let Bingo show froggy his toys!\" The Seismitoad demands, shutting the door behind Hex and dragging the smaller frog with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak imagined that Bingo must've had children's toys when taking his mindset into consideration, making him attempt to reason, \"I-I am sure they're nice and fun to play with but I really need to-\" Hex's voice drops when he's suddenly presented to what Bingo was talking about. The Seismitoad gestured a big open hand to a wall, showcasing his...<i>toys</i>. Dildos. Gagballs. Restraints of all kinds. Collars. Leashes. Whips. It took Hex by surprise, and he simply just quietly nods with slow and exaggerated nods of his head. \"O-Oh....those.... Gee, wow...I...really, really don't know what to say. Really. Just, wooow Bingo... Mmhmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Seismitoad's face reddens a bit, clearly enjoying the lewdness of the items as he takes one of the dildoes off of the rack. The thing was quite a large size in itself, perhaps more than twelve inches and thick. It was black and rubbery in fact, with Bingo murring, \"Heh. Heh. This is Blacky. Blacky is Bingo's favorite toy he made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, you actually made that, huh?\" The frog stutters, queitly taking a step back to see if he could slip away from the large toad, but Bingo's thick blue arms hooks around him and smushes him at the Seismitoad's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! Yep! Bingo makes all kinds of toys for the family!\" The Seismitoad licks over his lips pervertedly, giggling to himself some with his red and aroused face staring at the level of detail in 'Blacky'. \"Bingo used tar from tar pits to make Blacky. Bingo used to make pottery and statues, but sometimes Bingo likes making nice things like this that make Bingo...heeheeeee...excited~! Damien knows Bingo makes toys. Damien tells Bingo to make toys for the family here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex nervously chuckles, shuddering a bit against the large toad's chubby side as he tries to coax that Seismitoad. \"And I am sure Damien likes everything Bingo makes. Hrkk!\" The Toxicroak is squished into the side powerfully with Bingo squeezing harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. But no, too. Sometimes Bingo just wants to make different things than toys. But Damien is scary. Damien breaks what he does not like Bingo secretly make.\" The Seismitoad says with dissatisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex idly pets the big toad's side, trying to squeeze out of Bingo's side. \"I'm s-sorry to hear that Bingo. I think you should make what you want, whenever you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as soon as Hex was about to slip from the big burly arm, he's suddenly squeezed again drastically by the Seismitoad. \"Really? Bingo like froggy~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hrrrffff...B-Bingo...e-ease up...\" The Toxicroak tries to wheeze out, but the big toad wouldn't let him have it that way, and simply drapes both arms around Hex after setting 'Blacky' down to bear hug the fellow amphibian against his chubby cyan front. Hex squishes into the amphibious pudge, grunting tightly by the amount of pressure crushing at his back and the pillow of girth smothering his face. He'd have to do something to get Bingo to let him go. He could try to play into Bingo's interests to get on his good side, or if he had enough venom left in his system, the Toxicroak could just make it nap time for the big fellow...</span></div></div>",

C-Can't see it if you're squishing me like this...\" The Toxicroak grunts out, hoping it would ease the Seismitoad. Hex didn't want to hurt Bingo, cause he seemed like a nice enough guy, but the toad was certainly a forceful one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Seismitoad blinks before smacking his head lumps together excitedly. \"Oh! Yes! Yes! Bingo has other things for froggy to see~!\" Those thick arms finally set the Toxicroak down for Hex to stand and stagger for his balance. The big fat toad heads off somewhere, leaving the Toxicroak to adjust himself before hearing Bingo murr out, \"Bingo likes these a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And might those be?\" Hex mutters before yelping in place, having a collar suddenly click around his neck just under his jaw and above his throat sac. His eyes widen, tugging at the black material. \"O-Ohh...thank you, ah-ahem, Bingo, but really I'm not really the type to...\" The Toxicroak was too busy tugging at it, only to have a metal link at the front suddenly click as well after Bingo attaches a leash to it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeheehee...\" The Seismitoad's face is a deep red with his lumps vibrating in joy; certainly nice but rather perverted. \"Froggy looks nice in collar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex can feel his face redden, but more-so with just embarrassment than arousal. \"Th-That's....k-kind of you to say, Bingo. But I don't need to wea-\" The leash is suddenly tugged, forcing Hex to stumble forward and smack right up against Bingo's belly again. The Seismitoad hugs his arms around the Toxicroak to squish into his gut, molding Hex into the amphibious chub. \"H-Hnghk...!\" Hex wheezes out, but his arms simply drape the best they can around the big Seismitoad to pat at his sides. \"The collar's a bit tight, Bingo. Could you take it off for me?\" The Toxicroak gets out, leaving the Seismitoad to hum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too tight? Well...okay.\" The Seismitoad releases Hex from the fat hug to fiddle at the back of the collar, finally unbinding it to free the Toxicroak. It was a perfect fit, but Hex would never admit that to the aroused toy-maker. \"Froggy better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex runs a hand at his bare neck, huffing, \"Ahem...yes, froggy's much better now, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heehee. Bingo not thanked too much by others.\" The toad admits, poking fingers together again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you certainly should be. You are an excellent artist, and I wish you could be making what you want somewhere else.\" The Toxicroak mutters. He'd have to figure out some way to get Bingo out of here without just outright telling him the place would most likely burn down soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo needs to finish what Damien wants though.\" The Seismitoad huffs, grabbing Hex's hand and forcing the frog to follow the large toad over to where his workbench was. Right next to the crafting table was a wooden stock, one for keeping a prisoner, in most likely public humiliation. It was two lockable wooden boards, one lifted up at the side that could clamp down on the other thick boards, leaving three open circles of space to lock someone's head and hands into. \"Damien wants this to put people in silly moment. But also...heh...a nice moment.\" The toad blushes again, most likely enjoying the compromising position it could put someone in, unaware it was really for making use of prisoners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Ah...it looks well made so far...\" Hex attempts to compliment before the toad suddenly grins far more widely, beaming with red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hheh...heh...froggy should go take a closer look. Bingo bet froggy can't find the secret...\" The Seismitoad thrums with vibrations, pushing the Toxicroak forward to inspect it. The frog huffs, really wanting to get out of this room, but he certainly just needs to satisfy the Seismitoad's needs for his attention. He couldn't waste much time looking at yet another thing Bingo had.</span></div></div>",

You just want to lock me in it.\" It was rather obvious the Seismitoad wanted to trick him into the prisoner stock, but Hex wouldn't have any of it, not even from a pervy sweetheart like Bingo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big Seismitoad continues to nervously prod fingertips together. \"Bingo...sorry. Froggy would look cute in it though.\" He gives a sheepish smile, still red-faced, but looking far more apologetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. I look fine enough without it, don't I?\" The Toxicroak retorts, hands on his hips and his throat croaking in a way to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt gets the big toad to murrs, nervously rubbing at his cheek. \"Froggy does look nice~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how about you go make something like me? You said you like to make statues and figures. How about you make something for your froggy?\" Hex said, posing with a leg out and a turned posture. It certainly pleases the flustered Seismitoad, but the big guy worriedly questions it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo would love to make a small froggy figure! Nice looking figure. Bingo would have to go outside to get mud and clay to make froggy figure, but Damien no like Bingo going out.\" He says with a depressed sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget what that Damien wants.\" Hex rebukes. \"Some...friends and I are here to erhm...give him a stern talk, so that he doesn't hurt or yell at anyone again. We're not scared of him; in fact, by the end of tonight, he'll be scared of us~\" The Toxicroak doesn't like that he has to admit some of the plan to the big toad, but it wasn't like he was giving off any dire information, and it wasn't like the big toad was going to give the Toxicroak away. \"That way, you can make whatever you want, Bingo. Your frog friend here will even be happy to pose for you however and whenever you want, and we can make Damien watch~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBingo smiles at this, nodding his head, \"Really? Froggy and Bingo are...friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Truly.\" The Toxicroak answers, only to be instantly in another hug by the frog. Hex is smothered in the Seismitoad's belly, voice muffled in the chubby, round exterior rippling from his protesting words and squirms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Bingo didn't mind them at all, clenching the frog tight in those big arms. \"Heh. Heh. Bingo so happy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex quietly pats his arms around the girthy toad before mumbling to be released, and he eventually gets his wish and is dropped down once more. Wiping himself, the Toxicroak clears his throat, \"Yes, well, good. Ahem...\" Hex extends his hand out for a gentle handshake to properly greet himself. \"I don't believe I ever introduced myself either. My name is Hex. You can call me that.\" The frog's hand is grappled by both of the Seismitoad's, shaken vigorously up and down to nearly swing the frog about, struggling to even keep his balance on one leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hex! Okay!\" The toad ribbits, vibrating joyfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak finally manages to slip his hand out from the powerful grip and just pats the Seismitoad's front to assure the big fellow, \"I need to go and find some of my friends though, Bingo, in order to stop Damien from bullying others. Have you seen a Typhlosion anywhere near here? He wears an orange cloth on his arm.\" The Toxicroak points a finger at his arm to gesture which one it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBingo glances up and scratches at his head, attempting to think about it before stumbling over to the door leading out of his workshop, pointing to one of the many other doors Hex could've chosen from. \"Bingo think he saw him go in there with other guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex sidles right up next to the Seismitoad to see the exact door he was pointing, delighting the Toxicroak. Cupping Bingo's cheek, the frog reaches his head up the best he can to smooch Bingo on the nose to murr, \"Bingo, you're the best!\" He pats the cheek and explains, \"Now go out there and get some clay. I hear they have plenty of it back at Hedgen. You know where that is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBingo rubs at his nose, blushing vividly and murring, \"Bingo knows~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might want to take Blacky or whatever you think is important here. Cause uhm...you might spend the rest of the night at Hedgen! When you get there, just tell them Hex sent you there and why. They can trust you then.\" The Toxicroak mentions, getting confirmation from the Seismitoad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Bye bye Fro-, erh...Bye bye Hex~!\" The big toad ribbits, indeed getting his favorite toy creation and heading off to some other door, exchanging farewells with Hex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak cups both of his hands to his own cheeks, smiling, \"Well don't I just feel good now.\" He murrs with the pride in saving at least one innocent person working for Damien. \"I wonder if this is how Lace feels all the time when he helps others...oh I do hope he's alright.\" Pivoting around and facing the door the Seismitoad pointed to, Hex exhales and prepares to enter. \"Hhhh. A promise to Lace is a promise. Jackal is my priority despite my better judgement. Lace, wherever you are, please don't be in trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak presses his head up against the door to listen in on what was happening behind it all. He does in fact hear voices from the other side, one being which being close to Jackal's but perhaps not fully. Confused, the frog creaks the door ever so slightly...</span></div></div>",

The Typhlosion was surrounded by three other males, backed up against a table with something odd about him. His eyes were awkwardly drooping, his cheeks particularly rosy, and his movements were sluggish. His voice even sounded weird, with everything being a half-tired growl. \"You guyz aren't any fun... I'm gonna GO OUT and go back to that nice fella behind the bahr...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Typhlosion would stagger forward, only to clumsily stagger back with one of the bandits pushing him back by his chest. \"Not a chance, partner.\" A deep and gruff voice speaks, being the pusher. It was a large Aggron, muscular, tall, and with an armored belly sticking out. By his sides were a Braviary and Simisear, both with similar cocky expressions as the Aggron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe avian sneers, \"Psh, you are so drunk off your ass right now...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal growls, pointing at him with a hand that clearly had a pint with a bit of ale in it. \"Ey! How can an ass even get drunk...?! You people are weirdoez.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe primate murrs, \"How many pints of the stuff did you even chug?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Typhlosion blinks repeated, clearing his throat constantly and swaying back and forth. \"Uhhh....Uhhhh...how many's in a, hrk, barrel?\" Jackal looks down at his hands to begin counting on his fingers as if that was going to help him, only to get distracted by his own wiggling fingers that he forgets what he was even moving them around for. He just dumbly chuckles to watch them curl and point out. Hex, even from afar and struggling to see past the big Aggron, can notice the big beer belly on the Typhlosion. He must've indulged himself far too much, now drunk, heavy, and in some kind of trouble with the three of these bandits. The Toxicroak however spots three men having half-erect rods and mischievous looks to them all. It was obvious they dragged Jackal here just to take advantage of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Aggron bellows out with laughter, \"I'm surprised you can even stand! I think you'd be more comfortable bent over though...\" He murrs, reaching out to grab Jackal's shoulder. The Typhlosion jerks back, almost falling over yet again, but bumps against the table blocking him from escape, yet he remains unaware of the bandits intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hhrk. Ey, lay offa me! I don't need yer halp, or anybod'z. I can make it own my own! Hhup...\" He hiccups slightly, by the three bandits were closing in on him now. Hex had to do something, or else witness Jackal gangbanged on a table. Opening the door quietly, he slips his way into the room and begins to creep forward, doing his best not to alert the attention of the three bandits having their backs to him. Jackal, however, can see the Toxicroak from under the Aggron's arm. Hex puts a finger to his lips to gesture the Typhlosion to remain quiet, only to see and hear the fire-type growl out with a pointed finger, \"Oooy! Whaddar <i>YOU</i> doin' 'ere...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex freezes in place, standing there with widened eyes, a still heart, and choked breath once the three bandits curiously glance over to see the Toxicroak there at the other end of the room at the door. The Toxicroak had no idea what to do or say. The only thought of action right now was to quite literally murder Jackal. There was just no other option. Jackal had to die now. He <i>had</i> to die. Lace would understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drunk Typhlosion stumps forward, brushing away the Aggron in front of him to stagger to Hex. \"YyyooOOoouu...shouldn't be here! You should, hic, be back at duh, uhhh, whatever dug place wuz... Lace sed so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Aggron grunts, \"Who the hell's the frog? I've never seen him before, yet you know him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Braviary grunts, \"What place is he talking about? Does that mean he's some outsider?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Simisear grunts, \"Who the heck is Lace? Does he mean the Lance fellow he came with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak was about to go into a panic attack from literally everything everyone worked for up to this point, Jackal blew in a single drunken stammer. \"I...I...I...\" Hex utters, still shocked, frozen in place, unable to speak any kind of defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Typhlosion suddenly turns around and angrily growls, \"That aaaain't any o' yer BIZNIZZ...! Pipe down! I'm talkin' to sumwon...\" Jackal twists back around, his belly sloshing with his stomach full of alcohol with a hand resting on Hex's shoulder with the other poking repeated jabs to the frog's chest. \"I think they're on to yaaa...\" He attempts to whisper, but his voice merely hisses the words out. The other bandits can hear his words <i>quite</i> vividly still. \"You gots to go. Lace and I have everythin' unduh control. Yer gonna blow mah cuvuh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Jackal...\" The frog quietly grunts from between his gnashed teeth, curling his hands into fists with extreme worry about the three cautious bandits slowly approaching them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal awkwardly smushes his finger to Hex's lips, poking one up against the frog's gums some. \"SssSSHHssshhhh...! Mah name'zzz Zack! I-I dunno why...Lace said so...so be very, very, very, very, <i>HIC</i>, very quiet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Aggron stomps forward, growling, \"Wait, then just who are you two?! If you're outsiders, I'm taking you to Damie-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal spins around again to huff, \" Shaddap! Wait chur turn! I am toduhlee one o' you guyz. I luv the whole, uh, rape slavez thang. And uh, hic, uh, hunt infeckdid. And uhhh...drinks...~ Hhehhh...\" The Typhlosions spreads his warm, red cheeks with a fake toothy grin to try and pass off. The three bandits just stand there baffled at the stupidity and weirdness of it all, Hex had to do something while he could, because Jackal surely wouldn't.</span></div></div>",

But I am more than happy to take you three monsters of men out.\" The Toxicroak grins in his usual coy way to hide his fear from the predicament and frustration with Jackal. Hex didn't like the odds, cornered by three rather tough looking bandits. However, his fingers flex out and his tongue rims around his lips. \"Sorry boys, but I'm taking the Typhlosion back home. He's not yours to play around with. That's my job~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsenze...!\" The Typhlosion grunts, dropping his drink onto the floor and ready his wobbly fists up, fisticuffs style in a rotating motion. \"Jis you watch!

Three against two, or at least, three against one and maybe a half considering the useless drunkard. The Aggron beats a fist into an open palm, the Braviary flexes out the wings on his back with readied claws, and the Simisear huffs out embers from his toothy smile. The metal beast boasts first, \"Heh...is that right? We were just gonna put that big cushiony ass of yours to use, Typh, but the frog's more than welcome to join ya. We each can have a hole to fuck...~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex silently swallows, not liking the idea at all with the half-erect men standing before him. But there wasn't much of a choice. Jackal retorts, \"Eh? Ya wanna fuck me? Is that all 'chu can do to get yer rocks off, big guy, eh? Y'zee, this guy right here...\" The Typhlosion suddenly hooks an arm around the Toxicroak, bringing the frog to smush sides to Hex's surprise. \"This guy, tooootally just likes men. And dat's okay... A lotta people are bi theze dayz. But he actually only likez dudez, like me, aaand you...and you...aaaand I guess you too...\" He mentions, point separately to each of the confused bandits. \"Now, that's pretty weird, but I mean, I've gone about with this guy for like, HIC, for like a good while, and not once did he try to fffuck me...

With a strong inhale, the Aggron growls, \"...I'm beating the drunk down first.\" He stomps forward and swings his horned head at the two. Hex shoves the clumsy, bellied Typhlosion away with the frog diving the opposite way, barely missing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex rolls back to a stand with poisoned claws ready. Jackal meanwhile stumbles in his steps against a wall before slowly rebounding off of it, staggering forward, swinging a punch to the Aggron's chest. \"Aghh!\" He yelps, holding his knuckles from hitting a wall of armor essentially. The Toxicroak groans, knowing that this was going to be a tough battle to deal with. The Braviary and Simisear dash at him, ready to claim their prisoner...</span></div></div>",

With a slash of both arms, Hex completely slips in between the avian's legs with his knuckles claws raking the ankles along the way, leaving the eagle to fall to his hands and knees with a yowl. \"Craaahh!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling back up to a stand, the Toxicroak lightly bounces in place with hands ready to deal with anymore resistance from the bird. The Braviary growls, when staggering up to a stand, but feeling the effects of Hex's venom in his ankles proved to be troublesome. \"Damn frog. You're gonna pay for that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph.\" Hex croaks with a light smile. \"Don't blame me, fellow. I'm simply here to collect a pal; you're the one who wants a piece of me. And if you want some of me that bad, you're going to need to try harder than that.\" The Toxicroak winks to rile the eagle up more before the Simisear steps up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monkey growls with tightened fists when standing by the Braviary, \"Oh, I'm gonna have more than just a piece of you. I'd like to see how quickly you'd burn up in my stomach!\" His cheeks puff out before spewing flames from his mouth to torch Hex, however, the frog manages to leap high with his strong legs and latch his hands onto one of the upper rafters. His legs lift so the fire barely misses underneath, heating up his rump and thighs even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof! Sorry, I'm afraid I don't prefer being charcoal or primate food.\" The Toxicroak retorts while happily swinging under the rafter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Simisear scowls, but the Braviary flaps his wings forward to blast himself towards the frog in a twirling spin, sticking out his beak for a Drill Peck. \"Then how about being bird food?\" He madly exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring Hex's swing, the Toxicroak flings himself forward at the avian to the Braviary's surprise, only to miss the frog once again by just a hair as Hex goes over him. However, the frog brings his legs together to clasp his thighs to the sides of the avian's head, flipping over to completely jolt the eagle from his dive and to slam into the ground with the Toxicroak. The avian hits the floorboards first, busting through them actually with Hex leaping off from him. Hex makes his clean landing and stands up straight with his back to the hole, widening his arms out to the Simisear as if he was waiting for some congratulatory cheers from his enemy by the impressive moves. The avian can be heard slamming into the ground below to groan before the loosen broken boards above him snap apart and fall into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Simisear huffs embers through his teeth, \"I'm going to give you a slow death, and it still wouldn't be enough for what you deserve right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to give you a quick knock-out, which would be far less what you would deserve as well.\" Hex muses with half-lidded eyes. The frog bounds forward for a Poison Jab at the Simisear, yet the primate was able to side-step out of the with his own fist packing right against Toxicroak's stomach. Hex coughs out only before the monkey chomps his flat teeth to his arm. \"Auuhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex can feel the teeth bite down roughly, forcing the frog to fall over onto his side. The Simisear takes the moment to free Hex's shaking arm, just to then chomp down onto one of Hex's thighs. With the teeth biting his leg, the frog cries out in the sudden panic to kick the limb and swing his knuckle claws away at the primate. The monkey however jabs the amphibian right in the throat sac, forcing Hex to spit out some with widened eyes. His knuckle claw manages to scrape the Simisear, but only on the cheek. The monkey growls when releasing the leg from his mouth, leaving a firm bite mark on the thigh with a bit of saliva glistening with red. \"Not so confident when I'm getting samples of food, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak was too busy trying to breathe properly than to make a snide comeback. It took most of his attention to do so, leaving the monkey to kick his other side and stomp down on his back. \"Crrrhkkk!!!\" Hex yelps aloud with a shuddering voice, tensing up all of his limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Simisear's open maw glows a bright orange light to toast the amphibian, however, a sudden chubby figure tackles him down onto the floor from behind. Jackal growls when pinning the other fire-type to the ground, \"Ey! You lay the fuck offa him!\" Before the Simisear can mutter a word, Jackal's fist pounds him across the poisoned cheek, making it sting extra harder for the bandit before his other cheek is punched across with Jackal's other fist. \"Who the fuck goes aroun' bitin' other people?! What are ya, infected?! Peez o' SHIT!\" Jackal was swinging powerful and deafening punch to the Simisear's head with his heavy beer-gutted weight keeping the monkey down and breathless. The legs of the bandit squirm and his voice gags out to speak, but Jackal was beating him so frequently, only the Typhlosion was doing the talking. In fact, every few words he spoke, they were followed with a punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you! He's! A nice! Guy! Unlike you! A fucko! I hate you! I hate your friends! I hate this place! I hate bandits! I hate your face! I hate your leader! I hate Lace for! Makin' me come here! But fuck it! He's nicer than you! He's better than you! That's why! I'm <i>bashin'! Yer! Fuckin'! Stoopid! Ass! Face!!!</i>\" Jackal exclaims, having swung faster and faster the farther he went into his drunken furious rage. Hex was already up and standing, shoving the Typhlosion off the Simisear. Jackal kicks and squirms, snarling madly when trying to fight off the Toxicroak to get the primate. \"No! I aaain't done with that chompy chomp bazturd!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex glances over to see the Simisear was easily unconscious with a puffy bruised face oozing with blood from his mouth and nose. The monkey was left drooling stupidly with several teeth knocked out. \"Jackal. You <i>must</i> calm down! We need to-\" The Toxicroak wasn't allowed to finish, now that <i>he</i> was the one next to be surprised tackled. The Aggron Jackal was dealing with shoulder-charged and bashed his stomping force against Hex to leave the frog smashing through a wooden wall and into another room. The Toxicroak gags at the sudden hit before the Aggron's thick arms grapple around him and slam him heavily to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air in Hex's lungs are viciously forced out with his eyes rolled up, spine aching. He can feel the full weight of the Aggron's leg stomp right to his stomach, nearly forcing the frog to spit out all the poison he left in his body. \"Splchgaghtk!! H-H-Hh....H-Hughh...\" Hex wheezes and gags, unable to come to his senses with the large down glaring down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ggrrhh...I don't like it when people hurt my best buds.\" The dino says, lifting up a leg for another stomp above Hex's head to finish the groaning frog off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither do I, fucker!\" Jackal exclaims from behind the Aggron. The metal beast turns his head to see the Typhlosion...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Jackal's very eyes emitted a burning rage to them as his open maw glows a vivid glow of orange. His mane suddenly fumes out a wide fan of fire as his jaws unleash a chaotic stream of the stuff out at the Aggron. Whether it was just his mad anger or the alcohol in his system fueling the fires, the metal dino gasps before being blasted destructively away from Hex. The heavy beast bashes onto the ground by the sheer force with the armor on his body glowing red from burning heat. \"G-Ggyyaahhh!!!\" He exclaims, feeling the searing sensation at his body some. He was thankful he was the kind of metal-coated creature that he was, otherwise he'd be nothing but charcoal. However, this just leads him to being open to the charing Typhlosion. The fire-type was even pouncing on all fours before smashing into the Aggron with flames still erupting from his body and mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal growls with blind rage, \"Let's see how ya like it when the person you tried to fack <i>FACKS</i> you over!\" The Aggron is forced back after the maddened drunk managed to actually beat him over with his fists alone. Hex coughs and manages to pull himself over onto his side just in time to see his companion screaming and repeatedly bashing the Aggron's middle. His fist nearly had a fiery blast with each deafening impact, echoing the metal bashing into the room with the Aggron gagging to each one. The bandit's back slams to the floor boards, cracking and scorching up to the intense heat glowing bright from his body with Jackal yelling. The more Jackal screams, the more vivid and violent the flames become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-GhHyyahahhHHHH!!! AHhhHHhH!!! Get OFF!!!\" The Aggron growls with pinched eyes, whipping his thick tail about and rolling his head about in the panic of such ferocity. His fist collides into Jackal's belly to halt his flaming breath for a bare moment as the Typhlosion gags to the motion, but it was enough time for the Aggron bandit to grab Jackal by his neck with both hands. The clawed hands clench tight to seize up the fire-type's throat to cease his flame spewing while attempting to choke Jackal out. The Typhlosion's eyes tighten and his hands grab and tug at the burly arms. The Aggron glares angrily in his own pained rage, crushing away at Jackal's throat while growling, \"I thought it'd be nice to let you live and just keep you like a fucked-up slave, but if you wanna die, you're more than welcome to. I'm gonna watch the life in those stupid drunk eyes of yours die out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal tightly gags and wheezes, clawing at the hot metal at the Aggron's arms despite them doing nothing. Hex watches in horror, attempting to drag himself over to the two with his legs seizing up from the strain. He was able to get a wobbly stance going, but he would nearly fall over at any endeavor to walk. He was rushing himself too much, but Jackal was dying, and would die quickly if he didn't do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to think of anything else, the Toxicroak grunts, \"Jack-...yeah, Jack. Are you gonna let that bastard just choke you like that? Lace was right about you, being weak. He even told me your real name was Jack, and Jackal was just a cover because you thought it sounded cooler...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal's brows pinch with his teeth bearing together. The angrier he was, the stronger he was, and Hex knew this. The thought of Lace bad-mouthing him and still on about that stupid name drilled something into the Typh's mind to where he manages to choke out a growl, \"...H-Hk...my...fucking...name...is...\" His jaws part again with his teeth now glowing orange and crackling with fire. His mane even bursts fuming flames that torch the metal claws of the Aggron's hands cupped around Jackal's neck. The beast yelps from that along with the Fire Fang attack gnashing down around one of his wrists, forced to let go of the Typhlosion. The fire-type roars, \"<i>JACKAAAAAAAAAL!!!</i>\" with a Fire Blast slamming into the Aggron that sends the large beast crunching through the floorboards before bashing through a wooden wall, off of a balcony, and into a completely other room! The sound of a rumbling crash shakes the walls and floorboards of the room Hex and Jackal were both currently in, scaring the frog even with how violent and powerful the Typhlosion's temper was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal huffs out smoke with every heavy exhale, giving the air a dark mist to it as he just stares at the scorched wooden trail of embers and soot through the cracks and holes he made to send the Aggron off with. His growls subside and his arms slump before swinging lazily over as he turns to Hex, \"Hhhaaagghh....hhrrrrrgghhh...hhhhffffggh...fuck...hhhgh...that guy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak clears his throat and straightens himself more, able to take the time to actually stand correctly and check his walking. Making enough ground, he was confident that he'd be able to make it out of this place, especially now that he was with Jackal and the Typhlosion was...capable of defending himself should things get sour. Coughing, Hex mutters when looking at the damage with a bit of awe, \"Yes...hff...fuck that guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gluuhh...\" The Typhlosion groans, timbering over. Hex was quick enough though, and manages to catch Jackal into his arms. Apparently exerting himself in such a way exhausting Jackal. \"Ughnnn...I wanna...go home.\" The fire-type groans. \"Shit, wait, I don't even haffa home anymore, but I wanna go to a place that feelz like one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex tugs on the Typhlosion to get Jackal to stand properly, keeping an arm slung behind his shoulders. \"Don't worry, we're leaving this place at once and  going back to Hedgen. We're meeting up with the others there after all is said and done in this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two begin to walk together, needing to leave for all of the commotion they likely have caused, more than what Hex would've liked. Still, he was happy he found his friend. Jackal growls, \"Gggrrhhh...did Lace say all dat shit about me?\" The drunk Typhlosion tightens a fist with half-lidded eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, sorry, I am afraid I lied about that. I figured you needed an extra push to send you into your rather...uhm...<i>primal-self</i>.\" The Toxicroak admits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal then grunts, \"Damn. Oh well, I showed dat stoopid dino. Sorry for getting all, hic, worked up about it. Glrrhh...I need...some belly rubs...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we get out of this place alive, I'll give you all the stomach rubs you need.\" Hex states when his attention was more focused on walking Jackal stealthily through the rooms and halls of the mill, attempting to avoid any that had bandits in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hehhh...didja know I had Lace promise me sometin' like dat? It was after a tuff thing we went through together, and he kinda kept it up for a bit but then...shit, I dunno, it started making me angry. I dunno, not at him. I guess I realized it hurt my pride or some shit. Fuck, am I like a child?\" Jackal confesses aloud as he's slumped against Hex, needing to be babied around with his alcohol-addled mind after his temper-tantrum. Hex wouldn't admit that to Jackal though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frog mentions to dismiss the claim when glancing around, more worried for guards, \"Not at all. Now please, keep your voice down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, Jackal continues, \"...I should...apologize to dat guy. He's been lookin' after me since we met, and I tried to eat 'em when we did. L-Lace is such a, hic, such a great dude. I dunno why I get so frustrated with him though. Itz like he's drilled into my head or some shit that I have to deny. I care about him, y'know? And I've treated him like dirt for it. I'mma...I'mma talk to him when I see that Lucario bastard. He ain't gonna get the better of my temper or frien- hic! Friendship! He and I, hic, are gonna fuckin' save the world together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, that's nice, I'm glad you've consoled yourself with this but, please, will you be qui-\" Hex states before shutting himself up after hearing a door open. Quickly, he slams himself and Jackal against a wall around a doorway, out of sight from the people that just walked into the hall they were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal grumbles, \"Naw, we can take 'em, jis like dat Aggron bitch! Lemme' at 'em...hic!\" The Typhlosion was actually sliding himself off of Hex, ready to go out there to the approaching steps storming their way in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak immediately yanks him again, pinning his back to the wall while also pushing a hand to Jackal's mouth to muffle his voice. Clearly, he was panicking and getting frustrated with his friend from the close-call they had in the last encounter. \"Sh-Shh! Jackal, for Arceus' sake...! Neither of us are in a state to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal slaps the hand out of the way though. \"Get yer hand offa me! I gotta go find Lace, n' no bandit it gonna stahp me fr-\" The Typhlosion would continue, but Hex was forced to take matters into his own hands. His head tilts and leans in, snuffing out Jackal's voice once the frog kisses the Typh. Mouth to mouth, Hex guides his tongue into Jackal's jaws to welcome the fire-type's own in a bit of distracting play despite the smoky taste. The drunk's eyelids would lift up (as best they could) in surprise before awkwardly drooping. Jackal grunted in confusion, but soon his drunk-addled mind caved in. He simply let Hex do his thing as the gay Toxicroak worked his magic. The bandits in the hall would pass by the two hidden away, exiting through a different door in search for the commotion earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex's lips smear and tighten, repeatedly locking to the Typhlosion's own as his hands cup to the chubster's belly. Applying the previously requested rubs, the frog neatly thumbs over the beergut in coaxing strokes and easy palming. The fire-type's cheeks redden over time, lazily just standing there to let it all happen until Hex's lips wetly pucker off from him. The frog stares into Jackal's eyes for a brief moment until he states, \"...We're leaving this place. Follow me. Stay close. Be quiet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal is left dumbfounded. \"O..Okay...\" Hex takes him by the wrist and leads him out. And along the way, Jackal mutters, \"...Could we do that...again?\"</span></div></div>",

A constant and ambient pounding thrums at your skull. Your heavy eyelids attempt to open, and you think you manage to do so, yet the world was still dark; at least, it was so blurry, darkness was barely waning. Parting your jaws, you wheeze in a brief amount of dry air. While you do hear yourself doing this, your ringing ears hardly pick this up as a natural sound. A constant motion of noise fills into them even, but they're so frantic and muffled, you are unable to depict what they all are. \"U-...Ughnh...\" You groan aloud, regaining your senses at an incredibly slow pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA muffled voice boasts, \"Wakey, wakey, bitch.\" You groan out again, blinking again and again to battle off your grogginess. You can feel yourself moving, despite none of your muscles really responding to what you want them to do. Your wrists and legs most of all feel something brushing against them; no, dragging against something. You were being pulled along the ground against someone's hip carelessly before being dropped completely. You cough, blinking still with twitching ears until you glance up to see black set of hindpaws before you. Your eyes glance up to see the vague figure of a Houndour with a female Persian laid out along his lap, lightly combing at his chin with her clawed fingertips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien's familiar voice picks up, \"Lance, Lance, Lance. What on earth are you doing here back so soon~? Did you forget something...?\" His voice sounded coy, but there was a clear underbelly of anger in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cough and manage to get to your hands and knees. Your sight and hearing were getting better, but a sudden kick to your stomach sends you back onto the ground. \"He asked you a question, <i>bitch</i>.\" It was the person that carried you here, the same person that must've knocked you out from your last memory being with him in the toolroom. The Bibarel righthand man to Damien growls, \"Answer him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, Bigby. Give him a moment. He can't talk if you keeping knocking the air out of his lungs. You can bash it all out <i>after</i> he's done talking with me.\" Damien retorts, now becoming less sincere with his voice. \"I last recall sending you away with Ruby a good long while ago, yet I was never informed of your return and I have yet to have seen my precious cat. Why did you sneak back in here? Where's Ruby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollecting your breath, you hoist yourself up to your knees while clutching your stomach, getting a good view of Damien's unpleased face. \"H-Hhhk...came back...for a drink. Your precious Ruby's just waiting for me outside.\" You retort as a sarcastic response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBigby is ready to hit you, but Damien lifts a hand to stop him from doing so. He pats Sapphire's hip to get the just-as-angry Persian to slide up off from him to relax onto the couch more as he stands himself up. \"...Frankly, I need you alive, but only for so long to where I can know about Ruby's fate. But I can be very careful to hurt someone just enough so they can endure the very edge of death, at the cusp of it, and yet out of reach.\" The Houndour suddenly kicks the low-table in between the two of you out of the way and off the balcony he was at. Bandits in the main recreation room scatter when seeing the table fall down a level, barely avoiding it smashing to the ground below. The young Houndour then bashes your chin with a swift kick to send you onto your back. On the floor, he immediately stomps his paw onto your neck to make you choke out and gets your heart to skip a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-HAGCHHK!!\" You gag out with widened rolled up eyes, clutching in a panic at Damien's leg in your weakened state. He grinds and twists the paw down, straning the spinal column and closing your air tunnel, forcing your body to convulse and kick at the floor, gagging louder, \"<i>Gg-gggrrhhaackkkghkk...!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound fucking pathetic. But if you want to sound like anything at all other than a cold dead corpse, then I suggest...\" He suddenly stomps down at you again, harder this time, \"Where!\" He stomps again, forcing spittle from your jaws, \"Is!\" He stomps yet again, cracking the floorboards under your head, \"Ruby?!\" His eyes burn with rage, teeth snarling and gritting, tail whipping out in distress. He might just end up killing you with his form of interrogating, but it wasn't like Bigby or Sapphire were going to stop him. They were enjoying this in fact...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to decide what to say with the little amount you had to speak...</span></div></div>",

But frankly, he wanted feast on him like food, so I dragged that cat bastard to the Hedgen jail because at least I still have some decency other than you people. I plan on getting my friend outta here, an-ghkk!!\" You choke again once the hindpaw weighs down on your neck making your legs kick at the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien snorts out fire with clenched fists tightening up. \"You...you barred him in that fucking town? You're with those fucking peasants? You think you can just barge in here after taking Ruby and getting your fat dumb fuck of a boyfriend scott-free?\" His paw really grinds down at your clenched throat, closing your channel of air to have you silently gag on the ground.

Wind returns to your mouth to finally breathe, but Bigby is right there to knock it right out with a firm kick to your side, right in the ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll over onto your hands and knees, not wasting a moment to slam yourself up against the big Bibarel to drill another punch in. It connects to his stomach to make him hunch over, but Sapphire the Persian rakes your back with her claws as she hisses a vile sound for hurting her precious Houndour. You yelp from the sting until Damien's hand grabs the back of your head after getting up to smash it against the wooden railing of the balcony you all were on. The three on one situation really worked against you, and you collapse onto the ground once more, completely dazed, drooling from your open mouth even. \"H-Hghh...\" Bigby grabs you by the ears and hoists you up off the ground, leaving you to just dangle there with Damien and Sapphire scowling at you; the Persian already hugged into the Houndour's side and running a hand to the scorch mark on his thigh you left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Send him to the Pit.\" Damien orders the beaver with your eyelids throbbing to regain an open vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Gnnh...not the game?\" You remark before Damien slams a kick to your stomach to shut you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bandit leader was smiling a bit some, rather nefariously as he explains, \"Oh that's right, we never showed you. For some special fighters like you, we have a different kind of event for everyone to watch, not just for me to see down in a maze.\" He glances over to Sapphire to give an affectionate lick to her cheek, patting her ass to murr, \"Gather the men, would you~?\" She smiles and heads down as Damien gestures his head at the railing of the balcony to Bigby. \"Give him the short way down there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the Bibarel grip you tight before flinging you up and over the bars of the balcony, sending you to fall towards the large recreation room and bar the bandits had that were listening in the whole time. You bark out with your body slams onto a wooden table, breaking it apart on impact to nearly knock you out all over again. \"Gy-gh...nh...\" You couldn't even muster words as your world grows dark and blurry with bandit men crowding around you, glaring down at your body amidst the smashed wood...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard for you to tell how much time passed, or if any actually did. Your world was a dark and blurry mess with everything pulsating numbly. Voices mutter around you, almost like a cheer that increases the more you get close to it. You sense yourself being dragged somewhere since you obviously weren't up and walking. Soon enough, a bandit splashes your face with a mug of beer to jostle your senses, having you sputter at the fluid and open your eyes more. Bigby had a hold of your head while sliding you along the ground to somewhere behind you. Several bandits are eager to watch with Damien even walking next to you. His fiery eyes spot you waking up again to have them lock right to your own pair. \"Dump him in.\" He orders, not to you of course, but to the burly beaver opening a wooden gate to fling you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body falls before hitting a dirt floor this time, no hard wooden surface this time. Your muzzle grunts and wheezes as you remain in your new problematic situation when struggling to stand. Your eyes blink with a roar of applause up above you, getting you to glare up and see that you were indeed in a large circular pit. It was a dug-in hole with columns of logs rounding out the tall walls with a cage of branches making for the ceiling where the crowd of bandits watching down could be your audience. Damien rises from the crowd and bestows you like a show, \"Gentlemen, here we have a pretty stupid traitor that has sided with the fuckers back in Hedgen. But here is, wanting to come back for his dear old friend. Let's say we give him some new friends to play with, hm~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA heavy sound snaps your attention to face forward in the dirt pit you were stucking. A large gate slowly lifts up via chains to reveal to purple glowing dots peering at you through the darkness. You stagger back, only to growl in pain from how much your body's sustained thus far. The infected stammers forward, revealing itself to be a fat Lickitung with a swinging tongue that's far-too-eager to taste you right now. It drools with a hungry look with a collar tucked on its neck, being pushed forward by a bandit with a long pole to keep it out of reach from himself. He unhooks the pole from the collar to skid back to the gate entrance into the pit where it can slam closed before you or the infected could mosey on through it. The Pit was just a make-shift arena for people to fight it out with captured infected, and you were the newest victim. Apparently they didn't just <i>eat</i> all of the infected, but used them for sport like in the Game and this duel as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bandits cheer and holler for your demise as the Lickitung slaps its belly and stumbles forward with ravenous eyes at your already battered figure to make for an easy meal. Gritting your teeth, you prepare your fists with an awkwardly hurt posture to face off with this chubby being. Damien exclaims as he has Bigby ring a gong, \"Dinner time~!\" It was almost too convenient that the feral charged at you once the ringing sound bellows out in the room. You skid  away the best you can only to have your back hit the wall. There wasn't a lot of room to face off against this thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat being jostles as it encroaches with a mighty swing of its tongue that you're able to duck under. However, it swings right back to wetly smack your side and send you to the floor. You yelp as your body resounds with aches from the hit that would've normally just agitated you. All that abuse from earlier was on purpose, and Damien wanted to see you fall to a mere hungry feral in front of his 'family'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly getting up to a wobbly motion, you dash forward to meet the Lickitung with your own attack, only to meet its open arms that grapple around your back to trap you in a hug. Your body is crushed against the infected's gluttonous fat belly, mushing into the pudge that so many others have fallen into with the entrance to you gaping wide before you. \"N-No!\" You growl as you attempt to worm your binded arms out from its hold. The open gummy mouth before you drools with the fat tongue smacking to the back of your head, wrapping around it even to try and yank it on inside the warm and slick cavern. \"N-Nhmmpk! Grrhh!\" Your body tenses up. It was like several senses of pain were working against you. Your back aches from the stress of the Lickitung's thick arms apply to your spine, the bare pink and yellow flesh of its gut molds to your battered figure to weaken your muscles despite the cushiony chub, and its fat tongue darkens your vision from flexing around your entire head. The wet meat squishes to your muzzle and cranium before working your head towards its mouth. You do what you can in the dangerous situation, emitting your entire body with whatever aura you could muster in the short amount of time. Miraculously, you get the infected Lickitung to release you before you can even blast your aura off from you to hurt it. Apparently the dumb thing was smarter than you thought. The tongue unravels from your head as you stagger away to have your back hit the wall again, making you wince in place with drool matting your fur now as you pant for fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms hang down heavily with your posture slumped over some, obviously weighed by the damage. The Lickitung smacks its jaws, wetting its tongue to collect some of the taste it was able to snag off of you from its grapple. Its gut rumbles deeply for food, and you really just encouraged its hunger. The crowd berates you, and you'd have to take care of this thing quickly before the audience got to see what they wanted. Or you could try to hold out as long as you could to save time for your companions who should be storming this place any moment. A distraction like that could lead to your escape...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With curled fists that you clasp sides together, you focus your aura within their grip, spreading your hands out to form tightly bound aura into a staff the long your arms extend. Crafting a weapon from your own energy, you nearly stagger over to feel as though your muscles were going to give from just the mere motion. You close your eyes to zero-in on making the glowing bone as physical as possible, surely with enough to make every swing feel like an aura-burning punch. It was rather distracting with all of the bandits cheering for your demise, along with the heavy panting of the beast in front of you. Regardless, your weapon is crafted and you hunch down some to face off against the fat Lickitung slapping its own gut as a gesture for you to bring it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a quick dash, you attempt to close the distance with your staff readied behind you, swinging with all your might in the momentum to slam it right against the Lickitung's middle. The purple eyes of the fatty widen out as the staff completely buries against the hefty chub, leaving it staggering back with a heavy step here and there. You follow it up with another swing towards its head for real damage, although it yanks its face back just in time for you to completely miss which has you pivoting over too far. Left exposed, you feel its large tongue loop around at your hip before lifting you up just to slam you down to the ground on your back. You cough, feeling the stress of everything simultaneously ache. Blinking, you see its leg lifted up for a stomp, and thankfully you dodge this one by rolling over. You can hear the clay-like dirt smash heavily which could've been your skull a second ago. Rolling more back up onto all fours, you crawl some until you can rise back up awkwardly towards your infected opponent who already charged in for another attack. It manages to get another wet-slap of its tongue to smack against your face to make you step back, but you fight it off with bashing your bone staff to the long muscle's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lickitung yelp and wobbles its tongue about before glaring at you, swinging a wide uppercut with it in retaliation. You quickly use your aura weapon to block the move by holding it horizontally, which catches the fat tongue and his it loop around it instead. The Lickitung growls at this and keeps its hold on the staff, pulling at it to yank you a step towards it. Stomping your hindpaws down, you're now at a tug-of-war match with the beast by keeping a hold of the staff's edges in both hands while its curled tongue tugs harder at its middle. \"Ggghhhhhhgggghhhrrrr!!\" You growl out in frustration, feeling ever muscle in your body tense up, attempting to fight off the weight and strength of the fat pink monster. Its arms swing wide open in preparation to trap you in another bear hug once it pulls you in close enough, but you wouldn't allow it another chance to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an aura glint of your eyes, you dispel the staff away, leaving it to vanish in embers of aura midair. You had let go before it did so, but the infected Lickitung had not. The full force of its fat tongue smacks it right against face, forcing it steps back now this time. Panting, you crank up some of the aura you can muster around a single fist and bolt towards the Lickitung after it pries its own tongue off from its face, which now gives it a good view of the roaring Lucario leaping towards it. With the help of some speed, gravity to add some weight to you, and perhaps some miraculous adrenaline, you pound a mighty fist directly to the Lickitung's shocked expression to send the fatass spiraling away in drunken stumbles. Its back slams to the wall with a burning punch mark left right on its smashed nose, leaving it groaning from the rattling shock. ITs heavy weight forces it down onto its knees before inevitably falling over onto its belly, unconscious. The Lickitung's tongue flops out over onto the ground, drooling idly which leaves you the winner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had hit the dirt after falling from the down-diving punch, which has you simply on your knees and elbows, heaving for oxygen into those tired lungs before you weakly rise up to the dismay of the bandits above. Your eyes meet with Damien's as you point a finger, \"...hhh...hhh...I win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien doesn't seem to be too discouraged by this however. \"For round one, yes. But let's see how you deal with round two~?\" His tail whips by excitedly as the gate within the pit arena suddenly opens up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Round t-two...?\" You mutter before looking over and seeing another purple pair of eyes glaring at you from the darkness, and not only that, but crackling orange flames. Out from the gate, the next infected opponent looms closer to the weak-looking meal it sees before itself and neighs hungrily. A female Rapidash locks eyes with you with a vicious look to her expression. Her flat teeth gnash together with drool seeping through between them amidst her angered growls. And with a glance, her figure was intimidating all on its own. Her body was well muscled with an obvious impressive set of abs on her stomach, built arms, and the rather dangerous-looking legs that could probably break your back with just a squeeze between her thighs. From her slit, pre oozes lightly from it from being horny with nostrils flaring, quite literally since embers and smoke fumed from her. The fire of the unicorn's mane crackles some the more excited she got when thinking about how nicely you'd do for either food or as some fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien spreads his arms out, \"Round two~! Be careful now, she's a real feisty bitch. She used to be one of the slavegirls here, but managed to escape us. I was going to have search parties be sent out to hunt her down and bring her back, but we found her lumbering back towards this place outside, cause she apparently got herself raped out there by some infected! Droolin' and moanin' with purple eyes. Irony I tell ya~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lacked the means to shut the Houndour up right there and then sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rapidash roars from her mouth before charging at you. Now it was fight or flight. You packed a lot of strength in all that you had to deal with thus far, but you certainly had limits. You'd have to come up with some way to beat her or escape this pit.</span></div></div>",

You tense your body as close as you could to being steel, no pun intended for your type, and clash hands with the large horse. The taller Rapidash roars as your palms mash together in an attempt to work the other down. However, from your perspective, she was working her weight and strength down upon you, and you were endeavoring just to keep her from toppling over you. The infected snarls with its animalistic purple eyes before prying its maw wide, fuming an orange glow within her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmidst the grapple, you swing your head to the side as she fires off a flaming fan to narrowly miss your face, but the skin and fur certainly feel the intense heat scorch by. It gets you to growl right back before you spew out a bit of your flaming aura yourself, blasting a short burst to pelt the horse's own face with blue fire. The Rapidash snarls in response by swinging its smoking head around, and while the fire-type wasn't too harmed by the move, it weakened her hold briefly enough for you to throw off her hands, only to drill a powerful swing into her stomach. The horse curls over in the motion to gag out before you follow up with an arcing uppercut to clock her long jaw. The Rapidash slings backwards in a few steps before shaking its head again, whisking away the dizziness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStomping her hooves down firmly and flexing her figure, she snorts from her nostrils before spewing out a long flamethrower from her maw, forcing you to hit the dirt flat. The stream of crackling heat strikes the wall behind you and burns at the wooden pillars making up the surrounding pit. Just as you think it'd cause a fire for an escape, a sudden splash of water dowses the scorch-spot. Your eyes peer up as you stagger to a slow stand to see Bigby, Damien's right-hand Bibarel, grinning down at you with crossed arms and a wet mouth; rather, damp with water and not saliva despite his urges into eating you. Apparently they thought ahead of time in case you ever thought about using the fire against the wooden structure. No wonder why the Houndour leader liked having the beaver around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, a different idea hatches in your mind as the Rapidash prepares for another charge. Waiting for the unicorn to use another fire-attack, you pivot around and dash to try and outrun the infected beast. It chases you towards a well to nearly trap you, but you leap and kick off from the wall to effectively soar over the stomping Rapidash. It skids to a quick halt and twists around to face you, but by that time you had already landed behind her and swung your leg. A roundhouse kick smashes against the side of her head to send her staggering over wildly, almost falling over into the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer flaming mane crackles out much more wildly as she gives you what you want, spewing out another flamethrower to scorch up another wooden wall spot to engulf it in fire. Luckily you were able to slide down along the ground and through her legs, coming up right behind her. Just as she pivots around with a swipe, you get clocked across the cheek, but a firm stomp with a leg keeps you from tumbling over. Your eye catches Bigby's cheeks bloating from up above the pit to extinguish the fire, eliciting into you suddenly charging at the Rapidash. Your body leaps with your legs tucking in close before you dropkick the horse directly in her abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rapidash is sent tumbling backwards before slamming into the burning wall she just scorched up, and all the while, the Bibarel up above already blasted out another stream of water to dowse it. The beaver's eyes widen to see the waterfall smash down onto the flaming horse, erupting a wild amount of steam that clouds up the entire pit. The bandit audience all mutter confusion and thoughts of disappointment from the lack of Lucario whines or beatdowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlanketed in the steam, you limp forward to see the Rapidash is on her hands and knees, panting out with a nearly extinguished mane. Mere embers flicker from her back and neck with drool oozing out of her tired mouth. Without the fire burning at her body, the infected Pokemon was heavily weakened. Adrenaline was still running throughout your body on the other hand. Your heart pounds at your ribcage, your blood boils wildly, and the steamy air fumes about at your throat and lungs. You could feel the tinge of fatigue tempting your body to give out, which only encouraged you to finish this quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the Rapidash, you internally apologize as to whoever it was that suffered such a fate before your paws all ignite with aura. Swinging away, your punches slam down at the unicorn's head, battering at her face to rock her skull about. Saliva slings about from the infected's maw as you beat down upon it, all before you roar out with a final stomp. Your hindpaw closes her jaw to the ground in a booming thud, effectively knocking the Rapidash out and leaving your entire muscle structure shivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumble backwards with light-headedness and land on your rear end, panting out wildly as the steam begins to clear. The bandits are then given a view of the mighty unicorn fighter out cold in the dirt, along with you, alive and huffing. Your eyes glare up to where Damien was as you pant out, \"Another...round...done...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Houndour smiles from his cushioned seat with an elbow sitting atop an armrest with his head leaning against his fist; a leg casually crossed over the other to bob about. \"Cheating, are we~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBigby scowls down at you and mutters to Damien, \"Let me get down there in with him. I can finish him off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tempting...\" Damien murrs out but then demands, \"But let's make it more interesting. Final round. One more feral for you to fight. How's that, <i>Lance?</i>\" You didn't anticipate for Damien to keep his word, and simply glared at him while you had a moment to breathe. \"Very well, send out our newest yellow friend!\" He called upon the guards at the feral gate below to get, to which they both nervously look at one another before heading into the darkness of where they keep the excess of ferals in pins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wobble to a stand again as the gate begins to open once more. Readying your fists, you're prepare yourself to face whatever kind of Pokemon they have to throw at you. However, nothing could prepare you for the figure stumbling out. Light flashes off of the beast occasionally, with two purple dots glaring at you from the dark. You catch glimpses of its yellow and white fur that glint with an occasional electrical spark, yet the electrical discharges seem to be held back by something. The gate closes, and the infected is showcased in its glory. Large fangs gleam your reflection of surprise off as a legendary stands before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn infected Raikou breathes heavily in hunger and rage, as the power it withheld could be felt simply emanating with the sound of its voice. According to Herox, he ate all of the legendaries, but considering his intentions, that was easily a lie even before this revelation. Still though, the Raikou was more than just intimidating. Sparks constantly flicker off from its male and strong physique, even from the purple mane flowing about behind it. A black rubber mask was strapped to his head, along with other rubber garments like gloves, belted leggings, etc. The black rubber was able to keep most of the electrical power from exploding off from the legendary lightning beast, but it certainly wasn't enough to snuff it all out entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien muses, \"Ever seen the elusive Raikou before? I forget what his actual name was, but he ended up hearing the plea of the town and was bent on taking me down, along with my establishment here, just like you in fact! However, it seems legendaries are just a fat disappointment. We tossed his battered ass down into this pit with several ferals, and the poor tiger just couldn't fend them all off despite his mighty reputation. Joining their ranks, he's made for a <i>very interesting</i> opponent for others. Luckily for you, you won't have to fight him at full strength thanks to our local toy-making retard's outfit that he crafted just for this loser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Houndour claps his hands and announces, \"Let round three commence!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infected Raikou roars with a bellow that shook the entire arena, nearly muting your ears as sparks and bolts wildly crack about. Judging from how much his open mouth was drooling with saliva, and the intimidating size of his cock drooling with pre, there wasn't a good fate to suffer if you lost to this wild beast. The Raikou's erection throbs in a manner that you couldn't tell if it wanted to infect you, or make you into a batch to infect someone else later. You swallow down your nerves and ready yourself the best you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou prayed help would arrive soon if the others were carrying out the plan effectively...</span></div></div>",

He grumbles to himself as he walks along the dirt path with a mocking tone of someone, \"Oh Credel, why don't you head downstairs and check the tunnels. I haven't checked since it's dark down there. Make yourself useful and go light 'em for me. Damien's all aaaansty.\" The reptile seethes through his mouth with the task given to him, clearly annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he lifts his tail up, all that there was ahead was pitch darkness, with only orange glimmers here and there in the empty dirt path behind him with wooden archways supporting the tunnel like that of a mineshaft. The Charmeleon bandit continues, \"Like that's a damn excuse. He can just take a working torch with him and do this bullshit himself. I don't care if Damien's antsy. You'd have to be a moron to use the tunnels at this hour. Ferals can get in here, making it a death trap if you don't know where to go. Credel do this. Credel do that. Since when was I willing to stick my neck out for that asshole? I'm gonna give him a piece of my mind when I get b-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bandit stops in place upon bumping into something in front of him. He was so distracted in his complaint, he hadn't noticed it, having skipped a few torch spots to ignite. The Charmeleon cranes his tail closer to see it was a giant barrel simply sitting in the middle of the tunnel hall. \"...The fuck is this?\" He asks, taking a whiff to see if it was ale, only to jerk back from a smokey sting. \"Eghk, this is...blastpowder?!\" The Charmeleon glances over to spot a trail of the pewter powder trickled along the ground, leading to another powder keg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widen in disbelief, but before he could so much as move a muscle or blink, a Luxray rises up from behind the barrel and leaps right over it with a swift kick to the Charmeleon's jaw. The fire lizard is forced backwards as Star lands on the ground in front of him in an agile stance, crackling electricity at her hands. \"Sorry. I can't have you ruining the surprise for your leader though.\" She states aloud before dashing in at her foe. The bandit hardly has time to react as her quick nature allowed her several jabs bashing into his midsection to get the Charmeleon to keel over some, only for her hands to then clap together at his head and release an intense static shock. The voltage surges through his figure to make his eyes roll up pure white and his body to wildly quake in the electricity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gg-gGghGgg-hggahhhk!\" The Charmeleon shudders with a cringing voice before the hands pry off his head, leaving his body steaming and soot stains of his scales. The bandit groans unconsciously before teetering backwards, landing in a knocked out flop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar proudly put her hands to her hips in a smiling moment of victory before the Charmeleon, all before sighing out with a shaky tone that she actually managed to do that. \"Hhh, I don't know how Lace can do all this lone-wolf hero business.\" She mutters to herself before turning to the dark end of the tunnel, \"It's alright. He's taken care of now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut from the dark, several villagers from Hedgen appear. Their worried glances eye over the steaming Charmeleon as his arms twitch and wince. Star looks to him and adds, \"It's just reflex of the shock. He's out for a good while.\" She even nudges a hindpaw at his head to have it uselessly flump on its side as proof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Sceptile villager responds, \"Thank you for your help. I'm sorry that none of us are much for fighting, but I feel like I might make matters worse if I tried to help out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar smiles to him and offers a thumbs-up in reassurance. \"You're doing great actually. Y'all have managed to give these bandits the slip and there's no way I could roll all of these kegs by myself. It takes some serious bravery to even come down here and do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, uh, it's appreciated.\" The grass type scratches at the back of his head. \"To be honest, I'm used to dealing with explosives if tunnels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar quirks a brow. \"That's rather specific.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I used to work as a miner in the mountains by Hedgen before the infection happened. I'm pretty sure that's why Bronze nominated me to take the lead in this task.\" The Sceptile explains. \"Not that I wouldn't help otherwise or anything. It's just nice of him to remember who I was before everything went downhill. He remembers who we all were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luxray pats a hand to his shoulder. \"Taking out this mill and that Houndour's reign will be the first step to getting things back uphill. After that, the pack of people I'm with are gonna stop the infection from spreading, perhaps even ending it altogether.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you all can really do that...?\" He asks with skepticism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar thinks on it. \"I...don't think I could. But they've made it rather far and seem to have a good enough idea on what's causing all of this. I'm just tagging along until they get to some place called Redeemer's Grotto to drop me off. It's supposed to be safer there from where I was found.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Hmh. I could've sworn you were all companions together. I figure you would want to stay and help them.\" The grass lizard ponders aloud. Star was taken back by it. She certainly yearned for that, especially as a means to get her loved one back, but she didn't feel like she had the strength to do it. It all came back to feeling insecure as the day she set out for herself to catch lightning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ears lower some, \"I mean, I'd want to, but...\" She shakes her head to fight off the feelings, \"I'm not going to get in their way or slow them down. I'm just paying the favor here for someone that saved my life once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sceptile seemed unconvinced, yet there was still a brief smile on his face. \"What was your name again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's Star.\" The cat answers, only to feel the reptile to cup a hand of hers in a shaking greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you Star.\" The Sceptile states. \"The name's Bayne~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luxray shakes his hand in return, easing away from the topic. \"It's nice to meet you too, Bayne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I ask also...you had a Toxicroak with you, yes? What was his name?\" Bayne inquires as their hands part ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's Hex. He was a part of the group before I was.\" The Luxray replies, only to see the Sceptile's face ignite with some kind of internal revelation. Bayne glances away some, getting Star to ask in return, \"...Do you know him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBayne chuckles and shakes his head, \"...Of all the bloody coincidences.\" Looking to Star, he readjusts the conversation, \"None to worry about that. Let's just focus on the task at hand. The less we're down here, the better. Shall we roll out the rest of the kegs? I believe we only have two more to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and let the other villagers know they can go back and escape the tunnel. I'm gonna patrol ahead just to make sure it's safe, and together we'll roll out those last couple of barrels before heading back out as well.\" Star relays the plan in agreement with Bayne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me. Thank you for considering my people's safety.\" The Sceptile states upon turning around, however, he glances over his shoulder in the meantime to state, \"...Please do be careful Miss Star.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luxray scoffs in a smirk, \"I'll be the one to kick you out of this tunnel if you call me like that again. Scram, Bayne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sceptile shares her expression and proceeds back the way he came, conversing with the other fellow villagers to make their retreat, along with any others still down farther the tunnel. Meanwhile, Star makes her way forward to the now torchlit areas of the tunnel, lacking any cover or means of surprise attacks now that she lacked darkness to aid her. Her biggest worry however was knowing when to ignite the barrels. Lace kept it vague from her of when they should do so, because had he been caught, she wouldn't know when it would be best to erupt the mill. Knowing him however, he'd be sure to stay away from the ground level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's what Star prayed on. She hated feeling incompetent or fearful. Something in that Lucario and the others was growing the adventurous child in her before everything went wrong in her life. \"I'll make you proud of me. I promise.\" She assures herself to Lace, wherever he was. \"For Bell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar the Luxray strode forward with a confident demeanor, glaring ahead with a single eye and static crackling at her mane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It wouldn't be long until the oncomer reveals himself through the torchlit walls. A Tyranitar, easily dwarfing Star's height and width, was mozying on through with his eyes locking to the eyepatched cat. A sharp grin stretches on his face as he doesn't slow down or show any concerns of who she was; and all the while, his belly wobbles before him as a sign that he never skips out on meals. Star was certain he didn't just eat a lot of fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis deep voice carries out to inquire, \"You ain't Credel. What'd ya do with the Charmeleon I sent down here, lass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar readies electricity in her hands in a cold glare, \"I'd love to show you. I can give you the same treatment in fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large dinosaur laughs as he rests a hand to his front, nearly trembling the dirt and pebbles inside the tunnel to make Star worried about his sheer size. The Luxray didn't like the type disadvantage here, nor did she like the Tyranitar's thick armor plating figure. The only 'soft' part about him was the blue pudgy midsection that proudly bobbed in place from his bellowing laughter. He eases down some and leers to the girl, \"I can't trust that damn lizard to do anything. Heh heh, sorry lass. But a hottie like you is too good to pass up. I'm not sure what you're doin' down here, but I think you'd make for a nice addition to our collection of girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tyranitar proceeds forward with his size coming into plain detail that Star was going to have a rough go of this one. It took every fiber of her being not to take a step back. \"Sorry fatass. But I'm not anyone's to have. I'll be sure each of the women you've enslaved gets a good turn in kicking you down when we all leave here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah! So you're here to rescue them? All by your lonesome self? Get real, bitch. Just sit right there and let me walk you to where we can collar you up.\" The Tyranitar boasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar's eye leers thinly and a bolt of electricity erupts from her arm, blasting into the dinosaur. The sparked burst actually has the Tyranitar skidding back slightly with his sturdy legs retaining his stand. He actually laughs again and beats a hand at his plated chest. \"I'll take that as a no then. You think your tingles are gonna stop me, bitch? Hahah! I'm gonna show you why they call me Tank!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a tunnel shaking roar, he charges ahead with arms out, stomping about in a rather faster dash than Star anticipated his size capable of. The cat uses her best ability of speed to ready herself in place until dashing forward, keeping a keen eye on the charging reptile's range before leaping up over his shoulder, sending another surge of bolts into his shoulder. Star lands on the ground on all fours behind the Tyranitar as he skids to a halt by burying a fist into the ground, shoveling a bulky line through the dirt before charging right back towards her again, laughing. The Luxray huffs and leaps to the side to avoid Tank, only to feel his swinging tail catch her off-guard and bashes her into a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feline cries out from her back striking the earth to hit the ground shortly after. \"G-Ghah!\" She groans by the impact, only to witness the Tyranitar's leg swinging in for a powerful strike. Star's eyes widen to feel her abdomen cave in by the intense weight, forcing her back against the wall again. Saliva coughs out from her mouth as the Tyranitar then grapples his hand on her neck for a vice squeeze. \"H-----Hhhk!\" The Luxray grapples her hands at the male's thick-armored arm as he lavishes a murring growl to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTank boasts aloud, \"I told you to stay down kitty cat. Now I gotta play rough.\" He readies a punch to clock her square in the face, however, the Luxray's fur bristles up with a sudden crackle. Her entire figure discharges with built up electricity, shocking through the Tyranitar's arm and surging along his body. He grits his teeth, bearing through the pain until he inevitably releases Star from his grip. The Luxray staggers to wheeze in some oxygen, but she would have to act fast knowing the dino wasn't going to be stunned for long...</span></div></div>",

His endurance was something else to simply wave off Star's electricity, coupled with the thick plating of his figure. The Luxray surges power into her hands as Tank stumbles back after her sudden discharge, gifting her the time to completely concentrate the voltage into her fingertips. The Tyranitar spots her readying an attack and pivots his entire body around for a spin in hopes to strike her with his tail. The heavy length swings by, yet Star is quick enough to avoid it in a swift kneeling slide, skidding right to the dinosaur's front to lunge her hand tongue and mash her fingers into his blue midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soft scaled tum winces in at first, until Tank laughs, \"Hah! You call that punch-Ggh-Ggh-Chrrkgh-GaaAhahaaaaGghk!!!\" The focused voltage erupts directly into his middle and scorches throughout his interior, leaving him wildly throbbing in place as his expression matches the Charmeleon from before, whitening at the eyes from how much they roll up and his jaws hanging open. He attempts to stomp about in place, yet his legs remain ground for the electrical current to go through them into the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTank is left smoking hot and twitching in place, all before Star lunges a firm knee into his gut to send him crashing onto his back with a tunnel-rattling thud. His body spasms, but Star knew he wasn't getting up any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luxray steps onto his chest to lean over him, retorting down, \"I call that kicking your ass.\" She spits onto his unconscious face before kicking her leg off from him, striking his head along the way. With her head held high and her tail dancing somewhat, the cat couldn't help but feel a bit prideful in taking down such a large foe. A part of wish someone was with her just to see her pull it off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching her breath and endeavoring to shake off the aches from the Tyranitar's aggressive hits earlier, the feline leaves him behind and proceeds down the hall, hoping not to catch anyone else lurking for their pals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the torchlights, the Luxray eventually arrives at staircase leading up to an open cellar door, the first floor of the lumber mill presumably. This was the end of the line, and no more guards were present in venturing the tunnels. Star enjoys the relief of that, being able to tell Bayne they can roll out the last of the barrels then and get out. However, her ears catch a voice muttering aloud from the doorway, convincing her to actually snoop in closer. She'd want to make sure the coast is clear after all, and ensure no one else comes down the tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently creeping up the stairs, she carefully peeks her head out from the cellar opening in the floorboards to see a small room used mostly for crates and storage. But there was a door leading outside that a lone bandit was sitting by at, with a table of empty stools besides the one he sat at, mumbling. Playing cards were spilt out all over the table, along with empty mugs of what was once ale. Leering more, Star could tell it was a Girafarig, male like all the other bandits, looking rather bored with his head rolled up, drumming his fingers at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe speaks aloud to voice out frustrations. \"Goddamn. I could be elsewhere right now. I get why Credel always complains out loud now about Tank. The guy always makes ya sit or walk by yourself for some dumb job he can just do himself. Hhh, I could be watching the new Pit fighter right now.\" Star ponders what he meant by that until he adds, \"I've never seen a Lucario before. I wonder if it's true if they use blue flames. Are they even fire-types though...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar's eye widens in shock as she nearly bounds out of the cellar opening right there and then. Her mind fumes with worry, \"Lucario pit fighter? Was Lace captured? Oh no, they're making him fight... I have to hurry!\" The Luxray was prepared to crawl back down, but something in her heart stops her. She leers back at the Girafarig as he was still unaware of her presence. As much as the cat wanted to stick to the plan, the giraffe clearly knew something was up, and she wants answers. Perhaps she could save Lace...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising up from the floor-door, the feline quietly steps one hindpaw in front of the other, rolling her fingers in preparation to catch and interrogate the equine. With his back still facing her, she was a mere few meters away, ready to strike. But all of a sudden, Star is met with another pair of eyes and a mouth. The Girafarig's tail lifts up, revealing a round head with a face staring right back at her, having been tucked under the stool and snoozing. Star freezes in place, completely forgetting about Girafarig's tails being somewhat sentient and stares right back at it. She preyed it couldn't speak, and she'd be right about that. However, it begins snapping its teeth to alert the giraffe to glance over his shoulder. \"Huh? What are you hungry back there? I just- Whoa, what in the fuck?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giraffe rises up and twists around to face the Luxray intruder, noting that she definitely wasn't any of the pleasure girls at the mill. He reiterates, \"Who the fuck are you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar retaliates immediately without a word, sending out a thunderbolt at the Girafarig. However, the giraffe was impressively quick to summon out a panicked Light Screen, forming a glass-like panel before him that splits the electrical attack into several shocking lines that strike random parts of the room. The Luxray huffs in return and retorts, \"I'm the woman you need to give some answers to, that's who. What was that about a Lucario?\" She demands out of him, crackling her mane and arms in a readied pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giraffe pinches his brows in confusion. \"You're with him?\" The psychic Pokemon then readies himself as well. He adds, \"Then you're too late cyclops, he's probably getting his ass drilled right now or stewing in some infected gut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar's fur bristles wildly as she surges another blast of volts right at him. The shocks pound at his magical barrier until it shatters apart and he's electrocuted where he stands. She snarls as she keeps up the pressure with her hands out, \"Where's this arena? Where are you keeping him?!\" The Girafarig grits his flat teeth together with fists tightening to resist the shocks before having his eyes glow. In a kinetic blast, all of the stools, table, and crates near him fly back as he unleashes a psychic blast from his mind, forcing Star backwards as well. \"Hnhk!\" She snarls when landing on all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pants aloud to twitch his muscles and endure his shocked muscles, mostly using his mind in his advantage for the battle. \"You're not gonna find out. Unless I decide to toss you in there myself. You came from the tunnels, didn't you? How about you answer this then, freakshow. What happened to Credel and Tank?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your two lizard pals?\" Star rhetorically asks when rising up, \"Fried 'em.\" She then charges forward to attack the giraffe.</span></div></div>",

The Girafarig sneers to see the Luxray making a mad dash straight towards him. \"You serious? Big mistake pussy cat. You're not gonna land a single hit on me.\" The giraffe states as he uses his psychic abilities to launch the debris levitated around him at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar keeps her focus ahead at the psychic, refusing to falter or change direction. Around her body, electricity builds in loud crackles, all until her fur erupts with voltage in a single line of glimmering light. The volts surround her body as she rockets towards the Girafarig like an electric meteorite. Wooden stools and boxes sling towards her, yet Star's body erupts with lightning to strike any projectile that gets near her, bursting it apart. The giraffe grunts in surprise. No matter what he threw at her, it all just exploded into burning woodchips before they could even collide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?!\" He growls in distress, and with Star's speed, was right in front of him. Quickly, he summons another Light Screen in hopes to deflect her lightning, but with her physical body tackling against it, the psychic barrier smashes apart like glass, leaving one brightly lit Luxray smashing against the giraffe. \"Grhaghk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Girafarig is carried with her as she keeps charging forward, electrocuted along the way with his body pinned against her. \"Gggggghkhh-kakaka-gkghkrr-kakhk!\" He shakes wildly against her as Star actually barrels him back into the open cellar doorway, crashing into the staircase back into the tunnel she had been in. Her body begins to dissipate its voltage, but not before erupting one final strong blast that sends her onto the ground, but the giraffe spiraling away in a smokey trail. He slams the dirt and rolls repeatedly along the floor until he comes to a shuddering halt, left on his back to cringe and spasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar heaves to catch her breath before staggering up to a stand. Gripping her fists, she angrily trudges towards the Girafarig on the ground to tower over his stunned figure; his face of complete shock. With the amount of voltage in his system, the psychic could no longer focus his mind to use his powers which left him completely vulnerable to the rather pissed off cat casting her shadow on him. Sparks tingle off her mane as she glares down at him. \"Where is Lace?\" She snarls with pauses between each word to truly stress her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bandits sputters to answer as his whole figure shakes, including his jaw and lips, \"Wh-Wh-Wha...who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar stomps a hindpaw onto his chest and sends a bolt right through his chest, shocking his heart and lungs. \"The Lucario!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Girafarig shrinks at the eyes and convulses at his back, roaring in pain before shuddering back into a pitiful state, \"H-Hhgahh, i-in the Pit. The m-middle of the mill. D-Damien has prisoners thrown in there and fight to the death with the infected we've caught, y-your friend's probably gone by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar twists the paw and growls, \"Lace isn't foolish or weak enough to lose to some random pet feral you have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giraffe grunts amidst the zaps, \"M-Maybe not one, but Damien just keeps making them fight one after the other. He doesn't let anyone leave alive. Even if it means k-killing them himself.\" Star's eye narrows in rage, nearly taking it out all on the giraffe before she roars aloud. With an electric paw, she stomps down on the giraffe's head and electrocutes him directly into his mind, sending his limbs wobbling wildly. \"GggGggYyHHAaaAkk--kkhH!\" The Girafarig spasms in place until she kicks off from him to huff, getting it out of her system before looking back at her actions. The psychic Pokemon was left steaming from his body, left wheezing and dazed like the two other bandits before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luxray scoffs at his survival, but chooses to let it be that way. She glances at the wrecked stairs to climb with the idea to go save Lace herself, but she remembers his words clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Don't be afraid to set off the kegs. Hex and I will be expecting it, so the sooner they go off, the better.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar sighs and endures the desire to go hunt for her friend. \"You better be right about this you stubborn pooch.\" She mutters aloud to herself before turning around and gripping the Girafarig by the leg, dragging him along the ground as she moves through the tunnel with him. She would meet up with Bayne at the end of it to roll out the last of the kegs to keep the plan in motion. She just prayed Lace was keeping up with his end and surviving the Pit...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Luckily she wasn't the only one hauling it. Right beside her was the Sceptile, Bayne, doing the same and laddering his hands over it to keep the keg going. Upon reaching the end, the two stress the barrel over to slump onto one of its lidded ends, leaving it to set still. Star catches her breath and tries to wipe the blastpowder off her hands, but her fur certainly had patches of the stuff coated on her, with visible soot stains on Bayne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBayne happily claps across his hands for a job well done and states, \"There, that's the last one.\" He smiles over to the Luxray and even bows his head at her some, \"Thank you for the work you've done. It was wise of you to clear the guards out before this. It gave my people a chance to get out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar wipes the sweat of her forehead off and replies, \"No problem. Let's just get out of here ourselves before any more of them show up. How are the ones I stunned?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised you gave them that mercy all things considered. I certainly didn't expect you dragging one of them with you when you fetched for me.\" The Sceptile mentions before assuring her. \"The villagers outside have tied all three of them up, so they shouldn't be a problem. They looked like a rough bunch, I must say. That Tyranitar looked like no joke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was stupid and an asshole. He was going to down either way.\" The Luxray mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a compliment to you~\" Bayne then muses. \"You're a very strong individual Star, I'm quite envious of your strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luxray admittedly adored hearing that, visible by her sudden tail wag, but she was terrible at showing her appreciation for it. \"Uh...thanks. It's nothing though, I just got lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doubtful.\" Bayne comments in an entertained smile before turning around, deciding not to push the Luxray on the topic. \"Let us depart then. We have a mill to blow up and people to save.\" Star nods and goes to actually follow the Sceptile out, only to be interrupted by a sudden voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was that of another male, but far more sly in tone however. \"So that is what you are up to...? Tsk tsk.\" The two infiltrators twist around to look down the tunnel, but come to see no one in sight. However, Star's head glances upward to see a figure actually attached to the rocky ceiling just in front of them. Its claws were buried into the earth until it releases and drops down, landing on top of the final powder keg they had just rolled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a Heatmor. The anteater Pokemon eyes over Star as his golden claws flick of the soil on them, while his lengthy mouth idly purses about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luxray keeps a readied stance as she warns, \"Another one of you? You boy just keep coming. Do yourself a favor, but I've taken out plenty of you already. If you were smart, you'd be running for the hills far away from this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Because you managed to konk heads with three idiots and think you're brave enough to set off the kegs? I heard enough from your conversation earlier.\" The Heatmor states as he hops off the keg, landing to the ground to stand a bit a ways from the Luxray. \"Do not compare me to the likes of those morons. They were tunnel guards for a reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar huffs, \"Tunnel guard or not, I'll shock you like the rest.\" The Luxray's mane begins to spark, yet the Heatmor only muttered a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe extends a hand, wagging a golden finger-claw in disappointment while shaking his head. \"Tsk tsk. Are you as simple-minded as them? I would not advise using your prized power.\" The Heatmor states as Star then realizes her surroundings. \"One little spark is enough to ignite the blastpowder. Assuming you even survive the explosion, you will be buried alive with no one to save you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar grunts in agitation knowing he was completely right. The black powder was coated on the ground in a trail between each barrel inside the tunnel. Igniting one patch would ignite all of the others in a domino effect. \"Gnrh, that may be true, but you can't use your fire either.\" She seethes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Heatmor chuckles again. \"I do not plan on relying on it. You and I will fight fairly with only our bodies and wills to succeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How 'noble' of you.\" She scoffs in preparation to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBayne however steps next to her and worriedly touches her shoulder, \"I...don't like the looks of this. I can help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anteater laughs, \"I have no interest in fighting you, lizard. This should be between the girl and I. She was confident to take down the other bandits before, she should learn not to be so over-zealous in her triumphs. I am quite curious to see if she can outdo me.\" His claws rake together in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar looks back at Bayne, \"The guy's a creep for sure, but if it's a fair fight he wants, he'll get it. I don't want you getting harmed in the fight, cause I'm pretty sure he's right about one thing. He definitely seems more cunning than those last few thugs.\" She flings her head to gesture him away. \"Get outta here. I'll catch up when I'm done here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you certain...?\" Bayne asks with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives him another thumbs up. \"Positive. Now scram~\" The Sceptile merely glances to the Heatmor before sighing and turning around, headed back out of the tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the Sceptile was finally out of sight, the anteater gleams a small smile, \"Nice of you to spare him from the sight of when I ravage your body, miss...?\" The Heatmor trails off to get her title.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We trading names now? It's Star, you weirdo.\" She retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Star...\" He repeats to remember it. \"I am Ketch, and I will eagerly enjoy our bout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might regret saying that when every bone in your body's broken if you even so much as fantasize about 'ravaging' me.\" The Luxray suddenly dashes in to get the first strike with her own claws at the ready, taking a swipe at the Heatmor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the anteater was fast. He suddenly flips over at the side and lands against the wall of the tunnel, digging his claws in to brace himself there off the ground. Ketch laughs as a long and wiry tongue slides out from his long snout. The tendril wrings about in the air to drip with saliva. \"Starting already? You're rather eager, much more fun than any of the other trespassers I have had to deal with~\" He suddenly kicks off the wall and charges in at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar skips back as he takes several Fury Swipes to goad her into retreating, clawing the very air and splitting it with his sharp ends. \"Ngh! After tonight, I'll be the last one.\" She swings her leg to kick him away, only to feel his tongue wrap around it for a coiled grip. The cat yelps as the tendril burns hot into her fur and muscle, all before it whips her away in the tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon crashing into the ground, the Luxray flicks her head up to see Ketch chuckling to himself, wagging his finger and head again. \"Tsk tsk. Too slow. Too predictable. You'll surely be my meal if you keep making mistakes like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt angered the cat in her heart as she rises up. She'd have to come up with something creative to deal with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not only that, but his claws could prove dangerous if he allowed her to get too close. The Luxray ponders if there was a way to get the anteater to her in a moment of surprise or stunned state. If she could plant a hand flat against his head or chest, she could safely discharge a lot of voltage into him without the worry of igniting the blastpowder that could kill them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt eventually dawned on her of what to do, but she regretfully knew it was going to hurt. \"Then don't hold back. Maybe you'll learn something from me after I beat you.\" The Luxray retorts to the anteater, getting him to scoff and dance his claws again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKetch the Heatmor muses, \"Is that so~? Such confidence. Perhaps I will learn something of you, like how your figure tastes when I make you cum.\" The anteater suddenly slings out his long tongue as proof, igniting the tendril to a hot orange glow of flames to the feline. Star narrows her eye and doesn't go to dodge the attack, and instead, reaches her hand out to grasp the tongue before it can strike her. The Heatmor cocks a brow in surprise, but eventually mutters out to her, \"Foolish idiot.\" It was because the hot flames of the tongue burn into her hand as she squeezes it tight to try and die the flames down, yiping in pain and nearly letting it go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Star fights through the heat as a tear rolls down her cheek with her teeth gritting together, smiling eventually. \"Yes, you are.\" The cat states right back before enacting her plan. With the tongue acting as a leash, she violently pulls at it to completely yank the Heatmor off where he stood, slinging his body up to Star! The anteater grunts in surprise with widened eyes, watching Star rear her other fist back before it rockets in a surge of electricity to smash into his face. His long snout caves in on itself for a loud impact, all before a current of lightning blasts through his figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GGh-hHaA-HhgHhHHK!!\" Ketch roars in pain as he's flipped backwards while still flying straight forwards behind Star. His body hits the ground to wildly jitter in place before Star pivots around with a leg lifted straight up high, charging her voltage directly into the pads of her paw. In an axe-kick, the Luxray stomps down on the Heatmor's head to surge her electricity directly into his brain. Ketch's body wildly flops and throbs about on the ground, sparking with burning heat and shaking. \"RrRrhgghahahk-khhaggh-aooughk....!\" Foam begins to bubbles out from his mouth with his eyes rolling up completely white, baffled that he let such an easy mistake prove the Luxray right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar grinds her hind down until prying off, leaving the Heatmor to flop uselessly on the dirt floor. She was glad to directly electrify him away from the trail of blast powder, gifting her the advantage in the moment whereas the heat of his tongue dies down as its left sprawled on the ground out from his open lips. Steaming, the Heatmor was defeated, and Star calms down from her triumphant high. \"How's that for a lesson...?\" She mentions down at his foaming mouth before dropping herself onto her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luxray catches her breath now to glance back down the hall, seeing the stairs far away that led into the bandit camp. Her mind reflects on Lace being in danger, but his words continue to berate her into remembering their original plan. Star squeezes her fists as she begrudgingly tells herself to put faith in him. \"Stay strong Lace. And don't die. I didn't want to go through with this for this village, and maybe that's selfish of me. But I'm doing this for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising up to a staggering stand, Star grips the Heatmor's limp tongue again and drags his body behind her like a pull-rope, going back down the tunnel to ensure everyone was safe from harm and ignite the kegs soon. \"I don't even know why I'm sparing you considering you nearly got us blown up down here. But you can't learn your lesson that I beat you if you're dead. The lesson being not to underestimate me.\" Star huffs as her excuse to the unconscious Heatmor, still silently shocked herself that she managed to defeat the bandits that she did, while also disappearing into the darkness of the tunnel...</span></div></div>",

A Machoke's back flattens on the ground, with his body soaked with water, lashed with bruises, and a purple hue glowing from his face as his open mouth foams. Venom courses through his body as vine tendrils unravel from his muscled body to leave him in his poison-induced coma. The tentacles retract back inside the Roserade's bouquets as she simply walks past the downed fighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think the mayor lied to us.\" Eden mutters aloud as Gold was simply waiting by a doorway, letting the Roserade handle most of the fight beforehand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh? With what?\" Gold grunts. He didn't want to bother guessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flower woman crosses her arms and glances at the gargling Machoke on the ground. \"About the bandits. Don't you see how many of them there are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Golduck scratched at the back of his head. \"Uhhh. I don't remember the old guy givin' us any specific numbers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly, he didn't.\" Eden begins to explain, \"He left out just how many people this Damien guy had under his ranks. This is more than just any handful of villagers that skipped town. This guy's been recruiting anyone to everyone he can get that comes nearby. Save for whatever the gross slobs just see as entertainment...\" The Roserade shudders to think of the captured women here have to go through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. I'm just here to bust some girls out so you and Lace will get off my back.\" The Golduck dismisses the Roserade and continues the mission again. Eden and Gold were specifically tasked to go to the servant quarters to help free the individuals the bandits had captured. Used as dancers or waitresses, or worse, the duo had to make sure they were freed before blowing the lumber building to the sky. Despite their obvious conflicting personalities, the two were working well in tandem together, aiding in their type differences despite Eden's strength prevailing over Gold's own, without a doubt in her own mind. Gold, however, was rushing through things and refused to take the mission with any subtle stealth; head-on, he would take on the bandits, with Eden having to act as clean-up to ensure they wouldn't trigger any kind of alert amongst the majority of guards in the building. Gold then adds to his scoff, \"Wonder if they'll reward me after tonight...~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden slap of Eden's vine strikes the backside of his head, making him stumble. He yelps and immediately pivots around with clenched fists. The Roserade scowls firmly at the Golduck and retorts, \"Even when you're trying to do something good for others, it's just for disgusting self-gain. Why do you even bother following Lace and the others? I don't know why they put up with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold rubs a finger across the front of his bill in a sneering grin. \"Why I'm around? Nothin' you need to worry about. And maybe they're fine with me taggin' along cause they'd be infected chow without me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your misplaced confidence leaves much to be desired.\" The woman retorts before continuing on Gold now, taking the lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Golduck snickers as he scratches where she struck. \"And yet here we are, together. You're the one that asked to tag along with me in this part of the job, missie, so don't gripe. I'm here cause of you.\" The water-type reminds the Roserade with hands on his hips now, leaning forward as he walks confidently close beside her. \"Why are <i>you</i> tagging along, hm? You show up in a forest, see me 'n the pixie frog having a fight, and now you're a tag-along hero, out to save some backwater town. You got nothin' to gain from this with your life on the line for people ya never met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My reasons are my own.\" Eden answers back, almost immediately as she refuses to look at Gold as the pair traverse a wooden corridor in the depths of the lumber building. \"...Besides. It's the right thing to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold's brows furl in a way of dissatisfaction. \"Nuh-uh, you don't get to just say that. Lace is the big dick hero everyone adores cause he wants to find a cure. Jackal's an ass-kisser that'll do anything for his oblivious boyfriend thing and follow him to the depths of Hell if it meant getting some. I can say the same for the frog, but at least he seems to know what he's talking about.\" The Golduck began to list each of the travelers for the group, getting around to his point, \"The Luxray lost her mom or whatever and she's taggin' along to go somewhere safer then her fucked up town. You on the other hand just waltzed on in, made face with the pixie, and no we're buddies? No way sister. You don't get to criticize me and my reasons to be in the group. I've been here longer, and I got my reasons personally with Lace. You're the outsider here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEden retorts, \"Are you quite done?\" She even stops in place, now giving Gold the attention and look he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but do you need a break, hun? I know I can be a bit much.\" Gold also stops, eagerly facing the rose woman to egg her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't test me, duck. I can and will leave you in a worse state than any bandit I've ruined here tonight.\" The Roserade warns with her vines trickling out from her flowers again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinky~\" Gold muses right back before the vines strike his face once again. He stumbles a step before the tendrils easily grapple around his limbs and neck, pulling him right back over. The tendrils seize up multiple coils as they restrain his arms and legs to bend backwards, straining his back while also clogging up any airflow he once had with how tightly his throat clenches up. The vines seize his neck vicely to completely gag him, forcing him to choke on his own muscles. \"G-Gghkl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEden simply glares at him with an annoyed look, \"We have a <i>job</i> to do. Pipe down, do what I say, and we can take this <i>outside like adults</i> once we're done. Got it?\" The Golduck is unable to even answer as she chokes him harder, pulling at his muscles and forcing his gullet to garble tightly. His eyes widen while his claws flex repeatedly at nothing. \"This task requires stealth, and people's jobs are on the line. We can't get caught because-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if it was destiny working its irony, Eden glances over to see a newly opened door to the hall her and Gold were in, revealing a wide and taller figure. Large eyes stare down at her as a toothy grin was spread wide across a face. A sudden sense of cold ran through the hallway to get Eden to wince with a sharp tingle down her back. A snowy beast stood before her with incredibly large blue hands, a broad snowy figure...not to mention an absurdly fat afro of snow on its head resting atop its head. It was a Darmanitan, specifically one from a region up north in the snowy mountains to be something entirely different from its natural race. The yeti-like being simply helped confirm to Eden that Damien certainly recruited from more than just Hedgen, but it also confirmed she was in great trouble now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yeti rumbles in a rather amused tone, \"What's all this then? A stealth mission? Well you better keep it down, or else ya might get caught, little flower~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEden winces at the comment as the Darmanitan completely dwarves her in size. She quickly slings Gold away to get him out of the picture while also to prepare a defense to an inevitable attack. The yeti was too close and too fast however, leading to a giant fist slamming directly into her middle to send her flying back. The Roserade strikes the wall behind her, cracking the wood some and whining out in pain. \"H-Hhyyk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Gold crashes onto the ground farther away. He gags and struggles onto his hands and knees to catch his breath, probably deserving that for his words, but it was definitely inconvenient in his mind. The duck glares to the yeti stomping his way towards Rose before coughing out, \"Ey...chhk, this is between me 'n her, snowman. Swing on over, hmfhk, and I'll...take you on.\" Gold grunts to catch his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Darmanitan grins with fat snowy lips when grabbing Eden by the head and lifts her entire body off as she kicks in response. The Roserade's face was buried into the large palm, gasping for air all the same as Gold was before the yeti slings her away into the duck for the two to crash together and flop on the ground. The ice-type mocks with a fist pounding its snowy chest. \"Hah! You're in my house, punks. I don't know who y'all are, but I think I'll be takin' your girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold huffs and spits to the side to clear his mouth, steadily getting up. \"I called dibs on her. Back off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEden struggles up to a stand to catch her own breath, gritting her teeth as she debates on who to strike first. \"Gold. I'm going to eviscerate you. But this afro guy goes down first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\" The Golduck answers in response before the two ready themselves for a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snowy Darmanitan laughs as he punches at the ground, \"Y'all want to go down together? Fine by me. One's a meal and the other's a cock sleeve. Works out for me nicely...~\"</span></div></div>",

That tickles, duck!\" Viktor taunts aloud before readying up his large hands. The Golduck grunts as he was still left in a duel with the snowy yeti, with Eden by him cautiously keeping her distance from their foe. The dreadful chill of his presence and attacks could easily make her wither, dooming both her and Gold since she doubted the duck could fight him one-on-one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Darmanitan claps his hands together in a booming sound, freezing the ceiling in a frigid gust of air. The duck cockily retorts, \"Hah! At least I can hit straight; we're down here, asshole!\" Eden was weary of the attack however, watching large icicles suddenly form above Gold. Amassing a great weight, the basins begin to crack. The Roserade's eyes widen before she quickly dashes from the spot, whipping out a vine to wrap around his ankle. The Golduck is immediately forced to hit his back on the floor before getting dragged with the running Roserade. \"Wah--?!\" He quacks in confusion just before the large icicles drop and smash down just behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEden skids to a halt and whips Gold back up to a stand. \"It's called Icicle Crash, and you should be more careful.\" She advises him before peering tot he Darmanitan who was patting his snowy gut and laughing. Eden leers before muttering over to Gold, \"I need to get that snow off his front if I'm to poison or stun him. My spores or venom have to make it through his skin for them to work. Think you can at least blast him with water square in his stupid gut?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGolduck grumbles with a hand to his aching back for the beginning of the moment before huffing, \"Just shoot him once? Psh, I can do that, easy!\" Gold readies up a torrent of water in his throat again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Roserade interjects, \"Wait, don't just blindly attack him, he'll shield himself again. How about you try distracting him to look up first, and then go for his middle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold groans to all of the commands, but he does inevitably blast out some water. However, it was in the form of a Bubble Beam, sending the array of soapy orbs to flutter above the Darminatan. The yeti mocks Gold, \"Hah, are these supposed to be as strong as my icicles? Tiny duck head means tiny duck brain~\" The Darmanitan even reaches up to jab a bubble with a finger to make it pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Golduck holds back his initial desire to retort and obliges Eden with her plan. The Roserade goes on ahead to rush towards the yeti as Gold ruptures a fast beam of water again from his open beak. The high pressure strikes the Darminitan right at his gut, blasting him to stumble backward some. \"Rrgh?!\" Viktor grunts as the blue of his flesh is revealed at his gut. Eden readies several vines, latching her stun spores on their outer edges while toxic venom builds at their tips. In a panic, Viktor shoots an ice beam out from his lips, but it was in a sloppy direction during his stumble. Eden kicks off the ground to rebound off the hallway wall to dodge the ray of frost, whipping out her vines to strike the yeti's middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViktor roars out from the smack to his gut when Eden lands, with the Roserade following up with several more lashes, striking Viktor, again and again, to rake her poison and spores to his stomach. The yeti's eyes go wide as the stinging enters through his veins and his breaths become harder to muster with his front going numb. \"Gghr...d-damn weed, Viktor will have his victory!\" The Darmanitan growls when stumbling forward to conceal most of the hallway width. Eden winces and attempts to jump over his arms, but his large hands catch her by a leg to slam her back right onto the ground. She coughs after the hit, realizing she's towered over by the hefty yeti as he bears his fists together above himself. \"Die flower!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Roserade can't react quickly enough to move away from the descending swing. Expecting a brutal impact, she does at least hear it, but all she feels is the splash of water. Gold blasts against the Darmanitan's face with a headbutt as an aqua jet of water blasts behind him. The powerful launch smashes the yeti rolling away before crashing through a wooden wall with Gold landing in front of Eden. He huffs and puffs as water drips off of his body, ensuring the Darmanitan was staying down. Viktor's body was completely flopped out with his eyes white and his mouth hanging open. Gold takes that as a win and flexes the lean muscle of his arms, puffing his flat chest, \"That's right, get some! Victory schmictory, you overgrown snowman, this 'tiny-brained' duck just kicked your cold ass...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEden watches the duck from the floor with elbows propping her back up. She catches her breath as well before huffing, \"...Only after you did what I told you to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold pivots around, rubbing a finger at the front of his beak with a hand on his hip, \"Psh, I could'a thought of all that, sister. I just wanted to make you feel like you contributed~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a terrible liar.\" The Roserade huffs as she gets herself up. \"And don't call me that. In no way would I ever want to be related to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe muses with a smug grin and a look of intrigue to Eden's figure now that it was glistening wet. And yet, he holds back from commenting on it, and shrugs his arms up, \"Fair enough~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEden glares at him before proceeding by past him, \"You're impossible to deal with.\" The flower woman ensures no one was in the hallway with them, and warns, \"Still, we need to get going and find those girls fast. I'm sure someone at least heard all of that commotion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we split and check each of these rooms?\" The duck asks, counting each of the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you certain you won't need my help if you get into trouble?\" Eden asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold flashes a sneering look, \"You sure you won't need mine~?\" The Roserade huffs at his response and gives him her answer by turning away and walking down the rest of the length of the hall. The Golduck watches her go and turns to a few doors that line a separate wall. Everything looked unmarked so it was hard to tell how the guards knew where to go without just memory. There had to be something of a signifier to tell where the enslaved captives were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold traces his hand along the wall, unsure of which door to open which could lead right into an enemy, and he'd rather not pick a fight again if it was going to be more than just one guard. Soon enough however, he sees a carved pair of circles on the front side of one door, deciding it was something unique for a room. He takes a hand on a handle before turning it. Upon opening it, Gold reveals...</span></div></div>",

Upon opening the door, the duck is greeted to the view of multiple naked women. However, there was a twisted nature from how they were stationed. Lined up in different stables, the females were collared and connected by leashes to waist-high bars within each wooden pin they were fenced around in; only patches of hay are laid out on the ground for their knees or bodies to be left slumped on. The Golduck swallows a weight in his throat as he looks around in the room, finding multiple pairs of eyes taking notice of him. None of the women make any comprehensible words. In fact, they just sluggishly moan or whine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold motions into the stable room with his head darting around, seeing multiple pens keeping the girls in place. Their expressions show that they're drugged, kept complacent and mind-numbed. Along the walls, there were a few kegs of a rich aroma filling the air, a type of concoction never whiffed up before. Pitchers of the wine itself were stationed at a few tables, along with bowls of the stuff in the girls' pens for them to drink up from the floor. The atmosphere was...menacing to Gold. Had he never eased his selfish desires when meeting Lace or Hex, a place like this would be a dream come true. The women were flushed in the face and drooling from between their legs, clearly aroused and insatiably so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing a weight down his throat, he begins to back up and check back out into the hall. He had to let Eden know that he found who they were looking for. However, his head darts back and forth, and the Roserade wasn't in sight. He grunts out, \"Oi, Eden?\" No answer. His bill opens up to yell her name, but he realizes that might not be a bright idea. It could easily alert some other bandit in the area of where they were. Grumbling, he just closes the door and keeps himself in the room with the drugged women. He might as well check on them and free them from their pens before a guard comes in to check on them anyway. \"Alright ladies, your one true hero has arrived to save you!\" He boasts aloud, to which he doesn't really get a response from any of them. It certainly demotivated the duck to drop his heroic act and just rub the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching the first stable pen was a Flareon woman. Having a bit of meat to her, the Golduck did his best not to stare at her figure as he opens the fence gate and approaches her. \"Hey there...uh...\" Gold mutters as the fire-type flicks her fluffy tail about slowly, all before crawling her naked figure towards him on all fours. The Golduck mutters, \"Dunno if you can really hear me, but I'm gonna get that leash off of ya. I got a bunch of lackies with me and we're here to rescue y-\" The duck halts his explanation to feel the woman kiss at his stomach. His thighs wobble once and his arms flex up some. \"E-Ehh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drug-induced Flareon moans as her mouth pecks affectionately to Gold's belly, working her way down in between his legs. His thighs clamp up together and his hands squeeze onto her head. \"Ah! Ah, ah, ah, nope! Stop! None of that right now!\" The duck has to huff with a blush, confusing the sleepy-looking Flareon. He nudges her face away from his groin before he gets too excited. \"Jeez lady, what'd they do to you to make you so thirsty? I just said I'm here to let you out, not to get sucked off...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold however mutters under his breath that he'd enjoy that. Still, he had a task at hand and he unclips the Flareon from the bar she was leashed inside to within the stable pen. Gold retreats slowly and goes to another pen to do the same, finding a Leavanny woman in the same predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he motions past the moaning bug, he yammers on to himself, \"How am I gonna get any of these girls out of here? Any dude in the mill's just gonna see me with like ten leashed women stumbling behind me if I get them to follow me to the exit. And hell if I'm gonna walk them like pets... Eden wouldn't let me hear the end of it. Guh, I can hear her cranky tone in my head already. She needs to hurry her sweet green ass in here. Why am I the one pitching in the most effort on this dumb mission? I should give Lace a taste of my mind. None of this shit has anything to do with stopping the cocksucker that started this infection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndoing the clip and freeing the Leavanny, she just remains on her knees, confusedly looking at the Golduck she thought was going to walk her up to the rec area. The duck just keeps going to another pen. \"Hell if anything, that Lucario owes <i>me</i>! It's his fault he busted my precious gemstone, and I could'a swallowed his stupid wide-hipped ass down my gullet when he had the audacity to come back to my lake. What a punk, wrapping me up in this mess. I'm surrounded by horny women that want to get me off, and yet I have to be some kind of celibate babysitter for 'em. I'm gonna kick that dog's ass after this mess.\" Gold finishes unclipping an Ekans naga from her own leash and begins to walk out of the open fence of her pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he's stopped by the Flareon and Leavanny standing in his way. The women stare down at his shorter body, huffing idly with drooling slits. \"Wh-Wha...?\" The duck mutters as their bare breasts are at his eye-level, and their lack of personal space nearly bump into him as they step closer to him. The Flareon's hands reach out and touch at his body, stroking her nimble fingers around at his blue skin. It gets the Golduck to twitch his cheek in an awkward open smile as his eyes worried dart between the two women. \"Ehhh, heh heh, maybe I wasn't clear enough the first time ladies, I ain't here to fool around, I...\" The Leavanny eases herself onto her knees with her arms wrapping around to Gold's side, pulling herself into him in a cuddling embrace and murring right by his head. \"I...uhh...\" He trails off in an aroused stammer now that the Flareon lowers herself into Gold, squishing her warm furry breasts against his chest. The immense heat baking off from the eeveelution was overwhelming that made Gold's genitals thrum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA purple and gold tail even wraps around at his legs some, with the Ekans naga murring with delight as her tail gently squeezes at the duck. Her front rides up his back to sandwich Gold's head between her breasts, leaving him completely surrounded by aroused females thinking they needed to pleasure him. After being trapped and drugged for so long within the lumber mill's walls, any man down here clearly only needed a good time before the next one. Gold's beak stutters in place as nervous beads of sweat run down his intensely blushing face. It was impossibly painful for him to resist his urges right now. \"G-Girls, girls, please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ekans' fingers trace around at his belly from behind as the Flareon kisses at the end of his beak bill, and the Leavanny licks along his neck, delivering soft lovebites in between the gliding strokes of her tongue. Gold feels like melted butter now. It got his heart thumping hard and his knees shaking. \"A-Aaouh, you girls must not have had such a sweet guy like me in a good while. I ain't rough like these other punks here, I know how to treat you lasses right...~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shakes his head however as he fights his internal plight. Should he resist them and focus on freeing the others? Or...perhaps he could have just a quick session with these three and get right back to it? No guards to stop him, no Eden to whip and yell at him. It was such a tempting opportunity. Gold's dream of having an orgy with nothing but cock-hungry women demanding his pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to make a call now or never.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Keh?\" A male voice grunts out the moment Gold bonks directly into a purple wall of short fur. Stumbling back in place, the duck shakes his head to the view of a much taller Noivern completely overlooking him. The bat stood in the doorframe that blocked Gold from ever entering, leaving the duck to gnash his bill into a scowl with a fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ey, watch it!\" The Golduck snipes at the bat with his usual touted anger. He stomps his short leg and faces up at the guard despite the height difference. It didn't even occur to him that he had to remain inconspicuous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Noivern glares down at him and huffs aloud, \"I should watch it? You're the asshole that swung in here.\" The bat then perks a brow up with a twitch of a large ear. \"Eh...? Who the hell are you? You're not a Fetcher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold growls right back, \"Oi, the hell you standin' behind a door for? You think everyone just knocks in here? I don't know what a fetcher is, but I ain't no dog, and I go where I please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthro Noivern's brows pinch in together some as he crosses his arms to his chest, fanning out the wings of his back. \"Fetchers wring out the girls, and this is clearly where we keep 'em. You're either drunk and lost, or you ain't one of us, and I sure as hell have never seen the likes of you before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duck winces and realizes he needed to be putting on an act here as he rubs a finger confidently to his bill, puffing out his chest. \"Huh? Oh, psshh, that's cause I'm new here. Fresh hire actually. Told there was some real hotties here that I thought I'd uh, 'get to know' if you catch my drift, heheh~\" He stretches a cocky grin to pose himself off better, but it doesn't look as though he was convincing the bat. The Fetcher guard was already suspicious of Gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a lift of at least one of those brows, the Noivern asks, \"Is that right...? Huh, didn't realize we were still gettin' new blood. You must've gotten in by talkin' with Ronnie then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeeeeaaaah, Ronnie!\" The duck flicks out some finger guns to obliterate the bat's chest with imaginary bullets. \"Good ol' Ron-boy. What a character, that guy.\" Gold keeps his confident grin going with the Noivern just staring him down. The bat didn't immediately answer but simply grins almost like that of acceptance. The Golduck didn't know what to say in the gesture, and merely scoffed a few chuckles to try and keep the mood from him going. The bat mirrors Gold and sneers aloud himself, all before the two begin audibly snickering. Then raise it up to laughter, filling up the ambient wooden hall of the lumber mill with their awkward moment. The bat especially seems to laugh the loudest, that finally hinted to the duck that perhaps the guard was exaggerating. When the two died down in their noise, Gold is left looking at the bat. The Noivern looked...triumphant, like he got away with murder. Gold ponders silently as his cocky smirk turns into a scowl. \"...There ain't no Ronnie, is there.\" Gold rhetorically asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" The Noivern answers back before punching a fist into his open palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving his cover blown, Gold readies water into his throat, \"Fuck it!\" He blasts the bat's front with an eruption of water. A large splash hits hard, but the bat's hands reach out and grip into the doorframe, clawing deep into it to stop himself from being flung back. And in that position, he swings himself forward with a wing of his curling in. By a strong swing, the wing smashes against Gold's shorter body to slam the duck against the opposite wall of the hall. The Noivern stands proudly tall, preparing blue draconic fire at his crimson claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold gags at the initial strike, feeling his back numb up from the impact as he endeavors to stand tall. He hated how almost ever other male was taller than him, let alone having this bat give him a bad time. The Noivern grunts, \"Don't know who you are or what you want, but no one gets through to Damien's girls without permission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duck snarls as he spits to the side, \"I'm their savior in shiny skin! They'll be banding with me when I drag 'em out of this rottin' shitshow you call a camp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you playin' the hero? Hate to bust your bubble birdbrain, but there's a small army here and only one o' ya.\" The Noivern mocks Gold and runs a single finger up his own abdomen, tracing the clawtip along the purple furred stomach. \"But it's only gonna take one o' me to make you into duck soup~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold's gemstone flickers angrily from his forehead as his temper was aggravated. \"Oh I'm gonna tear you up now! I ain't alone, but I don't need 'em either! This duck's gonna drown you in acids before you ever drown in my water!\" The Golduck dashes forward before blowing a stream of explosive bubbles, having them pop in loud impacts that destroy some of the wooden panels of the floor leading up to the bat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the Noivern launches up in the air, and even with a ceiling blocking a high ascent, it was enough for him to dodge the bursts of the the Bubble Beam. Flapping his wings to keep himself suspended, he screeches loudly with an ear-rattling sound, forcing Gold to stammer in place. The duck quacks in pain as the bat's disc ears and vocals shake, piercing in Gold's mind to utterly quake his awareness. Gold cups his head in pain, hearing nothing but a high-pitched ringing while his muscles felt like they were struggling to stop themselves from having a complete spasm attack right now. Distraught from the Screech move, the Noivern dives down and slashes Gold across the front with a Dragon Claw, getting him to yelp aloud in pain. \"Q-Quuuaah!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard even follows it up with a lunging kick of his taller size to slam Gold against at wall and pin his chest in against the Noivern's hindpaw. \"Hmf. Stupid taunt from an even stupider quack-for-brains.\" The Noivern releases Gold's front before kicking the duck square in the face, forcing the water-type to slump onto his rear in a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooouuaggh...qquaah...\" Gold grumbles, holding his pounding head as his eyes dart about. The Noivern's scream still left his vision to shake in place, his ears ache to hear only muffled speech, and his beak struggles to take a strong enough inhale after the previous kick. \"Ggrrah, fuckin' punk, I ain't done yet, just wait til-nngh!\" The Golduck is gripped by the shoulders and hoisted up against the wall to finally face the Noivern at eye-level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bat taunts, \"For what? Your friends? You said you weren't alone, so if this is some kind of joke of a coup, then you're dead meat, duck. Damien's gonna reward me for erasing you, and then you won't exist anymore. Just like our mutual 'friend' Ronnie, right~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGolduck grunts in anger as his webbed and clawed hands grip the bat's wrists. \"Grrhh...what'cha say? Hard to hear after your shitty singing earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Noivern laughs and licks over his lips. \"How's this closer sound...\" Gripping tight, the bat lunges Gold's head right towards his open mouth. Gold's eyes widen to see the frame of sharp teeth and glistening muscle encompass his vision before causing his eyes to pinch shut in the darkness once the tongue mashes to his face. The slimy muscle courses around at his bill to inspect the strong but smooth exterior all before a resound '<b>glllrrrkk</b>' resonates around the water-type...!</span></div></div>",

The Noivern just lodged his head face-first into his gullet, and in a deafening swallow that reached even Gold's ringing ears, he was tugged far closer in. The duck's clawed hands seize up at the bat's wrists, only to feel them smacking down against his own hips from his arms snapping to his sides for a tight pin.Gold's heart thumped. \"<i>O-Oh shit.</i>\" He thought in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather ravenously, the bat bites at his body to chomp him on inside, having every chomp pinch the sharp fangs to Gold's bare tubby skin. The duck muffledly quacks in distress from inside the throat, but the resounding swallows mute his displeasure as they're replaced with the Noivern's swallows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b>Gggglllmp, ggrrlk, shmllckp, mmnnrrhh~</b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bat eagerly dines on his catch as Gold's legs and tail thrash uselessly outside. With circling strokes, the predator courses his tongue over the duck's belly, tracing the surface of the blue tummy to really soak in the unique flavor. It was the first Golduck he's ever had, and anyone else who's had one could probably argue that they were always meant to be eaten. \"Scchlpk, ffhnk~\" The bat growls over his meal, resorting to Gold barking whatever awful curse he could within his prison of flesh. His legs and hinds even cringe in place as the ticklish nudges of the tongue make it easier for the bat to eat with Gold unable to struggle properly. The buckling legs sink into its maw, with the tail slurping right down in a single trail. With a wet squelch, the Noivern swallows the last of the infiltrator to dump directly down into his belly. \"Aaaahhhh~! Damn that hit the spot!\" The bat taunts as Gold deposits in and roundly swells out the purple gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClapping the clawed hands into together, the bat squeezes up the round dome of his gut as a steamy sigh of hot water exits his mouth. \"Hhhllhh, steamed duck. You must be stewing with anger, huh~? Makes it all the better then for me. Don't worry, you're gonna be stewing a lot harder in just a sec.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold grunts in distress as he's packed into the dark chamber, feeling the walls compress against him. Juices even flood the space to completely coat his naked body with sizzling heat, working at numbing his flesh. \"Q-Qrraah! F-Fuckin' winged rat, I'll burst you open and eat your remains...!\" The Golduck growls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bat laughs and lifts his gut, only to slosh it down in place. \"Yeah, good luck with that, batfood~\" The Noivern palms over its gut to feel Gold's weight inside of him as the stomach acids flood in deeper to reach Gold's neck. \"And just cause you're a water-type, you still need air don't ya? So let's see which last longer. Your lungs? Or your meat~? My gut will claim you either way~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold's eyes widen, realizing perhaps he did needed Eden's help after all. He bucks his legs and elbows into the walls, only to be submerged anyway. \"Ngh, no! Nononono-bblhpkh!\" Gold puffs his cheeks out as he's sunken in tingly juices that now bake at his body. His body does its best to maneuver within the clenched space, yet no matter where he toiled or rolled, stomach acids kept him dunked in as its only heats up. The best the surface had at the summit of the chamber was the bubbling foam being made from Gold's own body and air. \"B-Bbblp! Mmlhgp!\" Gold quacks in distress as the pressure hits his throat to breathe, only to let out a few bubbles out of his bill. He clenches a hand to his neck to help keep his oxygen in, and his fists slowly thumps against the stomach valve in a last ditch effort. All fruitless attempts however. \"Bblllhp! Bb-blbuuhh-bpp, qwwaallp...\" His mouth gives out, exhaling just to get an open mouthful of hot fluid now instead. Empty of air and energy, Gold finds himself weakly sagging into the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the spectrum however, the bat stretches in place with arms up and his back curving in, watching his belly distend out tightly. The gut sloshes in place from Gold's movements, but it was quite clear they were slowing down. The muffled rumbles of stomach juices sound out as Gold loses his fight. \"Mmlhm, sounds like you didn't take a big enough last breath. Oh well. You aired enough out for me moments ago, so I know there's others like you around. I think it's time to pay the boss a visit, don't ya think, stew?\" He leans and tapping a clawed finger at his domed gut, smiling down at it. Gold only muffedly gurgles the juices in his open beak, struggling to retain any air. It gets the guard to murr, \"Doubt you'll be around when I get there then, ah well~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Noivern delivers a final taunt by slapping a hand to his gut. The belly jostles about with the sagging prey inside. After that, he motions forward to leave the hallway as his belly idly bobs in place from each heavy step he takes, echoing down the rest of the way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oohh yeah...\" The Noivern murrs as he relaxes on his stool within the slaves' quarters. Several anthro women are kept collared and drugged with Happy Juice here, in which the bat was one of many 'Fetchers' that keep the captive girls in their place and dosed up to keep them complacent. When needed, Fetchers walk the women out into the lumber mill's recreational areas or bedrooms for the men to have their fun, all before being 'fetched' back to this room where each captive is leashed to individual stables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bat in particular was lounging in front of a new catch, a short Roserade woman who was found fiddling around where she didn't belong. After the failed attack of the Hedgen villagers was dealt with thanks to the Noivern's report, Damien allowed the bat to keep a few of the captured stragglers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks down to the Roserade's drugged face as she moans over his cock. Her supple green lips suckle over his shaft like it was the nectar of life for her stupefied mind, lewdly swallowing the pre soaking her mouth and flooding her gullet. He grins with a lick of his teeth, petting her white head pedals in one hand as the other palm pats at his new layer of bat fat padding his belly out. \"Friends with the duck, I take it? You chose bad company lass. He was a small brat just waiting to churn in somebody. But not you. You've found your taste in men, haven't ya~?\" The Noivern murrs as the Roserade sucks him off. She just obediently swallows at his shaft, gagging out moans of agreement without understanding a real word he said. The bat still appreciated it. \"Couldn't have said it better myself~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his legs being wide-spread, he squeezes his the limbs in together more by crossing them, locking Eden's head between his thighs and hilting his cock right at her mouth. His hand grips up her head-petals as he jerks his waist in tight bumps, burying his dick deep in her throat to feel the edge finally tip over and his orgasm hits. \"Aaahh...~\" The Noivern pumps the flower woman with his seed, gluing the ooze all within her throat, making her struggle to swallow it all down at once. The legs mash in tighter and his hand tightens. Eden's eyes roll up with a deep blush baking from her drugged face. The cock and grip release from her, leaving her sagging her head back with cum splurting from over her bottom lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Uhhpll, glhhuhh...\" The Roserade moans as the bat rises up off the stool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl, let's get you reigned back in for the night. I think you're gonna fit right in at home here~\" The Noivern fetcher rumbles in bliss, wiping the moaning woman's face with his squirting shaft to help clean his cock off of her saliva and his jizz. Taking a leash, he clips it to Eden's collar and tugs to it to get the woman on her arms and knees. Walking with another pull, he guides the Roserade slave on over to her personal stable, right between other moaning women to be clipped against a bar before the bat closes the short wooden gate. \"See ya tomorrow, tuts~\" The Noivern chuckles before leaving the room to change shifts. He scratches at his purple abdomen, liking the new cushion the Golduck added...~</i></span></div></div>",

Gold was more likely to endure any icy attack the Darmanitan had to throw at them, but Eden would suffer greatly at any major contact with the being. The duck fires off several jet blasts of water to pelt the yeti, causing him to stumble in place some as they strike his broad belly. But the water merely freezes into spurts of snow after making contact, hardly achieving much then to delay Darmanitan's approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEden lashes out her vines hopes to poison the being if that could at least slow him down, but the ends of her vines begin to wilt at the frigid temperature of his body. Swiping against nothing but the thick layer of snow snug to the Darmanitan's body, the venom couldn't reach to his actual body inside. The yeti lets out a loud laugh before slapping loudly against his belly, wobbling the snowy gut in place. \"Hahahahahhh! Are you two trying to tickle me? I'll teach a lesson of when you try to break out the girls I catch~\" The Darmanitan mocks them with his wobbling snow afro and fat, grinning lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold bears his fists in anger, but Eden catches wind of what the Darmanitan was preparing. In his laugh, he would inhale greatly, building up air pressure inside of his body before pursing his big lips together, fuming out a freezing gust of wind at the pair of heroes. The terribly cold air froze the wooden planks and wall it came into contact with as clouds of snowflakes whisk by. Gold bears up an arm in front of his face to shield the cold air and takes the damage head-on. His sleek figure shudders down onto a knee as his skin felt like it was cold enough to be on fire, but Eden took it the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Ky-Kyyaa-aaa-aah...!\" The Roserade is blown back off the ground before crashing onto the ground. Her body suffers from the intense cold the wilts some of her flowers, leaves, and petals, freezing her in patches of icy mist. Her figure writhes on the ground as she aims to move or run, but her body couldn't manage it under the intense cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Darmanitan laughs again after ceasing his attack. \"Guhhahah! They don't call me Viktor for nothing!\" The yeti pounds a fist to his chest with that same one-sided grin that annoyed Gold a great deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Golduck scowls to Viktor and charges at the yeti with mental energy building towards his own forehead. \"That's it snowball! I'm gonna cave in those stupid lips of yours!\" He snarls aloud as he has to make his way down the entire frigid hallway. \"Wh-Wha!\" The duck however steps onto patches of snowy ice causing him to slip about as he skids forward. His arms attempt to regain balance and his energy dials down from his noggin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the Darmanitan had his own attack at the ready. \"Head-on? You and me? Very well, duck!\" He chuckles with a toothy grin rearing his head back as Gold slides his way right in front of the Darmanitan. The Golduck realizes his mistake by the time his talons can park himself to a stop as the yeti goes in for the headbutt. Gold rears his head to try and fight back against the same attack with a zen headbutt, but the stronger foe in this case was clear. A sharp kinetic blast ruptures upon contact, all before completely snuffing out with the audible smush of snow. The yeti lifts his head back up to see that Gold was no longer in front of him. \"Eh...?\" Viktor dumbly looks around to see no sign of the aquatic bird before a muffled yell alerts him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yeti goes cross-eyed when looking up, seeing Gold's legs kick stupidly about with half the duck's body submerged in the large snowball afro. The Golduck growls and grunts in embarrassed fury, lodged firmly inside the snowy orb to be unable to budge. Viktor mocks his enemy, \"Hah! Did you think my snow was soft? We Darmanitan take pride in our snow. Weak snow means a weak warrior!\" The Darmanitan grabs a hold of one of Gold's legs before prying him out with a forceful swing, slamming Gold's back onto the ground in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Golduck gags at the sudden pressure, knocking the wind out of his beak, but not before he was dangled upside down in front of the yeti's lips. Viktor pries his big mouth open, taking a sudden lick across Gold's face and front with an obese tongue, smothering a glaze of frigid drool along the way. Gold shudders wildly at the sudden coldness, kicking his free leg uselessly as his hands scramble downwards, unable to grab the floorboards. \"Silly duck. Don't you realize your kind are prepped as holiday meals for a reason here? Although I think you're scrumptious any time of year~\" The Darmanitan taunts before opening his maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold's eyes shrink as he flails his shivering body all the more wildly, \"O-Oh h-h-h-hell n-n-no...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly several sharp leaves jab into Viktor's snowy front, causing the yeti to pause and simply glance past Gold. Eden stands defiantly in the hallway with a huffing breath and trembling legs, enduring the cold with her flower bouquets out. \"Drop the duck.\" She demands with a clear look of vengeance in her eyes. Viktor smiles and starts to stomp towards her, not saying anything and refusing to drop. Eden swallows a weight in her throat before spraying stun spores out from her flowers. It was a long shot, but she had to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt failed. The spores merely cling to the yeti's snow-covered body before withering away at the cold, unable to reach his skin. Eden's world comes crumbling down knowing she failed the mission and was going to suffer an ill-fate she aimed to stop. The Darmanitan's large blue hand swings by to snatch her small body as well, dangling her up with Gold in a vice grip in each of Viktor's hands. She yipes at the pressure before he seizes both of them tightly in separate palms, stressing their spines and muscles in a tight crush. \"A-Aagghk! H--Hhhk!\" Eden cries out as her body spasms to even the cold touch of the yeti's flesh. Gold quacks in pain to suffer the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViktor laughs which bobs his snow afro again, glancing between the two. \"Ooohohoh! What a treat! Two in one go. Damien will be pleased I caught some sneaky little thieves, and such an attractive one to boot~\" The Darmanitan refers to Eden, taking a greedy lick across her bare front as well to make her gasp loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Grrhk, put me down you stupid snowy ape freak...!\" The duck snarls, \"I'll kick your stupid puffy ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? Please, show Viktor what you can do...lunch~\" The Darmanitan sneers before dangling Gold specifically over his open mouth again, striking Gold to quack about in distress. Obliged, the yeti drops Gold down into pried maw before the yeti clenches his teeth together, snagging Gold's bare body inside. The flat teeth chomp together to smash in at Gold's back and belly, forcing the duck to quack and wince in force each time. Not only that, but the Darmanitan even began to chew his food with several ice fang bites. The teeth chill in a frigidness Gold didn't think possible as they come to pincer in together and bruise his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Ggmphkh! Mmphk! Nhkpmnph!\" Gold yells muffled as he's completely stored inside the yeti's mouth, squished from bulging cheek to cheek, one side to the other in alternating chews. Eden shivers in place as she could only watch, mostly <i>listen</i> as the companion she had issues with is made into food. Not even Eden thought Gold deserved that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the yeti chuckles over his swabbed up and chewed about food to open his mouth again, revealing Gold's lower half slumped on the Darmanitan's fat tongue. The upper body was lodged inside the gullet, groaning and shivering in the freezing saliva withering his muscle movement to puny levels. It was to show the Roserade her friend's final time outside before the tongue curls up, and Gold's legs and tail submerge completely into the hungry throat. <i>'GLRK~'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEden shudders. The Golduck is dispensed into the yeti's stomach, disappearing into the already round snowy belly that rumbles upon the presence of meat within the chamber. A frozen hell to chill anyone into fading sleep. Viktor murrs with Eden now dangling before his eyes. \"Mmrrnnhh...ducks are so yummy. How about you? Will you be the herb on top, or do you want to stick around and meet the other girls...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis big snowy lips pucker up to smother her face and head in them, stinging her face with the cold, but also slathering her in a wet kiss. Frigid drool coats her face, causing her to muffledly whine loudly into his mouth. \"N-Nnn-nNn-Nmph! M-Mmppphblblpk...\" The yeti pops her head free with a slinging arc of his saliva trickling off her face, leaving her with a pale, cold expression and wilted white petals of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rrrrnh, you're good on the tongue. Let's see you repay the favor to Viktor though~\" The Darmanitan taunts before swinging her upside down to expose her slit. Eden whines, but knew she was a useless weed at this point. A fat-lipped snowy kiss squishes between her legs before popping free, slickening her green nethers. The yeti strokes a large finger across the cold lips, all before dipping inside and digging firmly in to bulge her tummy. Eden wordlessly cries out, suffering the massive finger to hook and probe about inside...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>With Lace's quest a complete failure, Viktor enjoys his R&amp;R time seated at a couch with a withered Roserade on her knees, bound in rope and muffledly gagging with the amount of cockmeat lodged in her mouth. The yeti's heavy blue erection throbs as the bell-end of it already fills Eden's mouth entirely. Dried tears stain her wide cheeks with her eyes rolled up and completely white. \"G-Glhpph...mpklb.\" She swallows uselessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need help, flower~?\" Viktor taunts, smothering her head in his big hand before cramming his cock into his new toy to swallow half his cock inside, locking her jaw, choking her throat, and burying into her belly. The small Roserade suffers from the cold of the cock, and would until she was broken. \"Suck. Or be pudge like the duck~\" He murrs with a pat to his fat snowy belly.</i></div></span></div></div>",

If she could extinguish them, it would give her an advantage over the Heatmor. Being a feline, her vision in the dark would be greater than his. Ketch brandishes his golden claws about again as he mocks, \"There is no escape. You will lose here, my dear.\" Right there and then, the Heatmor charges in for another flurry of swipes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar bounds to the side however to completely evade the anteater, refusing to attack back for the time being and would instead use her tail to smack off one of the torches. The tail catches it before it hits the ground and jabs it into the dirt wall of the tunnel, snuffing out the light to already darken the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKetch actually pauses in his assault to witness the Luxray's action. He cocks a brow up as he murrs, \"Oh? Taking the lights out, are we? Well Star, don't let me stop you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...?\" The Luxray states, having already swiped out another torch and creating a dense amount of shadows to blanket herself in some pitch darkness. It worried Star of what he said, but what's done is done. She was now comfortably concealed as the Heatmor simply walks forward with his head lifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what Star could see, he was listening out for her, but he was also extending his tongue to lick at the air. She couldn't tell what he was doing, but his middle was completely exposed. Carefully, she stalks in close and readies a clawed hand, moving in to close the gap between her foe. However, he suddenly smiles. \"There you are...\" His tongue suddenly ignites with intense heat, illuminating a short distance in front of him, but it was enough to expose the cat to his eyes. Star widens her eye, only to howl as the hot tongue whips around and catches her by the legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seering hot muscle wraps around the legs to completely bind them together, sending Star to the ground with a thud before the tongue drags her closer to him. \"Gh-hyah! F-Fuck! How in the-?!\" She seethes out with anger and confusion, but the anteater simply does his typical gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk tsk.\" He wags his finger at her again. \"Heatmor tongues are awfully sensitive, don't you know? I can taste the very air around you, picking up your scent. A detail you overlooked, which sadly has ended our little game here. A shame. You went down rather quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar swings her hips and stresses her legs, angrily wanting to use her electricity, but she was wallowing in blastpowder. One spark could makes things only worse. \"L-Let go of me you bastard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tongue suddenly sizzles and glows hot, making her yipe once more. \"Silence, food.\" He reprimands when glaring down upon her. He no longer had the respect for her to call her by name. Upon losing the match, she was a goner now. \"Your time is up and your mission has failed. You lost your chance.\" He berates her with cold, hard words. His tongue retracts back into his mouth some, tugging her hindpaws right inside his mouth. Star winces in place at the heat of his long, narrow mouth sealing together over her calves, with the coil of the tongue immediately slipping them into his gullet for an audible swallow. \"Gllrk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hh, hghh, you can't be serious! Not to the likes of you.\" She exclaims while jamming both of her legs in unison as a kick. However that only deepens her limbs into his throat as his claws clap together at her hips to aid in dragging her inside. His mouth bulges out at the side when feeding over her, coursing his hot tongue around to knead through her fur and elicit shudders from the legs. \"Rnghk! B-Bayne! Bayne?!\" Star calls out for the Sceptile, but he had followed her orders long before the fight and retreated out of sight and sound. Star was alone to save herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Heatmor chuckles over her legs and swallows again for a jerking pull. With his claws on her, Ketch gropes into her hips and squeezes around to her ass, mashing the cheeks between the golden ends. Star's back spasms on the sudden grope, howling at the air in dismay. Ketch idly rolls her asscheeks around for his claws to really pinch into, kneading them in circles, prying them apart and smushing them against one another as he eagerly ingests her thighs. Upon reaching her waist, the claws work up to then grip her blue tits as her hips submerge down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Aah! Ahnhnh, h-hands...off...!\" She growls to shimmy her torso, but it merely bobs the breasts in his hands as the claws test their resilience. The mounds to squashed about in alternating motions, having no clear pattern or care as the claws smear about. It causes Star's body to converge and pulsate as a reflex, but the heat of his maw was also getting to her. \"Ghahgh! T-Too....h-hhooot!\" She whines out as a plead, yet Ketch would not show mercy. His mouth swallows in more, dragging her back, head, and arms along the ground to sink her deep. If she thought his mouth was burning hot, she'd have to witness the boiling stomach to be proven what was going to be worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fiery anteater slings her off the ground and bite her inside, wrapping his tongue around at her head to drag it in, silencing a scream of hers halfway through. \"AaA-AaAAhHHH----! M-MnNmPHHk! HhhHMPHK!!\" Her body bulges his mouth wildly, but the cheeks chew down and the tongue slurps up the last extent of her arms. Her hands visibly cringe outside from her legs dipping into the furnace-like stomach, attempting to grab anything she could to halt her death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing could save her though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKetch pokes a gold finger-claw to tuck the struggling hands between his lips before gulping the last of her down. \"Sscckklllllrrrrppp~\" The Heatmor closes his eyes and feels a hand down along his throat, tracing the Luxray's path as her entire figure finally collects together into his belly, bloating out his red and yellow front. The claws grope over his now distended belly to smear around the hefty dome. \"Mmmnnhh...simply delightful. So much for your little rebellion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Heatmor pats his belly casually, but Star was having a vastly rougher time. Intense heat bakes from the squelching walls packing in around her. Bubbling acids boiling hot eating away at her fur. \"G-Ghaahh! H-Hhaauuhn-ngh, h-hhheeelp! Help!\" She pleads and jams at the walls, making the stomach only slosh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKetch murrs to hear her from within his muffling walls, groping around at his prey. \"Shhhh, shh, shh, shh...none to worry. My stomach will burn through you quickly. Just give it a moment, and you'll be fat soon enough.\" His golden claws drum along the taut surface as he listens within the tunnel. Star's garbled cries soon turning into bubbly screams, then whining gags, only to dissipate in a matter of minutes. The hot juices seer inside and the stomach churns loudly in a nutritious rumble. The Heatmor grins and gives his front a sloshy grope. \"See? All done~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the anteater trudges onward in the tunnel with a bounce to his step, digesting the meaty cat soup within his middle as he hangs his tongue out from his mouth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A pair of Sceptile legs thrash about in distress outside of Ketch's mouth, swinging the tail about and showing off hot burn marks lashed across his green hide. The grass reptile had been caught up to by the Heatmor, and after enough hot lashes of that whip-like tongue, Bayne was as good as dead as Star was. \"G-GhhMphk!!\" The Sceptile cries out inside until the long snout swallows the left of the lizard down in a heavy swallow, burying Bayne into the hot furnace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKetch sighs out a smokey stream from his mouth to cup his belly again, squeezing it in on the yelling villager within his walls. \"Mmmnhhh, two delightful meals in one night. You Hedgen-folk should try to stop us more often if I can eat this well. Do not fret, Sceptile. Your kind cannot last long within me~\" The Heatmor bandit's words ring true as the hefty lizard is torched and melted faster than the Luxray before, squashing audible churns of digestion until there would be nothing left of him to cry out anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anteater kneads his front and licks around happily at the air, knowing there was going to be plenty of more intruders to deal with, and Damien would have to be informed...</i></span></div></div>",

She may not be able to use her electric abilities externally, but a sinking bite directly at her foe's neck could do the trick. The fire-type gleams at her with a look in his eye before suddenly jabbing a clawed hand into the dirt before slinging it forward, swinging a plow of dirt right at her face. It blinds the Luxray for only a moment to grunt and stagger in her step, but it was enough of a moment for him to punish her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hot, stinging whip lashes out to lash across her leg which sends the Luxray to tumble over. \"Gyah!\" Hitting the dirt, she feels her body dragged right towards him to stand before her, keeping his tongue snug at her leg to seer with heat. Star cries out and tries to kick it away, only for a clawed hand of his to catch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tongue retracts from the limb now, but Ketch keeps a firm hold of it as he shakes his head, \"Tsk tsk. You're coated with patches of that powder. Get too close, I'll ignite it with my tongue alone. It won't be enough to combust, but you'll still be burned by it.\" The Heatmor's tongue then laps across her abdomen to taste along the blue fur of her front before flicking over a breast, coiling it up in a tugging squeeze of her nipple. The act gets her back arching and her body scrambling up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe denies her the chance of escape by using his free hand to claw right across her side. Star howls and crashes back on the dirt before he stomps her firmly in the stomach. She gags as the sole twists into her flat abdomen, hurting her down to the back and makes her cringe in place. \"All that speed, and you do not know how to even use it. You rely on your power too much. You boast of confidence, but the moment a weakness of yours is punished, you become helpless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar growls in anger, \"Y-You don't know anything about me!\" Her rage was getting the best of her as she naturally crackles electricity along her fur, only to have the powder in her fur ignite briefly for a seering burn. The voltage ceases in response as Star winces from afflicting herself in the pain. \"Ahgnhh...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you see now? You act on impulse without thinking, leading to your own downfall.\" The Heatmor bluntly scolds her, whipping his tongue to slap across her face. The cat is slung onto her side in the sudden motion, feeling the hot burn along her cheek before his legs shoves her right onto her back once more. The tongue returns to her chest for another curling motion to coil it up, mashing the tit and circling the tip along her nipple's edge. \"When you stop, wait, and calculate beforehand, you may be surprised at what you can react to and take advantage of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKetch straddles himself down on top of Star despite her protests and his claws slam down on her arms to keep them pinned to the dirt. The Luxray would suffer the Heatmor's weight on top of her as his leering eyes inspect her face and chest, with a clear target to attack. The tongue swirls around one breast for a coiling squeeze, puckering the nipple out for the tip of the whip to swipe across. The tongue keeps itself at a steady temperature, but Star knows he can just ignite it whenever he wants. She pants out from the sensitive touch, with blood boiling inside of her and self-shame tugging at her heart. \"A-Aaa-aaahh, you're, ngh, a monster...\" She groans out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am still the winner.\" Ketch retorts before sealing a nipple right into his mouth as the coiled tongue massages around the boob. His lips tug at her teat to coerce a sharp inhale from her mouth, only to fume it out as a whining exhale as he pops his mouth off to let the breast wobble back down, just to scoop it up with his snout again. Star's knees mash together inwardly from having the Heatmor molest her chest, repeatedly sucking a tit of hers before plucking the other one to do the same, coursing the tongue around, between, and over her breasts. His mouth salivates hot drool over their surface that is left steaming through the air. It hinted at just how hot his interior was, a place Star prayed she would be spared from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wet mouth releases her nipple to fume a mused murr directly to her trembling head, licking his lips just above her only working eye. \"Aaahh...\" He exhales. \"Yes, I think I'll enjoy my prize now.\" Just like that, he began to pivot himself around on top of her. The Luxray huffs repeatedly in thoughts of kicking herself back up, only to see the Heatmor's groin hover over her head. Ketch slams his waist down to mash her head upon the dirt again while his clawed hands grope up under her thighs; his snout even nudges itself right between them to huff at her bare slit. The tongue laps across the sensitive surface make Star howl out, raking her claws into the ground and nearly clamping her legs back together if it weren't for his claws. \"Do not resist. Or I will ignite my tongue and you will not survive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ghnh!? What are you---\" Before she could even demand an explanation, he'd give her one by suddenly plunging his lengthy tongue right inside of her. The vaginal folds spread to make way for the tendril to slither easily through, using its size to its advantage by tunneling within her body. The muscle idly scoops and swirls to explore the interior, tasting the inner walls shivering in response with wet hugs. \"H-Hhaa! K-Khhyyuuu...\" She groans out and gnashes her fangs against each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tendrils digs in deep as her inner walls begin to naturally secrete with her own pre, coating into the tongue as it mixes with his own hot saliva. Despite him keeping the temperature down, it still felt hot to the touch which drove Star's senses wild. She gasps and whines out for it to all be over, yet he was going to keep going until she inevitably submits. This was coupled with the fact that his groin lifts up to show off his now growing erection in front of her eye, all before dipping down close to her mouth. Star attempts to keep her lips sealed shut, but his tongue suddenly jams deeper inside and crams through her cervix, forcing a loud moan out of her mouth. Free now, the cock uses the moment to shove itself right into her open jaws, gagging her moan immediately. \"M-Mmmphk! Ggh-ggghmphk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cock digs through her gullet with ease as he simply lowers down, forcing it in with the help of gravity. Star's eye goes wide, only to be blinded by the Heatmor's ball sac nestling over her eyeline. \"H-Hhggmphk, mnph...\" She whines over his cock as it lifts up just to slap down again. In a sixty-nine motion, the anteater begins to thrust through her throat as his tongue plunges in her nethers to assault both ends of her body. The girl's hands claw the ground and kick at the dirt, writhing in fear, but subduing herself to not tempt the Heatmor into following through with his threat. His nuts repeatedly smack down at her face as the cock drills right on through to bulge her neck out in its pumps, spitting with intensely hot pre. Even if she swallows, the hot gunk just keeps on spitting out. It wasn't just bad enough to have lost to such a perverse bandit that wasn't even giving their fight his all, but knowing Lace may still be suffering out there. It could've been too late for Star knew, but it didn't mean it didn't hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Schlp! Schlp! Schlp! Schlp! Schlp! Schlp! Schlp! Schlp! Schlp! Schlp! Schlp! Schlp!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wet squelches sound out in a pattern from the Heatmor's thrusts, slamming his arousal deep into Star's gagged gullet. She gags at the constant pressure bearing down on her while yearning for oxygen. But Ketch wouldn't offer any. Even when his tongue buries itself into her own womb, the woman moans wildly around his cock and spasms in place to release an orgasm. Her waist jerks and squeezes over the muscle to soak it in her raining pleasure, yet the tongue doesn't lessen. Instead, his lips just seal in firmly at her cunt to wallow his mouth harder at her vaginal folds. The cat moans even louder to waste what was in her lungs already to feel the pervert's lips smother over her own lower pair. Ketch sucks away at her pussy as her mouth unwilling sucks over his cock as best she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar's view was fading, even between the times his sac flops off her face just to smack right back onto her nose and eyes. With a lack of air, her lungs were beginning to burn and the audible claps of his waist were waning into the ambient ringing of her ears. \"...n-nhhmph, rnph...\" She moans with her hands weakly tugging at his mounted legs, but he simply kicks them off. Ketch was enjoying his prize, and was close to erupting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlowing much more firmly into her gullet, the Heatmor feels his erection pulsate harder in its rise to release. His mouth mashes firmly into her pussy for a biting suckle as his cock finally erupts his molten seed into her. The cat chokes at the heavy globs of semen spurting right through her esophagus, but has no say in where else it could go. She swallows away over his cock in hopes to earn some air in its thrusts, but Ketch keeps himself hilted to her lips, denying her of air. \"G-GGggmlkph! Schllmplbbh...glmmp...\" She swallows weakly now as her world was darkening even more, her head felt light, and the pressure in her chest was becoming to much. The throat squeezes desperately for anything, but the Heatmor simply lays on her hard, forcing the girl to drift into a pained slumber...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Star's garbled voice dies down, Ketch pops his soaked lips off from her vagina and slowly sat up, dragging the length of his tongue out from her body in a droplet flicking slurp. Sealing the tendril back in, he muses, \"Aahhhh, and that will suffice as payment from you wasting my time, cat.\" He scolds her unconscious ears before thrusting his hips a few more times to watch her neck lump with his cock, hearing the gooey squelches of semen still present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he eases his rod out from her drool soaked mouth as it hangs open and scoops her body up to sling over his shoulder.</span></div></div>",

Her throat felt incredibly sore, her stomach ached from the inside with great after-heat, and her arms felt like they couldn't move as well as she was used to. As she finally comes to, she discovers she's looked at the floorboards of the mill past the length of a Heatmor's back. Jerking her head up, bandits of all different species were beginning to crowd around and follow her as she's taken away. Her body was slung onto Ketch's shoulder as he keeps a hand at her back, and another cupped to her rear. \"Huh...wh-wha...?\" She mutters aloud to catch the anteater's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally awake? Good. The other men want to see a good show.\" Ketch muses as he slaps his hand to her rear for a wobbling spank. She yelps at the gesture that bumps her forward on the shoulder some, all before jerking at her arms to resist. However, she discovers her arms are actually bound up in several rubber straps. Any endeavors to spark her hands or body resorts in the rubber nullifying it. \"Tsk tsk. You still resist? You should know when to swallow your loss, cat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar scans the area to find herself in the atrium, with several tables and chairs worth of bandits coming in together as Ketch halts. \"Gnhrgh, I-I'm not done with you yet!\" She bites back as a comment, only to be slumped off his shoulder and carressed into one of his arms for their fronts to bump together. The Heatmor gropes his golden claws into her rear as he leans his long snout in close to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pity. Because I believe I'm done with you.\" Ketch states back before clamping his mouth against her own. The Luxray tenses up at the sudden invasive gesture as his tongue swirls its front end around inside, even digging at her throat some. His other free hand grips at a breast to squeeze like it would be his last time doing so. It's because it was. After prying his maw off from her own and taking a final lick across her breast, the Heatmor then shoves her backwards. Star yelps as she falls through an opening through a dome of wooden bars; Ketch locking the doorway shut as she plummets down. Star's body hits the dirt to wheeze out by the impact, groaning aloud. Tall wooden columns of lumber form a circular 'room' as the bandits all watch together safely from above, being obvious to Star that this is what the Girafarig meant by the Pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuugghh...bastard.\" She weakly staggers back up, still feeling the afterburn of Ketch's assault and coughs at the wetness in her mouth. Suddenly, a gate at the other end of the pit begins to crane open, revealing a snarling voice and two purple eyes glaring right at her. \"Hhh, hh, sh-shit. Oh no...\" She backs up knowing she'd have a terrible time fighting against a feral without her arms or electrical attacks, but that wouldn't even by the worst of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut from the gate, two black hindpaws step out. A pair of blue-flaming hands roam at the sides of a male Lucario snarling right to the meal in front of him. It was Lace, or rather what used to be him. Star stutters in disbelief, \"N...No...\" Had she been too late? Was there anything she could've done had she even defeated the Heatmor? Could this just be another Lucario? No, Star felt it. This was her companion that had been infected earlier. Despite her own efforts, the Lucario could not last against his Raikou opponent, and he paid the price of it becoming just another slobbering animal for the infection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar stumbles backwards as the infected Lace motions forward, snapping his teeth and making her heart skip. The fallen hero would follow through with his urges by...</span></div></div>",

Star's curvaceous figure had always been a temptation, but with nothing left but a primal instinct, Lace's desires would be fulfilled tonight. The Luxray stumbles back until she bumps the logged wall behind her, trapped with the ravenous remnants of her companion. Her heart races in stress but her mind races in confusion. \"Lace...lost?\" She mutters quietly to herself in disbelief. With her arms still bound, she lacked any plan on how to get out of the situation, making the Lucario's job easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infected feral bounds forward to slam Star against the wall, hoisting her by the legs in a lift. His arms seize at her thighs as her hindpaws leave the ground, grinding her back and arms over the logged wall to be pinned between it and the purple-eyed canine snarling at her. \"Gnh! L-Lace, you don't want to do this-uah!\" She begins to plead, only to feel how much he does want to do is. His cock rides itself along the valley of her folds as a gesture to feel how ample her slit was before he'd inevitably penetrate her. What was once your body now completely disregards your companion and bucks its hips until the tip catches itself into her pussy. The cat howls up as the Lucario's length buries itself right inside without any real lead-in; inches dig through the already explored entrance thanks to the Heatmor's tongue from before, allowing the infected dog's efforts all the easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar's mouth opens agape as she shutters out a pained sound. However the feral took that as just another opening as its maw clamps down over her own to trap the cat in a forceful kiss. His tongue hungrily laps inside of her cheeks with his fangs bearing down, all during his idly thrusts to work his meat into her cunt. \"Ghmphk! L-Lyyyphhh...\" She whines into his salivating jaws as drools smothers her entire mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a firm grip under her thighs, the dog begins to rapidly hump away, cramming his length in where it could go to part her walls and jam at her cervix. The cat's eye rolls up wildly with drool squelching between their lips, moaning quite loud over the muffling tongue for the bandits above to enjoy. The male's knot slams away at her slit with swinging punches until the vaginal folds were forced to welcome it into their abode, locking her groin to his. Wet splats sound out as the knot mashes and tugs at the entrance walls, spilling over with their pre together to fuck Star into a state of helpless confusion. She saw this as a completely horrible way to go, but something dark in her mind accepted that if she had to be an infected like Bell most likely was, at least it was by Lace after his efforts to stop it all from happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts swing up and down with her body as it bounces at the Lucario's lap, with the infected's great strength to keep her supported off the ground. His jaws part from her mouth just to sink a bite over one of her swaying tits to swallow over the blue mound, growling over it. \"A---Aah...aahhngh...!\" The Luxray whimpers out, red raced and sputtering from the canine's saliva at her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally however, the dog would buck wildly as his orgasm reaches its limit, erupting his semen right through into her own womb. Star rolls her head tightly back and crackles static at her mane in response, not that it stops the Lucario ravaging her though. Hot cum floods inside with spurting shots as the infected's first victim, with Lace's body snarling over her breast when mashing it firmly inside his jaws as a brace. His hips continuously buck until the two begin sliding down. Lace hits his knees which drags Star down the wall until they were both sitting on the ground, leaving the Luxray to wince in place as the last shots of the Lucario's jizz spurt inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-Fhhuck...th-this...is it.\" Star whines within her own thoughts, only to feel the dog lock his mouth over her own again. She grunts in distress as he swirls his tongue around back inside. With his knot still lodged in her, the dog makes her lay along her back with his hands latching themselves onto each of her tits. The Lucario goes for round two as his bucks resume again to bash at her cunt, clapping his sac against her rear end while his hands rolls her breasts about in a pleasing show for his own violet eyes and for the horny bandits cheering for the Luxray's demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar moans into Lace's drooling mouth as all of the fluid and sex truly pound into her mind that she was just going to become another feral. Intense heat builds at her groin, her stomach steadily feels far more empty than it ever did, and the world above her was turning into a violet hue. Her thoughts of woes would dissipate as she accepts what she would become. The sounds of the crowd above her would deafen out as the wet growls and cum-spurting splats of Lace's thrusts would eventually take over before fading out themselves, replaced with a low ringing in Star's splayed ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last things she would see in her fleeting sanity was up through the dome cage would be of her captor. Ketch the Heatmor was staring down at her, wagging his finger and shaking his head in disappointment. She could hear his typical 'tsk tsk' within her own mind before all goes blank, and the infection claims another hero...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>An infected Luxray with purple eyes growls with flaring fur and snapping teeth. However, a black rubber mask was tugged over her face similar to the Raikou that they already have in a pin. Her arms are still bound to keep in check as a collar was also snapped against her neck. The infected cat was being led by an Umbreon bandit that kept a sturdy pole against the back of her neck, attached to the collar, to ensure she was held at bay but also shoved forward where he needed her to be. The Luxray is shoved into a small cage before the Umbreon twists the pole to unhook it and slams the cage door shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly spins around and mashes her head to the cage door, snarling at the male before her in an effort to bite him. However, the Umbreon simply looked at her in disgust as he safely stood outside of her range. \"Yeesh, what a freak... You could've been a nice pet too.\" He turns to leave the half-blind Luxray as she growls to herself, kept in a cage with other fellow infected inside a dark room underground, waiting for the one chance of being able to be pitted against a free meal in the arena...</i></span></div></div>",

It didn't take a psychic to know what was rifling through the canine's mind. Star stumbles in against the wall behind her as the Lucario closes the distance. Her heart races and her ears muffle out the sounds of the bandits above, still too stricken by the fact of what she was even facing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lace I-\" Star felt the urge to say something, but it wouldn't matter. The Lucario launches forward to smash his front against her and bashes her back to the logged wall all the more, so much so her hindpaws leave the ground as she's smeared up against the surface in his grip. The canine smacks his chops with a drooling tongue, eyeing her chest at first before sinking in a mouthful over her breast. \"A-Ahnh! No!\" The Luxray gasps as her companion swallows his maw over her blue-furred tit, packing the pliable meat about in his cheeks and teeth. His tongue happily slaps over her bare nipple to circle and flick over, and all the while his lips pucker in tight to pull at the boob. Star whines in the sudden gesture that her hindpaws plant themselves against the wall, endeavoring to push herself free from the pin she was trapped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLace's infected strength proves to be too strong however as he gives her a reasserting slam at the wall while mouthing over her tit. The breastmeat squishes and squashes to his empty gnawing, repeatedly suckling to get her senses hot and her struggles shuddering. The cat's ears flatten down, her face flushes redder, and her figure shimmies awkwardly in a hip-sway when her resistance proves to be too futile. The Lucario eventually pops his drooling jaws away from her now-wet breast, but it was not an act of mercy. A sudden growl eminates from his flat belly in yearning the cat as his prey. As Star attempts to calm down with whining huffs and useless kicks, the Lucario begins to lean her towards his open mouth. The frame of canine fangs welcomes her into the slick and dark madness that would dispose of her from this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar's heart quivers and her mind toils in a panic. \"L-Lace! Stop this! It's me, St-mphk!\" Star is silence with a muffling bite as his cheeks and lips encompass her head. Lace's tongue flatly smothers over her face to stroke about in collecting the cat towards his gullet as his arms cross together far more firmly around her back, crushing her front to his own. \"Hhanmphk!\" She grunts in a tight moment of pain as he takes his first big swallow. The gullet walls compact together over her head, all before jerking her firmly down into his throat. The infected rumbles a growl of pleasure as his first prey for his insatiable stomach was quite the delicious one. Regardless of his jerking shoulders and thrashing legs, the cat was helplessly bound and too fatigued to discharge any of her static after her defeat to the hands of the Heatmor. Star curses the anteater with all of her heart, but he would be too busy watching her demise from above with a smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bandits all hoot and holler as they watch the Lucario swallow Star's curvacious figure down, sinking in her chest to mash her breasts into his now bulging throat. The infected canine even grapples his hands over her rear end to grope into it, easing the slim body on in. Bite after bite, Star is swallowed down into the heated darkness of the hero's stomach. Lace's flat abdomen was now rounding out once her head was cramming on through as his tongue explores every savory bit of feline in his jaws. The maw clamps together tightly to squeeze her ass against his fangs as his tongue scoops right between her shuddering legs, cupping the nude cunt to gain another defenseless taste. Star's thighs cringe in the motion with her tail jerking wildly in response. \"Ggmhphk! A-Ahmph!\" Her crying moans could be heard inside while the bandits get quite the good show in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLace slings his head back, allowing Star's long legs to sink on down his throat with juicy gulps and squelches. The Lucario's hands leave her figure as her tail eventually tugs down his neck for his mouth to chomp back together, sealing Star's fate as dog fat. The cat packs his belly out in a round dome that the infected happily palms into. Glowing aura naturally begins to burn off from his figure as the heat picks up the pace of his stomach as she's awkwardly mashed in the chamber. Star grunts as the walls converge on her with juices pooling in over herself. She pleads his name, buck-kicking the stomach interior, and struggles to free her arms from her restraints, but the acids are quick to completely overtake her. She bubbles her protests in the submerged liquid as the Lucario merely massages his belly in response to feel her soon melt. With a flex, he roars up in the air in triumph while Star is left to the slowly perishes in his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Lucario lowly growls as he jerks about in place. Yet, he was far more restrained than his prey before him. The infected Lucario was chained to a wall, with heavy shackles ensuring his arms and legs stay wide-spread to the surface as two being stare at him, conversing with one another. Bigby the Bibarel was standing there, holding a lit lantern to ensure they got a full look of the fallen hero as his belly wobbles in place from his grumpy motions. \"He must've been pretty tough actually if he lasted through all of those ferals, even against a legendary for a bit.\" The beaver grunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien, the other one in the room, chuckles in amusement to actually approach the bound Lucario. The infected dog wildly writhes with snapping teeth as the safely victorious dog strokes a finger up along the gurgling belly of his fallen cat meal. \"His only weakness seemed to be those he kept around him. He was a fool if he thought his numbers could defeat mine.\" The Houndour muses before pivoting around. \"Well, his numbers are already dwindling. That's one less to worry about. Ensure that all of the other prisoners get tossed into the pit once he's done digesting the Luxray. But if the men want...\" Th Houndour trails off as the two bandits look on to the other shackled and caged ferals in the underground room, all eager to be pitted against a fighter to earn a meal. \"...feed the others.\"</i></span></div></div>",

His prized barriers of psychic powers wouldn't last if he endured an electrical attack directly into his neck, and the Girafarig sported a nice long target for something like that. The Luxray was anxious to sink her shocking fangs right into that length. Bolting forward, the giraffe scoffs at the brave maneuver, but simply slings the floating projectiles he had at his disposal. Star slides underneath an oncoming stool, leaps up to dodge crate following it, and even lands on one of the levitated tables to bound right off from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHitting the floorboards in a roll, she keeps her momentum going and closes the distance between herself and the psychic rather quickly, opening her jaws to reveal the crackling static of her fangs in preparation to pounce the giraffe. Before she can land the attack however, his eyes suddenly flash and his voice echoes out, \"Halt.\" A stream of chromatic rings out from his vision directly into Star's own eye. With only one target to stare into, the Girafarig grins as his Psybeam goes to scramble her thoughts and willpower. The Luxray stumbles to a stop with a wide eye, baffled that she had followed an order all of a sudden, only to be distracted by his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnn-ngh? What are you d...doi...hh-\" She couldn't finish her struggling question before feeling his presence in her own mind, binding her actions and thoughts like strings to his puppeteer hands. The rainbow rings absorb her vision to warp her reality as her brain loses its sense of presence. \"H-Huh...?\" Star mutters in confusion as her knees begin to weigh down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kneel.\" His voice ambiently reprimands out of her, to which her body instantly obliges. Her knees hit the ground and the electricity in her body dies down. Star stares up at the giraffe as he approaches her rather confidently, towering over her in a glimmering view that she could only focus on, forgetting what she was even doing. His eyes gave off a domineering vibe that completely controlled her now, ruining her awareness the longer she stares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....uh...uglh...\" The Luxray dumbly groans with her mouth hanging partially open. As his psybeam continues, the girl's arms begin to droop, her tail hangs down, and drool lines down off from her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it. No need to blink. No need to turn your head. Just keep staring and let me erase everything that you don't need.\" The Girafarig muses as he keeps a hand down on her head. His words ring true as her complete willingness made it all the easier to corrupt her brain and form her thoughts however he wanted. The psychic licks over his lips and asks, \"Apologize to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hgglh, I'm s-sorry...\" She moans up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for what?\" He stresses, working her mind into humiliating herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar grunts at the psychic takeover within her mind, but loses in whatever fight she had in her. \"Sorry f-for even trying to face you. I was much too weak and stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right~\" He chuckles, patting her cheek. \"You're going to be my new little cockslave, alright? All for me~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay...\" She dumbly answers back as he actually nudges his hips forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a finger point, he drags his brown nuts over the curve of her face, smearing past the head before dragging them back down. The nads wobble back in place before he keeps making her nose into them. \"Lick.\" He orders. The Luxray wordlessly obliges as she sticks her tongue out and kneads over the soft, taut surface, making the bag flop in place. \"Rrrnh~\" The giraffe groans with a one-sided grin and pats her head to keep it up. Star strokes her tongue repeatedly along his nuts in idle worship at this point. Lick after lick, the sounds of her tastebuds smearing across the flesh has the Girafarig easily growing a vast erection; his horse-like cock towering over the cat's head as her lips suckle away to each testicle, popping her lips off with audible plucks before slurping right back to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goooood girl. Keep going for just a sec~\" He rumbles with bliss as she nuzzles her face up along his shaft to lick the underside, feeling the great muscle flex in response. Her breath wafts across the meat which gets the psychic all to eager and spitting with pre. \"Fuck~! Alright, that's it. Turn around. On your knees, and raise your ass in the air all talk for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar's tongue collects a final lick of his shaft's underbelly for a swab of pre before obeying. She pivots around on her hands and knees, tucking her breasts close against the floor while her rear lifts up high for the Girafarig; her tail even cutely curls up to offer a better look of the taut black cheeks of her backside. The giraffe hungrily swallows as a thirst of control makes him rather anxious to fuck the Luxray. \"Hhh, hot damn, yeah just like that.\" The male eases himself onto his own knees to aim his lengthy size right against her rear, sandwich it along her crevice. Groping his hands into her rear, he feels the fat of her butt and grinds his slick underside over the ring and taint, grunting with a spit of pre landing over her curved back. \"Mmnhph.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Girafarig bites his lip and couldn't hold back. \"Keep that ass spread.\" He commands when pulling off to aim his tip in. Star's hands grope into her own rump to squeeze the cheeks powerfully apart, stretching at her anus to keep it ripe for the giraffe's cock. With an immediate plunge, the Girafarig buries his size into her, bucking to jerk more and more of himself inside to get her howling. \"Ouuah! D-Damn you're tight.\" He shudders as his cock stuffs half-way into her rear, all before tugging to stretch the ring even more in the opposite direction, just so he can hump right back into her for more progress. Hump after hump, the giraffe gets closer to meet his lap to her plush rear; her hands retaining their grip in keep the buns pried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSealing his cock firmly in, the giraffe secures most of his length inside to completely wrap his hands at Star's hips to buck away into her ass, grinding the tight walls into giving him the space and pleasure he craves. \"Hhouuhh, tell me the truth, you're a virgin yeah~?\" He mocks aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hypnotized cat answers all the same as she's plapped by his meat. \"Mrrrwww, I-I'm not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh~? You got a loverboy~? Tell me though. Who's cock is better? Mine or his?\" He growls in a smile, picking up the pace to clap his balls against her rump and bulge her stomach about with every pound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt gets the slutty cat moaning to answer, \"Y-Yooourrsss...\" Her thoughts of Lace completely gone, and even that of Bell. She only craved the Girafarig now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought.\" He mentions before hunkering down and really plows into her rump. His chest lays over her back as his arms scoop underneath her, latching hands to her breasts. The blue furred meat squishes between his fingers as he fondles and rolls the mounds about, all the while bobbing her in place with audibly wet smacks. His pre smothers her rectum and the cock was far too pleased to last much longer. \"Damn it I'm close already. Hhh, we're gonna have to end things quickly here bitch.\" He squeezes her tits tightly together when slapping his lap powerfully to her ass, making her howl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dazed Luxray moans as the equine cock spasms inside of her and floods her stomach with jizz in a sudden orgasm. Hot spunk floods inside and bloats her belly some, stretching to accommodate his vast size and his oncoming load. The Girafarig clenches his teeth together and bat his hips idly more, letting her asshole hug the cum right out of him in clenches. \"Nngh! Fuck! Ooouhh yeaaahh...\" He eases down as he thumbs at her nipples, slapping his now soaked balls at her drooling cunt. The cock flexes about inside in pulses as he begins to drag it out, slickly explosing the layer of semen clinging to the meat until it wetly plops out. Cum spurts from her rear before drooling down the crevice, leaving him to smear his half-spent cock around under her, leaning his mouth close to her ears. \"Remind me, who's my little cockslave now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar was heaving air wildly, obeying the only voice she wanted to hear. \"I-I'm your cockslave now. Forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giraffe laughs and licks over his face from over her shoulder, gripping her tits in a squeeze. \"That's my girl~\" The psychic eases himself up to catch his breathe while admiring the cream-filled show he gave her rear. His hand smacks across her rump to make her hips sway in the impact, stringing out the jizz for a bare moment from her pucker before he finally stands up on his hooves. \"You're gonna follow me then to Damien. I'm sure he'll let me keep you to see the kinds of pets I can rake in for us. You won't be joining any of the working girls though. A slut like you's gonna be our personal pet~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar simply nods her head in agreement, drooling saliva from her mouth, cum from her ass, and pre from her own slit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl. Now tag along. You're only allowed to walk on all fours from today on.\" The giraffe orders her at the door. The moaning cat follows the command and crawls towards him on her knuckles and knees, walked like an animal to the bandit leader she failed to even face off against...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Girafarig sips his ale as he sits on a stool, enjoying the cold wind breezing gently by when overlooking the forest outside of the lumber mill. At one of the guard posts, the psychic was enjoying his comfortable life as the lead guard. No more tunnels to look after, no. He'd be giving the orders for other guards and patrols from now on in reward for snuffing out an infiltration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the evidence was the Luxray sucking at his balls with needy moans, popping her lips off with strings of saliva connecting her mouth to his sac, only to make out with the nads more. She didn't require anymore psybeams; her brain lost long ago, permanently. She sits higher up her knees to knead her breasts together around his cock, worshiping its tip with thirsty kisses.</i></span></div></div>",

She was much too close and too quick for another Light Screen to fizzle her attack out this time, yet the giraffe manages to halt her progress with his ass suddenly glowing and Star freezes on the spot. A light pink aura shines in an outline around her body, similar to the Girafarig's eye color until she's blasted away instead, crashing to a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gyuh!\" Star yelps out as the wooden crunches against her back before she hits the floor, leaving the Girafarig to stride forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try, but not good enough.

He certainly wasn't the mastermind psychic that Lace and the group were after, just another jobber criminal in the way. Star confidently bolts straight in to try and throw off where she would have dodged his projectiles. Bolting in quickly, the Luxray makes a straight line towards the psychic giraffe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Girafarig scoffs, \"Hah! Stupid mistake.\" He mocks before reaching a hand out and clenching it together in a fist. All of a sudden, all of the stools, barrels, and crates in his levitating grasp all converge right in front of him; right where Star was. The Luxray gasps in shock and attempts to brake herself, but she runs right into the collision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-AagghhhHhh!!\" She cries out as wooden structures slam together around her, pinning her with intense weight and pressure as the furniture and containers pile in from the psychic's power. Crushed between them, the pink aura fades away, dropping all of the broken wooden chunks down to the floor with Star following them, slumping to her knees. \"...u-uughhnh.\" With her eye rolled up, her body teeters over and slams the ground in an unceremonious drop. The Luxray had been defeated. Rather quickly at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we done here already? Works for me.\" The giraffe taunts as he struts right towards her fallen figure, stepping a hoof down onto her head to make her body wince. \"That's what you get for trying to get the drop on me, cyclops.\" He twists his hoof down on the eyepatched cat to remind her of her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar clenches her teeth together and struggles to move her bruised muscles, but the impact left her shaking. Her body felt like it was heavy jelly, refusing to budge. \"G-Ghhhk...nghk, bastard...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh, whatever you say. But I gotta say, seeing you like that has gotten me all worked up. I think I know of a good way to get rid of you.\" The Girafarig sneers down. The cat struggle to glare up at him, only to see him using his hand to wring around at his sheath, teasing his erection out. Her pupil shrinks to see his long meat flare out over his fingers, having a horse-like cock and a heavy sac weighing down underneath it. The brown balls swell out to show just how much the giraffe was packing, not to mention his pillaring size of the equally brown shaft which transitions into spots over a fleshy pink end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar feels her body lock into place from the bandit using his psychic powers again, eventually lifting the Luxray off from the floor to hover right in front of him in a slumped position. The Girafarig smiles at her as he strokes his fully erect dick now, showing off its thickness and length with every pump. It even gets his large balls to sway. \"Impressed~?\" He taunts her as her eyes winces at the sight; she would hiss a response, but he keeps her mouth locked shut for the time being. \"Then let's get you acquainted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luxray is levitated on over above his shaft as he aims its end where her legs were, slowly drifting her hindpaws right to it. They squish into the flared tip, only to sink the pads right into the cock's lips. Star quivers her back muscles at the sudden sensation as she's slowly fed into the penis. \"....ngh....hk...!\" She grunts in a panic, desperately trying to yell. Her heart thumps wildly inside of her chest as her limbs spasm in place, yet the psychic hold remains stronger. Star would be forced to witness the hungry cock tugging her ankles down and feeding on her legs. The tight tunnel seals tightly in a pull, squelching from the pre already building up inside and coating her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giraffe murrs in watching his cock bulge. The feeling of her legs in it coerced him to flex his meat, squishing Star and yanking her down for another greedy pull. \"Mnh! I should thank Credel and Tank for being dumb enough to lose. It just means I get to enjoy you all to myself~\" The Girafarig strokes his hand at his cock, groping over the bulges as with Star's hips now descending into his cocktip. The cat shimmies in constant vibrations within his psychic grip, sparking his interest. \"Want to struggle for me? Be my guest then~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe levitating aura dissipates, leaving Star to freely move again. \"Gnh! Wh-What the hell is wrong with you, what are you doing?!\" She demands in fear as her hands shove down at the growing cock-head pulling at her midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Making you useful. I could go for a good stroke for the stress you caused me. It was quite a spook to sneak up on me like that, but I'm more than happy to dispose of an intruder for Damien.\" He taunts before using his hand to grip her head and shoves her down further. Her hands sink between the lips all of a sudden which binds her arms together at her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aghn! Y-You can't be serious! I...I can't let things end this way!\" Star pleads and her upper body thrashes, but it was far too late. She was more than half-way down now already. \"Pl-Please, stop this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giraffe comically taps his chin with his free hand to think on it. \"Hmmm...\" He then leers back at her and grins, \"Nah.\" Another shove on her hand sends her chest right at the hungry cock's lips, bobbing her breasts in place with his pre squirting out between them, pressuring to stuff them inside. Star moans aloud as the tits are mashed inside, dipping her shoulder in under as well to finally creep up her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Girafarig's mast throbs with a train of bulges traveled along its length smear around in her interior struggles, forcing the psychic to huff aloud with excitement. As Star's head begins to sink inside, her face squishes together in a hot blush to purse her lips and mush her cheeks in. \"N-Nmph! I-I don't want to go down, please. I-I'll do whatever you want...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugging his own massive cock against his front, he leers at her face to face, licking over her mouth and nose. \"I want you moaning as you melt into my spunk~\" With that as his final order, he mashes a thumb at her nose to poke her down entirely inside his cock, swallowing her into his sac. She emits a muffled cry in response as he figure vanishes from the meaty tunnel and then expands his brown sac. The heavy nuts swell out even more for a weighted bounce, leaving the giraffe staggering backwards until his back hit a wall. \"Hhhh, h-hohh fuck it's been so long since I've done this.\" He mutters as she squishes into his nut chamber, packed in a pool of cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of his hands clasp around his shaft to stroke its length, and all the while, his mind uses its psychic ability to actually knead his balls with an kinetic set of hands, pleasuring himself with a much needed massage. The fat nads are stroked and squeezed, applying a tightly hot prison for Star to wallow in as cum soaks over her entire body. Struggle as she might, she was as good as gone now. And from there, the giraffe jerks himself off to speed up the process of breaking her down. With the desire to cum, the hot semen begins to boil over her and soften her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mphknphk! Bl-bblpkkhlp!\" She moans within the sac, trying to find room to move her breathe, but as expected, her world begins to fade away as her meat and muscles dissolve into semen. Her figure loses its solidity, and in mere minutes, the Luxray was churned into a hefty batch of cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPre endlessly fires off from the Girafarig's cock as he bucks his hips into his own grip, swaying the hefty weight between his legs about to hear the semen slosh. \"Hhh, nngh, hff, fuck, fuuuuck...\" He groans idly until swinging his long neck back, roaring out. His mighty rod spurts large and loud shots of semen out in an orgasm, splatting the ground and painting it white. \"HHhhhhhyyaaaaaaaghh...!\" His hooves stomp firmly down as a brace when shooting out the heavy ropes, dropping audible squelches and thuds with every blast. The balls over time begin to shrink back to normal the more he orgasms, flooding the spunk through the floorboards in wide puddles that fatly ooze outward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the cock dies down with its shots, spurting regular strings of the stuff out until a soaked eyepatch splurts free from the tip, splatting into the pool of seed and drifting in the goo. The giraffe slumps onto his rear against the wall to breathe wildly, tuckered out and sweating, \"Hhoohhh shit that was good...\" He moans out as his arms flop down now to take a break. His cock idly flexes to drool out a lengthy fountain of jizz, lazily spilling the stuff down in a continuous line that would take minutes to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Two men angrily grumble to themselves as they dip their respective mops into a soapy water bucket and splat the ends onto the floor, cleaning the floor. Credel the Charmeleon and Tank the Tyranitar were tasked with mopping up the intruder's remains for failing to catch her in the first place, visible with the bandages they had to wear from how badly she shocked them. Credel grunts as he smears the cum off the floor, \"Ghhh, could you have picked a better way to get rid of her? Something that wasn't this fucking messy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Girafarig was casually lounging back against a table, taking a swig of ale. \"Hah! It's your fault she got past you in the first place. Damien wants this room spotless before tomorrow. And that means sweeping and tossing all of the wooden debris too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTank snarls, \"This is bullshit. I should be the one giving the orders for you two!\" He ends up scooping up a cum-soaked eyepatch with his mop, audibly grunting in disgust and flings the accessory to a trash bin barrel nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess you get a taste of your own medicine now, big guy. You can get a taste of the cat if you want to get on your hands and knees to lick her up. That's one way to clean this place up~\" The giraffe mocks in return, getting a glaring snarl out of the Tyranitar. The two lizards continue their mopping as the psychic gets to enjoy the show.</i></span></div></div>",

This time, the added electricity makes her faster, bolting her legs quickly to practically teleport in zig-zags through the room at him. The giraffe witnesses this and actually opens his arms out, \"Oh? You're approaching me?\" Suddenly the floorboards in front of him swing right up to create a shield blocking him from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Star uses her agileness to actually bolt around behind the psychic giraffe, crouched behind him with a hand ready to strike. \"I can't beat the shit out of you without getting clos-\" Star halts her threat as she's met with the same pair of golden eyes and sharp teeth as before to the orbed head of the Girafarig's tail. \"-er...\" She forgot about that thing yet again. The tail head suddenly pries his jaws wetly open and extends out, snagging her face into its maw. \"Mm-mphk?!\" The Luxray is stunned beyond belief as the tail ravenously swallows, packing her entire head inside its 'neck' to bulge out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giraffe swings his head over his shoulder in surprise to look at the Luxray appearing behind him, only to see her on her knees being gulped over by his sentient tail. \"What the...? P-PFFT, SNRK!\" The Girafarig ruptures in to laughter as he watches Star futility try to jerk herself free, but the tail maw chomps his its teeth repeatedly to stuff her inside like that of an infected feral. \"Hahahahahah! Are you shittin' me?! You got caught by that thing? You know I can't control it, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar swings her body from side to side in an endeavor to shake free, but she was almost half-way inside already. Her head and breasts bulge the wirey brown tail in great detail from how narrow it was, but the fleshy tunnel remained stronger than she ever expected. \"G-Ggmphk! Nmhph, rrmnrrph!\" Her arms are pinned at her sides as the smaller mouth snaps over and over again, sucking her inside. The feline's knees tremble on the floorboards as saliva ravenously coats down through her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giraffe squats down more to allow his tail to have a better reach to finish her off. \"This thing has a mind of its own. It only acts when it's hungry, but other than that, it's pretty brain-dead! You'd have to be a complete moron to get yourself eaten by it, hahahah!\" The Luxray whines inside like this was some curse of a god upon her to lose this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tailmaw snaps and snaps, biting over her rear and slurps away at her thrashing legs as her body hammocks in the brown tail, all until her body mashes in through the Girafarig's body to deposit directly into his stomach. The giraffe keeps his pair of hands on his front, watching as his stomach goes from a flat abdomen to a round, swollen belly as more of the cat packs within. Star's hindpaws and tail are tugged down the tail-mouth's gullet, sending her entire figure inside the giraffe's middle. The Girafarig laughs to bounce his gut some, fondling the yellow-brown tum. \"Ooouhhh, yeeeah that's the spot. You saved me a trip to the mess hall, hahah! I should've mentioned that my tail and I share the same stomach~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe claps his hands over his belly, wobbling Star in her prison. The compacted cat growls wildly, shaking about in place which only swings the giraffe's front about, refusing any freedom. \"Y-You cocky lucky bastard! I'm gonna rip your tail off and feed it down your own mouth...!\" The Luxray threatens as her mind begins to race inside the rumbling chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Girafarig takes a happy seat back on a stool, drumming his fingers on his front. \"Heh, no you ain't. You're gonna sit tight and digest like the tail-food you are. I'll be sure to let Damien know your Lucario friend wasn't alone, but I guess he will be now at this point.\" The triumphant bandit then reaches an arm back to pet over his tail's head. \"Good boy! You caught our sneaky kitty cat~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tail simply stares out blankly, licking over its teeth from the yummy meal it claimed. It merely pants like an unaware dog. Star attempts to slosh her prison all the more as the juices pooled over her begin to burn, having little time to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Girafarig actually hooks his hands behind his head while emitting a small pink aura around at his belly. Using his psychic abilities, he forces the Luxray to sit still in his acids as they eat away at her, with the sensation of invisible kinetic hands massaging his belly. \"Aaaahhh, there we go. You enjoy your bath while it lasts, eyepatch, and I'll show Damien the good news when you're giraffe fat~\" From there, he's able to rub his belly even without his hands, relaxing in a weighted recline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar howls in whines, unable to even struggle as the juices overtake, making for a resounding bubbly churn for the Girafarig to listen to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Interesting...\" Damien mutters as he runs his fingers together when pondering aloud. He was seated at his couch on a balcony over the mill's atrium, overlooking the pit arena many bandits were gathered around. \"Bigby. Go collect a group of men and head into the eastern tunnels where our good friend here was guarding. Retrieve Credel and Tank, but flush out any rats we have down there as well. I want some of them brought back for questioning. This 'Lance' character certainly wasn't alone and was up to something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bibarel nods, \"Consider it done. I'll be sure to give those two lizards a thorough thrashing for letting a cat slip by and get the best of them.\" And with that, the large beaver walks away to carry out the task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Houndour sighs and relaxes on his couch, \"Thank you for snuffing out our little intruder then. I'll be sure to promote you to a better task so you won't have to guard the tunnels ever again. It's nice to have those that can do their job around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Girafarig was standing in front of his leader, grinning with a gurgling stomach. \"Thanks boss, the pleasure was all mine. It was easier than I thought~\" He gropes a hand on his belly again, feeling the digested soup inside of the heroine doomed by a hungry tail of all things...</i></span></div></div>",

Tank was too busy shaking his arm to get it back under his control from all of the electric spasms, the Luxray takes her chances and leaps up against, using his knee as a stepping stool to plant her hindpaws on his chest and clasp her hands to his head. The dinosaur glares up at the Luxray as she retains a vice hold at his upper body and unleashes what she could, electrocuting directly at the reptile's head. His eyes widen and his teeth bear together, suffering the high voltage Star was able to muster between her palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she wasn't able to perform enough after her recent full-body discharge, leaving the static to dissipate and the Tyranitar surprisingly managed to remain standing. The thick armor helped for sure, but something told her he was going to endure most attacks regardless. She would suffer the consequence of being so up close to him that he swings both his arms in together, trapping Star in a powerful hug. Her abdomen squeezes up against his thick chest where he glares up at her happily. \"Nice try, kitty cat. That tickled.\" He sneers before bearing his arms even tighter together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar's head flings wildly back as the pressure was horribly intense, pinning her arms at her sides and crushing at her back. The powerful tightness was forced upon her spine, leaving it to arch as much as it could, yet the stress never alleviated. She couldn't even gasp or howl, as her throat locks up by the pressure. \"....Ghk....ahk....hk...ngh...!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luxray kicks her legs and swings her head about for freedom, but the Tyranitar's arms remain cemented to her figure. And with her chest at his eye-level, Tank eagerly pries his jaws open and strokes his tongue out, smearing a long lavished line across a breast. Star whines in the sudden tough and throbs in place all the more, yet his arms flex in for another air-sealing bind. \"Mmnh, nice taste...tingly to my tongue even.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar would retort had she the chance to even utter a word, but being able to simply breathe was proving to be quite the challenge now. She felt at any moment he would break her back, and he probably could any time he wanted to. His mouth laps another stroke over a blue tit of hers to squish it up against the other one, wobbling back down naturally into place. The muscle tests the weight of Star's breasts with uninvited licks stroking over their width, coursing the thin blue fur and flattening over her nipples. The sensation gets the Luxray's kicks to become more awkward as her knees buckle together here and there, along with her grunts sounding far more like whimpers. Tank is even greedy enough to pry his fanged jaws open to take a tit into his mouth. The teeth pinch in and mush the breast-meat in on itself, fatly squishing it out as his tongue polishes over the nipple with lick after lick. The Tyranitar even goes as far as to tug the nipple out in a stretch before releasing it to wobble at Star's chest with a pop of his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rrrhhh, damn, you got a healthier body than a lot of the other girls here.\" Tank taunts aloud with a glare up at Star's pained face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luxray bears her own teeth together with shuddering motions, only to wheeze out, \"I-I'm...not...yours...to...have...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not as a collared slut, but the thing about bitches is they're useful in all sorts of ways~\" The dinosaur threatens with a sudden lick of his mouth. Star's eye shrinks at the pupil as Tank pries his wet jaws open again, but this time it looms towards her vision. He flexes his arms again, this time popping any air pockets along her spine like they were his own knuckles. The string of muffled noises loosens Star out completely, but also forces her back to go briefly numb in the forced chiropractic hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Ughh---nhk!\" She gasps out with a rolled up, locking her mouth open in a completely stunned state of being. It made it far easier to cram her face right inside the drooling cavern with a hand to the back of her maned head, shoving her muzzle right into his tongue. His teeth bear down over his noggin and chin, tugging the defeated Luxray inside with an immediate swallow. Tank's mouth sucks away at her face as Star shivers uselessly in her arms, hugged to the very body she would end up feeding. Despair and confusion ran through her mind that this asshole managed to actually get the best of her, praying that Bayne or Lace or anyone would come to her aid. But her luck of rescue was used up apparently from Aldanwood. The cat feels herself being swallowed into his hot throat in a resounding gulp, followed with a sneering growl that throbs the muscled walls around her. \"Mm-mphnk! Nmph!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs cringe about with her tail, but their stifled motions had little to no impact against the Tyranitar's bulky figure. His name rang true, and she'd end up feeding the tank. He plants his stompers firmly at the ground with his arms laddering her into his swallow gullet, pinning her breasts up inside his mouth from his jaw to chew at and his tongue to explore, eliciting out garbled whines of his prey within. Tank was feeling like it was his lucky night in snuffing out any rebellious hero hoping to rid him of his lifestyle here at the mill, and not only that, it was an easy attractive catch at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar's body spills down his tongue and throat as her flat abdomen easily glides on through, taunted yet again as his teeth chomp in to bite at her ass lodged at his teeth. The strong fangs pinch into the rumpmeat with his hands gripping her legs wide, halting their fruitless thrashes of freedom. The broad tongue finds its way at her groin to welcome itself right up to her folds in her exposure. The tip strokes along the valley of her slit before flatly smothering the full extent of it and her clit. Star's hips convulse in response, clenching her ass visibly outside which just made for a stronger mound of meat for the Tyranitar to bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NNnNnnmnnmhhphk! R-Rrnh...r-rr---hhnnhgh...\" Star cries out inside, shaking her hips, but it merely encourages Tank in retaliation. His mouth snaps repeatedly at her rear, along with the tongue pumping into her cunt to squelch the pre inside, spreading the vagina wide. The wet muscle jabs around to test her tightness and to taste her interior, which only teased his tastebuds into wanting more. Hungry, the dinosaur begins to wildly swallow, tugging her pussy free from his tongue, but ends up having her thighs working down the gullet entrance next. From inside, Star's face mashes through the stomach valve into the burning chamber that has most likely claimed many lives before; and Star's addition was just going to disappear on the bulky dinosaur's front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final series of swallows, Tank seals his teeth together in a final chomp past her tail, and sending the rest of Star's figure to her doom. \"Hhrraaaahhh~!\" He sighs out when slapping a hand to his partially-bloated front. He gropes into the outstretched blue middle, groping into his victim and teasing, \"Fuck. If you hadn't been so uppity, I think you and I could'a gotten along together.\" He ruminates aloud, applying a firm grope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar toils within the cramped space of acids pooling over her bundled figure, struggling to find any space to move and change posture. It didn't help to feel the claws fondling her misery and thrumming the walls with his deep voice. \"A-Aghk! L-Let me out! Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" He rumbles with a grin. \"Where'd all that confidence go~? Are you showing your true colors now that you know who's better?\" He slaps his belly, jostling the juices around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar was just desperate, swallowing her pride and feeling the tomb wobble her about. \"Hnhh! Pl-Please...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTank laughs as he keeps both hands over his gut, beginning to walk and bob the gut in place. \"Too late bitch. I think you'll do much better as a meal. Don't feel too bad though. The other girls are just gonna get to enjoy a thicker Tank to worship now~:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar felt like she was in Hell at this point, feeling the juices eating at her fur in the pitch darkness and her body refusing to crackle with any more static. She cries and howls inside the muffled stomach, music to the dino's ears as it echoes in the dark tunnel, all before audible churns turn them into audible meowls of distress before dissipating into bubbly silence over time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Several of Hedgen's villagers are lined up in chains, forced to trek one after the other to the cages Damien's men had set up. After Tank discovered the secret bombing planted within the tunnels of the mill, Lace's plan had completely fallen apart as the bandits easily hunted out any stragglers or infiltrators that attempted to go through the with mission. Tank murrs in a toothy grin as one last villager fills the cage they had to a tight capacity, with the Tyranitar giving them a shove. \"In ya go, bastards! We're gonna have a lot of fun and games with y'all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last villager snarls at the shove, bumping into other villagers before snapping in response with hostility. \"Where's the Luxray that was with us?\" It was a Sceptile asking the question, with Tank simply stretching a malicious lick over his fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A permanent cage.\" He slaps a hand to his front of the blue potbelly leftover, letting out a juicy rumble from within. The Sceptile's expression drained with life and color as Tank slams the gate door shut, strutting off to enjoy the last of his stewing meal.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Star uses her legs to carry her as fast as she can when bolting to the side. She doubted herself into being able to take the large dinosaur all by herself, at least in such a cramped and grounded hall to fight in. Star would have to get some of the other villagers to help out, like Bayne, if she could catch up to them. She didn't like the idea, but out of desperation she would have to. However, the Tyranitar to quick to waver off the static in his body to see the Luxray fleeing the scene. \"Scamperin' away with your tail between your legs? Oh no ya don't!\" He roars aloud with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flexes his figure and wildly stomps into the ground, tremoring the dirt and cratering it place. The entire tunnel where Star ran through was crumbling all of sudden in an earthquake. The Tyranitar was fighting in his natural element here, and with only one direction for the Luxray to flee, it made it easy to trap her. Heavy rocks crash through the ceiling in front of Star to force her stumbling into a halt, collapsing into a skid. \"Ngh!\" She grunts and begins to scramble backwards as the ceiling caves in on itself. The wooden archways snap under the pressure, dirt and rocks rain down from above, daring to catch Star in their crushing mounds. \"No! No no no no!\" She yelps as she flops over onto her hands and knees to run back in the direction of where the Tyranitar was waiting for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTank laughs as he buries his hands into the ground, all before prying out a firm brown boulder, half the size of Star at least before lobbing it in one powerful sling. \"Hrraah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Star could do was put her arms up, lacking the timing or space to dodge it. The large rock collides into her and bursts into chunks upon the impact, forcing her backwards wildly to the ground. \"Ghuhk! A-Aauhghn...\" She wheezes in pain with shifting legs as she watches the ceiling above her crack. Her hands weakly struggle to force off the rock chunks off from her body, but it was too late. The dirt above her gives, and a rainfall of the earth crashes down upon her; the last she'd see being an eclipsing rock striking square in the forehead. The Luxray is then buried until a large mound of soil and stone, completely concealed in rubble as the dirt settles and the Tyranitar stomps forward to admire his prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh heh, you coward out, I play dirty~\" He taunts aloud before digging a hand through the rubble, searching for his furry prey. He grabs what feels like one of Star's thighs and squeezes into it strongly, all before tugging to pry the limb free from the rocks. Pulling with his great strength, he's able to unsheath the cat's body right out from the pile, with Star left upside down and dangled by her leg, coated in dirt and completely unconscious. Tank hoists her up high to get a good look at her face, noting her partially open mouth and closed eye. He bats the back of his hand across her head, resulting in her figure swinging lightly with no reaction. She was definitely out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tyranitar laughs aloud and turns out, dragging Star along the dirt to boast, \"Let's get you all cleaned up then. A beautiful lass like you needs to look her best when we've got some eager boys who need a good fuck.\" Star's arms smear along the floor behind the Tyranitar's stomping, taking her away into the dark hall for an ill fate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar sputters as fluid fills her dry throat and convulses her lungs. \"Chkkauhk! Agh--k!\" Her throat cringes in together as liquid spills into her stomach and out from her mouth, causing her to wake back into the realm of consciousness. \"...Oouagh.\" A groan exits her mouth as she feels herself laying on her back, coming to realize what her surroundings where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wakey wakey.\" A familiar and deep tone greets her. Star's blinks her eye repeatedly to catch that she was laying on a bed with wooden cabin-like walls. By her towered the Tyranitar that had captured, shadowed and gleaming over her body. Star winces in intense fear and struggles off the bed, yet her limbs refused to do so. Looking at the corners of the bed, rubber belts secure her wrists apart above her head, while her ankles are bound similarly spread apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What in the...?!\" The Luxray huffs aloud as her heartrate picks up and her body begins to spasm to escape her restraints. The bed bobs in place and her back bounces against its surface, but her limbs remain trapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comfy~?\" Tank chuckles down at her as he swirls a pitcher in his hand over her head, containing the fluid that woke Star up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get...Get these off of me!\" The Luxray demands as her head flings around and the bed shakes in place during her bound thrashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTank merely shakes his head. \"Like I have any reason to. But I certainly will after you're a good girl sit still. I think I have a motivator for you though.\" He lowers the pitcher of the drink in his hand as Star huffs about in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is th-that even?! Stop this, or you're gonna pay!\" Star warns despite her fearful expression, surging voltage into her hands. However, the rubber restraints at her wrists simply nullify the endeavor and absorb the voltage. \"..N-Ngh!\" The heroine's heart sinks into her stomach as the Tyranitar grips her face and forces her lips to purse with a squeezing clench, pouring the liquid right into her throat. Star gags as blue juice funnels right down through her mouth, making her sputter the drink over her face some, choking somewhat, but ingesting what she could. The flavor was something fruity, maybe alcoholic even, but it was of something she's never had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pitcher is emptied out and Tank tosses it away. \"There. That should be enough Happy Juice for ya~\" He muses before running his hand off from her face down her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar coughs as she wheezes, \"...Wha...what did you make me, ngh, drink?\" She groans feeling a light-headed. Star presumed it was from the rockfall earlier, but soon, colors of the room became more vibrant in her vision; the Tyranitar's body gleaming like shining armor. Heat builds within her body and mind that actually helps to numb her injuries and feel the bed as a soft cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a fun concoction one of Damien's boys made. It eases the mind...makes you more...\" Tank mentions as his hand smears over one of Star's breasts again, circling a clawed finger around at her nipple. \"...sensitive~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luxray instinctively flexes her back up and her mouth moans aloud, huffing in surprise at how riling that felt. \"H-Hh-hhhh, how...d-dare you...!\" She growls through her haze, finding it hard to stay mad however. A yearning for revenge was snuffed out by a sudden yearning for pleasure, and the dinosaur being would be more than happy to oblige. His large figure eases onto the bed between her legs and cups her thighs, lifting them up as best he could with her ankle restraints keeping her paws to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare I? That's rich. By the end of this, you're going to be thanking me for my cock~\" Tank assures her as he smears his groin against her own, dragging at her slit to force out visible arousal to leak right out from her. Pre already drools out from her flushed nethers, blushed hot and wincing with needs. It all caused Star to tense up in her restraints and release a long moan. \"Let's see how you handle my size.\" Tank then warns, leaving Star to throb her head up just to look over her own breasts to see his erection swelling out from his slit. The cock grew in width and height to a great deal, each twitching throb increasing its mass. It wasn't even fully erect as he aims its tip at her vaginal folds and nudges it right on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hhouuahhh, n-no...way, I...\" Star dumbly mutters as the vast amount of 'Happy Juice' go to her. She emits a high-pitched sigh to feel the dino's meat dab into her cunt, all before cramming the hole wide once it shoves right inside. She slings her head back and cries out to the ceiling, flexing out her thighs and abdomen as powerfully as she could. \"U-UuUuuAAaAAaaaAhhh~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I wanna hear~\" Tank laughs as he grips her sides and swings his mighty front forward, penetrating with his sheer mass. The vast cock stretches the slit painfully out, ceasing any of her pre to even leak out. Clogged and stuffed, Star would have to endure the strong pillar as it digs through her body and retracts out only partially. The Tyranitar seethes through his teeth upon feeling just how tight of a ride this was going to be. Still, in a mere bob of Star's hips in his hands, he pumps the bound cat against his cock, jabbing her belly to bulge greatly from his size during the idle buck of his lap. The wide shaft keeps the vaginal folds strained out tightly to feed her his pre, squelching with every motion to pop through her cervix. \"Hhrrhhhh, that's the spot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd from there, the Tyranitar plows the cat, ramping up his pace to smack his lap to her own, forcing Star to whine out with every pound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Plap! Plap! Plap! Plap! Plap! Plap! Plap! Plap! Plap! Plap! Plap! Plap! Plap! Plap!</i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glares down at her with half-lidded eyes and endures ever whining squeeze she applies. The cat couldn't remain steady as she rocks her whole figure on the bed to really drag it about, scratching the floorboards even with the legs under their added weight. \"A-AaauuuUaaahhh! Ahhhh, h-hhhhnhh~!\" The Luxray moans aloud with a rolled up eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Plap!Plap!Plap!Plap!Plap!Plap!Plap!Plap!Plap!Plap!Plap!PLAP!PLAP! PLAP! <b>PLAP! PLAP! PLAP!</b></i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTank picks up the pace as he wildly bounces the fallen hero over his cock, roaring out rather triumphantly, \"Hhrrr-ggrrraaahhh!!\" Hot cum bursts from his rod and stuffs the womb silly with his spunk. The gooey madness floods her midsection, causing her belly to distend wildly out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-R-RrrrRROooWwrrraaaahhh!\" Star howls to the ceiling, bucking herself against his spurting shaft that sent her over the edge, raining her own orgasm to smother his meat in a hot bath. The Luxray felt her world flood with pleasure...</span></div></div>",

His cock flings right up after the tip flicks out from her numb vagina, releasing heavy globs right out between Star's thighs and from his own end. The shaft spurts last remaining strands out to rope over Star's now taut belly; the Tyranitar even going as far as to grab her gut and smear his dick over around into her fur to wipe himself clean. \"Hhh...hhhh...hhh...how was that, pussycat?\" He sneers when looking at her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar's expression was left red hot, mouth gaping, drooling like a mindless zombie. Her chest rapidly pumps up and down in sharp breaths, crying out each time a hefty amount of seed finds its way spilling out of her cunt and over the crease of her ass into the bedding. The Happy Juice was running all throughout her system now, working its magic and keeping her placated into the bandit's bidding. \"H-Hhohuugghhah, don't...stop...more...\" She pleads aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More~? Damn, aren't you greedy.\" Tank mocks as his hands grip the sides of her cum-filled belly, molding it around to force the girl to spasm her waist and squelch her own cum. \"Don't worry though, there's more of my cock and jizz to enjoy. I gotta tell Damien about your stupid little attempt earlier first, but I think he'll allow you to be a nice trophy for me to enjoy. I think a leash and collar will be a perfect fit for you, pussycat.\" He slaps her gut to make her whine out again before easing himself off the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sit tight and look all dumb and horny. I'll be back for you~\" The Tyranitar promises the fucked Luxray before proceeding out of his bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar doesn't even attempt to struggle at her bindings anymore. The idea of escape was long gone from her mind.

The ambience of an arena fight filled the recreational atrium of the mill, with many of the bandits roaring for whatever leftover Hedgen villager was left fighting the ferals in the pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Marowak was left to defend against a newly made Typhlosion infected after an intruder was discovered with a Toxicroak. They were left to the ferals of the Pit to deal with, with the fire-type getting himself plowed and added to the group, whereas the frog would unfortunately end up as a meal. The staggering Marowak is slammed against a wall at his back, groaning aloud, \"D-Damien! I kn-know you can hear me! Y-Your reign of terror will not last forever! I-I may have failed to stop you, but th-mmnphk?!\" Bronze is silenced as the infected Jackal's jaws bear down over his head, beginning to swallow him down. The bandits cheer and holler all the more, exchanging their bets on who'd last in the Pit for that round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, a stuttering Lopunny girl worriedly approaches the Tyranitar who was up on one of the balconies overlooking the event asks aloud, \"...C-Care for another drink, Tank, sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Oh hey there lass. Yeah, I could go for one more.\" The Tyranitar muses before looking down between his legs. \"How about you, bitch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her knees, a collared and moaning Star huffs at Tank's throbbing shaft, stroking her tongue repeatedly along its underside as she has it laid against her face, nuzzling away at it. \"Ouugh, c-cuuum...\" She moans, under the haze of the Happy Juice, having destroyed her mind days ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTank laughs and lifts his hand, tugging the leash snug to Star's collar to firmly mash her face into his saliva-coated cock. He glances to the Lopunny, \"Looks like she's already got it covered for a drink~\" The Lopunny waitress slave nervously nods and struts away, leaving Tank alone with his toy again. The dinosaur glares back down at his lap to see the Luxray opening her mouth the swallow the tip of his dick once more and work it into her bulging cheeks. He sneers with a throb of his dripping mast, \"I told you already. I'm not gonna jizz in your cum-hungry throat until you can swallow my cock all the way to the hilt.\" He pulls of the leash again to submerge several inches inside of her maw, getting Star's eye to roll and the lid to twitch up. Her neck bulges wildly out as she chokes at his size, struggling to even extend her head past halfway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTank stretches a fanged smile and settles back again to watch her gag and swallow his meat. \"Looks like we're gonna be here all night then~\" He boasts as Lace and his allies succumb to the fate of failing their mission...</i></span></div></div>",

Enduring your fatigue, you would launch attacks against the infected Raikou, slamming an aura-fuming punch directly into his broad chest for instance. But the flames would fizzle out, and your knuckles collided to what felt like steel. The strong beast took your hits like they were nothing, but it countered with vastly harsher strength. A mere swing of the back of its palm slung you away from it. You stagger wildly back, only to feel a rocketing fist smash into your stomach to send you literally soaring through the air, crashing against the wall of the arena. Wood chips scatter about from the impact, and your back muscles go numb for a moment after you hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wild wheeze escapes your mouth after struggling to retain a breath in again before straining at your spine to move again. You can hear the infected stride towards you, but not in a rush of impatience. It's like it knew it won already. The Raikou stands before you with its throbbing erection and hungry eyes leering down at your nice figure that was just there for the taking, only to grunt as you desperately swing a punch at the Raikou's leg as some kind of form of resistance. The legendary simply responds with a lift of that leg, only to stomp its muscled limb down to crush at your back muscles again. Your jaws spread out to cry out, yet not even a strained bit of air fumes out; only a cringing tongue and saliva works out of the maw. The hindpaw grinds down in a pivot to add extra stress and weight to your spine before prying off for an ending kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou body uselessly rolls against the ground to thud against the cracked wall again, dazed and glued to the ground from how much gravity was keeping your weight to the floor. Unable to keep your jaw from shuddering and your body from merely wincing on the ground, you can do nothing but listen to the faint cheers of the bandits egging on your demise as the legendary beast approaches its fallen prize. Any minute, your companions and the villagers could hatch the plan and cause a distraction. Yet nothing came, but you had a feeling the Raikou might soon with you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary merely stands in front of you with a shadow casted down like a tower. Electricity crackles off wildly from where it didn't have a rubber harness, eventually emitting a shockwave of lightning to erupt against your body and the surrounding arena, forcing a wild bark out of your mouth while frying up your figure. Left steaming and cringing, unable to move, you were as good as dead now for the legendary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hhh...h...nh...\" Is all you can muster from your unresponding lips with a vague view of the mighty beast looming over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now that the Raikou had to decide whether it wanted a nicely cooked Lucario meal, or a stunned toy to ravage its cock with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien chuckles, \"Oof, what a shame. Didn't even last a couple minutes. But, you wanted to be a part of something great, Lucario, so in the end you get what you want.

Through the darkness, your ears pick up on an intense rumble within the Raikou's flat stomach while a steaming exhale growls before your muzzle. Your lips wince in place at the sudden warmth closing in towards as you're left blindly panicking inside your own head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all of your strength, you attempt to lift a hand and mash it to the Raikou's own face as a last-ditch effort to prevent your demise. You could feel the rubber mask squish to your forepaw which gets a grunt out of the legendary beast before reaffirms its grip off from your face, but onto your neck. Your throat caves in to completely close together, reunited with a view of your predator. Its feral violet eyes glare into your worried pupils, and all the while, its large fanged maw drools. The beast opens its maw wide to show you his intimidating teeth, along with the fat tongue lavishing out to smother over your vision once more. Shadowed tongue-meat encompasses your world for a moment, with a dark view smearing around and the sloppy squishes of taste buds, fur, and saliva all sounding out to your flattened ears. Pleasured growls from the rather angry beast seem to show a sign of placation now that the monster could enjoy a meal after days of no food. Your lungs on the other hand weren't fairing well at the grip as they begin to slightly burn at the lack of oxygen. Drool coats over your face however, with brief glimpses of the glistening darkness the Raikou breathed during its taste-test of your rare Lucario flavor. Despite the humiliating defeat at the hands to a monster as you're licked over like a dessert, you're at least grateful the thing didn't just bite your head off on the spot, especially with the two tusk-like fangs idly soaked with its endless saliva-running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour legs begin to cringe in the air from the desperation of air needing to fill into your body once more, aching with the amount of pressure building up. If you weren't already light-headed beforehand, you certainly were now to a greater extent. Your vision was beginning to even blur the little surroundings you had to look at, with flickers of light trickling about. The slick slaps and grunts of the beast even lessen in volume to your ears to be muted into a soft long ring. If it were not for your face fur, your cheeks would be a visible drained indigo. \"H.....h.......nh....h...\" Is all you can muster to choke out while your eyes begin to roll up, and the lids begin to droop. Just as you're about to pass into the sweet safeguard of sleep, a literal jolt shocks out from the Raikou's fur and electrocutes your muscles. Almost like a reawakening or being splashed with cold water, your body spasms wildly awake again as you gag about loudly. Your legs resume to kick and your mouth is locked open from the pressure at your neck tightening. The Raikou leers a cold look as it finishes it taste test, all before slapping its tongue around to clean its wet mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith enough time wasted and its meal conscious still, the legendary tiger beast opens its maw wide to slowly inhale at the dog's muzzle as it shoves you right inside. Intense dark heat exudes over your head before its pinned inside the strong set of jaws, welcoming you as just another meal that will pack its hide. The hand on your neck thankfully exempts your throat of its crushing grip, only to then have fanged jaws clamp tight as a replacement. Your gag out again before being subjected to its hot tongue once more, licked in curls and wallows to give your face more than just your typical bath, especially with any feral you've come across. The Raikou certainly wanted to savor you. Your body is mashed to the infected's superior one, crushed to the strong and built figure the legendary naturally showcased in its fallen glory. It was like a brick wall of furry meat that refuse to budge, regardless of your hands attempting to shove at it or your weak legs kicking its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA resorting swallow sinks your head deeper into the darkness, which only seemed to increase the heat within its gullet. Ambient reverberations thrum in the narrow tunnel gripped to you, and the walls wobble in their clenching with every gulp or growl the beast emits. They at least drown out the sounds of the muffled bandits clamoring on about your defeat. You could only hope you could hear their demise if the plan works out for the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in this moment of complete loss, the tinge of fatigue always lulls you into getting close to sleep. However, the Raikou zaps his own figure by his natural aura of electricity, shocking you wide awake again. Flashes even flicker in the meaty interior as ever muscle and bone in your figure feels the hot sting of volts zapping through your body. With no current to escape, the electricity lingers to travel all throughout your limbs and body, eventually going back into the Raikou. Muffled cries escape your mouth as you felt fried like an actual cooked meal, to which your audience would agree. By now your rear and legs stick out from the Raikou's jaws, with its large fangs hooked over your ass cheeks as steam fumes off from both it and your dangling limbs. your hindpaws twitch at the leftover sensation of electricity tingling inside your structure and your heart pounds wildly away at the boost of energy. You'd plead a noise of mercy if you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a toss of its head though, the legendary beast works the remainder of your body down in a series of swallows. A hand grips at its stomach that swells out with your figure collecting together inside, orbing out into a firm, round gut for the large claws to grope over. Nosediving into the hot chamber, you're submerged into electric stomach acids that spark occasionally, zapping at the slick exterior of your salivated form. This keeps you wincing and kicking inside the tight organ for the Raikou to enjoy all the more. It watches its white gut sag about, bobbing in place from your movement, but keeps the gut constrained easily with a simply gripped palm of its hand. The tongue rims along its fangs when eyeing how much rounded its front, despite the buff figure not giving away and making for one hell of a series of strong stomach walls. The gut itself seems to compact around you as you whine out from the hot juices bubbling to your already steaming figure, clenching up, burning at your fur, and continuously zapping you in flashes. The occasional flicker of lights silhouette your curled body inside the gut for the bandits to see, chiming in on how pathetic you look at the might of the predator's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien muses, \"Mmnnh, even with most of its raw voltage contained, it's a shocking defeat for our lone hero~\" The Houndour simply rises up from his seat and leaves the arena behind to abandon you in your gurgling fate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Raikou snarls as it tugs at its restraints. The legendary was bound down by several men beforehand and dragged back into the pens with the other ferals. Various growls and chains sound out in the darkness of the underground arena gate, but the Raikou dominated them all. Thick rubber straps and cords keep it pinned down upon its knees, nearly latex'd up to the fullest extent the bandits could muster with such a violent beast. Thankfully with enough rubber and weight, they keep the legendary infected in its place, but now, housing a special guest. The Lucario inside was long gone; nothing more than a tingling electrical soup causing loud bubbles and churns in the Raikou's rounded front. The infected drools within its rubber face mask, exhaling out the leftover air the gurgles from its hot stomach. No mutiny or fall of the lumber mill would occur today, and no savior of the infection would last in a fallen legendary's stomach.</i></span></div></div>",

You grunt by the sudden tug, only to then be met eye-to-eye with the legendary beast's cock. It was still as fully erect from before, if not more after the match got it more worked up from how much it was throbbing and leaking with hot pre. It even worried you in your mind as you say occasional sparks emitting from the Raikou's body to make the shaft flex wildly in a jump. Not only that, but a fat knot swells greatly in a rotund shape that dared to stretch whichever poor hole it decided to use. With your groaning mouth so close, it was clear what the infected wanted as he stares you down with menacing violet eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a squeeze to your ears, he's able to control where your head is shoved and jams your face close to his lap where his rod bucks. The large cock smears against the side of your muzzle in an awkward miss, yet the Raikou still growls in bliss to feel attention to its meat, smearing the hefty dick around to smother the fur of your face with its domineering mass. The legendary is forced to retract and buck again, this time managing to dip its tip at your lips, yet your mouth attempts to seize up and refuse any entry beyond that point. You were fully aware that if the infected had its way, it was game over. Even the bit of pre in its maw would probably be enough for your mind to fall to the elusive mastermind's control. The Raikou snarls between its tusked fangs at your resistance and easily disputes it with a sudden electric shock of its body, coursing directly to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roar out in pain as your jaws pry right open for the shaft, and with a sudden thrust, the cock plugs itself right inside. Your tongue is jammed to the bottom of your mouth and pinned down. The walls of your cheeks bloat out as the Raikou enters right through, hardly caring about any foreplay to ease how many fat inches he could within your maw until the tip penetrates right through your throat. \"Gh-Ghhnkl---!\" You muffledly choke around the meat settling inside your gullet as your body jitters in place from the leftover joltage, unable to even lift a hand to bash the legendary in defiance; you couldn't muster blue embers of aura from your palms any more. It was done for. <i>You were done for.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a victorious roar, the infected Raikou pulls at your head to ease some inches apart, only to stuff them right back inside for another thrust. The legendary's knot bumps against your nose and lips as a warning of what was to come for you to endure, but even then, you were losing all hope at this point. Pre immediately spurts out from the Raikou's shaft right into your throat, with only one way to go. Entering in through esophagus, you didn't have the strength or willpower to try and cough it back out. You even lacked the space to do so. You were going to become a feral no matter what. Accepting this ill-fate, your throat naturally begins to swallow at the dick knowing it would be easier, or would at least speed up the process. Losing your mind wouldn't be such a bad way to go then being digested by some feral out in the wild, let alone being digested by any of the cruel bandits mocking your position from above the cage match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Raikou was incredibly forceful as he begins to bang away at your somewhat consensual mouth now, repeatedly bashing your lips in a rhythm to bounce his knot against them and glide across your tongue, feeding you his endless pre. The hot fluid even tingled like the sparks of his figure, making you only wonder how this mighty beast fell to the infection, what his name even was, or if he was on your side before becoming a victim himself. Still, the jeers and taunts above didn't help your mindset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahah~! Hear that? He's actually suckin' the thing's dick!\"<br>\r\n\"Guess that's one less Lucario in the world. We're gonna end up runnin' out of you things at this rate.\"<br>\r\n\"How 'bout ya wiggle yer tongue under his balls, he might play nicer, haw haw!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Damien chimes in with a cruel taunt, shaking his head, \"Oh what a shame for you. I guess you won't be stopping me or my little campaign here. But don't worry. As one of our infected fighters, I'll be sure you're pitted with all of your friends and traitors, eating and infecting them all~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last part hurt the most in your mind, but now the Raikou was really picking up the pace in his bucking hips. The knot slaps at your muzzle over and over, with his heavy sac flinging to smack at your jawline as well, feeling the hot churn of cum readied inside of it. With the snarls and thrusts picking up, you expected the Raikou to fully penetrate and have at you, but instead, it actually shoves your head and drags your mouth free from its rod. You crash onto your back in a coughing fit to take in some oxygen back into your lungs, but it wouldn't last long. The legendary is eager to grapple your legs into each of its hands to lift them wide up, curling your back and body some. The back of your head and shoulders flatten against the dirt and your ass is pointed straight up at the ceiling with your legs hooked over spread out above you, leaving you to stare at the caged ceiling of the bandits looking down at you, only to then be eclipsed by the large Raikou mounting against your exposed upside-down ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe larger male stands over your awkwardly hunkered body while grinding his now saliva-coated cock along the spread valley of your ass. Your knees cringe inward upon the moment you feel the beast kneading his wet cock tip right to your pucker after no warning. With your tail flopped against your back freely, it made for easy access to jam it firmly inside with a shuddering cry from your mouth to follow. The legendary penetrates you, easing his length all the same as he did with your mouth, albeit even more forcedly this time. The anxious cock stuffs right down to be hugged by the inner walls inside, getting the Raikou to snarl with some bliss at the tight texture snug to his shaft before resuming the swing of his hips. His heavy sac beats down against your rump with a pattern of claps to rampantly pound your rectum, leaving you to gasp and grunt futifully in response. Your legs bob about in the motions with your rear swallowing the full extent of the cock, to the point where he begins to squeeze his knot harder at the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes roll up at the pains of the ass pounding, waiting for it all to be over upon getting lost to the growling humps and slap of his weighted balls muting out the crowd above you. The Raikou stresses his swollen knot at the pucker, forcing the ring to cave in and begin slipping the orb inside. It took great pressure, along with some tightly pained whines from your throat, but your asshole eventually takes the full width of the knot and allows the rest of it to be swallowed right inside, tucked firmly behind the crease of your tailhole. \"A-Aaa------aghkk...!\" You wheeze out, twitching a single eyelid with hands weakly raking the dirt you were pounded against.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Raikou roars out in triumph and truly bunkers down to beat your figure down with his hips. His arms wrap more firmly around your legs as his body hooks over your own, squatting against your ass some to beat away with swing after swing, bashing your anus numb. The cock drills down with no breaks or pauses as your saliva and his pre mix together for a squelching ride to echo out in the arena, until finally, the legendary beast roars out. Intense pulses fatten the cock inside as cum spurts into your ass, spewing the walls full. Your jaw shudders in your whining moans, unable to focus or stare at anything except for the purple lights glaring right down to you. The penis spurts a wild amount of cum to the point where you can even feel his balls throbbing with amount they had to offer, filling you with intense gooey heat. There was definitely no coming back from this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Raikou appeared to not be done however as he tugs at his knot at your pucker, stressing the ring all over again in an endeavor to pry free. You choke out again from your throat cringing up together in the pressure, tensing your entire body as he pulls and pulls, stretching the anus until it finally gives. His knot pops free with a new glazing of his spunk coated around his dark shaft, slipping the cock out in one long slimy drag. Once the cocktip pops out, it spurts leftover shots of fertile infectious cum, roping over your taint and face as he purposely defiles you. Yet that wouldn't be the end of it either as the tip nudges right back into your numb hole, digging right back through again until hitting the knot. You whine in confusion, but the Raikou wasn't ready to call your session with him done yet. The knot forces its way through your asshole once more in a pained squeeze, only to start pulling again once it sealed inside, popping the knot roughly back out. You bark in misery with cringing legs and wavering vision as he begins to knot-fuck you, repeatedly cramming the swollen hilt inside and tugging it free, over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you were pleading in your mind for the infection take over as the feral rapes you into submission to its one true master; all for the howling crowd mocking you for it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jackal slams onto the ground with a dazed groan, shaking at the hands and knees. The drunk Typhlosion leers up at the crowd of bandits sneering at him, roaring back, \"Ey! I ain't, <i>hic</i>, done with any of ya yet! Lemme back up!\" He would not be allowed back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien mocks, \"We've disposed of the frog already and your precious leader. Now that just leaves you, the drunk idiot they wanted to save.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Typhlosion snarls, only to hear the gate of the arena open, revealing a growling tone and purple eyes. Jackal steps back in disbelief, awe-struck even through his drunkeness. An infected Lace charges through, eager to claim the dumbfounded prey.</i></span></div></div>",

One clamp of her thighs looked as though they could crush your spine in an instant, and should it come down to a grapple match, you doubt it'd be you landing on top. So in seeing that they had no means in extinguishing her fire, you decide that it's best to gauge some of her attacks to hopefully blast open or burn the wooden wall behind you away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rapidash roars once more and charges towards you, kicking up dirt behind her hoofs in a wild motion with swinging arms. You hold your position to wait for her arrival, and you certainly didn't have to wait long as she comes colliding towards you, but not before you squat and leap up a high jump to arc over the fiery horse. The Rapidash barely misses in catching you and rams the wooden wall of the arena, cracking it in some with the tall log columns torching a black soot from her mane. Your landing isn't as graceful as your ascension however. Your side slams into the dirt before you can muster yourself onto all fours, then to an unbalanced stance. It was as if your legs were jelly and your chest weighed a ton of bricks; gravity wasn't doing you any justice from your already abused figure, but you've dealt with harsher conditions beforehand...maybe. Thinking back to even downing the legendary Zapdos, the horde raid in Redeemer's Grotto, the wild Aerodactyl in the canyon; those were certainly a challenge, but at least you were well-rested beforehand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the beating you received earlier, it made even a one-on-one with a feral all the more dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour current thoughts on the matter would have to wait as the drooling Rapidash opens her maw before you with an orange glow in her throat, immediately spewing out a stream of flames out to you in a wild growl. You duck and hit the ground again in a heavy flattening, watching the fan of fire fume out to torch more of the wooden walls behind you. \"Just have to keep this up.\" You think to yourself as embers cling to the wooden outerwall, beginning to burn away at the bark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a gush of water suddenly rains down to splash the walls with a steaming extinguish, snuffing the fires right out. You struggle to a knee to see Damien's right-hand man, Bigby, grinning down with arms crossed together from the pit arena's ceiling cage. The Bibarel's mouth was soaked with water before his tongue cleans it back up. Apparently they already thought ahead of time in the case of you luring out the feral's flames. \"Damn beaver...\" You growl out lowly when struggling up to your hindpaws again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden arm swings its way to lariat you across the chest however, bashing your back onto the ground with the Rapidash stomping her hooves next to your body. You wince to see her lifting a mighty leg up to then stomp down onto your abdomen, forcing out a wild fume of air from your sputtering mouth, arching your upper body. The hoof grinds down into your flat stomach, aching the bruises already darkened there to force out a strained growl of pain out of your throat before it resorts into a pleading whine to get it off. You swing your arm to punch at the leg in hopes to unbalance the horse, only to feel her squat down, pressuring the leg weight harder down upon your injury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn open hand clasps over your head and pries you out from pin, holding you up by the single grip alone to be met face to face with your opponent. The purple-eyed Rapidash hungrily glares at you with a sudden smack of her fat tongue rimming over her thick lips, all before adjusting a better grip on you. \"Gnh--! No...!\" You wheeze out while her strong arms collect around your back which bind your arms to your sides and leaves your chest bashing together with her own. Her breasts cushion some of the force, but her muscle remains solid and unmoving like a wall of steel as her arms crush at your back, bending your spine in to arch once more. \"H-hHhgghahhh!\" You shudder out with a rolled back head, gaping maw, and white-showing eyes. The pain felt as though you were going to be snapped in half like a twig, but the horse was going to rid you in a far different manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer wet mouth pries open to show the columns of drool seeping from her flat teeth and hungry gullet, inhaling slightly to guide your face closer. Your heart thumps wildly as you feel yourself closing in to the hot and slick space, yet your muscles are useless in her hold to avoid the fate awaiting you. The frame of the horse's mouth encompasses your vision, and you're met with the slimy blob of a tongue smothering over your muzzle and face. Slick sounds echo in your ears amongst the darkness while the equine bites over your head, pinching the teeth in powerfully to keep you in a startled place. You can hear the faint cheers of the men outside watching your demise, laughing and pointing out how you look right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face burns with embarrassment and anger, or perhaps that was the growing heat doing so from the Rapidash's throat packing your snout right in. The gullet easily gets a grip of your muzzle and pulls you right on inside, leaving your legs wincing outside off the ground and your hands clenching useless fists of air. \"G-Gglmph!\" You emit into her gullet, only answered with a hungry growl down from her belly, which hadn't been fed in who knows how long. The ravenous feral was eager to fill her stomach there and then, skipping any foreplay of tasting the rare Lucario snack. The teeth repeatedly snap over your battered figure, getting yipes and cringes from your body as the arms feed your upper body down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intense heat wracks your mind as you nose-dive to the hot tomb awaiting to claim your meat, rumbling louder and louder as the inches to the stomach valve lessen. The esophagus was powerfully tight, hugging you into that of a wrestling grip when pulling you forward, showing no signs of a struggle or weakness. Both outwardly and inwardly her figure was mighty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the horse tongue smearing over your own stomach now, bathing the yellow fur flat and gripping your legs together in her hands, solidifying as to what you were now. Your brain attempts to think of some way you can turn things around and not die in the horse's gut, praying the others could save you, but the sudden plop of the valve against your nose tugging you in down to the juicy furnace gave you a different impression of what was to come...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The infected Rapidash flicks her head back, guzzling down the wincing hindpaws in a final series of gulps back snapping her teeth shut, jerking her entire meal down to finally collect in her stomach. The horse's muscle gut swells out some, but snags tightly to her prey in a flexing squeeze, making things awfully tight for the Lucario as he's dunked into the bubbling juices. Her fingers knead into the belly as best they could, tracing over food's curvature while the Lucario shifts around inside, moaning from the wild heat baking him inside as his fur begins to break down already. He wouldn't last long inside, hardly even able to jostle the stomach in place before it eventually settles out, and his last bubbly breath is sputtered out. The Rapidash eagerly slaps her stomach in a gong of victory before roaring out a stream of flames above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a gush of water smashes down onto the horse, flattening her down and snuffing out much of her mane of fire. She growls out in rage upon the impact, shuddering on hands and knees while roaring to keep her anger up, crackling the steam fuming off of her to ignite her flames. Another Water Gun attack dowses her in a strong torrent of water, smashing her back flat until the feral is left weakly groaning on the ground. Bigby wipes his mouth from above and mutters, \"That dumb mutt couldn't have lasted a bit longer than that? She went down in just a few squirts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien claps his hands and laughs, \"No matter, he's done away with now. We have other guests to attend to and toss down there.\" He hits the pit's war gong again to summon the gate down below to open, and two of the guards there carefully approach the feral Rapidash. In cautious glances, they see the horse was barely conscious, steaming wet and left sprawled on the ground with a gurgling gut. Damien orders from above, \"Restrain her back up, and clamp that mouth of hers closed so the Lucario stays down and boils~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards nod and grip the feral's arms, pulling the Rapidash away with its legs dragging on the ground and its gut bobbing in place from each tugging motion. The canine hero inside melts into a hot soup to pack onto the horse's body fat, but even that would burn away too considering her physique...</i></span></div></div>",

Your vision transitions from the furious flaming unicorn before you to tilting upwards to the circled cage of bandits glaring down at your failure, laughing once your back hits the dirt. An audible groan is released from your muzzle as you feel every muscle in your figure punish you for the extraneous work you put it through in the past abuse, and gravity works in favor to your pain by cementing you flat out before your foe. Your heart suffers an aching tinge knowing you're dead meat at this point unless your companions can raid the fortress in time. The thought of being saved fills your mind, only to be stripped away as the infected Rapidash neighs with heated fury before tackling her heavy weight on top of you. The muscled woman outmatched you in size and easily pins your arms to the ground in her grappling hands, not that it would matter. You offer little resistance as the bandits above make fun of you with the feral on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer purple eyes glare over your head, huffing from her nostrils a great deal, crackling her mane of fire with an intense heat. A column of hot saliva runs down from her thick lips to run over your own cheek, eliciting a tense jolt of your body which is only met with a ferocious slam from the Rapidash. You wheeze at the punishment your strained back receives before shuddering back as still as you can to let the infected know that it's already won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer groin easily straddles itself right down on your lap to bring down an immediate grind to your genitals. Her thighs spread out wide for the practically steaming slit smear across your sheath to taunt its natural desires. \"H-Hhhaugh...\" You groan aloud with the back of your head grinding firmly more down on the ground as she works her hips. The hot nethers mash and drag about at your coerced cocktip, beckoning your length to arise from its hiding place better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't help that several voices were making fun of you amidst the defeating event already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah! He couldn't help himself! He's gonna let some female infected rape him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at the mutt not trying to squirm; he's so damn eager to bust a nut! Doesn't that idiot know what's gonna happen to him once it's over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Round two never even happened! He fell like a rock right from the start. Fuckin' pussy...! I'm goin' for another drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better luck next time, Lucario! Oh wait...hehehh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully their cutting words are muffled out by the aroused roar neigh of the flaming unicorn straddled over you, lowering her panting mouth down close. Those purple predatory eyes stare into your pupils with almost a curious look to them since the feral was beginning to discover the fact that you weren't fighting back at all. Her nostrils huff at your face some to inspect your aroma as her wet lips spread open to reveal her fat equine tongue welcoming itself to your muzzle. Your vision is obscured briefly with the dark insides of her jaws, taunted with the ever-hungry gullet of her throat and the flat wet teeth that would love more than anything than to bite over your head. Her tongue slathers across your muzzle before draping down to drag against your  jawline, flicking off your chin without much cleaniness or care. Almost like candy, her lips seal over your snout for the feral to tug on with a hungry suckle, slurpin loudly to probe your muzzle in and out from her mouth that gets your strained back to arch and your pinned wrists to clench into fist, grasping at nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mmnnhh...\" You groan out muffled until her tongue suddenly crams in between your own lips, stuffing out your mouth to feel the hefty muscle fatten and flex inside, mixing one another's saliva. Your heart skips a beat knowing just what it means for the fluids to join your body. A tinge of guilt strains at your mind as you contemplate there being a chance that you weren't fully infect. Yet it wasn't going to be so, and you knew this. You were either feral fat, or a feral itself. It seemed like it was only going to be this way for you since the start of your journey, but you ached to have made it out just long enough to at least stop the bandits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour self-guilt wouldn't last too long from all of the arousing attention you would receive however. The Rapidash pries her huffing maw off your muzzle to lick over her lips, having given your fangs and cheeks a thorough swabbing. Straddled on top of you still, she works her hips to raise up, finding your growing erection to clumsily dab its tip against her slit before SLAMMING her waist down without warning. It was almost a painful insertion for you alone as the cock is firmly jammed up into the hot tunnel in an unceremonious pound. Her hips shift again just to firmly plant down on your cock again, tugging up the remaining length and even roughly swallowing in your entire knot. \"Ugnh!!\" You groans you with a fist punching the dirt, regretting surrender now. You almost preferred to be eaten, because it was clear this wasn't going to be a sensual session between you and your captor. Too late now considering she knotted you into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a growling neigh, she tugs hard to pull her nethers back up, lifting your ass off the ground with your locked dick forced to stick against your groin, all before being slammed back down just as a final way to make sure you were trapped. A loud bark escapes your mouth that coerces the feral to vicely trap you in your pinned state to motion her lap up while her arms of might keep you flat to the floor. Your knot strains at her widening nethers, stretching and forcing intense pressure to the swollen orb that gets you to draw out a long whining moan until you're actually popped free from the pull. Your knot snaps out, yet the remaining length of your cock remains as she bears down on you again, straining to the lips at your knot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Gahh...st-st...\" You were going to plead her to resist abusing your member, yet your knot is crammed down and swallowed inside again, trapping your cock once more. \"N-Nn!!\" Your body cringes about now as a struggle while the Rapidash has her way with the structure of your dick. Your knot is quite literally fucked by the slit as it mashes over it, before forcing it to pluck out, again and again, jabbing your cock tip along the intensely hot walls of her already hot figure. Steamy moans bellow out from the Rapidash's wet jaws while she wrestles her groin alone to dominate your knot, filling the air with the loud pops and intakes of it all. Laughter joins as a chorus to the knot-fucking, later joined with every sharp gasp you inhale with every yank to your crotch. This was it. Of all the ferals and psychopaths you've managed to evade, was this truly what you deserved. Your vision was growing more blurry, dulling out at the faces high above staring down at you through the pit's cage-top while your body steadily grew more numb, despite also growing hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rapidash's mane flares wildly as her rhythm increases, and with her slit swollen wide and your knot helplessly lubed up with the pre forcedly squeezed out, it made it all too easy for the feral to rail down on you in desperate plunges. The moment rolls by until your orgasm is coerced to unload inside of her, eager to just finish the torture already. With the heavy knot-intakes, you cum all too quickly to unleash hot globs of semen into her figure, yet even the natural juices of her own body dominate the temperature of your semen, heating up your rod all the more. Once the final flex of your penis gives out, you're left sweating in the sweltering heat with your crotch aching for relief. And yet, the feral wasn't down. Her breaths huffs for a solid minute to gain air into her lungs until she readies her groin again, wanting to earn an orgasm herself while you disappointingly came too early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait...agh..\" You groan to deaf ears as your knot is strained against her nethers before popping back inside. Your head and eyes roll back, gagging to suffer yet another knotting session with the horny horse for all of your enemies to see and mock you for...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Rampant huffs of steam fume from the Rapidash's maw as she works her rear end up and down. Leaned back on her hands and knees, the infected unicorn uses her muscular strength to ascend and descend her rear end to stuff the Lucario's knot about under her raised, flaming tail. Loads of cum ooze from her spread and exposed thighs, having milked Lace of his load with many of the bandits watching above having grown bored of the dog's demise to continue with their duties of weeding out all of the other intruders. Damien however was the last to watch, noting the barely-conscious Lucario growling lowly with drooped eyelids. Despite the drunken and exhausted look, the hero sported purple glowing eyes, tiredly wavering while being fucked and infected by the fellow Rapidash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Houndour smiles with hands clapping slowly to mock the defeated canine. \"Game over, hero~\" He muses before giving the guards the go-ahead to bring the Rapidash back into the gates. A water-type spews a cannon of water against the infected horse, extinguishing her flames and splashing her body against the wall. She growls out tiredly, but with so much of her energy devoted into infecting the Lucario, she is quickly restrained in stone by a rock-type to be dragged away, growling. The newly feral-made Lucario is grabbed by the legs, dragged away without much worry of a struggle considering it was fading back and forth of slumber. The gate closes behind the Lucario feral, added to the collection of infected contestants that would be unleashed on the other captives. Some of which would even recognize their once-leader...only to join his fate, or join his fat...</i></span></div></div>",

Aura slowly builds to emit a fiery blue light that gets the infected Lickitung to step back in caution, but those hungry purple eyes certainly didn't waver, locked in a ravenous gaze that could only wonder what it's like to have you squirming in stomach. The chants of the bandits from above obviously cheer for your demise, but you drown out the opposing ambience to focus in at any move the Licktung would attempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blubbery being steps to the right to which you pivot to never keep it away from your aim, and you could practically feel the creature actually thinking how to approach you. Getting in close would be a sure-hit, and lashing the tongue could provoke a dodge and a blast from that Aura Sphere now built up in your hands. It certainly wasn't as large as your previous uses of it considering your fatigue, but something was better than nothing. You weren't going to die here and now to some tongue-monster for the joy of punks living out in the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sudden gut-wobbling stomp, the infected Lickitung lets out a loud Screech to suddenly daze your ears, forcing them to fold back along with your body to wince in place from the tough sound. Your eyelids repeatedly blink to ease yourself from the move only to hear the Licktung's heavy body stomping its way towards you. Now was your chance. Before it could reach you, you unleash the spinning sphere of aura at it. Expecting a hit, you see it swipe its fat tongue to actually shield itself from the aura, but it defeated your expectations when it actually curls its tongue around the sphere to swing its body around. In the momentum of the pivot, it keeps the hot ball in place surprisingly and flings it right back at you! You bark in shock before you're struck by your own attack, blasted against the wall in the small blue explosion. \"G-GhhYyuuachk!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes roll up to where only the whites show as you heavily slump onto your knees, body smoking some. The Lickitung's own tongue steams from the aura heat, although with a few calming and gummy suckles after it retracting back in its mouth, the fat muscle is flopped back out to reveal no real injury from the counter. Just your luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an endeavoring groan, you attempt to rise only to be punched by the swipe of the tongue. You're smacked onto your side with a wet pop before struck against once the muscle slams against your chest. You heave a wheeze when crashing onto your back, groaning with only the blurry circled crowd glaring and sarcastically egging you on down below in the pit. It's then that you feel the Lickitung grabbing your legs to both lift and spread them apart while your hands busy themselves into digging at the dirt floor in order to escape the infected's grasp. Too tired and too dazed, you're left with that tongue to thoroughly explore your body as it slaps underneath your ass to hungrily work over your genitals, stomach, chest, and face with one long drag. Saliva smears along your fur in the motion before the even slicker underside of the tongue works its way down your body in a repeating motion. Your sheath unwillingly thrums from the attention and your legs wince in its hold. A whining gasp escapes your mouth to which your audience laughs at. With front row seats to your humiliating end, they waste no time in berating you as you're lapped over like a sweet treat for the murring Lickitung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoices all around bestow in your humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all a Lucario can do? No wonder why there's not a lot of 'em!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check it! He's actually getting hard! Hey pup, might as well beat one off before it's all over, prey slut~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I blinked. Did the match just end? Hehheh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last fucker lasted like twice as long as this! Do I gotta go down there and show you how to beat a feral myself? It's a miracle this pooch lasted this long in the wild.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd probably hear more berating words if it wasn't for the silhouetting tongue lifting high above your head that slams down against your face, bashing against you in meaty slaps to wetly deafen your ears. \"G-Ghk! Agk! H-Hnnh!\" Your muzzle gags and chokes on its own groans with your slick body throbbing on the ground from the constant taste torture you had to endure. After one last good smack, the Lickitung was sated in its punishing delivery to revel in a sneering growl when looking over its slimy progress on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour legs are dropped onto the ground before its tongue actually tucks underneath you, sliding along your back to lift you off the ground. You can't even really see at this point from the foggy darkness blanketing your vision, and the crowd was nearly muted from the ringing in your ears followed with the fat muscle squishing just behind them. Your back lays along the triumphant tongue that managed to defeat you with just its mere size and weight that was strong enough to suddenly lash upwards to flip you over. Your chest and stomach slap onto the bed of tastebuds with your chin lazed along its middle crease. It was a straight slide forward to the open drooling jaws of the Lickitung predator. Glistening toothless gums drool columns of saliva amidst the darkness of a rather thick gullet that was already wincing to claim the delicious Lucario meal it won. You managed to surpass all the ferals and opposing predators thus far, from the Grotto invasion, the Aerodactyl in the canyons, the infested marshes and cruel hive. Even a legendary avian was bested by you and your team. And yet you fell to a mere fat feral's tongue in a pit of dirt. You wondered if this was some cruel joke from Arceus or if this was deserving of you to be defeated by such a being. Regardless, it was dinner time. The pudgy monster wanted to pack on some extra pounds that a Lucario could easily add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGravity shifts for you as the Licktung lifts its broad and long tongue upwards to make as a ramp towards your inevitable demise. Your useless arms and legs hanging over the sides of the pink meat shudder to even begin fighting off the tongue, but it would be too late to ever try. The curved tongue makes it easy for you to just slide in facefirst into the welcoming jaws that powerfully chomp around your head. Wet gums clamp and seal tightly around your world to deafeningly squelch when it begins to actually chew. Your face and head are squished about amongst the murring chompers mashing about with idle suckles and smack. Your hands attempt to grapple against the side of the tongue and push yourself away, bit its lips were sealed, and the gluttonous throat walls yank your muzzle in with a forceful swallow. The muffled laughter and cheers from the bandits dissipate the deeper you are gulped into the hot darkness. The fat throat walls squish about as your furry body is slid and fed into the infected's mouth, grazing that crease of its tongue to ride along the shameful arousal throbbing against your stomach. Your breaths are tight and shallow, just as much as your struggles to survive are. It was as if each booming swallow working you down was another drop of your drive to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tongue curls more to cup against your rear end, applying a firm shove to jam you down quicker now that its truly earned its take. Your nose pokes through the stomach valve into the extremely hot chamber that ambiently inflates and deflates in the rumbling breaths of the fat beast during the exercise of swallowing all the meat you had to offer. Your legs stick out lazy from out of its lips that the Lickitung is all too eager to gnaw on before flicking its head back, dooming yet another competitor tossed into the pit for Damien's pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurled inside its fat stomach, the chubby walls already begin to compact against you with the hot enzymes burning at your fur amidst the wobbling jostles and heavy gurgling rumbling the meaty tank. You shimmy your legs and squeeze your arms out to make space, hoping to last in this things stomach until someone of your team comes to your rescue, but all you receive as an answer is a heavy stewing growl of the stomach with the acids rising higher up on your body. It was awful you had to lose to an infected glutton, but in front of the mere bandits you hoped to stop was truly salt in the wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeak kicks merely wobble the stomach chamber, and it wouldn't be long until your panting muzzle submerge completely into the full pool of the Lickitungs mighty juices...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damien scoffs, \"Well that was rather easy.\" The Houndour glares down through the wooden domed fence to see the fat Lickitung's gut bob about from the digesting Lucario trapped inside aching for escape. The Lickitung merely drools in bliss, swinging its tongue from side to side while fondling over the pink and yellow gut jostling in place amongst the bubbling gurgles. The bored bandit leader then glances over to his right-hand man, Bigby, and orders, \"Find anyone else that's with this Lucario. One by one, they'll either feed our men or feed the pit beasts~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bibarel grins and nods, heading away while gathering some of the crowded men at the pit. The audience begins to scatter overtime now that the show was over, leaving Lace the Lucario stewing motionlessly inside the Lickitung's gut. Out of the entire adventure, at least he made something enjoyable to watch for a passing moment...</i></span></div></div>",

You'll have to come by later.\" You wheeze out, choking on your own words here and there when looking defiantly up at the Houndour bandit leader. You wouldn't cave into this runt's demands, even if that meant the worst. Damien's eyes flare and with his hands curling into fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RrrrrRRRAAHH-!!!\" He screams aloud with flames fuming from his maw. His own hindpaw is caught on fire as he goes to stomp and crush your head with it. You're ready to meet your end in this moment, only to witness Sapphire actually shove Damien slightly at his side to have his hindpaw smash the wooden boards next your head. You see the scorched panels easily tearing to the heat and power, which could've easily have been your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien growls, almost looking like he'd strike at the Persian, but she huffs, \"Oh calm down darling, I know you like your violent tantrums, but he knows where my brother is. We can easily coax him into telling us where he is than make a mess here at our balcony. Please, I don't want any of the blood on the couch deeear...\" She says in a fake whining voice as she embraces against the young Houndour. Damien huffs from his nostrils, attempting to calm down while glaring down at you. Sapphire runs her claws over his chest while murring, \"We'll get him to tell us where he is...willingly. He just needs some persuasion~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien grunts, \"Bigby. Get Lance here some Happy Juice...\" The beaver smiles and goes downstairs into the recreational bar area where most of the bandits weren't mingling with one another, looking up at the cracked balcony their leader was interrogating you at. The fire canine looks to his female Persian slut with more content eyes, \"Oh, forgive me sweet little thing. I just want this mutt's head smashed all over the floor...he might have hurt your dear brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female Persian purrs, giving a slow and affectionate lick to Damien's neck, \"Shhh...you can do that after he's had his drink...in front of all the other guards. Red's a good color on you~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou choke out from the looming threat brought upon you, realizing these bandits truly were crazy. But they had a central figure all to point at: Damien. You weren't for sure, but you'd bet your life that he was to blame for all of these people's violent and primal motives, and in the end, you might just end up doing so. Bigby returns with a bottle of some kind of blue fluid inside with Damien showing his gratitude, \"Ah, perfect. Please. Lance looks a bit thirsty. Care to help his dry, aching throat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBigby grins, \"Abso-fucking-lutely~\" The Bibarel grabs the top of your head and keeps your face tilted up with a vicious tug. You yowl and grapple at his arm, but his other hand suddenly shoves the open end of the mysterious bottle into your jaws. The neck of it jabs inside with its opening emptying the juicy fluid into your gullet with little space to stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hkk! Ghkkbllp!\" You garble in distress, trying to fight it off. Yet, Bigby stomps on your tail, forcing another bark out of your open muzzle to allow more of the drink spill in. The stuff leaks over your cheeks and the sides of your jaw, but the majority of it funnels into your throat that's forced to swallow it all down. It had a fruity and minty flavor to it, something foreign to your tastebuds though collectively. Whatever it was, you didn't want it. Eventually the bottle is tucked away from your mouth to leave you slumping onto your hands and knees again. \"Kkhhsspllkch! H-Hhughhh...\" You sputter the juice from your panting jaws before glaring at Damien. \"Wh...What is this...\" You growl lowly at Damien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Houndour murrs, \"Happy Juice. A nice little drink one of my men concocted. An interesting little mixture of substances. Usually we use it on the toys downstairs, but I think it will be suitable for you with enough doses...\" And just as he says that, the ebony of his dfur becomes darker with the orange fur becoming far more vivid. Colors in general begin to distort and become almost dream-like. A yearning sensation builds in your body, making you feel warmer than usual, but you didn't know what you were yearning for... Damien mentions, \"In fact, Bigby. Give him another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beaver yanks on your head again before you can resist, and once more, the bottle is plunged into your mouth. But what shocked you most is that you weren't fighting back. You just sat on your knees stupidly, swallowing away at the coaxing beverage working its way over your tongue. And after you finish the last swallow you...moan? At least, it sounded like one. The bottle plucks away with Damien settling back onto the couch with Sapphire. His thighs spread and his voice demands, \"Come here.\" Your eyes wince, and you almost get up to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No...I...\" You stutter, but your mind feels a sudden fog blanket your thoughts and reasoning, unable to work cohesively together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien growls, \"Come. Here.\" For some reason, you do. Your body heat increases as you do, shifting on your hands and knees to the villain you vowed to stop, and here you were approaching him like a feral animal. He pats a hand to his inner thigh and grunts, \"Happy Juice is a funny thing, you know. It can make even the strongest of stubborn people...\" Damien suddenly grabs you by the ears and yanks your face in between his legs, nosing at his balls and sheath, \"...into cum-hungry whores. Now be a good boy and <i>lick</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't want to. And yet you also wanted to. Something in your mind told you it was wrong, but because of how wrong it was, it coerced your lips to part for some reason to light pants against your enemy's ball sac. Your tongue extends out to lightly cup the orange furred sac onto it. Your brows pinch down as you angrily groan, \"I...won't...I...\" You can't stop yourself though. The taboo of giving in was too much for your sudden arousal to stop. Your tongue roams over Damien's balls to feel with their weight and to smear over the fiery fur down along the hot orbs. \"H-Hhhh...\" You exhale against them, and with the more you lick over them, the more coerced you are to seal your lips to one, kissing it and suckling lightly at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire laughs at you and purrs, \"Ohhoho, look how quick he gave up! Not even the whores downstairs fell under that quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien grunts, \"It's because he knows his place.\" You would attempt to growl at the Houndour, but a yank on your ears with your nosetip digging against his sheath simply roused a moan out of your neck instead. Your nerves felt like they were on fire in the heat with your own erection sporting out dangerously quick as you polish the enemy's balls. The Houndour pulls at your ears to face up at him as his own ebony knotted rod rises, twitching to show off its impressive thickness when it simply swells more and more outwardly, proving to actually be larger than your own. Just another insult to injury. The young canine growls with a fanged grin as he bats the twitching meat against your muzzle, stringing pre onto your face, \"Like what you see, boy? Hungry for dick? Tell ya what, I'll let you suck me off if you tell me what happened to Ruby. Then you can milk these balls dry that you're so fond of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Gghhrr...\" You growl out, only to start drooling now that the black cock was filling your vision with pre running over the top of your muzzle. \"...He's...He's in jail.\" You admit, unsure of how to lie to Damien any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jail? What jail?\" He demands and grips at your large ears more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hedgen. I knocked him out. Jailed him there.\" You admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire shows a face of agitation. \"You di-... Why?! Why there? Why come back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't want to confess, yet Damien was already grinding the underside of his cock over the top of your muzzle, in between your eyes. It distracts you from hiding your friends and allies' invasion plan enough to leave you groaning out, \"...We...needed to get Jackal back...and we're going to burn the mill down tonight by the underground tunnels, my friends and I, and Hedgen...with the mayor's help. Hhhh...y-you got what you wanted, now give me what I want...\" You whine out, shocked that you even said such a thing, but your arousal was clear as day in its desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien glares down some, thinking on all that you just confessed, \"...You pathetic little bitch. Trying to take down everything I've built up in the most cowardly way, have you? It's good to know that Ruby's still alive. I'll personally save him from his cage as Hedgen burns. I would've like to have kept that village standing, but if you want to destroy this mill? Then you've doomed that town.\" He glances over to Bigby and retorts, \"Rally the men. Get down in the tunnels. Not a single prisoner. Get rid of them all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBigby beats at his chest. \"From the bedrock~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large beaver heads down to follow the orders with Damien glaring back down at you. \"To the summit.\" The Houndour mumbles before he adds, \"You can suck it now, needy prick. I should probably kill you too, but...probably not when you're still of use to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't wait a moment longer. Your mouth immediately wraps around the black meat to have it dog over your tongue with its head nudging at your gullet. \"Gllk...mph...\" Muffledly moaning around the dickmeat, you groan with shut eyes to suck the villainous dog off, starving for his cum. Your hands even hang onto his legs as he casually reclines back, allowing free reign to suck his meat off. Your tongue glazes the black flesh with drool as your throat tucks at its tip, guzzling in the pre spurting out from it all with your willing work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien glares down at you, unimpressed and displeased with how easy it was for your downfall, \"...We're going to fuck you until your heart stops beating, and your head will be mounted on my bedroom wall with this stupid slutty expression you have on right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour drugged mind didn't care. This was your fate. You bob your head back and forth, swallowing with loud moans and drooling jaws.</span></div></div>",

Your seized up neck is pulled by the collar and leash you're forced to follow by whoever controlled you this time. Sapphire's purring voice murrs, \"Lay yourself out, boy. Damien will be here soon~\" You had a blindfold on which obscures your vision, but you oblige and spread out more comfortably as you can on what you guessed to be Damien's bed. It had been several days since your invasion's downfall and you remained unaware of who survived the assault, but it was clear that you and your team failed. Whether they escaped or became belly fat, you would never know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother voice purrs out, a male one that you know all too well, \"How much of a dose did you give it this time, sis? I'm surprised it isn't in a coma yet.\" It was Ruby, the Persian twin Damien rescued from Hedgen's jail. The male cat had eagerly punished you for your last encounter with him, showing no mercy in raping, clawing, and berating you. You had several close calls to when Ruby wanted to slit your throat or with Sapphire wanting to crush your head between her powerful thighs, but Damien convinced them otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire reinforces your state of being by purring to her twin brother, \"Hmhm, it's still a brainless slut. It can't even talk anymore! Just moan and groan more than a feral does.\" It was at the cost of your sanity and willpower though. No longer were you worried about the infected, the mastermind behind it all, or your past friends. You live to give sex, and you might just die doing so. You were certainly a favorite for the bandits to use, locked in a stock with a etched sign of 'Failed Hero' displaying above you in the main recreation room. Your ass would be presented out for any passerby to enjoy in gropes, rimming, and most noticeably a humping ground. 'Cum Dump' is your new name now, and as it was apparent, you were no longer Lace nor Lance, simply an object now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby and Sapphire meanwhile caress one another, smearing their curvy bodies against the other with their hands exploring their short-furred figures. Ruby murrs, \"I missed you so much before. I promise, I'll never let any stupid mutt like that get the better of me again, forgive me Saf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to apologize to me, Roobz. But you can make it up to me...\" The incestuous twin curls her arms around Ruby's back as her smiling lips bite onto his neck some, \"...by having some double trouble with the mutt before Damien gets here. What do ya say~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby mrowls to the clawed hands tracing down the crease of his spine before they clasp to his taut ass. He returns the favor by clapping his own to her rear end, rolling the cheeks around as they grind chests together. \"Mmmhh...think we have enough time~? I could fuck him all day, every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we won't be able to do anything with him if you keep giving me all of the attention.\" The female Persian murrs as she stares into his crimson eyes with her azure ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer brother squeeze tight to her rear as he leans his mouth into hers, exhaling, \"Sorry, you deserve it far more than that he does though.\" There, the two twins locks lips together with their heads alternatively tilting. Their tongues dance together in idle wet strokes with Sapphire cushion her brother's flat chest to mold against her breasts. The two slutty cats truly loved each other. But eventually, Ruby breaks his moment with his sibling to eye you on Damien's bed and he approaches with sauntering steps. \"Alright cum dump, spread your legs. Time for another round~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan in a response, but eventually, you instinctively spread your legs up in the air in a v-shape while your hands weakly grab at your ass cheeks. Squishing your palms and fingers into them, you invite the Persian slut over to you. Your face burns a permanent red as your cock painfully winces against your stomach. It had been days where your erection hardly ever subsided. The Happy Juice kept it in a constant needy state. It didn't help that a metal ring was tightened underneath your knot, keeping you from reaching an orgasm. It was all part of your punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby runs fingers along the wincing underside of your dick, eliciting a tight whine from your mouth. He taunts, \"Good boy. Let's put that numb asshole of yours to good use while I still can. Who knows when Damien's gonna drill you in half, hhhmmh~\" The Persian slides onto the bed onto his knees while wrapping his arms around your widened legs, eyeing your stretched ring nervously clenching together. Ruby was at least proud that you could still even muster any movement there. The flaccid sheath of the cat smears along the spread pucker as he coyly purrs down, \"Hhhh...oh how the mighty fall. You were stupid to think you could handle my beloved Houndour. And don't worry, I got the payback I needed to on that frog friend of yours. He's packing my ass nicely~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slaps your thigh to startle another moan from your panting mouth as you rock your hips about, humping at nothing with your stressed out cock. You feel a new sensation however with Sapphire sliding herself to the bed. At first you're unable to understand what was going on, but soon enough the female cat purrs down at you, \"Mmhhh...your head's a perfect fit between my thighs. What I would give to have you sliding up inside right now...~\" On her knees, Sapphire leans over to keep her hands flat on your chest with her thighs sandwiching your head. Your muzzle is locked to her nude slit riding up on your nose and lips which sends a flexing squeeze to the tantalizing walls clenching your world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmitting a moan, Sapphire adds, \"You're going to eat me out before you're eaten...so don't disappoint me, cum dump. It might be your last time to service all of this~\" She didn't have to ask twice, or even ask at all. Your limp tongue lazily drags in between her legs to run over the pussy grinding down at your muzzle. The lips shiver in place as your tongue works along the sensitive flesh with Sapphire emitting a tone of satisfaction, purring warmly with closed eyes. \"...That's it. C'mon brother, hurry up and fuck its brains out. Damien could be here any moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't rush me. I want him to feel every inch of this, if there's anything still left of him in that melted head of his.\" Ruby retorts with a grin as his erection is a stiff size and state. The head probes at the welcoming asshole of yours before it slaps right up inside, igniting your overly-pleasured nerves to firework with the sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....U-Uuhh...Aahh...\" You can only escape dimwitted responses from your mouth with eyes rolled back. Despite this being just one of many cocks digging into your rear, it still felt as good as the first one since you've been degraded into your new life. Ruby in fact wastes no time in hilting his meat into your rear end. The malleable entrance easily swallows in every inch of the length to weakly pull at it once it's nestled inside. The male Persian mrowls to himself by the light tightness squeezing around his rod before pulling back just to smack right into your accepting ass again. Your legs bounce each time he does this, bobbing about with the pattern of humps slapping against your ass and taint. \"Ah...nnh...uah...hhah...gh...nh...\" You tiredly whine with each hit which simply pants your breath to Sapphire's nethers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tail whips with her hands tug at your leash to really dig your face to her nethers. \"Deeper. Really wallow that tongue in there~\" She orders, and you oblige. Tastebuds stroke over her moistened slit and clit before stuffing the muscle's tip into the folds. It entices a happy yelp from the girl before shivering in a completel state of bliss. A hand flattens to her waist as she savors the tongue swirling within her vagina, lubricating the already pre-soaked walls to make a slick mess leaking down your muzzle. The sloppy sounds eating her out was enough to ruffle her thin fur and force her cheeks red. \"Aaauuaaahh...atta' boy~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby's butt and thighs wobble with each thrust, doing the same to your own when they meet. Glancing to his loved one, he leans his head forward to meet with Sapphire's, kissing her once again. The two Persians share this moment together, dominating the hero while pertaining to their own relationship. Slutty mrowls and purrs fill the bedroom air until a voice clears his throat. They break the wet kiss to see Damien having arrived with a smug grin and crossed arms. \"You two can't keep your hands off of that thing, can you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male cat answers as he simply continues to drive his cock into your rear end with audible humps, \"Hhh, if it were up to me, I'd have already eaten this bastard and given some extra cushion for you and Sapphire to fondle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien wraps his arms around Ruby from behind, swaying with him in his thrusts while laying his chin to the cat's shoulder to watch it all happen, \"That does sound nice, but it's a one-time meal only. If anyone's eating it, it'll be me. I fed you his friends as a favor for that, remember...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby rolls his head back to allow the Houndour to bite his teeth roughly at his neck, moaning longingly to the air, \"I know, but, hhoouuhhh...I can't stop thinking about this stupid mutt moaning in my belly as I stew him down...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or me raining him down your rod should I get to unbirth him~\" Sapphire states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You let me handle him when the time comes...for now...let out all that stress into that rear of his. You're still so pent up, dear...~\" Damien murrs into the cat's ear, rousing another moan from Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Lace's life would be spent here, in the lumber mill. The Lucario is simply dumped off the side of the bed with cum leaking out from his ass and pre staining his blindfolded face. He whines and bucks his hips at nothing still, unable to escape or think as the Persian twins caress their lover on his bed, sleeping soundly, spent from their orgasms. It'll only be so long until one of them finishes the hero for good...</i></span></div></div>",

It smashes into pieces against the Aggron's head, leaving the metal beast's face to turn slightly to the side from the hit, but his aggravated expression didn't change whatsoever. It seems as though being struck by the chair didn't do anything but reinforce the Aggron's frustration with these two intruders. Jackal, although, was firmly confident that he did something amazing. \"Hah! How'd ya like that bitch? I got more where that came fr-\" The Typh wouldn't be allowed to finish that sentence once the large fist of his opponent clocked him directly. The thick fist bashes the Typhlosion to stagger roughly backwards and groan aloud. His awkward, drunken steps stagger around with his beergut wobbling. His world was becoming a blur with his ears ringing, and inevitably, he falls onto his back in a floorboard-thudding slam. Jackal is left on the ground to lowly groan with a snuffed back mane, completely knocked senseless from that punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Aggron grunts after that and returns his attention to the incapacitated Toxicroak on the ground before him. Hex hold his battered abdomen when rolling onto his side, only to feel the Aggron grab the curved crest of his head before yanking him off the floor. The frog yelps weakly and is left dangling in the air by the high grip of the larger beast. \"B-Bastard...\" The amphibian hero curses to the bandit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, the name's Titan. And how should I refer to you? As <i>bitch</i> or as <i>food</i>?\" Titan the Aggron tightens his grip, slamming Hex's face and chest against a wall to force another pained croak out before pinning him there. \"Hhhhff...I gotta admit, you did quite a number on my two pals, but you and your drunken asshole aren't a match for me. I don't know who you are or what you're doing with that drunken punk, but you're paying for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe growls in his heavy and deep voice, grinding the throbbing frog against the wall to receive muffled whines of protest. The Aggron ponders for a moment now that he successfully took care of the two intruders. Eyeing Hex's figure, the gay male certainly had excellent curves to him especially to that shuddering rump nervous to the large male debating the frog's fate. Titan's cock was still partially erect from the arousing build-up he had when he was going to fuck the Typhlosion with his fellow bandits until they were rudely interrupted, but perhaps it'd be best to just eat the trespassers instead. It was a debate between being either more hungry or more horny...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Titan licks his chops and murrs...</span></div></div>",

You're just meat. You know what you are. Now down the hatch you go, food~\" The Aggron rumbles with a wide grin from behind Hex as he squishes the frog against the wall. The Toxicroak's face and throat sac smush strongly into the creaking wood before Titan reworks his grip on Hex's body. The metal beast locks Hex's arms together as the limber frog is held above the ground, weakly kicking for futile escape. The jaws of the beast clamp together and drools close to the amphibian hero's hearing, hinting at the dreaded fate Hex wished to avoid all this time. He thought he'd go out by being hammered by some infected's cock to join their ranks; not to some large asshole that managed to get the better of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Ghhh...I-I am Hex, and never will I admit being livestock for-ffmmphgf!!\" The Toxicroak is silenced after Titan's jaws chomp over his head from behind with a new dark and damp environment to welcome him just to disprove what he was saying. The frog writhes about in Titan's arms until the Aggron completely grapples them around Hex, binding the Toxicroak's back to the beast's thick grey gut and chest. Wet glands and a fat tongue slaps up against Hex's face as he 'looks' upwards to meet with the squelching gullet eagerly awaiting him. \"G-Gmmph! J-Jackal...!\" The frog cries out for his friend, however Jackal was still on the ground, useless and unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThousands of thoughts worked into Hex's mind, trying to come up with some impactful way that he could escape a situation like this. He could try to poison the Aggron, but his metallic and thick hide would be too difficult to puncture in his state. Even if he waited until he was inside to sting Titan's stomach walls, the frog lacked any venom to do anything against the beast. He used too much just to make it to this point with Jackal, and even then, it was roughly squeezed out from the Aggron after that stomp. The groaning frog's eyelids twitch once the fat throat grabs at his face and pulls his head inside to begin the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Gck...t-too...tight...\" Hex whines out with a squeaking croak after the Aggron applies far too many bear-hugging squeezes to his body. The Toxicroak's limbs cringe but amount to nothing when 'struggling'. It was a rather sad display, yet there was nothing else for the frog to do from how battered and tuckered he was from the fighting. The ambient swallows simply hammer this awful fact into his eardrums as Titan enjoys his meal. The Aggron's tongue slaps and glides across the smooth back of the Toxicroak. With a constant onslaught of swiping, Hex is finely glazed to be swallowed more and more into Titan's ravenous esophagus pulling almost angrily at its amphibious food, eager to stew up some frog and badger at this time of night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Schhrlpk... Gllrk... Skkkllck... Glllp...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slick ambience simply send cold shivers down Hex's spine as wet heat blankets his flesh with drool. The jaws of the beast even bite at his body some on his way down which elicit whines and tenses from the frog each and every time, to which that only elicits the Aggron to really do it more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway done, Titan's tongue slaps in between Hex's ass cheeks to spread them apart. The Aggron's food immediately buckles at the sudden invasion, resorting to Hex's ass clenching up together which merely squishes the wet muscle gliding against it. Hex's pucker and taint are teased with the scooping gestures of Titan's tongue to lube him all up with the beast's drool which gets his purple flesh to glisten to the room's torchlight. \"A-Aaghh! C-Cease that...m-monster! Just g-get it over with...\" Hex groans out, no longer wanting to endure the humiliation of being Aggron chow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitan responds with a chomp onto Hex's thighs much to the frog's displeasure, but he could tell the Aggron was smiling as he nibbled and suckled the rest of his body inside. The Toxicroak groans with weak croaks as he lightly lumps out from the already thick beast as the hot esophagus walls squish and pull him down to his tomb, burying him down into squelching muscles and juices when slipping into Titan's stomach. The Aggron makes a final and mighty chomp to seal the last of the frog inside, swallowing to completely bloat his stomach out just a bit more with Hex's addition. The large dino slaps his hands onto his big and wide gut to mold the hard surface as best he could. His armor was tough, but there was still a meaty tautness to it as his food squirms closer against himself within the hot chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gwahahhhh~! Got'cha, food. You're pretty good after a beatdown. Guess I tenderized the meat some, hehehhh...\" The Aggron boasts as his clawed hands circle at his thick front, groping here and there to feel the slight occurrences of the trapped frog inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak didn't want to please the very predator that snatched him with his protest or struggles, too weak to fight back regardless within the tightening walls. Croaking dryly, he groans for the aid of the Typhlosion one last time for aid, \"J-Jack...al...crhnnh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chamber sudden wobbles in place from Titan walking, bobbing the dark grey gut about with the heavy stomps jiggling the wet walls squishing around Hex to splash the emptying juices over his nude, slick, and battered figure just to add to his punishment. Hex's hands splay against the stomach interior in an attempt to push out against them to fight for space, but a heavy churn of acids pouring over him along with the metal beast's tough hide working against Hex, the walls slap into place and compact him tighter and tighter as the Aggron was too busy muffled with something to taunt Hex any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough however, it became all apparent to what he was doing. Jackal's wet and licked over face squeezes out through the stomach valve and presses up against the Toxicroak, uncomfortably mashing the frog with his unconscious companion in the already tight place. Jackal's large and chubby body funnels right on in with a bit of trouble from the stomach valve, but eventually the Typhlosion fully dumps into the prison. Hex whines as he mashes into the wet badger body with Jackal's gut taking priority for space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitan bellows some defiant laughter, slapping a hand against his thick gut to jostle the two captured intruders in place as juices pool inside higher and higher around them. \"Hhhrrff...damn, I haven't had a two-in-one for a good while. Thanks for the midnight meal, weaklings~\" A heavy gurgle ripples about in the chamber to echo around, deafening Hex for a brief moment by the thick acidic bubbles churning in the soup building up. His flesh becomes hot over time, softening even as he's pinned against the groaning drunk that he failed to save and who failed to save him in return. Hex does his best to kick at the stomach walls, but he feels just how tough they are with Titan's previous words roaming in his head. He knew it, despite not wanting to admit it. But it was clear as day. He was food. And soon enough, he'd be joining Jackal as a layer of fat hidden on the already large enough Aggron that was making his way back into the other room to check on his companions with a hand cupped on top of his round gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex wanted to make one final curse to the Aggron, but Jackal's body slumps against him more, submerging the two into the stomach juices completely as it fills up the organ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere...the two gurgle up in a bubbly mess as Titan eagerly pats his front, not caring for either of them all that much except for the filling sensation they gave to his gut and ego.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Titan carries his two injured companions with him, huffing from all of the weight he had to carry, technically holding up to four people. His thick grey gut sways about from side to side with each step which threaten to break from such pressure; Titan would have to be careful where he walked. The Braviary is slumped over one shoulder as a battered Simisear is tucked against his side in one of his arms, limbs drooping down. Titan huffs, \"Damn, those two really did a number on you two losers. Why do I have to be the one to deal with the tough shit and save your asses? Aw well, guess I shouldn't complain. After tonight, I scored a pretty fan-fuckin'-tastic meal. Wouldn't ya say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe groaning bandits do not respond, hardly retaining their consciousness, but the Aggron's gut ripples out a gurgling churn of the two ingested heroes which Titan takes as answer. \"Hahah! You said it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large beast exits down a staircase to leave his friends in the infirmary area the bandits have set up before heading off to Damien to let him know what all took place. Surely something bigger was going more than these two, and for Jackal and Hex, they were a part of something bigger. And their remnants would spend their days wobbling on the Aggron's body as fat.</i></span></div></div>",

If I squint enough, you could even have a lady-like look. Can't waste a body like yours. Your ass is mine, bitch~\" The Aggron murrs by Hex's head to get the frog's drooping eyelids to raise back up with worry and tension. The Toxicroak's ass cheeks squish together sheepishly from the comment as the Aggron motions his arms over. Hex's ead is firmly pinned to the wall by one hand still, but Titan's other free hand takes a thick handful of Hex's rear end into his palm for a free squeeze. The ass cheek molds into his hand, pinching at his clawed fingers. Hex's eyes pinch tightly shut as he attempts to kick his weak legs out, only to soon have those restrained. The Aggron grips the limbs with each hand to keep them spread apart and above-ground. The only way for Hex to stop himself from sliding to the ground was to grip against the wall his chest was pressing against just to hold himself barely upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Ahh! If you like my ass s-so much, why don't you take a closer look into it? I'm sure it would love to have you crammed up inside there...\" The Toxicroak huffs back. \"Feeling needy? Lonely? I-I bet this is the only way you can get anyone anywhere close to you co-co-ccaawhhaakkk...!!!\" The frog was unable to keep up his game once he feels the mighty Aggron girth hotdog itself between its ass cheeks, dragging its underside to Hex's nervous pucker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitan boasts, \"I'm still a bit hard from your friend earlier. But all your stupid chatter just made me think about how nice it's going to be hammering you til' you're a cum drooling slut from your dumb little comments. Now I'm stiff n' throbbin' again. Thanks, frog-ass~\" The Aggron suddenly spanks one of Hex's ass cheek to wobble it in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuahh! G-Ggrhghh...\" Hex growls. He didn't like having someone get the upperhand on him like this, but there wasn't much else he could do in his current state. Besides, getting fucked by this one guy wasn't as bad as getting devoured in Hex's mind. At least, he didn't think it would. Yet the sheer size and width of the large Aggron certainly made him question that sentiment. Hex ponders on how to potentially appeal to the Aggron, but the armored beast already made his move. The Toxicroak yelps aloud, arching his back, tossing his head back, flexing his gripped and spread thighs, and clawing at the wooden wall. Titan's meat dabbed its tip to Hex's ring, spreading it without warning. Hex gags on just his mere breaths when feeling the Aggron go in dry, digging in an inch or two before retracting and thrusting back in to achieve a couple more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitan grunts, \"C'mon. You can fit. Spread it out more for me, hehehhh.\" Hex's pucker seizes up around the cock, worried about its sheer girth widening out his ass despite its attempts to stop it. Titan's rod pulsates with thick veins and pre drooling out from its tip already, lubricating the passage between the frog's purple cheeks to leak wetly from the tight rim suctioned to the Aggron's dark grey meat. With a sudden dig, the cock squelches more of its size within to leave the Toxicroak rolling his eyes back and gnashing his front row of teeth to the surface of the wooden wall he was thoroughly pinned against. The mere tightness stretching at his rectum nearly worked a tear down Hex's cheek. His cheek was however burning a deep red with either humiliation or arousal, most likely a twisted mix of the two. As much as he hated the Aggron assaulting him, the mere forwardness and long-forgotten sensation of having such a wide ride work into his rump was embarrassingly enjoyable. Perhaps it was just the infection plaguing his mind, but the frog's erection slowly rose as the final tug and push of the Aggron's length tunnels inside of him, burning Hex's face with dark pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-OoOughh...\" The Toxicroak whines out, a sound like that drove the Aggron to eagerly work his hips back to drill the mighty length inward once more with a pre-wettened smack. \"Crrah~!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitan boasts, \"You poor neglected thing. Never had anyone as big as me split you like this? Better for me to do so than any feral out there in the wild, hehehhh.\" Grappling the legs, the Aggron begins to thrust his log completely into his newfound toy with a rhythm already building up. The audible slaps jiggle Hex's asscheeks, squish wetly with the warm pre milking out from the already-tight rectum, and elicit grunts from both the large metal beast and the batter amphibian moaning to a wall helplessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex's abdomen bulges greatly from the outstretching force packing into his rear again and again, numbing his insides even as his body is forced to take in the unstoppable cock. \"M-My...b-b-belly...\" He groans out with huffing breath and a fogged mind. His stomach lumps out by each thrust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, it'll be getting its meal soon. I can tell how hungry your ass is by how much cock it's swallowin'.\" Titan taunts down to his catch. With the amount of pre spilling into the frog, Hex could've sworn his ass already had its 'meal' that Titan was gloating on about. The humps drill in harder and faster. The heat of the moment for Titan's victory got his blood pumping and his arousal burning, eager to finish off the load he's been holding in for so long. Usually he enjoyed go at this for hours, but with Hex's resistance and the battle beforehand, Titan wanted nothing more than to have the frog moaning with cum bursting into his rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrust after thrust, it took a bit of time, but inevitably the Aggron feels his churning spunk finally peak inside of him with his balls ready to unload. \"Hhhhoohhhhh, here it comes~\" He pants from his heated and parted jaws. His tail slams against the ground with his thick gut pressing over against Hex's back. The Toxicroak at that point however was simply moaning aimlessly with eye-whites barely showing from his drooping eyelids. His tongue is even slumped from his mouth, bobbing about and drooling. A sudden jerk of his hips, and Titan bashed Hex against the wall for a final thrust that actually cracks the wooden boards some by the sheer force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hkkk!!!\" Hex gags out before Titan's roars. His orgasm launches cum out from his buried member to spew away into Hex's stomach, filling it almost instantly from the thickness of the shot spurting away from the cock's tip. Hex's belly swells out even more, stretching more roundly until the flesh was taut and round, giving him a bit of a potbelly as Titan slides his jizzing member out along the way. The rectal walls are painted wide by the hot spunk gluing at the walls and bathing the cock during its escape. The slick rod finally plops right out just to lay along Hex's curved back, drooling out the last few vein-pulsing shots it could muster there until the Aggron completely drops Hex. The cum-ingested frog flops onto the ground, heavily hitting it with his back for his small belly to wobble in place with Titan collecting his bearings He catches his breath and strokes his cock out dry until he was content afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Aggron murrs and keeps a firm step weighing down against the frog's now-squisher belly, \"And there's gonna be more where that came from, but let's see what Damien wants to do with you. I'm gonna suggest you get a good taste of some <i>Happy Juice</i>~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poison-type had no idea what 'Happy Juice' was, but he didn't like the sound of it. His trembling hands attempt to grip at the heavy leg on him, and to spit out words of protest, yet his world was going dark. His body went through too much and it was in need of giving out. With blurry vision, Hex groans out an exhale before his arms flop to the ground with his head rolling to the side. Titan grins before scooping the defeated Toxicroak up and slinging the limber frog over his shoulder. He stomps his way to the likewise unconscious Typhlosion to grab Jackal by the leg, dragging the drunk's back along the ground as the bandit takes them to his leader...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That's right, just a bit more.\" Titan murrs as he keeps a hand gripped tight onto Hex's head while pouring a blue juicy fluid into the open mouth of the frog. Hex's eyelids remain in their droopy state, but his pupils are dilated, experiencing a flurry of vibrant colors. His mind was completely in a daze as he swallows the fruity drink down almost willingly. The frog was sitting down on his knees with Jackal in the same position, at Damien's balcony with the Houndour lounged in a couch, cupping Sapphire the Persian at his side. Titan had brought to the dog both of the intruders that the Aggron defeated, allowing the Aggron to use the special concoction their brewery made. Happy Juice. With the right ingredients of fruits and herbs, it was a liquid that play into people's arousal and willpower. With enough ingested, they could be cock hungry zombies abiding every command given to them; and now Hex and Jackal would experience this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien murrs, \"Thank you dealing with these two Titan. Juice 'em up as much as you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Aggron is slouched in a chair with a grin and throbbing erection, ready for round two. Setting the drink aside, he pats his inner thighs. \"No need to tell me twice. Give this pillar a good worshipping polish~\" Both the Toxicroak and Typhlosion pant with open mouths, groaning stupidly before leaning in and suckling their lips to the sides of the cock. There, the two kiss and lick at the twitching rod, servicing their captor against their drugged minds' better judgement. Their mouths occasionally meet one another to lick over the other before focusing on pleasing their new master, no longer aware of who they were or what they were doing before. The moaning Typh even wraps his lips to the cock's tip, sucking in the pre beading out of it as Hex slurps at the Aggron's balls. Brainwashed, the two would serve as the bandits' sex slaves, drunk on the special drink forcedly ingested into their mouths daily.</i></span></div></div>",

It was only several minutes after the fight broke out, but the frog was nearly down for the count. The far-ranged moves the two bandits assaulting him simultaneously truly did a number on him. The Toxicroak's back slams against a wall in a flurry of embers, struck with a shot of fire from the Simisear before the Braviary followed it up with a wing attack. The strong winds smash Hex right up against the wall again to leave the frog dropping to his knees after landing. \"Uoough...\" The Toxicroak groans out, smeared with light burns, soot, and bruises from the battle. He can hear the taps of the anthro Braviary approaching him, and the frog swings a final punch in an attempt to snag the bird by the knuckle claw. The bird however catches the wrist into a clawed, yellow scaled hand and slings the defeated Toxicroak onto his stomach. Hex whines out, rolling over to his back clutching at his stomach. His chest rises and falls as much as his neck sac, obviously needing a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Simisear however smushes Hex's face by stepping onto him a hindpaw, chuckling, \"Hhh...hhh... What was that about saying how the Typh belongs to you. From the looks here, we own you now...~\" The mammal primate licks his lips with the Braviary lightly stroking at his own member when staring the frog down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak can only groan, not even having the strength to push the padded paw off. \"H-Hhh...hhhh...just...w-wait for round two, you heathen.\" That gets the Simisear to laugh, removing the paw to have Hex see the two grinning male's enjoying their victory, and clearly impatient in satisfying their twitching cocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming through!\" The Aggron suddenly bellows, making the two other bandits step away from the Toxicroak. The metal dino launches Jackal off from his shoulder for the fat Typhlosion to smack down on top of Hex. The frog gags in a tight croak with the heavy bellied fire-type slumped belly-down on him. Jackal groans, easily defeated as well. His mouth drools with a dark black eye showing on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Glluuhhh...th-this ain't my first bar f-fight... Hrrk...I ain't dun with'chu y-yet...\" The drunk hero grunts, trying to get up, only to fail and flop back down onto Hex to get the frog to wince against from the heavy weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Aggron belittles them on the ground, catching his breath, \"Hhmph. Round two? Aren't you cute after all. You're both done for, and we got a nice prize on our hands...\" The metal beast looks to the Braviary. \"Go across and get some stuff from Bingo's workshop to hold these fools down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, you read my mind, dude!\" The avian says with delight before heading off, rolling a shoulder and admiring the simple victory they just had from the brawl. Disappearing from behind the door, the eagle left the Aggron and Simisear to also bask in their triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big metal dino squats down, squishing his gut some between his crouched thighs. \"Well well well. Looks like we're getting two for the price of one. I'll admit, I didn't want to have to bother beating the mess outta ya, but it definitely released some stress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Typhlosion can only grumble, trying more to stay conscious then defend his pride. Hex however counters, \"H-Hhh...well if all you needed was a punching bag, you g-got what you wanted. I-I'm just here to bring this d-dumb fool with me out of your awful c-camp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Aggron grins, slowly running a clawed fingertip along his member which was swelling up with all of the recent excitement. He was the biggest and thickest of the trio of bandits, worrying both Hex and Jackal which person he would decide to plow with that thing. It even spits out a glob of pre onto Jackal's back, getting the fire-type to wince from it before the Aggron purposely starts to ooze it onto Jackal's head. The Typhlosion bears his teeth together, wanting nothing more than to punch the Aggron's face in, but the metal dino would just appreciate the gesture with it doing more damage to Jackal than to the jagged, tough head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the Braviary returns with some items to use on the two defeated heroes. He even mentions, \"Heh, Bingo wasn't even in his workshop for some reason, so I didn't have to ask for any of this shit like usual. Heh. You two are really fucked now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Aggron sneers, \"Heh, what a score. It must be a holiday or something with presents like these.\" Hex knew he and Jackal were being regarded to as the objects, not the toys themselves. And with that, Jackal is dragged off of Hex for the two to be prepped up in their gear. Both of them are collared against their will, leaving Hex red faced and Jackal growling. Jackal's arms are tied behind his back by chains with Hex getting dragged over towards the table by the Simisear. The monkey sneers as he bolts some shackle cuffs onto the table surface with a metal rod, hoisting Hex up close to it despite the Toxicroak's weak kicks and struggles. On his back on the table, the Toxicroak's wrists are seized above his own head, latched in the cuffs with raised arms, unable to really move them anywhere. His long legs hang over the table's edge, only to be grabbed and lifted up by the Simisear. Hex glances down his own body to see the fire monkey's smiling face between his spread v-shaped leg opening. His ass sticks out openly for the primate to enjoy which nervously clenches its ring for what was to come. Really <i>come</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal is slammed onto the table, hitting belly down on the flat surface. His gut smushes outwardly and his fangs bite down on the object in between them. Acting as both a gag and a mouth-opener, a large metal ring with straps was buckled around Jackal's head to fit the circular gag into his spread jaws. The ring remained tough, keeping the Typhlosion from closing his mouth, at all, but kept open and wide space for something to clearly go into it. \"A-Aaaahh...aahhh...\" The drunk fire-type groans, flexing his tongue about uselessly as his rump and legs are slumped over a table edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Aggron approaches behind Jackal, slapping his hands onto the chubby Typh's ass cheeks to mold and grope around, forcing Jackal to actually moan out. The metal beast murrs, \"Atta' boy. Yeah I like you both like this. Oh, but we never introduced ourselves. The name's Titan, and I'll be the giant thing shoveling your backside tonight...~\" He cooes down by one of Jackal's lowered ears, only getting him to shimmy in his restraints again as Titan the Aggron drags his dangerous log of meat along his crease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA talon hand cups the top of Jackal's head however with the Braviary standing at the other side of the table where Titan was, grinning down at the Typh with a pulsating rod as well. \"Valor. Nice to meet you, 'Jackal'.\" Valor's beak smiles, fapping at his own member to keep it hard when preparing to stick it in the fire-type's drooling, open maw. \"Sorry about the ring. Can't have ya bitin' my pecker, but I think you'll take a good liking to it with a few persuaded licks, rrhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Simisear spanks Hex's thigh to nab his attention away from the other two bandits torturing his friend. The primate murrs with wet lips, \"What, we're doing introductions now? Well, I guess it's only fair if we're gonna get so close and personal, heh hehh...\" The Simisear opens his mouth to lower down and drag it across Hex's exposed ball sac and cock, making the half-flustered genitals wince with pleasure that gets a croaking whine from the Toxicroak captive. \"Pleasure to have you, Hex...was it...~? I'm Boris. I was looking forward to fucking the Typh's chubby rump, but I've taken a considerable liking to you. Your croaks are really cute. Let's see how loud I can make 'em, hehhh.\" Boris shows off his teeth in a grin with Hex's legs trembling in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak growls with shaking breath, \"J-Just you try you v-vile primate! I won't allow myself to enjoy the likes of-\" Just then, Boris the Simisear takes another broad lick over Hex's genitals. The balls slap up against Hex's cock with the penis spitting out some pre for the tongue to collect on its way back down the dick length. It forces it to erect and jump more, along with rippling a moan from Hex's mouth. \"-OooooAAaaohh...d-damn you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, well what the hell are we waiting for? Let's get this party started...~\" Titan boasts out. The Aggron grips Jackal's ass cheeks tight, spreading them wide to expose the big donut of the Typh's pucker. \"Thick entrance. Fucking perfect~\" Both Jackal and Hex whine in their predicaments, but are forced to deal with the consequences of being literally fucked...</span></div></div>",

With both of them on the table, restrained and held firmly down, both Hex and Jackal would feel the cocktips nudging their respective goals of entrance. The Aggron behind Jackal keeps the ass cheeks spread wide with his thick and drooling meat pushing against the pudgy donut. The pucker clenches in an attempt to cease any entrance, but it simply hugs the head of his rapist's dick, forced to spread wide from the thick amount of dark grey meat. The log was thick in diameter and certainly intimidating in length. Veins pulsate at its sides with pre spurting out at an alarming rate from the beast's arousal just from entering his fucktoy. \"Ooooouuuggghhh....~\" Titan growls; the Aggron certainly pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal takes a wide inhale as his ass is stretched to accommodate the giant guest. \"H-Hhhhhahhh!\" He gasps, unable to make words from the metal ring keeping his jaws open for the Braviary standing in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, open wide big boy.\" Valor cooes, gripping Jackal's head tightly in his hand with his hips pushing forward. The avian's dick slides right on in, gliding over Jackal's flexing tongue to go through the wide ring with enough space to dab its tip at his gullet. \"Crrrhh...warm~\" The Braviary compliments to the hear of the fire-type's wet interior. The tongue pinned under the cock revolts and flexes, wringing about uselessly which just pleases the eagle's rod with constant licks. His throat is eventually penetrated with a few adjusting humps from the eagle to stuff Jackal's throat, making the Typhlosion gag, but inevitably swallow at the protruding meat out of habit. His drunken cheeks burn a brighter red with his eyelids sagging about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Ggllk...glk...\" Is all the Typhlosion can say before his mouth is subjected to the avian idly slapping his length into it, forced to take in more and more inches. The two bandits both release their pleasured sounds to the air as they each prod and hump at their target. Poor Jackal is bobbed back and forth between them on the table as they proudly stand at its sides, slapping Jackal's mouth to just smush his spread ass to the painfully thick log digging into his rectum, thrusting him back forward to unwillingly kiss his lips around the Braviary's feathered crotch. \"Smmchk...g-gggpl...\" The whines vibrate the throat walls around the eagle's cock which elicit the bird to eagerly give a strong hump into Jackal's bulging throat to have the walls around squeeze the aroused meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hhoohh...damn. Don't stop licking.\" Valor murrs with lovestruck eyes and a grinning beak. His feathers are ruffled and his talons dig at the floorboards. The drunk Typhlosion would resist by any other means, but his drunken state made him easy to coerce to suckle around the birdmeat more, almost as if he secretly enjoyed it all as his tongue explores its bare surface which consequently glazes it for an easier time to wetly smack through Jackal's esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hggkk! Gllk! Gggpllbk...!\" The Typh garbledly moans around the slick thrusts, doing his best to just naturally swallow the pre funnel into him down and please the avian fucking his mouth despite being enemies. Valor adores the muffled sounds, and the Aggron certainly wouldn't go unsated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitan rims his tongue along his smooth mouth with his head leaned over, really working his hips to fit all of his meat inside of Jackal. \"C'mon...c'mon and get in there.\" He speaks mostly to himself, but doesn't mind if the moaning Typhlosion he's using abides. Titan loved a challenge. It's what exhilarated him to get so incredibly horny from beating the frog and Typh. Not that they posed much of a threat, but that they resisted in the first place. He didn't usually have an attraction to men, but he'd fuck anyone he could prove his dominance over. Half of his cock is able to slip enough in and out to really work his pillar, but he wanted <i>all</i> of it swallowed up in the Typhlosion's ass. \"C'mon. You were boasting earlier about how much you loved sinking an infected Bayleef up your ass. It's no secret you just adore having your cheeks spread and packed full of meat. Quit playing hard to get, you stupid drunk, and let me really fuck you how you want...~\" The Typhlosion attempts to fight back, but inevitably gives into his weakness. His ass cheeks stifle back the urge to clench tight from the rod and allow the Aggron to stuff more of its length into. Titan laughs, \"Atta' slut~\" His large hand pops a spank to Jackal's ass, wobbling one of his tubby rump cheeks with his blushing, gagged face to yell out a higher-pitched moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValor mentions over to Titan, \"Oouuh...you know. I, hhhh, kinda miss his stupid drunken rambling.\" The eagle tries to keep his cool, but the constant tongue scoops and swallowing made it quite the obstacle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Aggron huffs, \"Tell me you're fucking kidding me. I'm glad you're around to shut him up for once. Psh...don't tell me you're close to cumming already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hff...you don't have to deal with this guy's tongue or saliva. He's really go at it like the poor thing's starved for dick or something. H-Hooahh...\" The Braviary huffs, but eventually grabs Jackal's head with both hands, really shoveling his pecker inside the warm and tight throat entrance. Drool seeps from the open jaws as they vibrate from Jackal's desperate panting and groaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitan scoffs, \"Look at your dumb face. You're practically in love. Gotta learn to contain yourself, friend, and really savor a good fuck. I haven't even hilted this bitch yet.\" The Aggron in fact decides his full length hasn't been fully appreciated, and tenses his legs up, gripping his hands tight to Jackal's thighs to spread them more. With a powerful slam of his hips to even skid the whole table, Titan's cock fully digs into Jackal's asshole to make the fire badger yell out strongly around Valor's cock, forcing the eagle to caw out joyously from the motion. Jackal's eyelids twitch with the eyes themselves rolled up to the back of his skull. His ass cheeks throb at the powerful embrace of the massive dick trapped inside his body now, bulging against his already round belly to the table surface. The Braviary can't stop himself, cawing to the ceiling and erupting his hot load into the fire badger's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ccchhaahh~!\" Valor moans out with pinched eyes. His cock fattens out with each shot, spewing into the swallowing, cum-hungry mouth of the Typhlosion. Jackal weakly groans, closing his eyes and drinking every glob. His tongue even continues to slip and coax the stuff out, liking the hot heat of the goo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitan grunts, \"Did you bust a nut already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-Shut it. He's a fucktoy, not my lover. U-Uaah! He's still...sucking.\" The eagle groans, shivering his legs with his oversated cock continued to be lapped at by Jackal's drunken tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can pull out anytime ya want, birdbrain.\" The Aggron taunts back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValor grunts as his cock is milked of every drop. \"J-Just finish the hell up already. Hhh. How ya doin' over there, Boris?\" The eagle looks over to the Simisear dealing with the frog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoris, at the time, was enjoying himself greatly with his moaning frog. Hex moans with loud croaks at the ceiling, tugging at his wrist bindings. The primate's hands are groped at those meaty thighs to keep the frog's legs spread out in their v-fashion, bobbing them about as he bucks his hips into the Toxicroak. The dick swings out, spurting Hex's unwilling love out. Boris pants with constant breaths as he has an excellent rhythm going. His laps slaps up against Hex's abused rump which was probably numb from the motions. Pre and stretching made the lubed ride at least tolerable to the Toxicroak, if now cruelly enjoyable. \"Ccrrrooaahh....rrooaaahh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahh hahh...creaming just from me pounding you? I think you like me using you like this.\" Boris taunts, gripping at the Toxicroak's thighs tighter to really slam his hips into the frog's rectum which bats his furry balls against Hex's cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex whines out, grappling at his own restraints, \"Y-You f-foul man! Y-You won't get away with this...s-so easily-oohh!\" The Toxicroak gasps sharply, spitting out another loose dribble of spunk from his cock. The Simisear drills his cock forward, working Hex's back on the table before a hilting thrust sends the monkey over the edge. Hot steaming cum shoots into Hex's asshole, painting the walls white and filling up any nook and cranny the semen fits into. \"CcrrrRRooahh!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak tenses up, throbbing in place with the last final humps being packed into him until he's finally pulled out of. The Simisear pants heavily, licking at his lips from the ever-satisfying feeling of his flaccid cock coated in his own spunk. \"Ooooohhh...yeah, I needed that. This is gonna be my favorite for awhile, hehhh.\" Boris fixes his flamelike hair and catches his breath from the exercise. Sated, the Simisear drops Hex's legs to flop back over the edge of the table to dangle and twitch, leaving Hex in a humiliated, raped position. \"You done over there Titan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitan the Aggron growls suddenly, keeping his belly pressed against Jackal's back with his cock unloading its load into the Typh's belly. Jackal quietly gags from the pressure and heat, having his belly fill up too much from the cum. With a pull, Titan slides out his thick and slick meat out of Jackal's cum-oozing rump with a grin. \"Hhhh...yeah, I'm done. Geez, do ya gotta rush me...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValor huffs, resting his wet dick on top of Jackal's head. \"Yeah, we gotta deal with these two somehow. Do we eat 'em or keep 'em?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoris murrs, \"How about we let them decide~?\" The other two bandits look at one another, but the Simisear just lifts one of Hex's legs to drag his tongue along the purple thigh. \"So frog, what's it gonna be? Am I gonna have your nice body for dinner, or will you cooperate and be a nice fuck-slave for me to use~?\" His teeth even bites Hex's leg ravenously, making the frog moan out.</span></div></div>",

He hated to confess this, but he'd rather force himself to be used sexually then to be a one-time use meal. The frog wouldn't do anyone any favors if he were made into belly fat right now; well, perhaps to the Simisear at least. But he wouldn't be caught ever giving himself up to be devoured, especially to a low-life bandit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoris the Simisear pulls at the Toxicroak some, huffing, \"And why don't I have to eat you...?\" He inquires with a grin, a smug grin that burned Hex's anger to no end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggle in his restraints as much as he likes, the frog was left to swallow his pride, exhale with a shaking voice, and nearly choke out from what he was willingly getting himself into, \"...b-because I will be your servant.\" Boris' smile widens from hearing the frog admit this in surrender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the Simisear works his hands to grip at Hex's head to face him, eye to eye. \"I didn't say to be a servant. I believe that term I called you to be was a 'fuck-slave'. We're not getting you to do the dishes, we're getting you to bust a nut in you whenever we want. So which is that you're gonna be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex's hands curl into fists with his cheeks flushing a deep red from both pure anger and mortified humiliation. As much as he wanted to just spit at the primate, he grunts, \"...If you must...gggrr... I'll be your 'fuck-slave' to fuck all you want. As long as you spare the Typhlosion over there, I'll do whatever you want as many times as I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Atta' boy~\" Boris murrs, patting a hand against the Toxicroak's burning cheek. \"Hear that boys? We got a new prize to stuff our dicks into.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Braviary huffs out, \"So what are we doing with the drunk here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt he'd be as willing to let us fuck him when he hasn't engulfed an entire barrel of ale, so just lock him up with some of the other feisty slaves. He can't do shit with a metal brace around him his neck, gagged and chained.\" The Aggron huffs before he grabs the groaning Typhlosion to sling the hero over his shoulder. The large beast grunts from the weight, but was stocky and large enough himself to carry the drunkard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoris undoes Hex's restraints, getting the Toxicroak to slide off the table at last with the frog squishing his ass cheeks together from the slight cramp in them after the ride he was forced to endure. Although, a hand sends him onto his knees quickly. The Toxicroak winces, sitting there sulking before the Simisear that had defeated him with his wrists still cuffed together. The monkey uses one of the leftover tools they have to collar Hex and locking a leash to it. \"Oh ho hoohh. You are just so cute on a collar.\" Hex refused to say anything and just glances away to not look at his captor. The monkey however grips a hand to the curved feature on the Toxicroak's head to twist his face forward with Boris' flaccid cock and balls now smushing against his mouth. \"...Give 'em a good polishing kiss, like it's your initiation. You don't serve me how I want, I can always just eat ya, haha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak exhales with a deep disdain for what he got himself into, but he can only hope the invasion of the villagers and his group causes enough distress for him to make his escape. It would make for an embarrassing story, but these bandits' ruin was the main thing driving him to do this to avoid being eaten. Hex's lips spread open, tucking in the soft and meaty figure pressed against his mouth before smearing his tongue all around it. The same rod that was abusing his rear was now being willingly cleaned by him, with those furry orbs behind it also receiving treatment. The hand on his head grips firmly with a victorious purr roaming from the Simisear's throat, signifying that Hex was doing a good job. The Toxicroak watched Jackal get carried away by the Aggron, hoping to save him in time later. As he licked the member, he also prayed for Lace to come by and save his own skin. The help would never come though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex silently whines as he walks by glaring eyes and cocky smiles, doing his best to avoid any looks. He had to traverse through a series of chairs and tables in the main recreation hall for the bandits were many of them were scattered about, enjoying their drinks and food. They were celebrating their victory for stopping the failed invasion against them and claiming many of those that tried to stop them. The Toxicroak even has to pass by tables where some of the prisoners were forced to show themselves off like a slutty presentation for the bandit men to enjoy. The frog even has to walk by a certain eye-patched Luxray in chains while displaying her curvy features out to a table group with a face of pure humiliation and worry. They pressure her into bending over more and touch herself, leading to a scene which Hex did not want to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nears the table he needed to get to, only to feel a greedy hand from one of the passed bandits seize his ass for a quick grope. Hex nearly jumps in place, but steadies the tray in his hands with the drinks on them. Usually he'd flash a look at them, but he was already so used to it at this point, gifting them his reaction would only leave him open to more of their perverted actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the target at last, he sets down the tray with the respective drinks and food for the three men he was assigned to be their slut to. \"Here...\" The Toxicroak mutters while glancing up to see the grins of Titan, Valor, and Boris all there at the table in chairs, appreciating the service. The Simisear curls his finger at Hex, and the slave is forced to approach the Toxicroak. \"...Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoris murrs, \"Be a dear and check under the table, would ya? I got something I need you to help fix, frog.\" The monkey runs his tongue over his fangs to force the Toxicroak to cautiously lower himself onto his knees, ducking under the table surface to see what he expected. The Simisear's half erect cock twitches in anticipation for the frog to wrap his lips around it, but the other two bandits shared similar features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex can hear Valor's voice coo, \"And don't forget about us down there either. Once you're done with the monkey, the bird dick here could also use some love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitan grunts after swallowing some of his drink, slamming it down on the table, \"Ey! Why do I have to get the last turn, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoris scoffs, \"Cause he's more likely to choke on your dick, you giant bastard. We're not taking the chance of getting our turn spoiled because he can't handle your thickness. Oh~!\" The Simisear's eyes widen once he finally feels the frog scoot up to the monkey's legs under the table with his tongue lapping at the rod. Hex's hands cup over Boris' knees with an angrily flustered expressing draped on his face. He'd give the primate a death glare for this blowjob if Boris could even see it. But the frog's vision is suddenly engulfed by the Simisear's furry potbelly, squishing into the thing he narrowly avoided by becoming a slave. Boris yanked on the leash still tugged on Hex's collar which had a bell tag on it reading, 'Frog Slut'. The bell jingles about as the frog's mouth swallows in the member by the pull. Hex grumbles some with his chained wrists straining at the little length of chains keeping them apart, yet he simply forces himself to suck the primate off with those balls slapping against his chin, pre squirting into his gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Gllmph...mph...\" He muffledly swallows and whines in his new fate. The three men enjoy their drinks as the Simisear pounds the Toxicroak casually underneath the table, almost forgetting about Hex's well-being as they egg on about their victory...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The metal locks on the door click open and two figures arrive inside a dark room. Titan's voice huffs, \"Down.\" He yanks on a leash to jingle the bell on the Toxicroak's collar to get Hex to slump onto his knees willingly. It had been several weeks since the failed invasion, and with days full of servicing man after man and nights of unrest and lack of sleep, the groaning frog was nothing more than a meaty husk to follow every order he was given. His eyelids droop and his dry mouth pants every now and again, aching from the length of abuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rustling of chains emits in the dungeon from the presence of the two individuals with muffled groaning and grunting. Titan chuckles as he grabs Hex's head to pull it right where he wanted the frog slave to face. \"Stay right there, boy. Your friend needs his daily cleaning.\" He murrs heavily as he lights a torch to illuminate Jackal at the dungeon's center. He was bound in chains, arms tied behind his back with his legs spread out to expose his backside out more. The Typhlosion had a large metal brace around his neck, snuffing out the red pores to keep his flame mane completely concealed. A muzzle cage is even belted around his mouth to keep his typical angry, resistant attitude down along with ceasing him from every shooting out an open fire from there. \"G-Grrrmph...!\" The upset and exhausted Typhlosion growls in his prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thick pucker oozes with cum from the recent doings of a bandit that needed a quick bust in. That's all Jackal was used for after all. Titan grips at Hex's head to smush it in between Jackal's ass cheeks, demanding, \"Go on, lick. Lube it up real nice for me, cause I'm feelin' anxious~\" Hex does by hungrily dragging his fat tongue along Jackal's ass and taint to elicit high pitched grunts and growls from the fire-type. Jackal huffs in desperation and muffledly growls curses to either himself, Hex, or the Aggron keeping him bound up as a cum-dump. Regardless, his cheeks redden when a moan forces out of his clenched mouth at the wetwork Hex performed to the slick anus. The ring is probed, smeared, and rimming properly for Titan to slide Hex out of the way and dab his infamously large cocktip against. Jackal yipes tightly when his ass is spread once more, jiggling to the humps...</i></span></div></div>",

Hex didn't like either choice, but he certainly couldn't ever see himself volunteering to be someone's slave. \"Go ahead and d-do your worse. I have no regrets f-fighting the likes you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Simisear, however, smiles widely at this. His tongue circles around at his lips, making him take another broad lick along Hex's bare thigh with a bite mark on it. \"Oh? Is that so? Well, whatever you prefer then. Guess that means I'm having Toxicroak meat tonight~\" His mouth bites to the other leg now, keeping it in place by his teeth with his tongue cupping up and stroking along what it can. Hex shivers with his leg muscles trembling and his throat croaking out another whine. The primate murrs, \"Mmh...you're delicious. I can't wait to have you writhing in my stomach to muffle those adorable croaks and moans of yours. Heh, a one-way trip to acid central just for you. You seem to enjoy yourself when I treat you like the food you are~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex grunts out with curled fists, \"N-N-Never...wh-who would ever w-want s-such a thing like from y-you, you awful b-bastard...\" The Toxicroak didn't enjoy it, but something dark inside of him did. He didn't know if it was just some weakness of the moment or something about the mastermind's influence affecting him in this eat-or-be-eaten world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like denial. It'll make chomping up this figure you're offering me all the better.\" The Simisear smiles with a toothy grin, leaning it down to smear another lick over Hex's spent genitals one last time to make the frog moan. Glancing to the others, the fire primate huffs, \"I got this one. You two can fight the drunk fatso there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Braviary and Aggron glance to one another. The beast, Titan, huffs out, \"Well he <i>is</i> pretty big. I think it's pretty clear that I should e-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValor the Braviary retorts, \"Oooh no. I covered your ass last week for guard duty. You owe me one.\" He glances down at his intended meal, running a tongue at his beak at the drunken cum slut on the table before him. \"A big one. A buzzed up, horny warm fatso~\" The Aggron huffs at this, but certainly wouldn't fight it. His thick, wet rod drags against the cheeks he had just plowed before he spanks the Typhlosion as a 'thank you' for the cum dump. He starts to undo the chains binding Jackal's arms to have them uselessly flop to his sides, fully aware that he wouldn't be able to fight back much, and all the while the eagle undoes his mouth ring gag. The straps unbuckle from the back of his head, allowing Valor to slide the wet metal ring out from Jackal's jaws to have them finally close at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groans out from the strain in them, but also to his swollen belly forced to take two extra cum loads of the two bandit men. Valor's hands caress around his late night meal's head, lifting it up to look down to Jackal's face. The Typhlosion's cheeks were still a deep red with his eyelids sagging about awkwardly, his teeth gnashed together, and his ears folded back with the same drunken expression as he had before, albeit more embarrassed. He grunts after a wet swallow, \"Ghh...I don't taste all dat gr-great, I swear, hic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, I think all of us here have seen what a terrible liar you are. Down the hatch, big guy.\" The Braviary opens his beak to squish Jackal's face inside and brings the head on in with it. Jackal groans as he's met with the eagle's tongue matting against his snout before it eases over his cheeks and mouth to help scoop him into the hungry bird gullet waiting below. \"Gllrk~\" With an easing swallow, the Typhlosion is dipped into the thick throat. Jackal's head bulges out from the feathered neck of the avian as he delightedly dines on his warm meal, not having to worry about much of a struggle considering the battle, sex, and alcohol overworking Jackal's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on with Hex, the Toxicroak gasps, whines, and croaks as the Simisear nibbles his teeth all along his tender legs to leave little marks as evidence of his venture. Boris murrs, \"Such a delicious yet venomous slut. I can't wait to wear you on my sloshing middle, I need to have you <i>now</i>!\" Just like that, the primate binds Hex's legs together and goes to work on his meal like his fellow and hungry eagle. Hex's hindpaws are dipped into his spread mouth and are tucked easily into his throat, pulled down with a sudden swallow. There was nothing the frog could do as he flops on his arcing back and rear about on the table surface, tugging and seizing at the restraints around his wrists keeping him there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Ahh! V-Vile monkey...\" He shivers, flexing his bitten thigh meat to unwillingly embrace his digestive end. As the legs of the frog disappears into the Simisear's mouth, Jackal's shoulders and chest submerge into the beak chomping around him. His hands weakly press up against the Braviary's torso to cling onto the feathers, but his shaking weak nerves reduce the efforts to nothing more than a pleasing victory lap for the eagle. Valor sucks down to his prey's belly as Boris reaches his prey's rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValor pinches his brows down and muffledly grunts at the Aggron who was too busy enjoying the show of watching the eagle eat the fire badger. \"Eh...?\" Titan mutters to see Valor pointing away at Jackal's legs. The thick and short limbs kick and scramble awkwardly with the eagle gesturing to have them seized. All of the squirming was wobbling Jackal's round belly about which made it harder to swallow him down. Titan rolls his eyes, \"Fine, but next time, handle your food by your own damn self. I certainly never get any help from you.\" The avian muffledly scoffs at his bandit companion, but lets out a lavish moan once Titan takes Jackal's struggling legs to keep them spread and held in place as that rotund tummy is squished into Valor's jaws. The beak consistently sinks the pudgy beer belly with enough swallowing force, as well as his hands groping the mess inside as well by his hands. Jackal's sliding and captured head can be heard making groaning moans within his prison, nearing the bird's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex was back to moaning aloud to the open air however as Boris probes his tongue about inside the frog's pucker, right between the sexed up ass cheeks. The ring was numb, yet the wet probing sensation simply drilled the humiliating factor in until the chuckling primate was finished embarrassing Hex in his last moment. The lips creep up Hex's curvy figure to now slip him past the halfway mark, getting the Toxicroak to really shake and tremble now within the massaging throat walls squelching and never-endlessly pulling at him. How much the Simisear's interior was sucking him down was terrifying enough, but he could see the pleasured face it gives the mammalian monkey as he engulfs his food, staring directly at Hex's own eyes. \"A-Aah...m-must you look at me and lick at me this much. J-Just get it over with you pathetic man-AH~!\" Hex exclaims with wide eyes to feel the teeth pinch at his back and stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Simisear clearly silenced him and fulfilled the frog's wishes by quickening up his pace. The Toxicroak's body disappears more and more with Boris now climbing up onto the table surface to crawl his way forward to slip Hex deeper. \"Gglllk....ggggllp....glllnnk...~\" Hex stares wide eyed down at how much progress he made, with only the frog's head and arms to go. Boris uses his hands to begin undoing Hex's restraints to be able to devour all of his meal neatly in one go, but by the time the frog's wrists are freed, he whines out with his head submerging into the Simisear's throat. Only Hex's arms and hands are out in the air, but not for long once the monkey flicks his head back to hungrily swallow the limbs down to pack the Toxicroak away forever. \"GGGggllk~! Aaahhhh...\" The Simisear pats his gut with Hex balling inside the rather hot interior of the fire-type's interior, grunting in the pooled juices fizzling inside. \"Thanks for the midnight snack, frog. How's things goin' on your end, Val?\" He asks when glancing at the Braviary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitan's hands grope Jackal's ass as he shoves the Typh most of the rest in. Valor had defeated the width of Jackal's belly and swallows in the last of the legs, ending his meal as well. \"Ooooohhh...b-big...\" He groans out, keeping his hands squished to his round, blue feathered gut. It wobbles lightly from the simple squirms inside, but the eagle lazes his back on the table to rest. \"He was so fucking gr-\" A sudden groan in the wood sends the table legs and surface snapping, sending both Valor and Boris onto the ground with shaking guts in the impact. They glance to one another and sneer as they let their stomachs work on the heroes. \"Let's go mention this to Damien. I'm sure he'd be stoked~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Houndour murrs out from the couch he was reclined against, \"Great job you three. Glad you dealt with the infiltrators upstairs while everyone was scrambling downstairs to stop the invasion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitan, Valor, and Boris are all next to one another to stand before their leader, two of which with fattened out guts of their gurgling prey. Boris the Simisear murrs, \"Thanks boss! You can always count on us. You could say this frog's finally croaked, heh~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Braviary adds, \"Anything for you boss! Sorry we weren't down here faster to deal with the others. Hmph. I would've killed another meal for myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien rises up, patting the two predator's guts to ease them, \"Don't sweat it. The fuckers downstairs failed, and we nabbed plenty of them. We'll be getting plenty of pleasure and can eat well for a good while. You two enjoy your meals. Titan, come with me. We nabbed a Luxray girl I'm sure will fit your tastebuds. Or dick. Whichever~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Aggron grins, following his leader to receive his reward. \"Heh. Why not both?\" The Braviary and Simisear settle down on a spot to ease their round bellies, gurgling away the Toxicroak and Typhlosion...</i></span></div></div>",

He looks directly into Hex's eyes, or at least, the best he can from his constantly warped eyelids wavering about. \"Don't worry. I gawt dis...I can eat'cha and jist let ya out sumwhere pryvit.\" He says in his attempt at whispering again, hissing it loudly though for the Aggron and others to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Jackal! Wait! That is a stupid pl-\" Hex is cut off with the Typhlosion bellowing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'z okay guyz, I got him!\" Jackal exclaims with his jaws suddenly spreading, making Hex stare into the glistening hiccuping abyss of Jackal's mouth and throat. \"Hhhhhhhaamph!\" He bites down around Hex's head before the frog can react, sending the Toxicroak into a struggling panic. However, the hands on Hex's arm bind them to his sides with the Typhlosion's stockier frame being stronger than his own. The three bandits ready to grab the two traitors pause in place, bewildered to seeing a traitor eat one of his own like that in front of them, as if it would do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Ghmmph! J-Jackuummphl!!!\" The frog croaks with frantic displeasure with his face smacking against the thick-walled gullet of his companion, having it seal around his head and sink him down towards the stomach. Hex's legs kick against the Typhlosion's sloshing beer-belly, which almost gets Jackal to spit him right back out. Yet with a mighty hoist, the Typhlosion lifts the frog away from him as Jackal staggers about, awkwardly stepping around as he attempts to feed Hex into his swallowing jaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Braviary looks to the Aggron and asks, \"What do...we do...?\" The large armored beast just scratches at his head, wondering if it would be better to intervene or to actually let the drunk devour his apparent infiltrating friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime of their confusion, Jackal was <i>hungrily</i> wolfing down Hex, trying to get the anthro frog down as quickly as he could. His jaws repeatedly snap up more of Hex's upper body, biting in more and more of the Toxicroak as Hex's legs splay out and kick. His worried croaks go muffled into the throat passage bulging from Jackal's neck and chest, unable to get any help from anyone. \"Glllkk! Gllp...sckhhlp!\" The Typhlosion repeatedly works his throat muscles, doing fine work on submerging his food inside with hardly any time wasted on just savoring his meal. Inconsequently though, he did enjoy what he could with wiping his tongue about the frog, using it to literally scoop up Hex to tug him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three bandits are forced to spread out and let Jackal by as he staggers backwards in repeated steps, having only Hex's kicking legs sticking out from his lips now, directly pointed up at the ceiling from Jackal's head being tilted back. The drunk hothead nearly topples onto his back, but with a mighty stomp and the last few swallows of his meal, Jackal's mouth tucks in the squirming amphibious paws into his gullet and bites his teeth together. All of the Toxicroak is dumped inside his stomach, leaving Jackal groping at his incredibly swollen belly and blushing even harder. \"H-Hhhh...th-there...\" He exhales out with a hanging tongue and tuckered eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex, inside, is forced to submerge briefly into the interior organ, mostly filled up with all of the ale Jackal had drank. \"B-Bbllbb!\" The Toxicroak sputters before he can finally manage to get his face out from the surface of the beer with his body cramped up inside the tight chamber. The walls squeeze at him, aching from so much being inside, it brought the pool of ale's surface dangerously high with Hex fighting for air and space. \"A-A-Aahh! J-Jackal, mph, s-spit me out, you st-stupid m-m-m-moron!\" The Toxicroak does his best to shimmy and shake, sloshing and splashing the fizzing alcohol about, wanting anything but to be cooked in this alcoholic broth. The fire-type's belly was exceptionally hot, getting Hex to pant out from the heat. \"Jaaackaaal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Typhlosion on the outside was only groaning and whining from his wobbling belly, trying to get it to calm down by holding it with both hands. \"A-Aaaggghh, st-stop oouuhh sq-squirmin' there... Hrk!\" His cheeks bloat and he stifles back from letting the frog escape. Despite the sick feeling, he was confident in his hazy mind this was all going to work out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding before the three bandits, he points to them with finger-guns and gives a toothy grin, \"S-See? I goddem! Now if you'll excuuuuze meee, I need to uhh...hhhuugghhh...use the bathroom privately, hic, or s-something.\" The trio of bandits just stand there, dumbfounded by the fire-type's drunk idiocy while the Typhlosion attempts to strut forward with his swinging gut. However, Jackal's eyes roll up and his fullness get the better of him. He timbers over, slamming onto his back, whining out with a panting mouth. \"UuuuUUGHHhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabs at his swollen belly which was stretched to the point where the fuzzy mound itself was warmly blushing pink from the heat and pressure inside. \"H-Hhck... I could some zum...h-helppppbbll...\" The Typhlosion groans for assistance, but his arms suddenly flop onto the ground awkwardly and he's left there quietly huffing and panting. His eyes are barely open anymore, with only slivers of white peering through what was hardly split between eyelids. The Aggron, Braviary, and Simisear remain standing, having achieved 'victory' by doing nothing to stop the two heroes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCircling around Jackal's unconscious body, they watch as the belly wobbles from the Toxicroak's struggling, only hearing faint moans about the heat as the taut orb trembles from the gurgling work going on inside. The Simisear asks, \"Should we...get the guy outta there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, didn't it seem like he was someone that snuck in here?\" The Braviary adds when scratching his own head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Aggron rubs at his neck before grunting, \"...I guess we should take this Zack, er- Jackal guy? Like, drag him to one of the cells and lock him up so Damien can get to know what the hell just happened once the drunk wakes up.\" The Aggron scoops up one of Jackal's arms, getting the anthro Braviary to carry the other to hoist their fat prisoner up. \"Here, we'll just have to drag him off. You go find Damien or Bigby and let him know what happened. Or...just, tell them <i>something's</i> goin' on. This dude's a traitor, and there might be more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Simisear nods, \"R-Right...\" He goes off to find the leader of the bandits, as the two others drag the groaning and hiccuping Jackal in the other direction...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>The prison cell ambiently echoes with stomach gurgling and low moaning. The Typhlosion has his back slumped against a wall, sitting on his big rump with his head hanging down. His eyes remained closed, but his consciousness slowly comes back to him. He attempts to move his arms, only to hear a metallic jingling. Chains bind his wrists to the wall above his head, leaving his hands uselessly grabbing at the air. \"U-Uugghhnn...\" The Typhlosion couldn't fully wake up, digging his heels about on the ground in slow shifts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly, while still quite round, had been able to digest some of its content inside. The frog meat was no longer moving, now just a soup mixed with the beer bubbling in Jackal's stomach to ripple a loud chorus of noises. It fills the air, and makes the Typhlosion's half-erect cock jump periodically with the lovely sensation. Pre drools out from its tip, and while the Typhlosion would wake up later that morning with a killer headache and the downfall of his team, he would at least get to enjoy a Hex-pudged up tum thanks to his drunken antics...</i></span></div></div>",

But this is the last thing I do before I go, okay Bingo?\" Hex stated, wanting to make it clear with the Seismitoad. The big frog tilts his head, nervously poking fingers together again. \"Are we clear, Bingo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awh, froggy has to go after this?\" He looks worried, but then a big smile creeps on his face. \"Okay...froggy can leave...after this~\" He chuckles to himself constantly in his slow mannerisms and heavy voice, half-lidded eyes. The Toxicroak can almost see the toad drool, seemingly very happy about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak however approaches and rests his hands to the stock, feeling along its edges. \"I'm not really sure what I'm...looking for here, Bingo. It just seems like it's all wood to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heavy steps from behind Hex have the toad approach the stock. He ribbits, \"Froggy, peek over. Secret on other side~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex does so, leaning his head over to see nothing out of the ordinary. \"Bingo, I-\" The upper stock board suddenly clamps shut to the other one, locking around Hex's neck and wrists! \"Crahh!!\" The purplish frog exclaims with widened eyes. He tries to pull back, but his head and hands are locked in the sealed three circles between the boards. He's slumped onto his knees, wiggling his rump and jerking at the stock in an attempt to free himself, but the thing was outright bolted to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Seismitoad claps, laughing, \"Ha ha ha! Bingo clever! Bingo trick froggy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex's face burns red. He was completely humiliated that he let a bumbling idiot actually outsmart him from something that should've been so obvious, but he had no idea why he went through with the whole thing. It should've been seen a mile away. His hands splay out and curl into fists repeatedly, unable to escape their bindings. Hex's head and neck even meet the same fate, with the orange bubble sac now roundly squished up against his chin with the rim of the stock keeping it locked there. \"H-Hh...B-Bingo...y-yes, you tricked froggy. But it's time to let froggy go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBingo steps away from Hex's view however, feeling his large hand stroke the frog's back. \"No. Froggy leave when froggy's done with Bingo's stock. Bingo's stock not done with froggy yet~\" The Seismitoad even makes a greedy grab to Hex's big rear, squishing at the taut cheeks to make Hex wiggle and struggle all the more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Ahh!! Bingo, this is not some kind of game! R-Release me from this stupid contraption!\" The Toxicroak pleads with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Seismitoad smacks his head lumps together in displeasure. \"Froggy said stock looked nice. Now froggy says stock is stupid?\" Bingo collects something from a table somewhere, ribbiting a retort, \"Well let see how Blacky think of froggy then! Let see how froggy change his mind about Blacky too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex's pupils shrink when he senses that Bingo was going to use that massive black rubber dildo on him, instinctively making his pucker and rear tighten up. \"B-Bingo! No! No Blacky! No more toys! Fr-Froggy's sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Froggy <i>will</i> be sorry. Heh. Hehhh.\" The Seismitoad toymaker sneers before opening his mouth. Hex can't see, but he certainly can hear the big toad suckle around the dildo, licking around its exterior with a few pumping motions. It gets the toy glistening and slick from the guest it would penetrate soon enough, getting Hex's cheeks to throb and squeeze again out of nerves. The Seismitoad finishes lubricating the dildo, having the thick twelve-inch thing wobble out drenched. Glossy and ready, Bingo pervertedly chuckles as he aims the wet tip against Hex's cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak gasps from the thick head welcoming itself to his ass, forcing him to croak, \"B-Bingo! No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toad however pushes strongly, jabbing the head between the cheeks easily before forcing the ring to swallow the wet dildo. \"Bingo yes~\" The Seismitoad chuckles, tugging and prodding Blacky's head at the anus before giving a squishing thrust with it. The dildo spreads Hex's ass cheeks and anal walls, getting the frog to moan heavily out to the ceiling and walls with a gaping mouth and rolled up eyes. His cheeks fume with hot blood, now with not only embarrassment but arousal too now as well. With how thick and easy the smooth dildo was, it penetrates with cramming thrusts the toad forces, making the Toxicroak's own rod erect up with each pounding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crroooaahhh! Oouuoohhh! B-Bingoooohhh!\" Hex begs, going cross-eyed with the dildo just digging more and more before the toad packs it completely inside Hex's ass. The frog's rectum hugs tightly around the wet pillar just silently resting inside of his body, bulging his stomach slightly even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Seismitoad laughs, \"Ha. Ha. Froggy make cute noises. Bingo go tell Damien stock works on froggy~\" The Toxicroak's eyelids twitch with his fingers wincing and grabbing at nothing when dealing with the outstretched pain and pleasure tucked in his ass right now. Hex wanted to beg for Bingo not to inform Damien and blow his cover, but all that comes out is a shaking croak. The toad can be heard taking heavy steps out of the room, leaving the door open even, allowing any passerby to see Hex on his knees, trapped in the stock, with a big black dildo sticking out from his spread ass. Hex prayed that they would just kill him here and now. He can't imagine the humiliating torture to come from being caught like this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hex's face is a deep red still, head hanging low with his hands as he quietly awaits being berated. Standing in front of him was the nemesis he and his group were meant to stop, Damien. The Houndour is squatted down to meet eye-level with the frog, using a hand to grab the frog by the curved crest to yank his face up to lock eyes. The bandit leader was smiling, huffing from his nostrils. \"...You must be stupider than that retard of a toad. I hear you got yourself locked into this thing willingly. Nice to see that it's working its charm. I'm gonna have that bumbling idiot make me several more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex's fists clench together as he growls to the young dog, \"Mock me all you like, there's more like me putting a stop to you. Sorry to disappoint you, but your mill's going down tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Houndour suddenly pets Hex's cheek before coursing in idle rubs and strokes. Damien seemed unphased. In fact, he seemed evilly happier. \"Oh, you didn't hear? Well I'm sorry to disappoint <i>you</i>, but I'm afraid several of my men have caught your precious little teammates. We found out about how you were going to blow this place up, but with the powder kegs you weak idiots thought you could use, we'll be sure to use them properly on Hedgen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak's eyes widen from hearing that they had failed, only making him struggle and jerk in the stock all the more. Damien laughs before groping Hex's neck sac tightly, \"My men will be eating well tonight on who we nabbed, but for a stupid faggot like you, I think something <i>special</i> is in order...\" The Houndour suddenly slaps the Toxicroak across the face before rising up and walking around behind the frog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex groans out, \"Y-You're a monster. AaCK!\" The Toxicroak yelps out after Damien lifted a hindpaw to press against the back of the dildo that was slightly sticking out from Hex's ass, hilting the toy all the way through to lump out the frog's belly. Hex gasps and whines, completely immobile from the pressure and length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien has hands on his hips, adjusting the weight he uses on hindpaw to probe the dildo inside Hex. \"Better to be a monster that wins than a fucking dumbass that gets a dick in his ass.\" He taunts before retorting, \"But you'll be degraded to something even lower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Bandits cheer and egg the Toxicroak as they're circled around him. The frog's stock was unbolted and brought down to the main lobby and recreation area the bandits drank and ate in. Hex himself was restrained right back into the stock, available for use for the bandits to celebrate their victory. A blindfold had been tied around his eyes, shadowing his view of what all was happening, but it wasn't like he couldn't feel it all. He whines around the gagball locked in his mouth, biting around the wet thing with his flat teeth as he drools from his constant huffs and whines. His entire body bobs back and forth, hitting his shoulders against the back of the stock and making him moan out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA male of some kind had both of the frog's ass cheeks in his hands as his cock repeatedly thrusts into the numb ring. Hex lost count for how many of the bandits have fucked him in this bent over position, but they certainly knew. After the bandit moans aloud, emptying his load into the Toxicroak's abused ass, he pulls out to leave it leaking with spunk. Red burned hand marks litter the once light purple flesh, leaving Hex's ass stinging and hot to the touch from the constant spanking it endured. His belly is warm with cum, and ropes of the stuff line his back. The bandit adds to it, popping an open palm to the cheeks he blew his load in before dipping a fingertip into an ink jar. There, he wipes it shortly to one of Hex's ass cheeks, making a tally mark. Nine tally marks are inked to the frog's rump, leaving the bandit cheering, \"Who wants to be number ten?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bandits laugh until the tenth volunteer joins in on the fun. Hex breathes the best he can, feeling nothing but sexual torture from his hardly conscious mind. At this point, he was just a cock sleeve to these men to use and belittle. He knew they left some harmful comments and names inked onto his blushing ass as well. However, a new pair of hands grabs his hot ass to knead around. A horse's cock rides up on Hex's crease with a fat pair of balls as well. A familiar voice from earlier murrs, \"Remember me, bitch?\" It was the Zebstrika the frog had poisoned and interrogated earlier. The frog can't even beg or apologize to the bandit he knocked out; All he can do is submit to the thick horse rod digging in and moan for his enemy...</i></span></div></div>",

I'm afraid it's time to go night-night.\" The Toxicroak does his best to work in the tips of his knuckle claws at the Seismitoad's sides, but he can't get their tips through such a thick, pudgy exterior, resulting in Hex just awkwardly drawing lines of his purple venom at the sides of Bingo's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does froggy mean? Bingo does not feel tired...\" The Seismitoad blinks some, confused on where Hex's failed phrase meant. But the tingling at his belly gets the Seismitoad to become slightly drugged, just not in the way Hex had hoped. The Toxicroak put everything into that last bit of venom, but all it did for him was get the toad to murr, \"Bingo's tummy...feel's funny...\" The toad stammers before drooping his eyelids and his eyes dilate more. \"Bingo feels...hungry...~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made Hex's heart sink. \"Oh dear...\" The Toxicroak realizes that he may have made a huge mistake, and now has a hungry moronic Seismitoad for the rumblies for something. And considering his dulled, drugged mind...he might just want to eat a certain other frog. With all his might, Hex struggles from Bingo's thick and tough arms, doing everything he can to escape the belly hug he was squished against, wanting anything but to end up in there. He knees the stomach repeatedly and even bangs his head on the fat toad. \"R-Release me, you behemoth!\" Hex exclaims, making Bingo yelp and drop the Toxicroak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven a chance now, Hex decides to just bolt for the door. But the sudden vibration alert him to Bingo's head lumps smacking together in anger again. \"Grrrr...froggy hurt Bingo. Bingo doesn't like to be hurt...! Bingo show froggy!\" The big toad's mouth suddenly opens up, and a long, fat, pink tongue whips out to smack to Hex's back! The frog tenses up in place, almost reaching the door until the sticky tendril struck him. Just a fingertip's brush away from the doorknob, Hex finds himself being yanked backwards after the toad tongue whiplashes back. Swung off his legs, Hex yelps in a worried croak to be slapped right up against the Seismitoad's belly with his back against it. The light blue gut wobbles in place, but emits a deafening gurgle when doing so. The Toxicroak doesn't even have time to push off after Bingo's arms return to draping around Hex's body, binding him right into the fat amphibious gut again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBingo was clearly displeased, and growls, \"Bingo nice and show froggy toys. Froggy mean. Bingo show froggy tummy next!\" The lumps on his head smack angrily together far more ferociously, and Hex didn't like the sound of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry, Bingo. F-Forgive me, I got too-\" Hex shudders in his voice, cutting off once he feels a warm slimy fluid drip onto the top of his head. His constant squirming against the Seismitoad's thick belly stop as he takes the moment to roll his head back, seeing the parted jaws of the behemoth's maw above him, drooling onto him. \"B-Bingo! St-mmphk?!\" The Toxicroak would meet his last words to the outside world once those jaws snapped around his head. The angry, drugged toad wouldn't have any of what the smarter amphibian had to offer though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Schhlp....ssllkp....mmrrrhhh...\" The fat toad would murr around Hex's head as he nibbles his gummy jaws around the smooth Toxicroak noggin, playing with his sticky tongue by wiping over Hex's gasping face and the curved feature sporting from the purplish frog's head. Saliva smothers over Hex's groaning and croaking face, making his orange throat sac bulge repeatedly in fear and frustration, having this dimwit get the better of him. Out of all the things the Toxicroak imagined falling to, this bumbling fool wasn't one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Ggmph! Cr-Crrmphk!\" He tries to protest and free himself, but the excessive arm strength compacting at his own arms and ribs was a staggering pressure to deal with. Plus, his face would be packed into Bingo's gullet from a single and strong swallow. The wet, gummy walls squish and squelch at Hex's face, pulling his head and neck inside the dark and narrow passage to his unfortunate demise. The Toxicroak's legs kick and lash out, beating his heels against the wobbling belly he'd internally meet soon as his efforts do not earn him anything; at least, they don't earn him anything positive. It merely encourages the Seismitoad to smack his flat, squishy chops against the Toxicroak's upper body, fed upwards into the mouth before curving back down through the esophagus pulling at the wonderful fellow amphibian meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBingo's lips spill out drool to ooze over the Toxicroak's smooth and squirmy figure, getting those prey legs to tense and stretch out, hands splayed out and thighs nervously grinding together. Hex's croaks become less fervent yelling and more overwhelmed moans each time the fat toad chomps his jaws around him or swallows more of his figure in. The poison frog can't even truly complain once he feels his ass getting lapped over by Bingo's tongue, curling around the cheeks, squishing the together, dragging in between them; the Toxicroak was forced to moan inside the rumbling throat walls claiming him. \"C-Crooaahhhh...Ooouuahh...!\" Hex whines out with pinched eyes and reddened cheeks, feeling his face finally push through the stomach valve into the intensely warm stomach of his predator with his back uncomfortably bending backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Seismitoad thankfully tilts his head back with only his hands gripping at Hex's kicking ankles to keep them restrained. Bingo loops his thick tongue around both of the limber legs to drag them inside. His hands slap onto his belly to jostle the mighty round weight in place as he finishes his Toxicroak meal, slipping the legs and paws inside to finish Hex off. \"Ggglllrrkk~!\" Bingo swallows a final time before lowering his head with pleasured eyes, reddened cheeks, and his tongue hanging from his wet mouth. \"Ggllhhheehhh...yummy, yummy...\" He pats his now-thicker belly with Hex groaning out in defeat, cramped in the extremely thick-walled gut. Stomach juices and drool bathe the frog in the dark, squelching chamber, leaving the Toxicroak to weakly stir in place, trying to shimmy his legs and arms for space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Uugghhck...B-Bingo... L-Let your fr-frog out. Try to cough him back up!\" The Toxicroak pleads, having no other options now. But he's only answered with the sudden jiggling of the wet walls around him with the ambient belch of his predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBingo on the outside gropes at his stomach, chuckling and groaning with pleasure from how lovely it felt to have prey inside of him. \"Gleehhh... Bingo don't think so. Bingo getting sleepy though. Maybe it night-night time after all.\" Hex's eyes widen when realizing that his weak poison was only now truly working its weakening effects on the toad, far too late and at the worse time, leaving the potential companion trapped in the Seismitoad's stomach as the beast staggers over somewhere, most likely his bed. The meaty prison jostles in place from Bingo slumping onto his back at his bed, lightly patting a hand on his meaty, round belly to sate his gurgling prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hhhhrroooouuuggghhh....nighty-night... Heh. Heh. Hehhh...\" His head lumps smack together in delight from his late night meal and Bingo stretches himself out before fully closing his eyes and letting the dull venom drift him off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly however quakes angrily, wobbling back and forth desperately with the Toxicroak, \"B-Bingo! Wake up! D-Don't you fall asleep with me in h-hhggbblb!\" The stomach acids begin to pool upwards, flushing in now that a meal was slumped in its fizzling juice. \"B-Bbllbp! Cr-Cr-Crblblpmph!!! Hex begs, sputtering at the fluid overtaking him some, leaving the Seismitoad stupidly snoring, lazily sprawled out unconscious with his belly sloshing about. Muffled croaks bubble inside, resorting the snoozing toad to hiccup some in his sleep, letting his meal stew inside for the night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Bingo's jaws widen in a yawn before smacking at his gums. He rolls on his side with it being morning outside, the raid from Lace's group having failed without its necessary members, with villagers just captured or eaten. The bumbling fool of a Seismitoad was surprisingly why Damien and his men succeeded, and they would remain unaware of that until the new layer of toad fat was explained on Bingo's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Seismitoad however slept through the entire raid thanks to Hex's poison, which in fact led to the Toxicroak's downfall. Half-asleep still, Bingo idly scratches and fingers at his belly which had worked down the Toxicroak meat into a more pillowy form for Bingo to enjoy. The person who doomed the world; Bingo, of all people.</i></span></div></div>",

The frog gives out a whistle to catch the Zebstrika's attention and the horse turns around, glancing about without finding the source. \"Wha...?\" He mutters before the Toxicroak leaps down off from the rafter. Hearing the murring croaks, he glances up just to see the frog one second too late with Hex stomping down on the male equine. The horse's back meets the walkway flooring with Hex's hindpaws pressing down onto the Zebstrika's flat chest and abdomen, returning into the same squatting position he was in before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Gyahh!!\" The horse whinnies out with arms flopped above him. He gets ready to lift his hands out to shove the frog off from him, but Hex is quick to flash out his orange clawtips towards the equine's big neck, daring to puncture him with their poisoned tips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex threatens with a murring croak. \"Ah. Ah. Ahhh. You keep those greedy hands away from me, or else I'll make them useless with a nasty stab, and neither of us want to bother with that, correct?\" He clenches his fists and idly traces the claws along the Zebstrika's neck. The stallion bites his teeth together in a scowl, wanting nothing more than to attack the frog, but he slowly adjusts his arms back onto the floor boards, growling. The amphibian cooes down, \"Good boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-Who the hell are you?!\" The Zebstrika seethes through his clenched teeth, inflating his chest out from the weight going down on his lungs, needing to pant far heavier than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm someone looking for a certain Typhlosion. Know where I could find one with an orange bandana, bit of a potbelly, and can be a real hothead at times...?\" The Toxicroak interrogates the question, wiggling a poison tipped orange claw before the horse's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt, the Zebstrika huffs, \"You're with that Zack guy? How the hell did you get in here past the guards? I knew the Typh was gonna be trouble-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, ah, ahhh...\" Hex mentions again, tapping his claw to the horse's big black snout. \"I'm the one asking questions. You seem to forget that I'm in control here...~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse snorts from the comment before retorting, \"Not for long, frog.\" Suddenly the lightning white horns on his head flash with electricity, blinding Hex's vision for a brief moment that forces him to shield his eyes with an arm. It gives the Zebstrika ample time to hammer his fists into the Toxicroak's stomach to send the poisonous frog off from his intended prisoner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crruk!!\" Hex croaks aloud in surprise, before truly becoming shocked once the Zebstrika hauls himself up and electrocutes the Toxicroak with crackling bolts. The Toxicroak's muscles spasm, leaving flopping on the ground dumbly as the horse continues the assault by shocking Hex repeatedly. The frog doesn't even have a free chance to attack or escape from the onslaught. It wasn't long before the Zebstrika ceases his sparks to leave the Toxicroak left on the walkway floor, steaming, and twitching in place; Hex was completely stunned on his back. \"H-Hk...hk...\" He groans with widened rolled up eyes, throbbing fingers, thighs, and cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zebstrika scoffs at the Toxicroak's current state before stepping a hoof onto the frog's stomach. \"Now who's in control, throat sac?\" He taunts down before stepping a hoof onto the orange bubble at Hex's neck, forcing the Toxicroak to squirt out most of what remained of his purple venom onto the floor. The only response the frog can give is twitches from his eyelids and a wince from his flopped tongue, finding the action to breathe to be a challenge as his chest constantly pulsates from the left over static. The horse growls, \"Hff...that's what I thought. Time to disappear, frog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the Toxicroak down for the count, the stallion steps off from the frog. Reaching a hand to his flaccid member, the Zebstrika begins to stroke at his large cock. The horse member was quite lengthy and thick, even when it was flaccid, but with enough work the stallion gets it to a throbbing good size pointed outwardly in his tugging palm. \"You might not be a lady like I'd prefer, but you can still help me bust a good load, frogmeat~\" He taunts again with his large black balls swelling and bobbing between his legs during his stroking. The Zebstrika smiles as he has his vein-throbbing, pre-spurting weapon at the ready to claim the frog's body. His hands bind the Toxicroak's ankles together, and with ease, begins to slide them through the flared cocktip. The paws smush in with the head of the meat devouring them with a firm tug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex can feel his back drag along the ground with an intense wet heat sinking at his legs, but all he can muster are idle rubs when they're bound together. \"Cr-Crrahh...nnh...\" He croaks, almost hiccuping each time he throbs on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaahhhhh...been awhile since I've had someone go down my dick and stew in my balls. What better meal than you? Heh hehhh...\" The horse murrs, closing his eyes while stroking his fat pillar of dickmeat as it claims its Toxicroak meal. The amphibian's smooth skin makes it easy to swallow in with the urethral lips, pooling out pre from around his thighs as they submerge inside. The legs lump out the dick nicely for the horse to grope with his palms and fingers, getting every twitching wince and pathetic struggle Hex can muster inside. It didn't help that Hex could barely process much in the situation, but something twisted and dark was occurring. An erection sports on his groin, twitching in its own right. Perhaps it was just his muscles going haywire that made his penis decide to rise up, maybe the hot pre pooling over his legs and groin caught its interest, or maybe the demented thought of actually wanting to be sloshing in the Zebstrika's fat balls as his spunk allured Hex. The frog was scared to admit the latter, but passes it off as the mastermind just wanting the Toxicroak to submit to the voracious desires plaguing the land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Ahh...st-stahp...\" The frog croaks weakly, trying to dig his fingers at the floorboards to stop the progress, but his paralysis stopped him from overpowering the strong cock hungry for his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a chance, asshole. You're gonna be ball batter in a moment, so just keep laying back and enjoy the show.\" The horse snapped back, stroking at his cock far more aggressively to start batting his thick balls up against the bulging member. The ebony dick fattens out with each passing moment, slipping past Hex's groin and rear end, needing to stretch over the cheeks. \"Pshh, look at you, you're even enjoying yourself. Is this what you always wanted? Dragged in a dick and digested in spunk? Well lucky for you that you got yourself caught by me. I'll give your life a good send-out~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBinding Hex's arms to his sides, the frog is fed into the hot cock interior, feeling the slimy walls clench and yank down on his frame to send him sinking in with single pulses. The Toxicroak's head now only remains from the cock's tip, slipping dangerously close inside. He pants out with breath, shimmying uselessly inside the tall pillar bulging with his figure. \"Uaaa-aaahh...!\" The Toxicroak whines out with reddened cheeks and a drooling mouth, forced to endure the hot pre oozing out from around his neck on his face. The cock twitches and wobbles in the air, ready to claim its meal at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zebstrika grips a hand to the curved crest of the Toxicroak's head while neighing, \"What's the matter? Get on in there. You're cockfood already, so you might as well enjoy it while you can before I'm shooting you out onto the floor, heh~\" The horse pushes down on Hex's blushing and stunned face, slipping it completely inside to capture the frog. \"Hhh...thought you could get the better of me huh? Let's see hear your cocky tone when I'm gurgling you into cum~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zebstrika moans aloud to the ceiling as the pathetically struggling Toxicroak oozes his way down the length of his horse dick, spilling into the scrotum to fatten out the swollen black balls all the more. \"Aaaahhh~! Hot damn, that hits the spot!\" The equine boasts as his cock tightens back into a more standard size after its meal, leaving the horse to fap it with both of his hands with bucking hips. His hooves stomp at the walkway floorboards some as his fat balls nearly touch to ground in their sloshing swings. The orbs bounce and wobble, loudly churning with the hot horse semen inside that the paralyzed frog was now imprisoned in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cr-Crraooahhk!\" Hex whines out, trying his best to move, but it all felt too intense with heat and...pleasure. The semen smothering him weighs down on his body, making it feel softer and slippery. His head lolls back with his throat bulging out from his aroused croaks. \"Y-You...r-r-rude...monster...th-this isn't the end for me...!\" The frog however is stifled once the cum really starts to swirl inside, sinking him in under the stuff with nothing more than bubbles reaching the pool's churning surface. \"B-Bbllbp--bllcrk...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Zebstrika is leaned against the fence of the upper walkway, tugging at his cock with slick faps and awful moans ambiently echoing to the ceiling. \"Ooo-oouughhh...~!\" With a rapid rate of stroking, he fills the room with the fast and wet sounds of his pre-soaked cock and hand working together to reach his climax. \"Aauughhh~!!!\" The horse tosses his head back, spreads his legs, and unleashes the digested load in his balls. Thick amounts of his white sperm spew through the air, rocketing from his large rod to arc onto the walkway and over it. Blast after blast, the Toxicroak fueled semen spurts out with continuous blasts to empty out the horse's balls. Several minutes of just cumming out his gallons leaves the horse breathless and satisfied from dealing with the intruder, unaware of the frog's importance or goal. \"Thanks, jizz stain~\" He huffs, leaving Hex as nothing more than oozing white cum dripping off a walkway...</i></span></div></div>",

That was the frog's logic, and he knew he'd have at least enough to take the Zebstrika out like the others if he needed to. As soon as the horse made his way past where Hex was above, the Toxicroak leaps off the wooden beam. He lands to shake the wooden walkway however, alerting the stallion to twist around at the sound of the impact. \"What the-\" He stammers as the frog goes in to swipe a Poison Jab towards the Zebstrika. The Toxicroak only manages to scratch one of his arms, and even then, it wasn't an injection. All it managed to do was piss the Zebstrika off after he finished taking a step back to dodge the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell are you? Think you can just sneak up on me, huh?\" The horse growls out with his white horns and back crackling with electricity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak huffs, whipping out his fists to be ready to really fight, \"You're a bit faster than I thought, but you're certainly nothing I can't handle. I guess those strong legs of yours distracted me too much, hm~\" Standing up straight, the frog apologizes, \"Sorry, but just give me a moment, and I'll have you all cute and on your knees. Then you can you tell me where I can find a certain friend of mine I need to take out of here. We both have overstayed our welcome here~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the frog leaps forward, taking purple-lined swings of his knuckle claws in an effort to really strike the horse with his venom. But with only one direction to go, the horse hops back each and every time, narrowly escaping the swinging arms. \"Grrrrhhhh, oh you think you're some tough guy, huh perv? How about you fawn over me when I'm beating you to a pulp?!\" The Zebstrika suddenly stomps both hooves down and sends a bolt of electricity into the nearest body in front of him; Hex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frog widens his eyes, staggering back with his body shocked and convulsing some before he can manage to stand back upright. \"H-Hrkk...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis leaves him open for the horse to take a step back before charging forward at the Toxicroak with electricity crackling and glowing around his entire body! The Zebstrika charges with a Volt Tackle, and the frog had nowhere on the narrow walkway to go, and he certainly couldn't jump from the balcony with his stunned legs. He could only stagger forward to try and nail a hit in on the horse. However, the stallion easily overpowers him and catches him before he could with his intense speed. The Zebstrika smashes into Hex during his sprint forward, keeping the yelping Toxicroak trapped against the running electric horse from the momentum. Voltage shocks through Hex's muscles and bones, getting his entire figure to shudder against the grappling horse with nowhere else for the static to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, the two were approaching a fork in the walkway during the Zebstrika's charge, one path going to the left and to the right. The only thing forward was a small wooden guard railing with a drop down to the floor level below. Hex wasn't able to stop the growling Zebstrika, bound in the other male's strong arms, packed against the flat chest with electricity zapping off his own body. \"A-A-Ahgghhk!! Ccrrkckkk!!!\" Hex exclaims to warn the horse, but the two smash through the fence railing and plummet to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow them were barrel kegs of alcohol which most of the Toxicroak smashes into first, taking most of the impact with the large and heavy masculine horse on top of him slamming him through the wood. The barrels smash with others rolling away from the hit, steam rising off from the place where the Zebstrika drilled him into. The stallion steps out from the carnage, panting with a few scrapes on his body, but more or less fine. Turning around, he sees the result of his tackle. The Toxicroak is left groaning lightly with his back against some of the broken wood panels with a cracked barrell above him leaking out beer onto his head with his limbs sprawled out uselessly. Bruises litter his body as it shines in a wet glisten from all of the alcohol coating him, with ale and wine puddling underneath the smashed pile of kegs. The Zebstrika huffs, stepping his hooves into the wet ground to reach out and grab Hex by the curved crest on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hhhh...hhhh...got anything to say for yourself now...?\" The Zebstrika growls, glaring face to face with the defeated frog. Hex's eyelids remained drooped down all the way for the most part, with only a weak croak groaning from his lips. He was unconscious, leaving him to the horse's desires in how to deal with the trespasser. \"Pshh. I don't know who you are or what you're doing in here, but nobody gets the better of me! And since you're nicely marinated in ale...\" The Zebstrika's maw suddenly opens up, sticking the frog's wincing face into his equine jaws to meet the tongue and muscles eager to taste the Toxicroak. The tastebuds soak in the alcohol coating Hex's head, coercing the tongue to scoop, slurp, curl, and wallow anywhere it can over the smooth amphibian surface to enjoy both the drink and the meal Hex would provide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the horse collects the frog better in his hands to hoist the limp frog into his mouth, disappearing behind the black lips to bulge out his cheeks, lumping out his neck with the head of the Toxicroak after a firm, 'gllrk'. Hex's face smushes in together from the narrow yet thick throat walls clenching around his head, tugging it down the Zebstrika's big neck to draw the wet frog deeper and deeper to his awaiting doom in the thing's stomach. The bandit closed his eyes, murring as his tongue slaps up at his prey's chest repeatedly, swallowing repeatedly to just draw in the alcohol dripping from the light purple flesh. \"Scchhhlp...sllkk...grmph~\" He moans slightly around Hex's delicious body, enjoying the beer-cooked frog after the voltage certainly warmed up his flesh. The left over static even get his meal to twitch against him at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClapping his hands onto Hex's ass cheeks to grip onto, the Toxicroak is devoured. Swallow after swallow, the frog disappears into the Zebstrika's jaws as they bite around his prey, suckles around it, and drags it in with a lean of his head and the round flex of his neck. Other bandits come into the room just to see what all the commotion earlier was about, just to find their comrades taking in the limber mystery legs of a Toxicroak stranger. No one goes to stop him however, too busy enjoying the show or being ticked about their smashed beer kegs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last, the Zebstrika stands tall with his head tossed back, drawing in the twitching Toxicroak hindpaws inside before sealing them behind his gnashed flat teeth, gulping down the last of Hex. Both of his hands were already on his stomach, feeling his belly swell out greatly from his tall meal collecting inside. The unconscious Toxicroak's body awkwardly curls into the hot chamber, slumped in the juices pooling inside and bubbling lightly already which gets the horse to neigh in delight. He claps his hands together on the taut belly, having the thing wobble about in its roundness and weight. \"Oouugh, damn that really hit the spot. It's been awhile since I've eaten too... Thanks for the dinner, asshole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stifles a belch and glares at the other bandits, huffing, \"Some Toxicroak got past the guards, but he couldn't get past me, heh~\" The Zebstrika boasts, clapping a hand against his gut before walking ahead, pushing his way past the other men. \"Now outta my way. Gotta tell Damien the good news~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse makes his way to where the bandit leader's balcony would be in the lumber mill fort, ready to inform the Houndour about the break-in and the suspicion there might be traitors amongst the bandit group. Surely the leader would know who to suspect. And all the while during the trip, the Zebstrika gropes at his swaying gut with the Toxicroak intruder tight inside, splashing in his acids...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"An excellent job, Flash!\" Damien's words murr out while on his typical couch in the mill's main lobby where most of the bandits relax and converse. The Houndour was laying back with his Persian girl, Sapphire, caressing at his bare chest, purring in delight into what they were both looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlash the Zebstrika stands before them with a rotund belly stewing up the trespasser he informed them of. \"Heh...no problem, boss. The frog thought he could get the slip on me, but I really showed him, huh~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did. And I'm in your debt for informing me of this little...incursion...\" Damien thinks about who the frog was coming back to get, with it either being Lace the Lucario or the new Typhlosion, 'Zack'. The Houndour gets up from his seat and actually offers it to Flash, grinning, \"Here, let Sapphire treat you. She'll take wonderful care of you as I go to see about some business with Bigby. He's told me he's caught an intruder himself, and I'm eager to find out what's going on around here...\" The horse's genitals thrum at the sound of this, with the female Persian giving him a coy look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien guides the horse to sit down where he was just before with the young dog murring, \"Sit tight and relax. I have a hunch something's going on, and I'm keen on snuffing the issue out. And with your help, I think we've accomplished that. Enjoy the frog stew. Hope he lasts long in there for what he's done~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the Houndour leader takes his exit, leaving the Zebstrika and the Persian alone on the couch. Her arms caress at his body now, delicately tracing clawed fingers over his thick gut to grope and knead. \"Mmmhh...you truly are a stallion...I do love a man that just takes what he wants~\" The feline purrs with delight, biting her smiling mouth at his neck. Her hands can feel the Toxicroak balled up inside, who was now awake and aware of his surrounding, bathing in the hot juices bent on melting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">G-Gggmphk...! B-Bbllbp...!</font>\" The muffled whines croak out defeatedly, but through time, they die out with the horse's moans and gurgling...</i></span></div></div>",

The Luxray nods, takes a few steps back, all before finally turning around and heading out to follow the villagers she was tasked with staying close to. The Marowak gives an immediate and single pat against your back as he heads off to follow her, leaving just you and the frog there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak cocks a brow with a curled finger at his chin, \"Hm? Something on your mind? Don't tell me you're getting cold paws now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not it.\" You explain before trying to find the words. \"I just...felt as though we should talk to one another, in case we don't really get a chance to again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex stares slightly down at you with a light case of being taken back some, before his expression settles into his typical playful smile. His throat sac bloats and croaks more happily. \"Well isn't that just adorable~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm being serious.\" You retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands suddenly cup your cheeks though, and the gay frog murrs, \"I know you are, Mr. Hero. But this won't be the last time we'll talk. It's a promise. I still have far too many clever jokes that you still need to hear. But those can wait after we deal with the pesky pup inside that mill.\" You smile back some, but you can't help but fixate your eyes to the frog that just stared back at you, like not a single worry was running though his mind. Hex seemed like he would prance around in Damien's mill if he could, despite him not have seeing all that you had. Realizing you're just standing there quietly, your own hands find their way taking Hex's cheeks to leave the frog curious. \"...Lace~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean in with closed eyes, unable to hold back a kiss to his mouth. Your muzzle meets his lips, locking together in a zip that Hex didn't waste too much time in putting effort himself. He thumbs at your furry cheeks, feeling the warm of your natural light blush appearing as he croaks far more quickly with his delight. \"Crrrrr...crrrrr...crrrrr~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a pluck of your lips, you break the moment after a minute or two before you really lost control with it. \"...Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're apologizing for kissing me~?\" The frog taunts, keeping his chest and stomach pressed up against you, cradling your head in his palms and looking directly down at you. One of his long legs was even bent with a heel craned off the ground, tucking a knee more in between your own legs as he kept his balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More-so that it might be an inappropriate time.\" You huff back, feeling his smiling lips press at your nosetip. He lightly nibbles the black canine nose, resorting into you wiggling it some. \"...Yeah that was pretty dumb of me to say. I just felt compelled to, I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, and stop being cute...~\" Hex adds, really running his fingers at your cheeks before kissing your nose. \"I'm not offended at all. You're welcome to kiss me whenever you feel like it actually! I'll take free kisses from anyone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about that last wording, you ask, \"Sorry but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's that pesky apology word again.\" He huffs, wanting you to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou prepare to apologize just for that, but you realize you just need to get on with your point. \"-But I was also wanting to tell you something else. In the morning, when you told me you wanted to keep yourself in an open relationship, I don't mind. I wanted to make that really clear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...?\" The frog mutters in revelation while retracting. \"...Didn't you already mention that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take his hands into your own, applying light squeezes. \"Yeah, but I felt like it needed to be reinstated, in case you didn't fully take me serious.\" You keep yours eyes locked to him, having your furry front smear with his smooth and fleshy exterior. \"I like you Hex, I like you a lot. If it weren't for you, I might not be around right now so just... I don't know what's going to happen with us fighting Damien or the mastermind, but, with whatever time we have left, I'm glad you're spending it with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex gives a soft blink and grin, sliding a hand to brush the top of your head between your ears, \"I think it's rather understandable you'd feel the need to appease me since I have maybe saved your life once or twice. It's only natural, but I'm glad to be spending time with you as well. These past few days have certainly been remarkable ones that I wouldn't trade for the world. You're doing me a service to go out and cure my sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head however, \"No, no that isn't just it. Stop being humble.\" Your arms slowly begin to wrap around the frog's sides and back to keep yourself locked to him as you nose at his mouth again, \"...Your charm hooked me the moment we first spoke to each other. You care about people so much, even if they wrong you or push you away like Gold. You always have that dumb smile plastered on your face, and I can't ever feel down whenever I see it. And last night back in the tent...it was the best night I've ever had before, and I want to be able to experience something like that every night...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were getting the Toxicroak to blush back himself, getting a rosy coloration and rubbing his taut thighs together. \"O-Oh dear...~\" His own arms bring themselves around you, but cup at your shoulders to hold onto as a brace. \"...I...don't think I could have sex with you <i>every</i> night if that's what you're imply-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that's not what I'm implying, but I think you just want to hear me say it aloud.\" You retort, being more assertive in your words, \"I liked being in a bed with you. Being at your side, quietly talking, getting to feel you. Yes, of course I liked the sex, but my favorite thing was just to be able to be sleeping against you and waking up to see you in the morning. You were just casually drinking your tea, smiling at me like nothing was wrong in the world. You don't let the bad get to you.\" You lean in, kissing Hex again to force him into another tuck of each other's lips. You slightly give a bite to Hex's bottom lip before letting it go, smiling yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frog's hands tighten on your shoulders with his body having a light shiver to you. \"...Stop being this sweet. You need to be the big tough guy with a plan like you always are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is me with a plan. And I plan on doing anything I can for you, together.\" You add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex stares at you some with hot red cheeks and a sheepish smile where you can see his flat teeth. Closing his eyes however, you discover his hands taking yours and he slides them down his back to reach for his taut rear end. His cheeks fill your hands, coercing a sudden grope to them to fatten in your fingers and grip. The frog croaks with his orange sac and murrs aloud, \"...After this bandit business is over and done with, you're getting a turn to fuck me~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arousal thrums at that idea, instigating another squeeze to Hex's ass with your tail now wagging, \"Oh, we're taking turns now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's the only way you'll think you'll ever top me, pooch~\" The Toxicroak teases before giving your nose one last nibble before slipping another kiss of his own. But this wasn't the typical light smooching you had been delivering before. Both of your heads were tilted alternatively, locking your full mouths together with wet lips and tongues. The muscles smear and drag over one another, exploring the contours and creases of the other. Your hands don't waste the opportunity they have either. Rolling, you knead the cheeks around, smushing them together before spreading them apart to get Hex's pucker to tighten up and startle a croaking moan from the kiss, \"C-Crrmph...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile the best you can with sealed wide jaws, giving a spank to the ass that has Hex retract away from you. \"A-Ahem...yes...well...\" He mutters with a wide grin, looking away from you, \"...I think it's best if we, ahem, didn't get too riled up right before what we need to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, frog-o. Just don't forget everything I told you.\" You mention, but not before you give another popping slap to his ass to jiggle his cheeks and make him jump in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah~\" He yelps lightly before wiggling his hips to be free of your hands at last as they return to your sides. He however takes one into his own to croak, \"...I don't think it's ever possible that I could. I just don't need to have a boner when I'm trying to sneak around the bandit base, you know~? But you can hold my hand on the way there, at the very least.\" He gives you a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin, thumbing over the top of the hand before lightly pulling at it to guide him with you, \"Let's make this a quick job then. I want to get back to us doing this~\" He simply scoffs, walking with you at your side to hold your hand the entire way before you'd reach Damien's camp. It would seem unprofessional if you took down the bandit leader while holding another man's hand after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>In order for you to continue the story, please go to this link!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n[ <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1799220-Viral-Pokemon-Vore/map/115312111111111111111111212211111111111111121111111211111121211121111111211112111111111111121111111221111111121111111111111111111111111111\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/ite...</a> ]</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Is something up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look directly to her, \"You alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ear flicks and her head tilts, \"Uhh...yeah? I think so. Maybe just a little cold but...I'm not scared of fighting any dumb bandits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're scared that I am.\" You explain, and the expression she makes back at you makes it seem like it was all true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You can handle yourself. Like you said. You've taken things down that are far more threatening than just some horny, hungry punks.\" She retorts, looking away some with the grip on her crossed arms tightening up from the sudden prodding questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Star...\" You prod again, knowing that wasn't a satisfactory answer you had been given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe huffs and curls her hands into fist, twisting her upper body some with sudden anger, \"Don't 'Star' me! Yes, yes I'm worried about you, okay? Are you happy? Am I not allowed to be worried about you when you just decide that you want to go into a random settlement just because there's a chance they might not be bad? Am I not allowed to worry when you just head off to some evil bandit hideout all by yourself? Am I not allowed to worry when you just do the same exact thing, having to deal with ferals, bandits, and this fucked up Damien guy while the mill blows up and burns down? Huh?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expected her to snap, but not by that much so soon. But considering that she's bottled up emotions for the past two days, you can't really blame her. At least it could be a positive she wasn't so quiet and held-back as before now. \"...I'm just doing what I can to help people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can help people, Lace, but that doesn't mean you can save everyone. That doesn't mean you can just go out there alone and try to do all of the hard things on your own. I hate to break it to you, but you're as mortal as the rest of us. If you went out somewhere off on your own and never came back, I just...I wouldn't know what to...\" She started to mumble and roll her head, fighting back her concerns and feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach out to her, but she turns just enough for you to miss. She cups a hand on her mouth, not wanting to make eye contact just yet, remaining reclusive. \"You're never going to be alone again, Star.\" You tell her directly and up front, \"I might put myself at risk, but it's because it's the right thing to do. I have all of you right behind me though. This group wouldn't exist if I wanted to do things by myself. I need all of you. We've made it this far, and we're not going to let bandits or ferals stop us from finishing what we started.\" Reaching out once more, you're able to cup her shoulder and make the Luxray face you again, \"I need <i>you</i>. These villagers hardly seem like fighters, and there's no one else I trust that could take care of all of them than you. You're strong, and you fight for what's right, like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar huffs with a shaking voice and has her hands planted against your chest now, lightly pushing at you. She has a smiling, but a tearing eye, \"...You know Lace, I really, really hate how you have to be the big hero in everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know.\" You reply and scoop your arms more around the Luxray, enveloping her into a hug. \"And I'm not doing this alone. Hex will be right there helping me get Jackal, and all three of us are getting out. Believe me, this isn't going to be the first time I get Jackal out of a burning building, he can vouch for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luxray emits a soft sound, like a sneer almost, wrapping her own arms around you. Her head rests against your chest, above your dulled spike to breathe out some. \"You'll have to come back to tell me about that then, and all the adventures you had before we met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a promise~\" You say as you stroke a hand at her thick mane. With a leaned down muzzle, you kiss her forehead in comfort which coerces her hands to cling to the yellow fur of your back. \"I'll try not to rush ahead to do things myself from now on though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you...\" She mutters, and the two of you just remain standing there in each other's hold during the dark night in the forest. The wind coldly blows by and the trees rustle in place. It felt as though you were the only two people around on the entire planet in that moment, quietly not saying anything and just enjoying the bare moment for what it was worth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Star gives a pat to your back and begins to loosen up. \"Go get your best friend. He needs you, and I have some people that need me.\" You smile at her and let her go, allowing the Luxray to take a step back and fix her ruffled mane from how you brushed it about. \"The entire attack today doesn't need to go down the drain just cause we wanted a night full of awkward hugging.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hugging was awkward? I was enjoying myself.\" You respond with Star to sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, fine, I guess it was nice and all.\" The Luxray steps back a bit more, holding a single arm and kind of slowly staggers away. \"Come back to me after this, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it.\" You say with a wide grin, watching the cat walk away some. But in the end, Star appears like she was contemplating on leaving, and instead, approaches right up to you with hands against your chest again and her lips meeting yours. You're not given too much time to kiss back with Star leaning her mouth back out, now just staring up at you some. \"A goodbye kiss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe huffs, \"It's a see-you-later kiss. And I felt as though I would've regretted it if I didn't do so.\" Her hands remove themselves from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After Damien's camp is over and done with, let's meet up where we can talk more. I'd love to tell you what all I've done so far.\" You explain to her as both of you were stepping back from one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar was holding her arm still, but behind her back with a bit of a saunter in her step. \"Good. I'mmm sure they're quite the listen...~\" The grass crunches even under soft steps, along with your own. The way she looked and gave you that one-eyed peek appeared magical in a way. Her head was tilted away with a light grin on it, showing off the eye-patch side of her face mostly. But you can still see her eye of the other side of that short cat nose bridge, looking at you. She was sated with ease about your confidence, yet you can tell there's still that sense of worry in her. It means that she cares though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally turn around and head off where Hex had headed, calling out, \"I'll see you later, Star.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you later, Lace...\" She mutters. You don't know how long it took for her to turn around, but you felt as though Star watched you go the whole way before doing so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>In order for you to continue the story, please go to this link!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n[ <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1799220-Viral-Pokemon-Vore/map/115312111111111111111111212211111111111111121111111211111121211121111111211112111111111111121111111221111111121111111111111111111111111111\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/ite...</a> ]</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Serperior naga spills its large coils over the fallen tree to advance both you and the fallen Persian just a bit of ways from your body. Obviously Ruby lacked in any skill or effort for teamwork, so you'd just have to handle the masculine serpent in your own way. Leaping up onto your hindpaws while ignoring all of the pain in your upper body, you ready your fists with flaming aura to face off against the naga alone. \"Bring it, big guy.\" He huff aloud as it flickers its forked tongue with flexed muscles, more than happy to meet your challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt lunges out with open hands, but you're more worried about the gaping maw dashing at you to claim your body. For the split second, you can even see the lightly glistening interior from the dim evening light as its wet upper fangs unfold from the roof of its mouth. However, you meet your fist to its cheek to slam the things jaws away from you, sending the arms away as well with its torso slamming onto the ground. Reacting quick, you lift up a leg to burn with aura to deliver a stomp to its head while you still can for a quick charge. \"I'm not ending up as snake food tod-\" You're cut off however once the thing's tail sweeps by to trip your only standing leg. \"Wahh!\" You exclaim while falling back, right onto the naga's long body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo time is wasted as its tail scoops around your ankles, binding your legs together as its heavy length climbs your body, looping up to your thighs already. \"D-Damn it! No!\" You growl with bearing teeth as you endeavor to kick and squirm your lower limbs free from the thick loops of snake wrapping around you, but there was no hope into that alone freeing them. With arms raised, you're prepared to start punching at the coils with your burning fist, but they're suddenly restrained by the wrists in the Serperior's hands. Apparently the strong naga recovered and it was certainly unamused with how troublesome you and the cat had been acting thus far. You stare into its almost hypnotic, terrifying purple eyes as it glares at you. Your arms are easily sandwiched to your sides from its own overpowering arms for its coils to now have a far easier ascension up your body. Your stomach and chest disappear into the spiraling snake figure, feeling the thick tube of muscles restrain every writhe and twitch you can muster while they dangerously close in around you tighter. You take a worried breath, but your air tunnel locks up the moment a coil seizes around your neck which leaves only your head sticking out from a perfectly spiraled mound sitting up from the ground. The naga hisses pleasantly to see you completely trapped in your tight prison, causing it to hug and flex its strong coils to compact you for a bare moment, squeezing out any air that you had in your lungs with your mouth locking up wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Aahckk...! <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">Ckck....nk...achk....</font>\" You choke out, drooling from your open mouth with twitching eyelids and bristled fur as you feel every body part within you painfully squish up together with nonexistent space to flee into. Oxygen is closed off from your throat, making your nose and mouth useless at this point as they strain for air of any kind inside. For some reason your heartbeat ambiently thumps into your eardrums with a slight ringing echoing around. A cold burn emanates in your neck with your vision having a more dark border around it, seeing nothing but the figure of the buff Serperior glaring down at you with those taunting purple eyes as it licks its lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coils however loosen just slightly once a sudden meowing growl rumbles out, taking the naga's attention. You try to blink and adjust your vision, able to take a few squeaks of air in as you focus on what was happening. You see Ruby having leapt up and forward to the infected Serperior with outstretched claws in hopes to sneak some attacks in while it was distracted with you. But the Persian slut is claimed in a sudden vice grapple of the male snake's muscled arms, squeezed into a hug of sorts against its pecs and abs. \"Ghhaakk!!!\" Ruby exclaims with widened, shaking eyes and gnashed teeth. Squirm as he might, the tough arms delivering a crushing squeeze to cease his kicks and thrashing, forcing a gasping yelp from the cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill with faint eyes of your own, you feel the ever present need to just fall asleep from how little your blood was flowing and how slow your heart was getting without much needed oxygen. Your eyelids fall down over your vision, encompassing you in the dark before your strong will alone forces them back up. Every time you open your arms, it seems like time had skipped some, because now the naga's open mouth was sealed over Ruby's head, circling its wiry tongue around to enjoy his mewling meal twitching in its arms. Blinking slowly again, The Persian meal is sunken down to his chest and abdomen as the naga plays with Ruby's ass cheeks. Its palms and fingers explore the lovely two mounds and tight pucker hidden under the wincing tail, really working Ruby's ass that's probably claimed a few innocents on his own feeding accord. The cat can kick his legs all he wants, but with another tired blink, you see them disappearing into the snake's wet jaws to follow the long bulges of its pecs to round out its muscled gut on its upper body. You even see the Serperior's slit slowly stretch out with its pink rod, stretching out from just under the thing's upper belly at its groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">H-Hk...gck...</font>\" Is all you can say out to the Persian now completely inside the Serperior's stomach, wobbling the round white and green belly, helplessly trapped inside. Stewing gurgles emit around the muffled cat in his constant thrashing and groaning which please the snake into delivering firm pats to the taut, strong gut. Its eyes return to you however with the now twitching erection throbbing at its crotch, almost eye-level with you in fact. Another clenching squeeze gets yet another tight whine out of your mouth. The coils were hooked up so strongly around your neck, your mouth was forced to remain wide open in an effort to claim any oxygen possible into your dry and wincing throat. Your tongue uselessly quivers and your dreary eyes can only see the victorious Serperior lower a hand down to grip at your head fur tightly with its groin aiming at the available hole of yours to fuck. It claimed a meal, and with how you're presented to him, you'd make a good use as its toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large cock meat slides right in with ease to your forced-welcoming mouth, slipping right over your wincing tongue to feel even the muscles in its dick. Your eyes roll upwards to show off their whites and your ears fold submissively back as well, closing off any chance of breathing you had as the cockmeat stuffing your jaws even spills out drool from the sides once it claims all the space there. \"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Splchk...glk...</font>\" You tug lightly against the thick rod as it digs its way into your clench throat, making enough passage to funnel any pre down through your narrow tunnel. Any breath you attempt to draw only results into weakly sucking your captor's dick, but there wasn't anything else you could do at that point. Your body was forcing your throat to tug in what it could with your vision and hearing going all blurry. It feels like the naga was thrusting into your mouth at this point from the muffled wet splotches of sex reaching your ear drums from time to time, but at this point, every sense just felt numb. Your brain can't even handle any thoughts or regrets from its lack of oxygen, not even understanding the consequence of your body becoming infected now as the panting snake thrusts repeatedly into your throat like it was a wrestling battle to get it through, feeding you its pre and soon the hot cum it had stewed up just for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a faint whine...you pass out finally, unaware of the troubles you'll cause or the people you needed to save.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Serperior continues to hump its unconscious fucksleeve for awhile to really enjoy the wet sounds filling the forest air. Its stomach bobs and wobbles with each hump, but the cat inside was already out for the count at this point as the infected's stomach easily churns his meal into the meaty soup it'd become. With a triumphant hiss, the snake busts its load into your limp jaws and throat to fill your stomach with the roping shots of its orgasm. Its coils loosen up so your body can take every spew it jets out into your neck until it all dies down with time. The slick member slides out and the Serperior lets your useless body drop onto the dirt from its coils. A flick of its tongue, the snake is sated for now in what it's caught today, gifting you the chance to join the ranks of its own kind from your fighting efforts, and after the justified punishment it delivered. Slithering away while gurgling its meal down, your limp figure is left stupidly sprawled on the grass with the infected seed already corrupting your system and allowing the mastermind behind it all to claim you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>With a growl, the Lucario left in the forest stirs awake. Its tail twitches and its arms picks itself off from the grass with his body inhaling air into its lungs that strangely feel strained, but now with the ferocity of a feral, it easily ignores the aching and already achieves a firm stand. Its eyes blink open to reveal a loss of self with its fully purple vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ggggrrrrraahhhhrrr...\" It exhales with a snarled mouth to show off its fangs and drooling glands. A hungry growl from its own stomach joins its angry needs, feeling the ever-present need to feed. Stepping forward and discovering its newfound power, the Lucario once known as Lace staggers forward before heading off defiantly to go and find its own living, kicking meal to sate this maddening hunger.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your hands are already slapping up under Ruby's thighs, lifting him off from his hindpaws with his legs spreading apart to make plenty of room for his ass to hover above your throbbing erection. The veins in your dick pulse with your rapid heartbeat when your arousal takes over your conscience's decision-making. \"Hhh...\" You breath out, breaking your kiss with Ruby as the Persian's legs crossing behind your back as you hold him against a tree. His back rides up against the bark with his eyes pinched closed and his fingers combing your yellow fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuhhnnff..., hurry the fuck up, you dog~\" The cat purrs, eager to be drilled away. You happily deliver by nudging the tip of your erection up against those furry round buns of his, finding your way to his pucker smooching your cock's tip with a clench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grit your fangs to give your first hump to Ruby's rump, forcing him to yowl happily as he's bumped upward. The light bob only gets him to descend back down, stuffing more of your length inside that enforces a growl deep within your throat. The way his rectum was already neatly tying your cock inside his warm hole was enough to get you hammering in some more inches with extra humps, giving Ruby no time to relax the penis inside. Both of you wanted as much as you could as fast as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands slide up from your exposed back to clench at your shoulders now that his pucker was fitted tight around your dick, resting at your bulbous knot that was only swelling more with time. \"...Hhh...hhh...A-Aghn...you're...quite the large one...~\" Ruby compliments, wincing from the firm ache in his rump. It only elicits another hump from you as you get a rhythm going to having your way with the enemy, probing his ass and bouncing his asscheeks against your impatient knot during the cold night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only exhale with desire in response, taking more attention and energy into fucking the cat rather than thanking him. The head of your member plunges deeper into his rectum to spread those wobbling cheeks of his, grinding his back to the trunk of the large tree with your swaying balls batting up at his curling tail, overzealous with pleasure. Pre is already spurting inside to help slicken the ride and make your experience with Ruby all the louder. The Persian was moaning loudly to the black wilderness with pinched shut eyes and a grip of his claws grazing at your shoulder. His fangs glisten with drool as his body seizes up the more you plow into him, all before a firm <i>pop</i> crams your thick knot inside to lock the two of your together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-HhOOHH~!!\" He exclaims with joy, rolling his head back against the tree with a happy open mouth. His flat chest inflates and deflates at a rapid pace with his breaths as his tail dances against the tree it's pinned against. Your cock even lumps out of his thin abdomen, ringing out a pleasured meow with each and every thrust you pack inside that lovely rear end. His cheeks hug and squeeze you of your pre, really giving your dick more of a workout than it's ever been used to at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...But your fun wasn't going to last for too long now that you were in an infected land with many preds, open and defenseless, and making quite the loud racket with that moaning cat you greedily wanted to fuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo glowing purple eyes gaze ahead at the scene displaying itself to them, rousing a beast to loom behind you with deadly silence. Ruby was far too into the moment with his shut eyes to warn you of the danger now just inches from your back. Jaws spread apart to drool onto the grass below it, eventually onto your head as it looms higher above you. Your eyelids break open some, wondering if it was beginning to rain, only to feel distraught when you tilt your head up to see two lavender eyes peering down at you with strong snake jaws underneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large Serperior naga has found its way too you, with an incredibly lengthy and thick body that surely was the work of having several meals pack its hide. The serpent body was topped with a rather fit torso and arms, easily that of a strong male that would be feared even without the intimidating snake length underneath and behind it. Your humps begin to slow down, and you desperately try to unplug your knot out from Ruby's asshole, but the clenching cat's rear holds strong, merely being pulled downward with it as Ruby murrs, \"AHhh!! H-Hmhmhmhmmhh...not so fast, mu-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stops when he notices the large and infected Serperior eyeing the two of you together in a rather awkward and dangerous predicament. Struggling wouldn't even occur as the large coils of the beast begin to envelop both you and your Persian enemy together, spiraled up by the green meaty length and ensnared almost completely by the snake. \"A-Ahrkk!!!\" You growl out with your arms pinned against Ruby, and his owns pinned against you in your accidental hug, trapped in the wrapped prison of the Serperior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-RrggghhhRRHH!!! L-Let go of me, mutt! I need to claw this stupid worm!\" The cat exclaims in a hiss, unable to unlatch his claws from against your shoulders as the spiral mound of the grass snake encloses faster around both him and you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Nnhhghh...c-c-can't...b-budge...\" You wheeze out, finding it harder to move let alone breathe. The Serperior licks its white lips in the easy catch of two males for its stomach, already crushing away at them with its coils alone as its buff arms are relaxed in a cross against its pecs. You wriggle in place the best your can, but your legs and arms are completely immobile with the only movement being in your hips...and your cock was still deeply lodged and knotted inside Ruby's rear end with no room to pull out. Wherever one was going...the either would have to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby growls with flattened ears and blue face, feeling the pressure of his lungs being far too great for his burning lungs, \"H-Hh...hh...! D-Damn...it...\" You find it hard to breathe as well, with any interior valve you needed inside of you locking up in a tight squeeze as the coils begin to twist and clench your bodies together strongly. Your ribs and limbs are put to the test as they strain for mercy, tightened to their limits with the world becoming even darker for you. Your eyes roll up and your ears begin to ring and pulse with your ambient, slowing heartbeat. It was hard to even think when you were overpleasured when having your way with Ruby, but the Persian's pucker was unwillingly hugging your dick to extreme means of strength that you were unable to hold back. Hot spunk spurts its way into him, forcing him to rip a loud moan out from his fanged mouth with shy eyebrows, hot red cheeks, and his own orgasm bursting against  each other's stomachs inside the coil trap. His sandwiched cock stuck between your flat furry abs finds its way leaking all the way up to your chests for room as your spunk has to fill every available nook and cranny of his rectum. The both of you are lost in a mixture of exhausting sexual pleasure with the asphyxiation that aided it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Gh.....\" You try to retain your consciousness as your head is unable to even keep itself held up, and it lolls back with your muzzle hanging open with a flopped tongue. Hardly even a breath is able to escape your throat as you're forced to see the blurry, dark image of the Serperior's triumphant violet gaze glow down at you before disappearing behind its unhinging jaws. The toothy snake maw encompasses your world in a wet squelch that tightens around your head, making your entire body disappear. Both you and Ruby's faces are crammed upwards against its thick and impatient gullet working your heads in together with an ominous gulp following afterwards. It's forked tongue swipes away at your neck and spunk stained chest, sending you away with your final moment in the world as an awfully twisted, humuliating one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Eh....uhnn....\" You try to take one last breath before you pass out lodged in the Serperior's throat, fading away to avoid the obvious end to both your journey and Damien's favorite pet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>The infected Serperior's lengthy tongue rims around at its own lips to take in the last of the cat and dog's flavor down with a final swallow, sighing out in delight from its midnight meal. A beautiful mound is outstretched in the naga's lower body in the middle. It sags on the grass, flattening it wherever the snake was able to drag it. With a grin, it begins to drape its tail around the serpent belly, coiling its own middle some the best it can to give a strong squeeze at the two dead meals inside, squishing the Persian and Lucario's bodies together inside its thick walls that stewed away countless of victims before them. And now, they shall add to the snake to make it a truly feared alpha of predators in these woods. Listening to the low gurgles and bubbling from inside its stomach it slithers off with the wobbling green hill, dragging it in an obvious flattening trail to sleep them off and awaken to another day...for another meal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lucario's willpower remained strong throughout his journey, but Lace inevitably fell to the psychic's influence when tempted enough.</i></span></div></div>",

He hardly had muscle on his figure with that femboy curvy figure of his, and you've taken down far more menacing things than Ruby has probably ever seen. You were confident in taking him down now. To distract him, you begin to talk, \"So I'm pretty sure I know of a good way around those tar pits, but I'd like to keep low and quiet since there were ferals around them that last time I-\" You cut your own sentence short by jabbing out your leg behind you kick at the Persian's midsection, nailing Ruby in the stomach to have the cat heave forward over your hindpaw some with a curled back. The landed hit gets you to twist around swinging your other leg at him, but the cat suddenly evades the kick and swipes your leg to scratch it. \"A-Ah!\" You bark out and stagger away some, feeling the thin burn left on your shin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby has his hands out with unsheathed claws from his fingertips, glaring at you with his crimson eyes, \"Hah...I knew you weren't to be trusted...just who are you and what do you want~?\" He demands to get an answer out of you with an open smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ready your fists and ignite them with aura, \"The name's Lace, and what I want more than anything is to kick your ass.\" You dash at the Persian and fling your burning fist at him, only to see his head duck under it to feel another scrape go across your abdomen with the cat dashing under your arm. You twist around and face him as he taunts back, \"Kick my ass? I'll be sure it's my ass that you fatten when I eat you and show myself off to Damien~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be sure to show Damien your bruised and battered body before I beat him just the same.\" You retort and send a blast of aura at the Persian. The nimble cat is already leaping over it however to send a kick right into your stomach that gets you to keel over before you receive another scratch going down your cheek. You stagger back and shove him off of you as he rises to a stand, licking his claws with an open, fanged smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think you can beat that hellhound, then you should have no problem with me then, right~?\" He murrs aloud, lapping around those sharp points. You can feel the sting of the scrapes get to you, nothing vital, but they were certainly distracting you from your fight. He wasn't strong, but he was faster than any Pokemon you've faced. And Damien's supposed to be better than him? A young brat like that? You disregard it and charge up an aura sphere into your palms, building up the burning blue energy next to you with Ruby wasting no time in dashing forward. He zigs and zags to distress your aim, unable to track him in the serpentine movements. \"Think you can catch this cat, bitch~?\" He mewls to anger you. You blast the ball forward to blow up in front of him at the ground, but he dives over and through the smoke with outstretched claws, using furious swipes again and again at your that scrape your chest, face, and arms. You yelp as you step back a few paces, getting clawed at by the cat. You make a brute sluggish punch outward just to get him away from you in the panic, only to have him swoop behind you and rake your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-AhHH!\" You yell out and fall to your knees from the stinging pain at your spinal crease before a hindpaw comes swinging in and slamming you into a tree headfirst, rocking your skull as you slump to the ground face first. Groaning in the aching, singing stings, you can hear the grassy steps of the cat sauntering his way to you, kicking your side to lay you on your back to see him standing by you, eclipsing the orange sky with his glowing red eyes and gemstone. Stepping over you, he plops his rear down on your chest to get you to huff out the air of your lungs. \"Hnngh!\" Attempting to grab him with your hands, your wrists are taken into his clawed grasps to be slammed against the dirt with you, pinning you in his straddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tail behind him plays in the air with his round rump smush against your furry broad chest, settling nicely on top of you as the clear victor of your sad attempt to subdue him. \"Hmph. Stupid pooch. You wouldn't stand a chance against Damien if I got you this easy. You better be thankful I was the one who beat you. My master wouldn't be as merciful as me~\" He purrs leaning his head down more to glare into your eyes. It burns in your heart that you got caught by this cat as you endeavor to get him off, but those claws reinforcing your wrists cease the hope of that happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing your pride, you grunt, \"G-Ggrrrrrr...well I certainly wouldn't be alone in taking parentless brat like that down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Do you mean your dumb fat fiery friend? Or do you have others in this heroic cause of yours, hmhm~?\" He asks with a smile and an extended ear. You decide it's best not to answer him and you only bear your fangs at him. \"I'll take that as the latter then. Interesting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better get off before I break you jaw so I don't have to see that smug face of your-AGHK!\" You were threatening the cat, only to receive a sudden headbutt with that tough gem striking you right in the noggin, making the back of your head hit a tree root as well. \"Gghhouughhhnn...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby huffs, \"You're in no position to be making threats, <i>Lace</i>. And you better choose your next words very carefully.\" The Persian has daggers for eyes in their own sharp gaze that you force yourself to abide to in hopes of getting to live. You got yourself into this mess. Now you had to see it through. \"Now I'm in a pretty good mood right now, getting to get a man down on his back, pinned underneath me. I get to decide your fate. Or rather, you do. I'm fine with letting you live if you plan to cooperate with Damien. He'll have a few questions for you, but I'll be sure you won't be tossed in the Game afterwards, or end up in someone's gut. Although I bet you'd make for a lovely, squirmy meal~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou growl at your circumstance and grunt, \"...And if I refuse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inquiry gets the to show off his wet fangs, lapping at them some before leaning down, nearly nose to nose with you, soaking up all of your vision in his predatory eyes. \"...Then I get eat a useless mutt~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it. Would you go with the offer? I mean it wasn't like you could trust him to keep his word should you be interrogated, but you and the others could still have a chance to fight back at Damien if you were alive. Living seemed like a pretty good option. But that would mean potentially betraying your group, and you could end up getting eaten in the end anyway. Perhaps you could pray for a miracle, stop this Persian, or hope the others would go on with your cause...</span></div></div>",

It broke your heart to think that this Persian got the better of you, but it's not like you could just go back and change your decision. Ruby can see it in your eyes that you had lost and had to admit your defeat, it just had to be painful to deal with the consequences of it. Swallowing a heavy weight in your throat, you groan out, \"F-Fine...\" The cat's expression shows that of delight, leaning in with a lifted ear, wanting to catch what you said again. Your lips flare in a twitch before you huff out, \"Fine, I-I accept your proposal. I'll talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby slowly leans back up, wiggling his butt against your chest and stomach some. \"That's a good boy. I knew I could help learn your place. Now...am I going to have to drag you over there, or do I have to cut you enough til you pass out~?\" He murrs, seemingly to enjoy both options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to take in enough breath as he's weighing down on your ribs to grunt, \"G-Ghk...at least give me the dignity to walk back there myself...\" This amuses Ruby and you actually feel his body slide off of you, freeing your chest and arms. You lift your head up, ready to stand as well, only to have his hindpaw press down on your torso to flatten your back down to the dirt again, being stepped on by him. You glare up at him to see an expression only that of, 'no funny business' before he takes the paw off of you. Groaning up and making it to your knees, you wobble up to a stand with your adrenaline going down to feel the real stinging and aches of the clawmarks he's littered your body with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're hardly able to walk on your bad leg before he shoves your back and growls happily, \"Move it then, pup. If you fall down, I guess I'll just carry you there in my stomach then, won't I~?\" You give him a scowl over your shoulder and proceed to limp back towards the lumber mill with Ruby following close behind you again this time. The failure hurt some, but you could only wonder what would happen to you when you had to be exposed to the Houndour leader, Damien...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">------|------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mmmmph....mph...nnhphh....\" You moan aloud. At least, you attempt to. You can't even tell if you're making noises anymore with your mind a broken haze at this point. The muffled sound of your throat just felt like natural ambience at this point with your body numb...yet it was hot...throbbing even...but lacked true feeling. It had been several hours since you were interrogated by Damien and Ruby after you hoisted your battered form over to him. Or perhaps it's been a day. You couldn't tell anymore. It's been so long with the way that they've had you tied up, that it could've been another night already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are blindfolded with a black cloth over your eyes in a dark cellar under the lumber mill, with no light having reached your pupils since they've imprisoned you in this place. A gag ball is buckled into your mouth, glazed in your drool and pinched in your fangs as your mouth occasionally bites down on it in the stress going on in your limbs. Black leather straps and chains from the ceiling have tied your wrists together above your head with your legs lifted and spread wide to show off your plump blue furry rump and tail hole to those of Damien's family. Dried tear stains line your furry red hot cheeks with white cum drooling out of your pucker onto the floor to truly showcase just how far you've fallen as a hero, and the constant snickering from two males before you seemed to enjoy your outcome. Damien and Ruby stand there with spent members half flaccid against their groins as they admire their work. Ruby is ins Damien's arm as the Persian chuckles, \"I think we broke him, sir...that poor pup didn't even last past the fifth round~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Houndour huffs, \"Nor will his friend. Bring that 'Jackal' guy in here later. I'm sure he'll tell us more just from seeing how his friend here is.\" He looks to his Persian and gives an affectionate lick, \"I'm so glad you weren't hurt by him. He wouldn't be alive right now should anything have happened to you~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww, you don't have to worry about me. He didn't stand a chance.\" The cat bashfully murrs before nuzzle his master's neck. The Houndour pats the cat's ass before stating, \"Well, he told us plenty enough. Go and gather the men and inform Bigby about everything. Lead a large group to assault Hedgen and capture his 'friends'. I want them alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course~!\" The delighted cat smooches his master's cheek and heads off out of the cellar door, leaving Damien with your broken-minded body alone. The fire hound approaches you as you're just hanging in the binding chains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe murrs, \"How's that collar. Not too tight I hope. I need you alive, at least, until your friends get to see you after my men bring them here. Thought you could destroy everything I've built here? My mill? My family? Myself?\" You don't answer, only flaring your nostrils for air and swallowing excess saliva in your throat down. It gets the younger dog to smile, \"I'm not just a kid. I'm more of a man than you at this point since I've made you into a sniveling cum-dump, haven't I~?\" He reaches a hand out to grasp at your own throbbing erection, squeezing at your knot with his fingers tips to elicits the chains to straighten tight when your limbs react powerfully. You muffledly scream against the wet gagball and buck your hips at his hand, wanting to get off and spasming the meat in an orgasm. Your throat quivers helplessly and none of your jizz gets out, trapped by the metal ring locked under your knot with no room for escape. You haven't been able to cum for the past eight times. \"You poor slut...is that cock ring on too tight too? Oh well. Only way it's coming off is if you get rid of this boner, and I guess that's not gonna happen anytime soon. Especially with your balls swollen as they are now~\" The Houndour taunts, grabbing your furry sac and rubbing at your taut nuts, thumbing around at them as they stress their current torture with the churning spunk in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Houndour releases your scrotum just to wrap his arms around your spread thighs, dabbing his black member against your leaking pucker to dab its head into the numb hole. \"...Then you should've thought twice about facing me. You want me gone? Then you should've just said so and I would've been glad to take care of you myself. But I guess if that flimsy slut of a cat can bring you to your knees, you're not even worth facing me, right~? Now just pipe down. I need one last little bust before I head back up. It's a beautiful day outside~\" His cock digs into your rear end to get your mouth to instinctively bite the gag with your pleasure-filled mind long gone at this point to resist or endure what was next. Your bouncing motions against his lap have only become a natural rhythm at this point as he defiles your used asshole with fervent humps, packing his thick black meat into your butt in muffled, flesh pounding thumps...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">------|------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The metal door to the cellar opens up with Persian pawsteps making their way down through the room, swaying a tail behind them. Ruby is sauntering his way with a small whip in his hand, gripped pleasantly tight. He passes by a row of several prisoners all chained to a wall, collared, blindfolded, gagged, and fucked beyond belief by bandit after bandit to leave them as drooling horny slaves left to live in this dark a damp room. A Golduck, Toxicroak, and Typhlosion were all left in a similar attire with cock rings to cease any necessary orgasms unless their new masters allowed them to do so. The Roserade and Luxray however had smooth objects consistently crammed into them, with a dildo stuffed within the rose's deflowered drooling slit and anal beads plugged in deep into the electric cat's asshole, making them both whine pitched noises as they hear someone pass them by. They beg for aid and freedom, but are denied just like the men are as Ruby just leaves them behind. The men were different, with the duck and fire badger being the most resistant to their new home and fate, but with enough cocks in their asses and enough sexual torture, they would break just like their slutty frog friend did, the most willing of the group. They all break at some point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Persian however was interested in them, and stops before his favorite pet of them. A Lucario quietly sits on his knees, arms chained behind his back, lift blind like the others but his mouth was free and open, dryly panting. \"Up, boy~\" The cat purrs. The dog rises up slowly with shaking legs with Ruby collecting the leash attached to the Lucario's collar. \"Good boy. Do you still have my present~?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog whines with a nod, red faced as he unclenches his ass cheeks, letting a dildo slowly shift out from his ass. Ruby pets the top of the Lucario's head, \"You did well keeping that in. And you know what that means. You get a treat~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hhh....hh...\" The canine whines out, unable to speak words from his heaving mouth. The Persian presses against the fallen hero to get him moving, slowly walking with his leash held by his master of his behind him. The Persian shakes his head, \"You poor thing. Let's get you a drink. You deserve it from all the work you've had with the boys~\" Getting him drunk would certainly quench his thirst and make him easy for some of the men to fuck on a table top. The family was rather happy with the recent takedown and destruction of Hedgen, and the weeks-old slaves they've been keeping around as certainly appeased the men; especially the Lucario. They'll make for great fuck toys until they were too useless and end up as food. Quite a victory for Damien and his men~</i></span></div></div>",

There was no way these bastards were just gonna take you willingly to their base for Arceus-knows-what. You knew it couldn't be anything good, and if they got any more information out of you, why would they possibly keep you around? Glaring at those red feline eyes, you courageously bark at the cat straddled on top of you, \"Ggrrrrr, you can forget it! There's no way I'd go down to your level, you rotten savages!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Persian isn't phased at all, merely lapping at those murring lips of his before explaining, \"I was hoping you'd say something like that~\" Ruby looms his head closer to you with parted jaws and glistening cat fangs. Oh you'd be going down to his level alright. Waist level. That tongue of his cups along your cheek to stroke along it, smearing along the red lines left swiped there to absolutely unleash a rumbling purr out of the cat. \"Mhhh...you're so delicious...I've never had Lucario before...you don't see too many of those these days...Maybe that's because you're all so yummy, they get eaten. You've turned out to be more of a dessert than just some dumb snack at the very least. Good for you~\" He sings into your folded ears with periodic licks grinding his tastebuds over your fur that force you to wince in place. Your arms attempt to move only to be slammed into the dirt again with the Persian reinforcing his position to you. \"Ah, ah, ah. You didn't want to be any use to us as a prisoner, so you're nothing but my prey now, food! Don't worry, you're not all that weak as I made you seem. You can make me faster, as long as you don't really round out my hips too much, haha~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn you...!\" You grunt back before those jaws of his clamp around your own mouth, silencing it in a sudden kiss, albeit a very one-sided kiss. His tongue crams its way inside your struggling jaws to wrestle down your own muscle and caress it in hungry drags. Saliva mixes together some for the Persian to enjoy his temporary stay inside of you, lapping at your teeth, tastebuds, and even to lump out your cheeks when the slimy length probes around at the walls. You gag muffledly in distress while Ruby is having the time of his life forcing you to kiss your battle's victor. He was just reaping the rewards as best he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scchhllpp~! Ssllllrrkk! Sllllppp!\" The slimy sounds working in your mouth force a muted moan into his own mouth that gets his curled lips to pucker off of your muzzle in a wet pop, sighing out against your face. \"Haaahhhhh...if you had just took my offer, we'd be able to kiss everyday like this. Oh well. Time to say goodnight, pup. You're catfood~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyelid twitches at the thought and you're just about ready to launch Ruby off of you when the weight of his rump and body leave your chest, yet his hand clasps your neck and slams the back of your head into the tree trunk you had smashed into earlier, blaring your senses and leaves you in the dark almost. \"GHHakk!! ....U-Uugghhhooagghh....\" Your head slumps down with a powerful ache pounding at your skull, seeing nothing but a blur of your own furry scratched chest. Even your ears are ringing and you can't tell what's happening to you. The Persian however was getting down in front of your hindpaws when getting to his knees, picking up your black, smooth legs to eat first. Your hindpaws are coupled together and slipped into Ruby's jaws with a bit of struggle, but they make their way into the those fanged chompers and dab at his gullet. The purring of the triumphant male vibrates around them with his tongue going to work and lapping your pink and cushiony pads, adoring their plushy texture from your big dog paws. The sudden hot and wet sensation make your stunned body shiver with your eyes blinking repeatedly. \"A-Ahh...stahp...that.\" You grunt out in reflex, almost moaning from the faint sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby however doesn't 'stahp' and continues to eat you actually, swallowing around your hindpaws to cram them into his throat, lumping it out roundly with a thick 'gllrk' sound. \"A-Ah~!\" You add to your whines, struggling to truly understand what was going on. Attempting to lift your back off the ground, cause hopefully that'll get to stop whatever was happening to you, your rump actually grinds along the grass from a swallow sinking your legs in, yanking you for your head to swing back and bonk its wound at the back of another tree root. \"Ooaagghhhnn...uhhn...uh....\" You groan out with rolled up eyes and partially lowered lids. The pounding in your head was too much, and the sudden warmness you feel around your lower half was somehow relaxing, hugging you against yourself like a thick blanket. It wasn't long until you passed out with the feeding Persian sinking your rear end in, munching lightly and the big furry meat there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat eyes your unconscious form and decides to play with your body now that he had extra time. His hands release your figure and go to fondle at the luscious lumps you make down his throat and originally flat chest, and all the while his tongue laps at your exposed balls and sheath to taunt them. Your member even grows slightly from it all as you stir in your sleep, experiencing vivid pleasure in the realm of your slumber. \"...hhh...\" Your mouth sighs out with the cat giving another swallow to swallow you inward, dragging his tongue at your pucker to lubricate it some. In your state, it was inevitable where you were going...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">------|------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Gglllppk~\" Ruby satisfyingly swallows on last time around the pointed ears of the Lucario, letting the defeated dog sag down into his middle and orb it out in a heavy wobble. The cat pants with a curling tongue with closed eyes, feeling the stomach walls within him expand and mold about with the Lucario settling inside before being powerfully squished together in on itself. The walls strengthen and grope down against the dogmeat with Ruby licking at his teeth for the last remnants of flavor from the so called 'Lance'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooohhhh...that hit the spot. The boys sure are gonna be jealous of me when they see me come back like this. Rrrhh. I'm gonna have to eat your Typhy friend after my stomach finishes you off, pooch~\" He pats at his taut belly and rises to a stand, hearing the beginnings of his stomach gurgling and churning acids against the silent, motionless morsel. Smiling down at his gut, the sultry feline pads his way back towards the lumber mill to inform his master about the imposters at hand. Surely the Typhlosion could get some answers for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Persian belly wobbles about with each hip swinging step, dancing the long tail about when disappearing into the dense trees and gates of the bandit base, rumbling loudly with the hero digesting inside to be nothing more than cat fat...</i></span></div></div>",

I have to teach this dog to never keep a panther away from her prey.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She purrs to him, flicking his chin with her tail end.

She flashes a look to you, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a clear blush on her cheeks. Her tail runs up along the back of one of your legs as you bap her rump with your tail. Looking to Damien, you inform, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to know your charming lady friend here a bit more. I can meet you after she and I spend some quality time together~\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire then adds with a lewd purr, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOoo~ I like this hunk, Damien. Can I take him to <i>initiation</i>, pretty pleeeeeeeaaaase~?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamien suddenly grins at the plead and rolls his head. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlready? Well\u00e2\u0080\u00a6if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what my Sapphire wants, go for it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She nearly hops in joy from the sound of that and pressed a hand to your backside to go lead you somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis way, Lance!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She murrs as you walk side to side with her to head downstairs and downstairs, going lower into the building. You pass by most of the guests inside and go through a dark staircase to get wherever this \u00e2\u0080\u0098initiation\u00e2\u0080\u0099 was. Underground at this point, you notice a hallway of rock walls with wooden beams to support the weight and space of the area with doors aligning all along the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to ask, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere exactly are we headed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRight here~\u00e2\u0080\u009d She purrs back and unlocks a door. Craning it open, all you see is pitch black darkness and no forms of lighting to use to see inside. A hand suddenly shoves your backside to tumble yourself over, falling down into a pile of hay. You grunt while rolling over to try and look back, only to see the sexy silhouette of the female Persian at the doorway with sauntering hips, dancing tail, and bouncing breasts making their way to you as the door cranes shut to blanket everything in black. You can hear the pawsteps and teasing purrs of the cat in the room approach you, eventually feeling her soft and warm form slide over against you. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s straddled on your abdomen with hands flat on your chest to keep your fully down on the haypile before she explains. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe dark room is my favorite room. I take all the cute new recruits I like in here. They struggle to see anything, but a feline like me can see every reaction and throb you show to me as I have my fun. Ready boy~?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only nod to her, taken aback from the sudden forcefulness here, but you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t complain. The others might not be so happy that you took it up to have a one-night stand with this random girl that was working for the enemy, but if it gets you closer in line with them and gets you to bust a nut, then by all means it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShow me what you got~\u00e2\u0080\u009d You reply with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire obliges and begins to roll her waist forward and backward, brushing the thin fur on her thighs against your sides and hip while coursing her fingers through your yellow chest fur. She kneads at the flat muscles there hidden underneath and lightly drags her clawtips over them to get a sudden wince out of you. She enjoys it, and is encouraged enough to go slide her rump down against your groin. Her cruel tail even brushed up one of your legs again until rubbing over the large blue sac you sported. Low grunts escape your gnashed teeth the more the Persian continues to assault your body with her mere touch, coaxing your cock\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head to nudge out from its hiding place. The member slides out more and more to a decent enough of an erection that gets her to move on in the next step. The crease of Sapphire\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ass drags along the top of your dick to let the head of it course along the valley of her buns, brushing against that velvety fur that has your eyelid give a twitch in how hot that set ablaze to your nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wiggle of her butt, the Persian settles herself down against the member to brush it along her warm and exposed nethers that receives an immediate response from your cock. A sudden bit of pre beads out to stick to the warm entrance that entices the cat with a low mrrowl. Sapphire looks down at your blind from to drag the cock along her slit as your hands massage over her toned legs and hips, occasionally groping there with a sigh of relief running out of maw. You felt entirely comfortable in all of this. It was nice to have such a quiet, dark moment away from ferals, dangerous Pokemon, and your team. Just some one-on-one action with a tantalizing woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get comfy yet. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m about to exhaust you~\u00e2\u0080\u009d She teases when lowering down to suddenly dig the cock\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tip up into those hot folds. Your muzzle curls a lip on the side with your legs tensing up from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cG-Ghhk~!\u00e2\u0080\u009d You grunt out through your teeth as your shaft is slid up inside to feel the tight walls running completely around it and clench around you. Her pussy was tight, even from what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been used to before, and it was like she had full control of every millimeter of wall space there was when it came to rolling the clenching muscles around your dick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAaahhhhh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6hmmhmm~ You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re right. You are rather big. Not the biggest I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something to write home about. Maybe I did choose right in having some fun with you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sapphire murrs to you while descending more on you. Her hands cup around the back of your head with those plump breasts of hers smushing up against your own chest. The taut boobs mold about on you more as she begins to roll her hips in soft rocking shifts to slide your cock out some, only to take more of its inches up inside. Her walls wave over your cock like the surface of winding waters and juices seep all around in a hot bath to wash over the meat. Your length throbs to its greatest height with the full height in can achieve with your knot swollen like a taut fruit. Your nerves are on fire as you help aid the cat in bucking up into her, feeling and hearing the wet slaps digging in through her as she takes in your needy meat. Her body brushes up against you with each hump to get the cat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fur bristling and her mouth purring with warm vibrations. The thrumming in her chest and throat rumble into you to know that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing a good enough job so far, so your hands smear over along her backside before nudging up under her shoulders. She notices your prodding, and figures out what you want, eagerly obliging. Lifting herself up some, her boobs have more room to round out so your hands can cup around them and knead about to your heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s content. You can feel the light fur warmly tucking against your fingers each time they breasts into the lovely mounds with her nipples poking at your palms. A heavy murr shudders out of her mouth the more you begin to pack up inside of her and tease her tits, getting you to open your some to breathe from it. Long and sensual breathes roam out of you, adoring the heat and strength tugging at your boner with a hot tension building up in your balls. You were in bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire is glaring down at you, unbeknownst to you, with a naughty look on her face. Licking her lips, she opens her own mouth and tilt her head to meet with yours and seal a kiss there. You flinch from the sudden action, but quickly accept it and kiss her back. Your lips roll around one another, puckering and licking as your grope her boobs and drill up into her vagina with more force now. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re drunk in the arousing battle with pleasure, whole-hearted into blasting your seed into this lovely cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTongues wrestle in your mouth as her sandpapery yet wet muscle courses along cheek walls and tastebuds. Warmth is shared about with saliva mixing together as your hands tense around those furry tits grinding down against you. \"M-Mmphh!\" You moan out into her mouth once her groin shoves itself all the way down, stressing your knot inside to pop neatly inside and lock you two together. Your legs cringe and throb, kicking at the hay pathetically some once those vaginal walls seal tightly around that knot and bathes pre all over your length. The heat and compaction is more than enough to break your kiss away to howl to the empty, dark room, echoing your moan throughout it. Hot spunk explodes early in the sex to stuff up inside the cat's body, making her bite her lip and claw your shoulders some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slight pain merely adds to your need to orgasm, shooting shot after shot of your hot cum that burrows deep into that pussy. You paint her walls white with the sensation of emptying all that your balls had with her milking you dry. Cats enjoyed milk after all. Your knot pulsates in taut throbs and your cock spasms in place each glob-shot you spew into her. Sapphire dances her claws along your scratched shoulders and purrs, holding back her own orgasm to sway her hips with your dick still inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling down at you, she gives your blushed cheek a lick before saying, \"Mmmhhhh...all done already? I have to say I'm disappointed in you. You're not even strong to handle a girl topping you? Tsk tsk! You're nothing to Damien if his little pussy can beat you~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunt weakly in shame at that and struggle to move...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The lady Persian on top of you gyrates her hips to slowly worked your meat inside of her folds clockwise, smearing her cum-slathered nethers completely over the cock spent from the orgasm. You whine out from the sensitive tension swirling your dick with little energy to get the cat off of you. Her weight burdens down on your body with you at her mercy, tucked neatly into her groin with that knot of yours. You regret ever plugging it into her since her slit tightly clamps around to imprison your arousal inside of her, completely trapped by the sexy Persian. You could tell her face was close to your own through the darkness by those teasing purrs roaming louder in your ears with her whiskers tickling your muzzle. Sapphire mewls happily however in your exhausted stress by taking a warm lick over your lips that get a groan out of you. You attempt to toss her off by sliding your hands onto her abdomen, but her own claws grapple your wrists, peck their sharp points close to them, and bind them into the hay pile by the sides of your head. Now you were really worried. What you presumed to be just a simple dominatory act of sex was really just the cat sating a hunger...and when a low rumble emits from her stomach...you realize she wasn't just craving a good ride, but a much more natural hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'm gonna have a whining puppy for dinner! You silly stupid dog~ We only allow men into our family, not boys~\" She meows to taunt you before smacking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Uhhngh...w-wait, I was cleared by Damien. I'm one of you...!\" You attempt to plead, but you know that the Houndour will take his apparent favorite pussy's word over your own. The cat smacks her waist down, digging your cock up into her again that gets you to bark and twitch your legs. \"Glahh~!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Persian murrs at your humiliation and worry, slowly tracing her clawtips along her wrists and arms. The power-hungry cat seemed stronger all of a sudden with the triumph of overwhelming you boosting her adrenaline. It was either her cruel sense of arousal or the maddening crave for eating Pokemon by the infection getting to her. Maybe a mix of both. That, or she was just this strong and shouldn't have been messed with. \"Oh you'll be one of us, but as a part of me~\" She teases down at you before you hear those slick jaws of her part. The gooey sound of your muzzle slowly digging past her lips and fangs into her gullet force your ears to fold back naturally, completely flabbergasted that you're being eaten by some woman you couldn't last ten minutes with in a dark room. No witnesses to see your demise. No one around to help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-MmmPPHK!!!\" You yell out through your clamped mouth, only to be answered with a sudden swallow echoing around you. Your neck is assaulted with that rough, wet tongue as your muzzle nosedives into thick throat walls clamping at your face and dragging you in. You didn't want to go down like this! You had a job to do! But any struggling movements you endeavor result in your hips shifting, smearing your cock inside her folds that seem to never-endlessly stroke at it, caressing it within the hot slick tunnel you exploded into that might elicit a second rupture if she keeps torturing you like this. The thought of digesting inside her was alluring almost, imagining how much you'd add to those tits and cheeks of hers that she'd caress in her own hands, taunting you like the food you were. It made your stomach twist in horror that you were thinking that way, but it made your arousal skyrocket with pre spurting inside of her folds again. It means that psychic mastermind's draw was working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Persian happily bites around your shoulder with your arms being pinned to your sides, teasing your yellow furry back and chest with those teeth jabbing at you in tempting bites. You discover this gets a moan to roam out of your lips, and it was a discover for her as well. Sapphire is even 'kind' enough to take your hands instead to roam to her chest, dabbing those breasts to fit excellently into your palms. Her esophagus feels the heat of your face ignite red as you rather willingly grope onto those boobs, getting to feel at them one last time, thumbing at those nipples and imagining about even adding to the milk in them. The thought slowly works its way through your sanity to wreck some of your willpower, and you even give a few humps into her pussy again in hopes to get off. How shameful it was of you to enjoy this horrid scene, but how right it felt. The fact that no one was around seemed like a good thing even almost. No one to stop her...just you and her as she feeds on your body. You're practically at the brink of letting the cat claim you for good with no complaints. The supposed infection was doing its job, and all it took was this attractive predator feasting on you. Perhaps life wasn't all that bad then right? You're serving your purpose...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are broken when you suddenly yelp after she releases your knot, popping out from her drooling nethers to have your dick slid out the more you're swallowed into her bulging body. Sapphire had collected too much of your form inside of her to keep your waist to hers. In fact, even your reaching hands lose their hold onto her magnificent chest to be taken inside her slobbering chompers to leave your rump and legs dangling out of them. Her teeth squeeze at your butt in soft bites, coercing her meal to moan and whimper within her own body as your legs wiggle about some. That tongue of hers even nabs a few licks to that pulsating slick dick of yours, only wanting to end you quick however. A slut who prematurely explodes doesn't get to have a second chance. Tossing her head back as she's sitting on her knees, your entire world grows ever darker and louder with the hot searing of her belly just in front of your nose as you're pulled inside face-first. Your legs are just slid down the wet, muscled ramp to your doom, twitching aimlessly so your entire body can collect into her stomach. With a satisfied exhale, the blue-stoned Persian rolls onto her back in the hay pile, bending her knees inwardly together some; hands resting over the beautifully round gut outstretching her thin coat of light golden fur. She couldn't be happier with her catch, and you however are so confused on whether this was truly awful or amazing, you just shiver within the tight confines compacting your strongly together. \"G-Gghhnnnn...a-ahh...hhh....t-too hot....\" You groan out with wavering eyelids, feeling the juices pooling around you some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat purrs, stretching out all of her limbs before relaxing on her side to swirl a single clawtip over the taut mound of her middle. \"Mmmmm...I was obviously too hot for you if you couldn't even fight back. Don't worry, weak pooch. You'll serve the family better as my lovely pudge~\" Her hand then flatly rests at the belly, smearing over the silky fur to feel your poor form balled up inside with the fluids bathing your form and hotly searing. \"Heeheehee. But at least you had some fun. I'll be sure my brother will give your tubby friend a good farewell like this too. Then you two can reunite when my brother and I embrace each other, feeling up what you make. Heehee~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom within the squelching madness, you endeavor to plead, \"W-Wait...! I-I've got something...important...the world's at sta-\" Her hands suddenly grope the belly to squish the thick stomach walls against you, silencing you and submerging you completely in those tingling acids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up and melt already~\" She purrs and rolls onto her stomach, mushing her hands playfully into it to paw at, squeeze, and smother you in the juices inside, listening to the lewd gurgling emitting around your furry body. You can't take it anymore. Your eyes roll up and your body gives into the darkness. The chorus of stomach growls gets to you and the infection's influence wins. You embrace your destiny as food and pass out within the bubbling pool that seals your fate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sapphire purrs with the hand stroking her head, neatly petting between her ears before Houndour lips smooch her blue gemstone at her forehead. Damien's voice rings, \"Fuck, you look so beautiful like that. But it's bad for the family if I let you eat <i>every</i> new recruit we pull in here.\" The Houndour slides his hand off of her to stroke the other Persian at his other side. \"And we could've used the muscle on that Typhlosion too as labor, even if he didn't want to cooperate with us after your sister stewed his friend up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby's voice answer, \"Oh please, a big guy like that? He's keeping me fed for at least a day~!\" Damien laughs at that as he drapes his arms around both his cats. He was lounged on that couch of his with the Persian twins nestled up to him, each with their own round gut. Sapphire calmly pets at her belly to feel at the gurgling Lucario meat inside as she eyes her brother's stomach, noticing its slight wider width with the Typhlosion she had been eager to taunt and eat earlier working down the same way. Their prey's movements ended long ago. \"Say sis...\" Ruby perks up to ask with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to him, Sapphire tilts her head while laying it against the young Houndour master's chest. \"Yes Rubes~?\" He doesn't actually ask a question, but smiles while leaning in to smush his belly against hers, wrapping his arms around his own twin to lock mouths together. The incestuous Persians go at out, making out with one another with their guts pinned against the other to gurgle about loudly before their master. As he enjoys the show, Damien's own knotted arousal peeks out from his sheath from all of this, and the twins happily service their leader. Sapphire gropes at his balls with Ruby working a hand at the throbbing meat, all the while slurping at each others tongues in a horny display of victory of digesting the two foolish heroes with the Houndour murring in closed eyes, \"...Ahhh...you two are perfect...~\"</i></span></div></div>",

You'd have to probably distract the Muk somehow first so the others could pull Jabber out with better ease. With Grimer on your tail, you aren't given a whole lot of time for a more efficient plan. Looking around, you see one of the wooden boards on the walkway is peeling off and about to give. You quickly grab it and rip it off, taking a tight hold to it in your hand as you kneel back down in front of Jabber and the Muk with the others grunting and tugging desperately. You raise it up high and cry out, \"Jabber, duck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rhydon looks up with fearful eyes, and once he spots your melee weapon, he ducks his head forward rather fast to expose a clear view for you of the Muk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head as it slowly gulps at him. You strike the plank repeatedly down with the best of your strength could provide, splatting it firmly against its face to have the slime monster garbedly growl in irritation. Your plan seems to nearly work once the Muk is slightly giving less focus on eating and more focus on the constant smacks to its head. Although, it would all be for naught once one of its large, slimy hands outstretches from the tar to restrain your arm. You yelp as the plank of wood sinks into its girthy goo, disappearing within the murk as your arm seems to follow in suit with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tug and pull your trapped limb, discovering that it was just as glued inside as Jabber is. \u00e2\u0080\u009cG-Gahhh! Let me go, you fat blob!\u00e2\u0080\u009d You growl through your teeth. The feral Muk refuses and begins to draw back inside the tar, taking the Rhydon meal and you down with it. Your eyes widen with everyone else. Clubs and Jackal are quick enough to let the Rhydon go to avoid being tugged down, but you and Cherry aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so lucky. The crimson Typhlosion still has Jabber\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands locked around her arms that accidentally tug her towards his shared doom, and you would follow in quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Muk widens his maw to swallow up Jabber entirely as you all land face-first into the thick tar. You wallow in the heavy glop with Cherry, grunting and fighting off the slime with rewardless efforts to make easy and faster meals for the infected Muk. Its hands wetly slap together to pin you and Cherry together while craning its seeping, drooling maw to bring you towards. You yelp when having to stare down the rippling cavern of grey goo strong enough to take the shape of a throat and tongue, worrying you if this was truly it. Cherry growls, \"G-Glugh! Hands off, slimeball!\" She begins to heat up her mane, but that ceases once its slimy mouth slaps shut around the two of your upper bodies to begin dragging in. Mounds of slime bash and seep around you, muffling your vision and hearing that leaves you entirely helpless inside the Muk's maw. It's tongue is packed together enough to guise as physical, together muscle so it can smear up and down your face and chest, tasting the delicious Lucario goodiness that you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Jackal and Clubs would worriedly stare at your legs, as well as Cherry's, sticking out and wincing while disappearing through the fat layer of tar and Muk girth. This event makes a distraction advantage for the Grimer approaching the two chubby males, and the infected take their prizes. One Grimer tackles Clubs to the ground and uses its entire mass to slowly absorb around the Grotle. He yelps and wiggles his body to get the stuff of him, but it sticks to him seamlessly and his wallowing merely traps him in more of its girth. Another Grimer wraps its arms up under Jackal's for a pin before it opens its maw and stuffs his head inside from behind. The Typhlosion angrily roars inside of its mouth while trying to fight it off. His flames are snuffed out however by the encroaching mass of slime morphing around him hungrily and his body is trapped in the Grimer's hold that the fire type is slowly taken inside the big pile of goo to become its meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are compacted into the 'stomach' of the Muk when reaching its center. It's entirely dark, tight since slimes is cocooning your body along with Jabber and Cherry inside. Your head is even smushed directly in between the shiny Typhlosions tits as they roll around in the ever-constant motions of the Muk. She groans aloud through the muffling slime to bubble out as no oxygen was present inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't even budge within the murky fluid as it swirls slowly about with lighter fluid beginning to wash all three of you. You assume it's the stomach acids getting ready to make you into a fat for this feral, if a slime mountain like itself even has fat in its body. Your lungs are strained of no air and your body is weakening by the second. Darkness had already consumed your vision, but now it has consumed your mind, forcing you to inevitably pass out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Bubbles ripple out through the surface of the tar in the spot a Muk had submerged itself in, taking three heroes down with it. It rests within the homely confines of the sludge to rest as its triple course meal digests inside of it, soon to make it larger in size with new goo to add after it digests the Lucario, Typhlosion, and Rhydon all into its form. The same fateful ending is spread out and shared amongst others in the Lucario's trekking pack, with a Grotle and different Typhlosion being packed inside two Grimer, protruding as wobbling orbs distending out of the infected digesting away as the Grimer rub their meat-filled guts. The same is said for those defending the entrance to the tar pit boardwalk. The ferals outnumbering them made quick work of the remaining defenders that stood alone against impossible odds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tar pits are a harsh area, and not just because of the tar...</i></span></div></div>",

Aura burns throughout your body, and with plenty of energy to take this thing out, you charge forward with bounding steps at the mushroom creature with a punch ready to go. However, a board underneath one of your hindpaws breaks as you remember that the walkways were still weak, but a little too late for you to avoid falling through the crack. The space of the hole was only big enough for your entire leg to descend into to bring you down onto a knee and stop you in your charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou angrily grunt from the simple mistake and quickly slide your leg out from the hole, yet it wouldn't matter as the Breloom had taken the moment of opportunity to headbutt you right onto your back atop the walkway. You growl out from the impact and spot the infected Breloom glaring down at you and licking over its lips, irritating you as you send out a leg to kick it away. It hops back easily from seeing your move ahead of time and releases off orange spores out from its body and shroom head. Widening your eyes, you endeavor to crawl back, although the wafting dust blows over you and sticks to your fur without any trouble, suddenly forcing a sudden force of numbness throughout your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp as you struggle to move your arms or legs, heck, even your tail and ears were nearly impossible to even give as much as a flick in response. The Breloom sees that its stunning spores have done their work well for it to step forward again and get closer to you. You can only wince at the sight of the mushroom creature getting down onto its knees while it straddles its round lower body on top of your chest with the feral's large cock laying on your muzzle to pulsate warmly against. Your eyes can't peel themselves away from the shroomhood as it oozes pre along the top of your muzzle to leak down and get into your open mouth some. In fact, you realize your mouth is just hanging open stupidly with your tongue slightly out of it, and yet, you're unable to close it. The spores seemed to have apparently stunned your jaw as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infected mushroom grins and positions the head of its large green cock so that its darker green head rubs up on your fat tongue lazed out helplessly. You glance over to the Typhlosion by you and shamefully cry out, \"J-Jahh-ahhl! Halhhp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, your friend wasn't doing too good either. All of his fire attacks to the female Pidgeotto weren't doing a whole lot for him with the bird constantly flapping its wings to disfigure his blasts of fire to scorch away from them, aggravating him beyond all belief. The avian then dives in quick for a headbutt of its own to slam right into Jackal's belly, making him gag loud some and spit out before he was forced back a few steps. The Pidgeotto finishes its move off with releasing a powerful gust to actually blow out the fire-type's mane of flames that have Jackal yelling out and teetering down to fall onto his back. \"G-Gyuh...!\" The bird then lands down by stomping straight onto Jackal's gut again to have the poor guy cry out again. The infected avian licks over its beak some before hopping off and stepping to Jackal's hindpaws. There, it scoops his legs into its wings to drag into its open maw, taking in the hindpaws inside the salivating beak and lick over. The Typhlosion yelps, kicking and wincing helplessly during his growls at the devouring bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour saddened attention is then taken back to the infected Breloom mounted on you as you suffer the feeling of a large and meaty shaft slide into your open maw and occupy most of the space. The member pulses warmly on your tongue that has you clench your eyes tightly closed with the cock beginning to pump deep inside your mouth. Your entire body winces from the sensation while the Breloom cups its clawed hands around your head, keeping it in place before slamming its waist back and forth and plunges the cock in and out of your accepting mouth. You can only sound out muffled and wetly garbled groans around the shroomhood slapping along in your muzzle as you lament the idea of fighting this feral, or for endeavoring to aid a lost cause. Your quest was obviously at its end now that you found yourself losing to a feral, forced into giving it a blowjob, and having the others doomed to a similar fate as you. The Breloom however savors the joy of this triumphant moment, gripping the fur on your head tightly with its groin pressing against the tip of your muzzle with every cock-forcing pound it stuffs inside your maw. Your tongue has to succumb with the idea of being a toy while you have to taste this feral's penis and pre. In fact, the cock was constantly beading out and pumping the clear, hot ooze into your gullet that you unwillingly had to swallow now, already feeling a strange sense in your head now like a loss of control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't the only suffering from the torture of being raped by an infected. The other group afar were in just as much trouble as you were, seeing that the Grotle was defeated and down on the ground unconscious, with the shiny Typhlosion on her hands and knees, panting helplessly. Covered in bruises and shivering, she looks up to the oncoming Tyranitar stepping menacingly closer to her. Unable to get up, she feels the fat exoskeltoned beast mount against her with a long and thick muscle rubbing up along her rear, only to terrify her as she feels the head of its dick then press at her anus. Holding back the tears and trying to soldier through the moment, the Typhlosion kicks and squirms helplessly while crying out, \"Nn-nghh! St-Stop that, you bastard! G-Get off me o-o-or I'll ha-ghyyyyaahhh!\" She then screeches out as the big muscle penetrates in between her cheeks and slides up inside of her, already forming a bulge in her abdomen. \"Ahhhhh! Ahhh...ahhhh...!\" The crimson fire-type struggles the groans out of her mouth while clawing at the floorboards. There, the Tyranitar feral licks its lips and begins to rape its victim by digging through virgin rump and violating her insides. The Rhydon stuck in the tar helplessly watches his only hopes die with him as he's now neck deep in the guzzling slop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA familiar smack of a Breloom's crotch reminds you of the predicament you were trapped in. The long member jabs down your throat some with your cheeks occasionally bulging out whenever the cock misses its target. The Breloom didn't seem to mind though, having closed its purple eyes and flopping out its tongue to lazily pant with enticed pleasure. Just to make the experience less uncomfortable and little less painful, you shamefully try to bob your head back and forth around the member as it grazes past your hard teeth to tingle its nerves all the more. You wished for anything to bite down, but the stun spores still have your muscles in a bind and your body subjected to this terrible mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long until the Breloom feral roars and shoots out its hot semen into your slimy maw. Thick shots of the stuff guzzle down your mouth and throat that force you to gulp most of the stuff down to have your entire body shiver and eyes roll back. The mushroom creature releases your head just to stroke its saliva-covered cock to spurt out the last of its creamy batch onto your face, leaving you helpless on the ground panting with a messy spider web of gooey white substance on your face and hanging mouth as your stomach takes in the stuff. You already feel someone or something poking at your mind, corrupting it almost as you feel the instance of laughing somewhere. Your mind blanks out, but not before you see the whining head of Jackal sliding down a Pidgeotto's swallowing mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>An infected Breloom walks away with a spent and recently emptied member, all with a drooling smile on its face having done its part in corrupting another Pokemon. The Lucario behind it later sits up with the spores clinging to its fur dying out and littering to the floorboards. The canine and fallen hero flashes its eyes open in a purple glow and under control of its new master to begin its first command of dealing with its previous companions, heading over to the group still fighting off the ferals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Toxicroak, Golduck, Roserade, and Luxray all are panting heavily and tuckered from the fighting, but are still able to press on some. Just then, they are attacked by yet another group of ferals through the crowd, but it terrifies them for what they were. The Toxicroak is tackled down and is taken back from the Lucario that had pounced him down, feeling a crashing sense of shock in seeing their leader and friend become a feral now. Before the frog could protest, he is met with an open maw from the canine, forcing his head inside to begin being eaten alive by their only hope. They others would soon meet their ends as well, with the Golduck and Roserade being grabbed and squeezed powerfully by a recently infected Grotle leaking cum from his rear. The armored and chubby turtle forces the water duck's face against his cock, taking his head inside its urethra to begin dragging down as the plant girl struggles the best she can to get out. The Luxray would meet her end with a female crimson Typhlosion pouncing her down and suckling her legs inside its mouth, terrifying the cat as she tries to weakly kick and whimper in distress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all would end up as meals to the newly-made ferals, whereas the Rhydon was left sitting in the tar to watch from afar. He figured that perhaps the tarpit would be a better fate, all until he feels his feet touch the ground. With joy, he feels like he can make it alive now, but that all ends once a Pidgeotto with a fat and bouncing gut emitting the whines of a different Typhlosion flaps its way over and perch atop of him. There, the Rhydon stares up at the crotch of the avian just inches from his face to slide his face into her vagina, beginning to unbirth him with the reptile unable to escape or move from the tar.</i></span></div></div>",

We're here to help everyone, so we can start with them, just make sure you watch your step and cover your backs. We don't need either of you in a feral's gut today.\" You convince them with your call. The Toxicroak and Typhlosion head over to the wooden walkways and do their best to hop over any holes and fallen bridge areas towards the trio in dire need. You on the other hand prepare to fight and defend your spot with Star, Gold, and Eden. \"Let's get in a circle so we can attack on all fronts. We can take these guys long enough for Hex and Jackal to come back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four nod and all group up around each other, all having a direction of ferals to take on as they approach in their mad spree of dashing. At last, they reach close by you, and you all respectively pick your targets to attack. A chubby Bidoof boy approaches on all fours with an open salivating maw to chomp you down with, only to feel the brutal punch of your fist to its face to send back to ground with a small burst of aura. It crashes into the ground with dirt erupting in a small crater from the powerful, completely and already knocked out from one hit to its head. After the weak beaver had its shot, two more ferals approach you at two angles, a Persian and a Girafarig. Charging both your palms, you shoot your fist forward in uppercuts to strike both of the infected anthros straight into their abdomens simultaneously to force to gag out and tumble back to the ground where you blast them away again with an aura sphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith things looking up, Star easily keeps all of her sides clear with her powerful electrical attacks either forcing the ferals to faint under the surging power or to just fall to the ground, paralyzed and twitching from the static left in them. Gold and Eden are even making a great team, combining their water and grass attacks to overpower the infected charging anywhere close to the tar pits where the others are. So far, so good, right? However, things take a turn for the worst when you see a silhouetted figure off in the distance. You squint your eyes to see what it is until you make it out to be a giant black wheel spinning towards you. Confused and still prepared, you charge another amount of aura around your fist to get ready for another swing at whatever that thing could be. Yet once it got closer, you saw just how truly large it was, having a thick width of size and weight to where you're unsure if you can even stop such a massive being. Before you can even warn everyone else of the oncoming target, the feral closes in to where see its a fat, rolled up Donphan barreling towards all of you just at impact. The pachyderm smashes into all of you in a chaotic roll that sends your companions to the ground and you to be smeared underneath the madly spinning creature that grinds you deeper and deeper into the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan as the Donphan's roll ceases with your body firmly implanted in the soil, left to sit in the hot dirt from the searing hide of the spinning behemoth that had toppled over you. There, the Donphan unrolls its chubby body to be seated against your legs for you get a decent enough look at it through your foggy vision. The stout elephant was on the heavier side of things when it came to weight and size, to which you already knew from the aching pain of your legs being squeezed underneath it, but truly made the distinct point of the large light grey breasts orbed from his its chest, leading down to a big potbelly of smooth flesh, and ends with thick legs with pre oozing out in the middle. The Donphan glares down at your body that was still steaming from the grinding attack and immediately grapples you in its blubbery powerful arms to constrict you within a tight bear hug. You choke out, writhing in the grasp of the infected feral as it squishes you against its pudgy body for your head to be squeezed in between those large breasts the hug around your face that smother over your eyes as your body is smooshed up at its large belly, feeling the pillowy flesh to be strangely warm. Struggle as you might, the Donphan's powerful spin had knocked the wind completely out of you, and now you were trapped against its hide for it to do as it pleases with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hope that one of your friends can save you at this point, but little did you know that they were still on the ground from the elephant's collision to then be picked off by the oncoming ferals. An infected Linoone hungrily pounces outward to tackle Star closer into the grass before grabbing her ankles and dragging its tongue at her hindpaws. The Luxray squeals unpleasantly and endeavors to kick away the feral as a charging Pinsir bounds forward. The crustacean quickly opens its head joints to clench around Eden's body to squeeze between the two claws. The Roserade gasps and struggles within the tightening grip as the Pinsir grabs Gold by his shoulders and opens its maw. The Golduck quacks and fidgets helplessly as his face slides into the vertical fanged maw of the Pinsir, squishing the head around the rippling flesh and salivating glands. And all the while, the ferals fight for whoever gets to truly claim those meals by grabbing and licking at their bodies before they go down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou muffledly groan and try to push away the Donphan, only to just knead your hands into the thick fat of her belly as she scooches her crotch closer to yours. You then feel a hot, wet sensation grinding against your, forcing your legs to wince helplessly and for your maw to groan out even louder. The Donphan held you close and murrs wildly as she grinds her pussy at your groin, slathering it in her warm pre while she drools a bit on her breasts that seep down to drizzle over your face. You can't help it in this horrible situation, but your cock betrays you once its erects out to pleasured height for the folds to clench around. And at last, the Donphan humps forward, scooping your penis inside the tight tunnel for it to tug and squish inside to force a startled bark out of you. The elephant can only smile and toot its own horn as it starts to squeeze you in the hug back and forth, which inevitably makes your cock slide in and out of the wet nethers of her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmph! Mmmmmphmmk! Mmm-mmmph...mpph...\" You only produce your covered mouth to say that just ripples though the flesh of the Donphan's large tits. The elephant moans and drools even more from the statement, using an arm wrapped around your by with its other one using its hand to clasp around your big blue butt to clench tightly. With that grip on your tush, the infected pachyderm is able to move your waist back and forth to really dig your cock inside of her, making your throbbing shaft explore the narrow tunnel of her folds as they continue to seamlessly suckle and hug the muscle, aching for its load. '<i>I-I can't let this feral just...u-use me like this. The others can't see m-me like this</i>!' You stress in your head, but there wasn't much you could do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audible wet slaps of your cock pressing deeper and deeper into the juicy flesh only causes your cock to grow harder with your knot swelling to a bulbous size pressing against the entrance of her groin. Your head is finally able to squeeze all the way through her breasts for you to see the light of day again, however, you get a darkened view instead. The purple-eyed elephant's head looms over yours, staring down at you with an open maw. You don't know why, but you are prompted to just stare down into that mouth, watching the tongue pulsate fatly as saliva strings from its jaws that beckon for your hide. Even the opening to her squelching heavy throat seems to beg for you to just dive inside, and strangely enough, you almost wanted to. A red hue glows from your cheeks as the Donphan gives you another grope to your fluffy bum, pressing against it to cram that knot of yours into her pussy for it to lock around. You cry out again and bury your face into her breasts again, trying to just keep a hold of yourself from the overwhelming sensation powering around your cock at this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou completely forget about the infection, your friends, and what happens if you ingest anything. You feel only compelled to cum your load out as fast as you can. Panting heavily and even willingly hammering your rod into the feral, you submit yourself to the obviously more powerful elephant and do your best to pleasure her. With not a lot of room to thrust since your knot ties you to her, one of your pinned arms is able to reach a hand down to finger just above her folds, wringing a fingertip at her bulbous clit. The elephant trumpets with pleasure and squeezes you even tighter in her arms. You can only figure that you're doing a good job of pleasing her from that reaction, which prompts you to keep going. With an open mouth, you slide your head out from her cleavage to press against it again, except this time, suckling inside one of her dark grey nipples that was protruding out. You moan as the teat leak milk into your gulping and licking maw as the wall of flesh seems to just dominate you at this point. Her hand tenses against your rear with her trunk wrapping around your neck to hug you from flooding ecstasy powering through her groin and chest. Your tongue rims around the nipple with your hands groping at that shaking belly of hers as you slam everything you have into her groin as well as thumbing over that sensitive button of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was finally too much for you, and you wetly release the tit from your mouth to spill a bit of saliva and milk out as you yell to the top of your lungs. Hot cum cannons inside of her folds as they clamp around your dick tightly, accepting each and every glob of your load inside of her. The elephant trumpets with pleasure with her orgasm raining down around your crotch as she teeters over and falls against you, letting your arousal die down together.</span></div></div>",

Your cock is still firmly jammed into her groin with her nethers squishing around it wetly, tugging at your milked member as hot cum bathes the muscle in what transpired just moments ago. You eyes struggle to open and your mouth slowly moans through the smothering fat smooshing you down. The Donphan pants hotly and heavily for you to feel each and every motion of her triumphant exhaustion pressing and retracting on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing your hands against the chub, you are completely left drained of any strength you think you had as you're at the mercy to the pachyderm now. She huffs as she gets up to her knees, swaying her crotch from side to side that teases your poor member trapped inside her folds for a whimpering moan to force out of your lips. Satisfied with your reaction, the fat elephant stands up with your cock sliding out of her at last, feeling the burning and pleasuring walls release your arousal for a bare moment for you to enjoy the freedom outside of her. Although, that would all come to a close as you see her step over you with her large body just above your head. With your face in between her legs, the infected Donphan squats down to mush your face back into her body again, but this time, your muzzle is firmly jabbed into her hot snatch as its leaks with both your cum mixed together down over your head. She was going to unbirth you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whine and wriggle that best you can offer as a struggle, but the heavy elephant seems to barely even notice as he head tosses back with the great sensation of your face sliding against her nethers. She trumpets her trunk with a drooling smile, weighing herself down more to slide your entire head up into her vagina, eager for your filling hide. Groaning in misery, you can't help but enjoy the fact of her pussy swallowing you up to join that large belly of hers. The thought of being this feral's next orgasm brings you to the urge groping your hands around her body once more, kneading at the tight pudge with your knotted cock swelling with pleasure again. The vaginal walls take you deep inside with your body nose-diving its way towards your own doom, yet you didn't seem to care. You were already infected with the milk inside your stomach with your friends probably lunch or toys at this point. Just with the seduction and forced sex with this feral, you were pretty much already willing to lose to this monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour groin and rear are taken inside the folds to have your rod grind along the slick walls of her cooch, allowing you enough space to slightly hump at the flesh leaking with cum to soak your whole body in. The Donphan rolls onto its armored backside to spread her thick legs in the air, letting your weak legs give off little kicks as they make their way inside the hot tunnel dragging you towards her belly. While there, your companions were having their own troubles on the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar was down on the ground, panting helplessly as she's already half-way stuffed down a Linoone's throat feet first. Her hindpaws and legs lightly squirm inside the tight esophagus as the ferret slurps along her groin and ass while they sit inside its suckling maw. It lightly chews at the furry meat as its tongue roams at the slick flesh of her nether-lips, receiving gifting amounts of pre from the moaning Luxray while she's gulped down further. Close by, a Golduck's legs and tails thrash furiously from the outside of an infected Pinsir's maw with Eden unconscious in its head-claws grip. The crustacean gladly slurps and licks Gold's skin, tasting everything it could from the flavorful duck before chomping down more of the water-type's body into Gold's displeasure. The duck's body was already protruding a gut out of the feral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, out on the walkways of the tar pits, Hex falls to the ground on his backside. Bruises scatter his body as he pants to the sky, unable to continue on any farther as the infected feral that had defeated him approaches. The female Pidgeotto glares down at his purple hide with her color-matching eyes, licking her beak before latching her talons down on his shoulders to keep the frog down as she leans her pussy closer to his face. And for Hex's great fear, begins to shift up into the absorbing vagina swallowing in his writhing body. The bird tosses her head back while perched on the Toxicroak, unbirthing a victim of her own with this one causing a loud distress of unhappy yells and croaks with unwilling struggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown along the ways sit Jackal and the trio they were meant to save, all on the ground beaten by the infected horde. A male Breloom forces the Grotle down onto his chest and knees as it mounts against his rear. The armored turtle begs, \"N-No! G-G-Get off me!\" The mushroom creature murrs as it jabs its own shroomhood into his rump. The Grotle yelps and pounds his fists against the wooden walkway under him in his efforts to panic. \"S-Someone, ahhh-ahhhhhh! Someone help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one would come to his aid though, as Jackal and the other Typhlosion are picked up from the ground each in a Tyranitar's hands. The infected and large reptile licks in lips as it wonders who to eat first, and begins to dine on the red Typhlosion first. It opens its maw wide and gulps down her grunting head as she's unable to put up a fight to the large beast, with Jackal trying to claw at the hands around his neck to escape, yet the heavy and thick exoskeleton covering the Tyranitar proved too powerful to even damage. Then there was the Rhydon left to sit in the enveloping tar to see his friends and hopes become food for the ferals. But then, he feels someone tugging him out of the thick sludge! He glances over to his hero at last, only to get a faceful of an infected Shiftry's maw closing around his head. The big reptile struggles the best he can as well, but lacked the strength to beat the Shiftry from his previous struggle in the tar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the Donphan, your hindpaws and tail tip twitch at the entrance to her crotch with your body almost completely inside of her now. You groan inside your more powerful predator as you feel the last of the outside air to cram up into her womb with cum drenched at the walls. You can only pathetically sit and slosh inside the tight chamber now as hot cum pools around you, making you shiver with the temperature and arousal building inside of you. At last, you feel your body give up, and you pass out within the gurgling organ of your rapist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Donphan smears her hands over her large stomach as its sloshes with the Lucario inside, feeling the dog melting down into more of her thick fluids that supports for more pre to seep out from her nethers. The elephant fondles a round tit of hers as the other hand makes its way down to finger around at the puffed and oozing lips, masturbating happily with the memory of that mutt she forced into sex with. Many other ferals shared the joy of the moment with the Donphan as well, with a Linoone patting its stomach as the pleasured and eaten Luxray mewls out in arousal inside, unable to hold back the strange ecstasy running through her as she masturbates as well in the gut. A fat Pinsir tosses down a Roserade it caught in its claws before swallowing in her legs. The unconscious plant girl is dragged back with every shift of the Pinsir's esophagus, pulling her closer and closer inside to join the groaning duck inside of its belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom afar in the bog, a Pidgeotto finishes up her meal as a pair of Toxicroak feet are forced up into her snatch, doming out her gut greatly until she's pushed onto her back. A chubby Grotle with recently infected eyes and Breloom spooge leaking from his ass holds the bird down to ram its own arousal inside of the avian. She caws out happily with the large turtle helping to deal with their libido and to make quick work of the gay frog inside to become more fluids for the two. A Tyranitar lays on its back with a hand topped over its large and sloshing gut as two Typhlosion moan and move about inside, unable to escape as they're forced to take a bath inside the lizard's stomach juices and become its fat soon, along with a Shiftry plopped next to the other feral with its own large gut crammed around its prey. The Rhydon growls and threatens the plant Pokemon all it wants, but would soon fall victim to the same fate everyone faces at the tar pits...</i></span></div></div>",

Groaning as your cock aches from the experience with both of your fluids mixing together and bathing your member still stuck inside of her, you try to press your hands at her large girth, but discover that you have no energy left to face this monster. Besides, you had already drank her milk and had intercourse with this feral. Even with your brain fogging up from the ride of sex, you still felt as if you had done something wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the pachyderm gets up by its hands to look down at you. You wince when seeing those creepy purple eyes glare down at you like you were nothing but meat to it, and in this instance, you were. Lifting its groin some from the ground, you feel your cock slowly plopping out from her nethers to have your rump hit the floor and your shaft to receive a bath of your orgasmed delight seeping from inside her groin. Grumbling with a pulsating ache in your head and cock, you suddenly bring your attention back to your situation once you feel the Donphan lowering its face down to your own. Your eyes widen with surprise after the elephant opens it large maw to scare you into thinking that this was it, that you were going to be made a meal out of now. Although, you merely feel the sloppy mouth clamp around your softly parted muzzle from panting so much to feel the pachyderm actually beginning to suckle you. Its fat tongue squishes inside, cramming your whole mouth with the obese muscle slurping and flexing within quite audibly. Your eyes squeeze shut and your entire body tenses up during your make-out session with this feral if that's what you want to call it at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElephant saliva funnels down your gullet, as well as the tongue throughout its constant attack of licking inside your maw. Unable to escape, you can only hear the groans and yelps of your companions from underneath this beast to believe that they had also failed in surviving, and are now being raped or eaten. <i>Or both</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter wetly pulling away, the Donphan heaves air back and forth at your face before that very same tongue drags thickly across your face. Your entire head and furry cheeks are carried with the tongue until smacking back down after it ends its stride, leaving your face covered in the hot stuff. Taking the moment to look up at the elephant, your eyes willingly stare down into the dark and pink depths of the Donphan's maw, watching the tight inner cheeks walls glisten wetly from the small amount of light, as well as the wincing entrance of that thick throat of hers. You bite your bottom lips from the sight while your cock gives a wincing bounce just from the thought of sliding down inside of there, and it seems the pachyderm shares the same idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouth widens again this time to scoop over your entire muzzle this time, but continues to go as far as your face being smooshed completely by its tongue. The tastebudded wall grinds like wet sandpaper over your head and snout as you feel the elephant's lips clench around your neck to encase your head entirely within its hungry maw. Its thick hands grab your arms and pin them to your sides as its trunk coils around your body some, making sure you keeps still once it begins to finally eat you alive. You can't help but shiver some as you see the slimy walls and tunnel approaching you, clamping around your face to drag you inside. The fact that you fit neatly in between the elephant's tusk make you all the more easier to swallow as the feral lightly chews at your body. Your fur is matted down by the sticky substance washing the whole tight room with the tongue smearing around at your chest and belly forcing you to wince some by your sensitive muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind was in such a foggy state, you didn't mind the idea of becoming trapped inside this creature's belly. In fact, you practically wanted it to happen now. The psychic's plan for complete and utter seduction for the feral's stomachs had overpowered your common sense now, and your lust drove you to become a willing meal for this infected pachyderm. The Donphan murrs and gropes its hands around your rear end, pushing you up to stuff your furry, twitching body inside deeper as the esophagus walls hug around you and pull you at your hide. The elephant was wanting to finish you off quickly from all the exercise you put it through during your 'intimate' moment, slurping at your groin for only a moment until working your legs inside. Her thick lips suckle and smack around at your throbbing thigh and calves, all until your hindpaws are sent sinking down into the glurking depths of the Donphan's gullet. Fleshy and thick rubbery walls surround you to imprison you within the tightening chamber of the elephant's gut that it so happily rubs after you meet your final stop, sloshing you about some from the weighing smears of the large tugs. You gasp within the stomach, finding yourself completely at the mercy of the infected's belly as stomach fluids begin to pour inside and pool up. A muffled belch from the outside connotes your inevitable end, and you can only slump back deeper within the hammocking pouch as it tightens up around you. With the liquids up to your shoulders, you begin to realize the state you're now in, and what this truly means for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the sudden awareness now, you begin to struggle and kick at the walls, yet it seems to only jiggle to whole gut and makes the elephant enjoy her meal all the more. Whining like a puppy at this point, you eventually pass out as the bubbling liquid flushes over you completely inside the stomach, ending your journey as a willing snack for this fat elephant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The infected Donphan plops down heavily onto its fat rear, grabbing at its large and domed gut to feel the digesting dog inside get to become a part of her girth now. A doom leading to larger breasts, belly tautness, and all around chub for the superior beast. In fact, the other ferals were lucky enough to enjoy themselves as well. A Linoone feral is mounted against an eyepatched Luxray girl, pounding away at her pussy with the entire length of its rod to force the cat to mewl or gasp with every thrust. The Luxray wouldn't be the only one to service a feral that way, as a Roserade is down on her knees and forced into sucking a fat Pinsir's shaft as well. Tears well up in her eyes as the clawed hand gripped around her head petals motions her head back and forth, making its pulsing cock to slide in deep within the plant girl's mouth during a Golduck's struggles in the crustacean's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd from afar, both the Toxicroak and Typhlosion met an uneasy end by becoming meals to the ferals, followed by the other group afterwards from not making it in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so this is where the Lucario's story ends. After overcoming all of his troubles thus far, he meets his demise within the belly of this Donphan.</i></span></div></div>",

The surface ripples with the soft, yet cold winds and reflects the team standing near its coast. Although, there wasn't much else to see with the steam everywhere. Which was strange since the water itself looked cool enough and the weather seemed too nice today. Your curiosity is sated though once you hear a sudden loud hiss shake the earth some. Just then, a pit in the ground shoots out with natural water and steam. Glancing around, you see similar other holes in the ground, all fuming with the same kind of steam. Your group discovers they've walked upon geysers around the lake. You look up to the sky to check the distance of the sun's travel ever since you left the tent, and you still had plenty of time to get to the mountains from this point. As long as everyone avoided stepping into any pits in the dirt, things could go easy for all of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex behind you takes in a nice inhale of fresh air before happily sighing out in relief, while Gold walks on down to step into the water some to wet his legs. You call over to the duck, \"Hey now, be careful. We don't know if ferals are in the water or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Golduck rolls his eyes, enjoying the cool water but remains to stick to the shore as he and the rest of the group walk around the lake. \"Don't worry about it. I'll take care of any of em'. Besides, do you see how calm these waters are? There's no way any Pokemon are down there especially with these geysers to scare em' off, so just leave it to us expert water-types.\" He closes his eyes and crosses his arms behind his head, not caring for another word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just have to take his word for it and continue on with traveling. The mist did provide more of a security to you rather than a threat with its beautiful texture and occasional creation of a foggy rainbow to appear in the sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll seemed well until a cannon of water shoots out in front of you to wash you and the others back! You gasp only to receive a mouthful of the liquid as you're sent splashing away closer to the coast of the water to instantly get grabbed by a pair of hands. You cough out some the water and endeavor to free yourself from the captivating hands. Growling, you notice several purple dots shine from the blanketing mist of the environment, and out from stalked several water-type pokemon who thrive at the lake. The ferals had actually planned an ambush for any travelers to this lake, knowing prey wouldn't just dive into the pond. They were actually learning and able predators. You then feel a fat tongue drag along the back of your neck, making the saliva-glazed fur there prickle and to make your muscles suddenly tense up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a powerful lash of your head flinging backwards, you headbutt the infected grappling you from behind to the scutter away with your skull pounding some, but at least you weren't in the hands of that hungry rapist. You swing around to find an infected Marshtomp growling at you and pouncing outward. Luckily you jab a fist into its stomach as it goes flying back for you to knock back far into the lake, allowing you time to check back on your companions. Gold was off faced with a Milotic naga who you knew why he would struggle with a foe like that. The beautiful water serpent was glistening from the water as she slithers her large form from the lake water, causing the Golduck to look dumbfounded with his eyes aimed at the large breasts that shook slightly with every movement from the Milotic, but Jackal is quick to help after blasting a Quagsire away to go help Gold. You didn't have time to deal with that awkward situation and spot Eden fending off a female Swampert from the looks of it, as Hex and Star are attacked by a large feral Lapras from the lake. The Lapras lacked an anthro body was forced to remain at the coast of the lake, but its constant ray of ice beam wasn't helping anyone during the fight. From the looks of it, you didn't know who needed more help, but you decided to go aid...</span></div></div>",

You would need much your strength to take it down with Star and Hex and to make sure every hit counted. Arriving at the lake coast, you quickly leap away once a chilly ice beam shoots down towards your from the Lapras' maw, freezing the ground where you stood earlier almost instantaneously into a rupture of icy spikes solidifying loudly that had your hairs prickling at your body from the close call and temperature. You could even see the cold mist steaming off from the chunk of ice thick as a rock, which could've easily been you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling back onto your hindpaws, you watch as Star unleashes a bolt of electricity into its hide as Hex dashes in an attempt to poison the feral with his knuckle claws. However, the large Lapras roars and headbutts the Toxicroak away and almost catches him in its maw with a snap of its drooling jaws. Star prepares another surge of electricity in her forepaws until the Lapras shoots her with a powerful jet of water from its mouth to send the cat washing away. You return the favor by leaping forward with a snarl, driving a deadly punch of aura at its neck to cause the large water-horse to howl out and shake along the ground, creating a small tremor throughout the dirt floor just from its writhing. You stumble back and struggle to keep your balance during the rumble of the ground, managing to maintain an upright stance whereas Hex fell back down after just getting up. The Lapras flashes its cruel, purple vision down at the three of you, and just before you could even move it lashes out its hungry jaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak makes it back up finally on his own, rubbing his head from where he had been struck before grunting, \"Nngh, what a complicated and determined beastie this one is. We'll need to st-\" The frog's words are cut off once the Lapras' maw closes shut around Hex's upper body from its head-lunge. The loud chomp causes your fur to prickle and you to practically petrify from the shock of what happened. The Lapras retracts his head back up high with the Toxicroak's kicking legs desperately hang outside it lips, licking its fat tongue to smear around the feasible snack. You charge forward to go and rescue Hex as it tosses his saliva-glistening body up in the air before catching him back into its maw completely for his entire form goes sliding down the infected's throat with a bulging, and quite loud, swallow to contract its esophagus and bring the devoured amphibian's body into its large stomach. You halt dead in your tracks with your ears flattening down behind you once you are forced to hear and see such a deafening gulp. Forcing you to watch, your eyes trace the round and groaning lump that was your traveling companion down along its neck and disappearing into his thick midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lapras' own eyes were closed for a moment as its grins sinisterly from quite the delicious but sadly quick meal, all before opening those violent, glowing eyes to stare you down in front of it. The infected murrs with a deep and yet serene tone Lapras' were signature to have. Your heart wanted to escape your chest and desperately beats at your ribs with your breath beginning to quickly all of a sudden from the strange terror striking you in this moment. The neck and head of the beast towers above you, looming with its dominance obviously showing as you listen to the muffled croaks and whines emitting from deep within its belly. Its lips part cruelly to stretch its salivating jaws before you to show you the rippling flesh and muscles inside that ache for your filling. Thick drool seeps out as the tongue pulsates by fattening out and occasionally fidgeting around to keep its cheeks and gums wet while the esophagus leading down its dark tunnel of no return seemingly beckons you to just jump right in. You have no clue how or what was happening, but the Lapras' intimidation tactic was working on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, Star rushes in once she spots you petrified from fear after watching your friend suffer a terrible fate with a crackling spectacle of electricity packed around her arms. The Luxray roars and leaps forward at the Lapras as it turns with its jaws still widened out to see what the commotion was. The cat yelps as she sees this, losing her focus from her attack to suddenly dissipate as she tries to impossibly stop herself, only to inevitably fail and land directly into the Lapras' maw. The infected's eyes widen some as a meal delivered itself to it anyways, but not that it would complain. It proceeds to lock its mouth tightly closed to trap Star inside to torture the poor cat with several licks and tongue-slams for her to be ground around like food along the fleshy walls. You can only gasp again when you see the Lapras' cheeks occasionally bulge when lapping at the groaning and mewling kitty inside, dooming your other friend as well to share Hex's fate with your thoughts not yet clicking together that you too could end up like that if you didn't do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could comprehend to save Star, the Lapras opens its maw to you to show Star completely covered in the hot, clear slime of its saliva with her fur completely matted down. Her body tries to pick herself up, but she slips on the slick tongue that causes her to splat on the fat tastebuds to just be curled up within the mass of tongue flesh rolling around her body. You blush when you hear her moan and for her nipples to harden out from under the fur of her breasts, revealing the confusion of her body being mixed with fear and arousal if her body is constantly  forced to grind with wet meat. The Lapras even adds insult to injury when it uses the side of its tongue to glide in and out from between Star's legs, eliciting more meows of exhausted submission and helplessness out of the weakened Luxray. At last, the Lapras shuts its jaws closed once more and loudly gulps its second course down for you to see the same show again. The moaning bulge makes its way down the glistening thick neck of the Lapras feral to join in with the frog, signifying that it was your turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body is suffering from too much shock to do anything but for your legs to suddenly give away. Falling to your rump, you begin to scoot back in an awkward crawl to make any kind of distance or retaliation to get away from the Lapras, yet it merely opens the strangely alluring but ravenous maw out to you to lick you inside anyway. You fall face first into the mass of tastebuds soaking in your flavor as your world begins to darken. You shudder as the hot, wet environment appears rather soothing to you as muscles contract powerfully around your form. The Lapras didn't even need to use a single ice beam to freeze you stiff, but rather used the most natural way of doing it; fear and intimidation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive water-horse rewards your discontinued fighting by smearing its tongue lighter around you instead of wrestling you down as it did with the other two anthros. You are smooshed against slick walls, guided along a tasting tongue, and bathed in a hot bath of drool that feels refreshing from the chilly temperatures the Lapras provided outside. The victorious feral tosses its head back, gulping you down to your own demise as you were stupidly defeated by a single feral. Making it down the even darker tunnel of its throat, it isn't too long after you hear the gurgles and squelches of its mighty stomach, forcing you inside a tight sphincter to compress you together with your two other fallen companions. Even with a large feral, three meals were enough to truly pack the fleshy and dank chamber to where poor Star is sandwiched in between the two males inside. It doesn't help either with her rump pressed against your face and her head brushing against your rising member. Even Hex's genitals were forced up upon Star's face, eliciting unwilling moans from both of them as they were unable to move or fidget those parts away from each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew before your real senses even came back that you had lost to a feral and had become its lunch, dawning upon you to just submit to your fate while you still could, surrendering to the evil psychic out there that proved its underlings were far stronger than you or your team were. Your panting maw takes in a mouthful of the Luxray's rear, smearing that tongue around her slick, furry tush that cause the Luxray to yelp and cry with you using her like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh...ahh...L-Lace, stoppp...What a-are you doing? We n-n-need...to escape~!\" She tiredly mumbles, using too much of her energy to say as she tries pushing you away. That doesn't stop you as your tongue finds its way to her pre-slicken nethers to use before toying with the thick, blushing folds around it. Even when the Luxray was going to protest again, struggling even harder, Hex's purple cock was forced into her mouth! The gay male winces and tries to get it out with both of the unhappy travelers forced to endure their new fate as Lapras fat and sexual objects for the evil mastermind's own accidental amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Lapras releases a mighty and victorious belch before sliding back into the lake with three meals forced to cram and pleasure themselves inside as digestive juices overtake them.

The strike causes the Swampert to gag out with wide purple eyes opening up but seeing you too late to escape, which sent the feral sliding away in the gravelly dirt from the impact as the Roserade's own eyes widen up from the excitement she received from your help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-Whew...thanks Lace!\" The Roserade mentions as her legs shake some. Her pink eyes seem to then grow more intense as she returns into more of a fighting stance, \"Don't you worry about me though! I can take care of myself!\" She exclaims confidently, but you were still going to help her no matter what. With Star and Hex helping each other, you're positive they can handle and outwit their foe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Swampert is already back up, holding its stomach with one hand and glaring at you in a vindictive manner. It's fat pink tongue rims along its lips before charging in again and hissing with an open maw. However, Eden was quick to shoot out her vines from her bouquets, lashing several whips against the Swamperts bare body to leave blushing red lines all across its body and sending it back a few more steps again only before being shot back to the ground again once you had released a large Aura Sphere at it. The Roserade grins and gives you a victorious wink, \"See? She doesn't even stand a chance, especially against someone li-\" Eden would then be cut off to shout muffled yells when a large amount of mud blasts out to strike her face, sending her to the grass floor. You glance back, only to get a mud bomb attack yourself that the Swampert feral had thrown to blind your vision. The sudden surprise has you stunned and frantically backing away while wiping your face with your arms to try to remove the wet dirt. Having wiped most of it off, you're only given the view of a tremor rumbling the ground in several cracks before once the chubby Swampert had stomped its foot to the ground, causing a small earthquake to shoot out towards you that causes exploding dirt to propel you deeper into the dirt floor, trapped within the thick rubble of the mud and dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunt and struggle with all of your might to escape the tremor's squeeze before looking over to Eden. The plant girl was then grabbed by her flowered head by one hand on the Swampert to just bear through her whining, dirty face to be licked. The chubby female amphibian evilly chuckles and it helps clean her face for her. Through the slimy licks she had to endure, Eden tries lashing out her vine whips once more, only for them to be grabbed as well and tugged on by the Swampert's free hand. She yelps and squirms helplessly in the infected's grasp, with her short legs kicking in the air, unable to reach the ground. You peer over to your companions to request more help, however, you would only find more things to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Gold's blue and twitching legs sink down into the open jaws of the Milotic naga, stretching out that sandy-peach skin of her throat out as he quacks out with seemingly happy moans with her tongue smearing around delicately around his member and thighs. Even Jackal was to the point of becoming seduced by his captor, being tightened up in her coils with his eyelids drawn down a bit over his empty eyes with blushing cheeks igniting red. His lips are secured around one of the naga's breasts to suckle her nipple. Drinking whatever heavenly milk he could, the Typhlosion moans with muffled whispers and exhales occasionally as the Milotic finishes her dinner with the duck for Gold to become nothing more than a bulge sliding down her lovely figure. After the Golduck fits neatly into her belly, Jackal is then subjected to more teasing as the Milotic naga reaches a hand out to playfully rub her fingertips along his stiff, pre-oozing member that stuck out between her coils around him. The act has the Typhlosion tensing up and struggling inside and sucking harder even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore over to the coast of the lake lay Hex on the ground, completely unconscious as Star was mewling weakly. The Luxray was trapped inside the large infected Lapras' jaws, being ground and licked around inside with the water-creature opening its maw every now and then to show its obese tongue grinding in between Star's thighs. The cat groaned and yelped all she could, but nothing stopped the feral from wrestling her down to use with its tongue. Other muffling cries could be heard though, and you swing your head back over to see Eden's legs throbbing in the air as they slid up into the blushing, dripping nethers of the Swampert's crotch! You gasp as you see the Swampert murring and stroking at its breasts with the plant girl being suckled inside its womb. You watch the chubby amphibian's white belly stretch out and jiggle some with the Roserade inside, both horrified and becoming aroused at the same time at the sight of the sloshing gut. The Swampert smears its thick, blue hands around the domed stomach, coursing around the perfectly round curve as the womb walls tighten around its victim to made into cum soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple glare of the feral then spots you, still trapped with nowhere to go and no one to help you. You can't help but gulp and wiggle in your place with all of your might that actually begins to loosen up the dirt some when you begin sliding out. Although, your efforts would be all in vain once the Swampert punches its own fist up against your jaw, literally forcing you out of the ground from the jab to hit the ground on your backside. The Swampert pops the knuckles in its hand to signify paying you back for your own punch earlier and then happily walks over to your battered form. You grumble aloud with your eyes wincing some while you try to crawl back and make distance between you and the towering, large feral. The Swampert easily closes in on you though at just walking pace and suddenly plops down on its knees above you to straddle you down. You gasp and continue your wriggling as the amphibian grabs your wrists and keeps them to the dirt floor, only to have its pussy sit atop your cock flattened against your waist and belly. The Swampert chuckles with its eyes glaring over your body and its gut sitting on your chest heavily, churning the Roserade inside and gurgling softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpossible to help yourself, you begin to pant warmly with arousal and defeat as its slick nethers grind up and down your length to elicit high-pitched inhales from your open mouth, only to have it raise up and dip your member's head wetly inside within its folds. The hot tightness sends storms of pleasure to ring through your cock that it gives a responding throb to the act as you feel the Swampert's waist lower down to slide the rest of the member into it, giving it a nice play to stay for awhile to throb aimlessly in. The fleshy, slimy walls hug around the dog-rod to tug and rub to cause you to willingly hump into her some, completely forgetting the consequences of doing so. The idea of becoming infected, to help your friends, or to survive have completely left you at this point as you start to hump inside the tight feral vagina now. The Swampert grins and feels heat building up inside its body with the other male's genitalia using her to her advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Swampert circles her large hips with your poor doggy humps with your furry sac swinging up against her groin as well and your tail swatting the ground in between your legs. You watch as the female dominates you from above, as well as the sloshing stomach and bouncing white breasts with all of your motions working together to help you both off, which only causes your cock wanting to jizz within just minutes of drilling this Pokemon's vagina. The feral is appeased enough by your stupid willingness that she slides the hot lips up once again to slap down heavily with enough force to stuff your thick knot inside, reacting with a loud bark from you as the knot tenses up within the wonderful, narrow tunnel. Pre slathers all over your crotches together with the end of your cock slamming against the barrage of fleshy walls wanting every inch of your doghood imprisoned inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely lost of it, your eyes roll back and your tongue flops out. At last, your orgasm reaches its limit and erupts its molten, white seed to shoot into the feral for her benefit and paints the vaginal walls the very same pale color with every shot of the goo. The Lucario cream even shoots up far enough into the womb where it mixes with the Swampert's cum that was once a cocky Roserade to form a nice warm batch to release. The Swampert murr with complete delight as she rains her own release over your pounding member of meat, bathing it in the clear ooze before she yanks out it out to drip more of it out onto you. She swirls two blue,large fingers around at the messy nethers before spreading the folds open some more to plant them against your panting maw. You eagerly and tiredly oblige, lapping at the sensitive and wet entrance of her vagina to make her toss her head back, lapping up some of those very juices to the point where the orgasm and weight on you begin to make the world darker, and then, just vanish forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Lucario's eyes open up once more, but this time, have a vivid purple hue to them. The canine gets up to discover others of its kind, with a Milotic with two large and around bulges jiggling around along its body from two masturbating males insides, a Lapras with two Toxicroak legs dangling from its maw before it slurps them down to join a Luxray, and a female Swampert laying against a tree rubbing its stomach from the wonderful unbirthed meal it churned. It reminded the canine of its own hunger and it heads out under the control of its new psychic master to claim its own similar prize, as well as dooming the world forever.</i></span></div></div>",

Yuli's smile seemed to glimmer more seductively as your legs are dragged under her arms, effectively being locked between them in a tight bind. You grunt and blush from her dominance, struggling to get out of her hold. Your crotch is purposely resting at her large chest, forcing your cock to squeeze in between her soft breasts. You exhale fervently through the stress your cock feels, throbbing within the crease as Yuli begins to pump your groin vertically. The knotted rod rocks up and down along the tight space, occasionaly jabbing the Abra's chin in its humping strides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands go from endeavoring to reach the winning psychic to grasp the bedsheets or pillows nearby. You grunt aloud as your cock is given a thorough ride along her curved torso, having the brown boobs slap happily against the grinding sides of your member. Pumping your body a bit upward, Yuli is able to catch your rod's head into her mouth, suckling over its head to force more trembles and squirms from your body. Your nerves flared up in heat and your fur spiked to its farthest point. With gritting teeth you groan out in pleasure as her tongue dabs around your breast-beating cock, occasionally licking the urethral lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had clearly won, and you only wished for the moment of your own orgasm. With how your member was being pleasured in this enticing moment, who would care what 'losing' meant? You had a large batch of hot cum to unload! By just mere humps and licks over the Abra's body, you softly howl in blissful misery, ejaculating your anxious semen into Yuli's mouth. She backs her mouth away some, letting the white strands jet over her face to droop down in an utter mess, She blushes brightly while her tongue circled over her lips to collect a small dose of your shooting cum, swallowing it down in front of you to simply arouse you more. You couldn't help but stare at her stringed face, blushing all the same with her as your body gave up its drained form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour muscles loosen and you cease all movements in you. You <i>lost</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing what Yuli was up to, she stalks up body as her wide rear bumps the very air around it beautifully. Her head was close to yours now, in fact, her mouth was quite close to yours. Your own seed slowly drips from her face, plopping over your slightly open muzzle as you stare lustrously at her eyes. Her tongue parts her lips, scooping a little of the white goo from your face. The single action alone made you almost orgasm again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Abra breathed over your head, tingling your pent up fur with a gentle and mind blowing breeze. \"Well, my little pooch, it seems you're as easy to seduce as I thought. With your horny little mind, I'm surprised you haven't ended up as a feral's dinner or <i>playmate</i> yet.\" You didn't know whether that what just a sexual tease or a direct insult. Not time was allowed to process that though though, when out of the blue, Yuli's open maw came down on you! She swallowed you down to your shoulders as her hands suddenly pinned your arms together, slurping your body deeper and deeper into her stretching throat. You quickly struggle in revolt, keeping your best effort to stop the random attack. Your body was already weakened by your sudden and sexual outburst however, having taken most to all of your strength left to fight her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind scrambled about for ideas on what was happening and why it was as Yuli continued to gulp your throbbing dog body closer down. Your waist enters the salivating maw, getting a nice coat of drool to slather in before heading down. You wince as your satisfied member hardens once more as it basks in the dripping saliva around it. Your meaty rump is swallowed in, dragging your thrashing legs and tail to follow it into the wet depths of Yuli's esophagus. The stomach valve stretches around your head, pulling your ingested sections into itself as your footpaws are given a nice and long bath by the Abra's tongue. Chomped down with ease, the lips close around the writhing paws, gulping them down to join the rest of your body in the psychic's outrageously swollen belly. Yuli gave off a soft belch and grasped her three fingered hands around her massive yellow gut, pinching its love handles and stretching flesh. You whine out and shuffle inside the slimy stomach walls, pushing roughly against the wobbling and rubbery walls clenching tight around you. You could even feel Yuli's hands roll over the bulge you created by your feeling, giving you a grope here and there as she began to walk, causing your innard hammock to slosh about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm terribly sorry that it has come to this, Lace, however, by conducting this little experiment to see if you truly were incorruptable, I have discovered that the sad truth is that you're as easily seduced as all the other infected victims are. I haven't even begun to use my psychic abilities and I was still able to swallow you down. So doesn't that just show that it is impossible for you to defeat this supposed 'mastermind' psychic in the first place? Trust me, I'm doing you a favor.\" The Abra admitted as she picked her crimson robe back up. You cry out in protest, wallowing in her organ as digestive fizzling juices began to pool inside. Unable to understand your words, she simply ties the belt around her robe, (the best that she can with a wobbling belly), tightening it to fit her differently curved body. She slides her feet back into their rightful sandals and adds, \"I think it's better that your body's digested energy suits a pokemon who can actually do something about the infected, not some horny dog willing to surrender himself to some <i>animal</i>. Now you might as well be quiet about the whole thing. Just sit and relax to boil up into the frothy stew you're about to become. You'll serve me for excellent nutrition for the trip I'm taking...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the Abra teleported away, far off from Draxius' tent with your now unconscious body digesting inside her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yuli rubbed her belly as she walked down the streets of Redeemer's Grotto. Her sagging stomach sloshed from side to side with each step she took towards the Village Chief who had been talking with pedestrians of the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly approached the Charizard, grabbing his attention as he eyes her gut. \"Another caught infected, I assume?\" The Village Chief asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuli nodded, \"Of course. I found this pesky little guy wandering around Draxius' tent during my visit. He wasn't much trouble, in fact, a little willing.\" She teased and poked a finger on the pasty Lucario dissolving within it. \"Speaking of which, I'm here to report some news about the infection from what I've heard from Draxius. And some sad news from Lace's quest. I'm afraid the Lucario found an unfortunate end inside a feral's belly. It turns out he was easily seduced by one with just its body and fell victim to its stomach. I guess he wasn't much the hero type we all thought out to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Charizard let his attention wander, drifting away in woeful thought. \"Ah...that is quite unfortunate. I was afraid it would occur sooner or later, yet he showed so much promise as well. Hm, I never expected him to be defeated by just one feral. Had I known that he would've been eaten, I could've saved him the trouble and ate his cute looking hide myself!\" He gives a hearty laugh and beats a fist against his fat belly before returning back to a content mood. \"Anyhow, please come into my quarters since we have much to discuss. I'm very eager to hear what you have discovered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Abra followed the chubby dragon inside, continuing to stroke her yellow gut. She answered with a sly grin, \"Do not worry Chief, I too would not mind a Lucario cuisine as well. From what I've gathered, they're more delicious than any other Pokemon...\"</i></span></div></div>",

Back at that time, I had let my guard down, but I'm fully aware of his power now so I doubt that'll happen easily again. I'm prepared now.\" You struggle to spit out with the stunning Abra trying to seduce you in front of your very eyes. You clear your throat and grumble out reluctantly, \"Listen, it's kind of you to offer, however, I'm going to have to decline your offer. I'd preferred to just find my friend and spend a quiet night there. I'll admit that I'm flattered and all, plus your body is...beautiful, but the answer is still no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Abra tightened her gaze on you, terrifying your fur to spike out helplessly. Yuli sat there in a chilling silence for a moment, pondering at your sudden disinterest as her tail slowly slides back and forth along the bed. Suddenly, she grins as she begins to tie her crimson robe back around her body once more, stating out, \"Nicely done Lace. You've proven me wrong. Draxius had mentioned how simple it was to control you, so my apologies for thinking different. If you had actually accepted and waltzed in here like some perverted dog, then I would've saved trouble for the ferals and devoured you myself.\" The statement shocked you with the hidden insult of eating you, but you passed, right? You were just ready to get out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Your welcome...?\" You answer awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuli chuckles, \"You don't have to be afraid of me any longer, Lace. I no longer pose as a threat to you. I do, however, must congratulate you on your fast decisiveness. I was certain that you would have been seduced like Draxius had said. The Drowzee mentioned how capable he was to brainwash you into his sex slave; you and your frog friend both. You either are a cunning young canine, or you're a committed homosexual with no interest in a woman like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole \"gay\" aspect kind of put your irritation over the deep-end, but you decided to hold it back. \"I'm pretty sure I'm not gay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Abra snickers again, \"Oh? Well, I have to keep that in mind for later then, won't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face heats up and you manage to retort, \"I guess it's a good thing Draxius didn't make me his sex-slave then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't know about that now, because if he <i>had</i>...\" She said in a coy tone as she starts loosening the red silk-woven cloth off her body yet again, \"...then we could've had some <i>real</i> fun then. Of course, we still can. My offer still stands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour blush rockets in mad warmth before your eyes dart to look somewhere else. \"Maybe...later...\" The psychic huffs in amusement and returns the robe onto her body, shielding her large breasts and golden underside. Although, the tight and smooth material adding to the curvy effect to her body did little to help stop your arousal. Her figure was still awe-striking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm proud of you Lace. I hope your 'friend' knows how lucky she is to have you.\" Yuli calls out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jolt in surprise. \"How'd you know who I was specifically talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA single laugh escapes the Abra's smiling lips. \"I am a psychic, remember? Star is quite an attractive female, but one that needs to be consoled after what she's been through. Go to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face was completely drained to blush any longer. You turn away from her, mentioning, \"Goodnight Yuli.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight Lace. I will see you in the morning. Oh, and sorry for the first impression. I just have to make sure I know how capable you are into stopping the infection. Seeing how you can avoid being seduced, even though you struggle with it somewhat still, I think you will do fine out there in the world filled with corrupted monsters. They'll do anything to put you into their stomachs, or worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou huff, \"I've managed to keep away from the infected up to this point, I'm sure I can keep up that record.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I wasn't talking about the ferals</i>.\" Yuli's chilling voice answered before you left. The comment sent shivers tingling down your spine. Thankfully, you arrive at the last remaining door, which <i>had</i> to be Star's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were done with anymore surprise walk-ins, so with some new courage built up thanks to Yuli's conversation, you speak towards the dangling tent doorway, \"Star? It's Lace. Do you mind if I come in?\" Almost immediately, a Luxray's arms shoot out from the opening crease of the cloth to clasp your shoulders, yanking you into the room with a brief pull! Looks like you were in store for another surprise anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar's body clenches into yours, hugging you tightly as your chests press together. Her tail coils around one of her legs and her fingers run through your fur, all the while, Star's single eyelid lowers down with her blushing face, exhaling steamy breathe at your face as she looks up at you. Her weak voice whispers, \"Lace...Make love to me...please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes and ears widen out in shock. Not once, not twice, but three entire times has an attractive woman appealed you have sex with them. You figured today must have been some twisted dream Draxius was setting up to toy with you. Judging from the limp state, extreme body-heat, sudden desperate desire for a male, and sticky clumps of fur along the Luxray's groin which glistened with pre, Star was in heat. The cat grinded her waist at your thigh, moaning and whimpering helplessly as she looked like she was about to pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a strange and quick decision to make. Do you try to calm Star down and help her? Or should you actually just accept and take advantage of her? It tremble to think of a better plan as the Luxray was ready to pounce and rape you.</span></div></div>",

Are you alright?\u201d You worriedly ask the Luxray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar drags her tongue up along the surface of your neck, exhaling, \u201cTouch me\u2026\u201d Her hand glides down your chest fur to pause at your crotch, fondling around to find your ball sac. You wince in return and unleash your hands to stop her venturing curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scowl, \u201cStar, what\u2019s the problem?\u201d You weren\u2019t going to be tricked into believing that Star\u2019s sudden behavior was just because she randomly wanted sex, so instead of pushing her away, you wrap your arms around her to embrace the Luxray in a deep, thoughtful hug. She pauses her moans for the time being and stops her grinding. Unable to see Star\u2019s expression with your head over her shoulder, it was obvious how sad she was when her body began to convulse and breathing changed into sniffling. A tear streamed down her single eye, dripping onto your shoulder in your lengthened hug before the cat wailed miserably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2026miss B-B-Bell\u2026\u201d She barely managed to speak out. Star pushes you away and turns her back to you, struggling to hold her weeping back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to comfort her with a story, judging the fact that you knew how loss feels. \u201cI never did tell you about my parents, have I?\u201d The Luxray didn\u2019t answer back. You continue, \u201cBoth of my parents were Lucarios. My mother died during childbirth, so I lived with my father as an only child. Thankfully, he never blamed me for her death and told me that she was sick before I came out. My dad always said that she was a lively woman though, and had a lot of willpower in life. He mentioned that to me a lot in fact, saying that I had some of that stubborn nature.\u201d You smile weakly. \u201cMy father was an inn keeper in a small town, and after I evolved from a Riolu during my youth, I started helping him around with his work. He was a quiet man, who neither yelled nor beat me. Yet there was this strange feeling of power in his voice whenever he did speak, like, as if his words always mattered and carried powerful meaning with them. It  was a peaceful life, and I couldn\u2019t really ask for more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid\u2026you <i>lose</i> him?\u201d Star whispers. Your ears perk up, in fact, a little excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no. He didn\u2019t die or anything. At least, not that I know of. I moved out a while back before the infection. I don\u2019t really want to get into useless details, but mainly, we had an argument, which was rare with someone like him, but when it happens, it\u2019s definitely destructive. It ended with me leaving town out to find, \u2018my purpose in life\u2019 or something. I\u2019m not really sure anymore. I can barely even remember why we were even angry at each other to begin with. I guess that\u2019s how most reactions are to fights.\u201d You check back on Star, seeing that her tears had disappeared and she was left to whimper slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry to hear that\u2026Did you ever see him again, or know if he\u2019s still alive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears lower, \u201cI\u2019m afraid not. He\u2019s probably still out there somewhere, hosting some kind of shelter for any survivors. Probably thinking about me from time to time.\u201d Her wet hazel began to grow red  and tear up again, so you quickly add, \u201c\u2026But it\u2019s alright. After this crazy mess is all over, I\u2019m going to see if I can find him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat nods at the comment, letting the room settle into pure silence again, standing with her head down and her tail barely moving. You attempt to go to her, but she backs away and climbs onto the bed, rolling to the side in efforts of giving you the cold shoulder. Curling up, she lifts the sheet over her body with a swift note. You sigh and sit on the edge of the bed, also facing away from her as you ask, \u201c\u2026Care to tell me anything about Bell, or why you were so\u2026<i>clingy</i> back there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, you hear Star actually answer, \u201c\u2026Alright.\u201d She sniffs once and turns over, \u201c\u2026Bell was always like family to me, like a mother. She did more for me than I could ever imagine. I was amazed as a child at how much she loved me, with my background, my disability, and even my stubborn attitude towards her. I came to bond with her in a relationship I never really thought could exist for me. I\u2019m all frizzled up because, the last thing she ever really mentioned to me was the night we were going to spend together. Tonight. But now\u2026\u201d She grabs your arm and forces you to fall into the covers with her, clenching you tightly against her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and pet her carefully, replying, \u201cIs she your girlfriend then? You two seem closer than just family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luxray\u2019s eye flashes a look directly at you, \u201cYou say that as if she\u2019s still alive\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m positive she is. Killing of infecting Bell would do nothing for Herox. If anything, he\u2019ll keep her around to try and force us to surrender as a hostage. But trust me, at that moment, we\u2019ll save her. That\u2019s a promise.\u201d You tried comforting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar shrugs to ignore your optimism and continued, \u201c\u2026No, we\u2019re not a thing. We just\u2026fooled around just for fun.\" The cat's star-ended tail curls about the more she thinks of the cow. \"...She\u2019s cute, you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, \u201cI <i>do</i> feel <i>thirsty</i> when I\u2019m around her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar softly punches you at the comment. You giggle as she hugs closer over you. Her face grew hotter though. \u201cHey um, don\u2019t tell anyone this\u2026but umm\u2026one reason I really like is\u2026cause\u2026I sort of\u2026kind of\u2026\u201d The cat finally trails off, shaking her head madly, \u201cActually, just nevermind!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tug her into your chest, grinning a fanged smile, \u201cAw come on. Tell me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026I have this thing for\u2026<i>tums</i>.\u201d Star admits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown in disappointment. \u201cSo? This infection seems to have made everyone somehow interested in that. It\u2019s one way the ferals are supposed to seduce us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar shook her head again, \u201cThat\u2019s not really true. I\u2019ve had the...'interest' before the infection. Maybe it sprouted in my head since I was deeply in love with Bell and she isn\u2019t exactly the thinnest Pokemon around\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlat or round?\u201d You inquire. The Luxray pinches her brows in confusion until you explain, \"Stomachs, the tums you like. Do you like them flat or round? Maybe something in the middle?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar blushed, \u201cY-You\u2019re asking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah. Are you uncomfortable with explaining it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feline actually just immediately answers then and there. \u201cRoundish. Bell\u2019s belly is just too cute for me to ignore. She even has that plump milky udder poking out of it, it just makes me want to squeal and hug it!\u201d Star excitedly cheers with a whisper scream. She flashes her eye at you, seeing a devious smile along your muzzle. The cat calms down, looking at your own abdomen and finishes, \u201c....Flat is okay too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin. Star immediately spikes her fur in embarrassment and tries to cover her humiliated face with a pillow. Through the muffled fluff, her voice quietly yells, \u201cUgh. I can\u2019t believe I told you that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean into her side, wrapping an arm over her. \u201cTch. You don\u2019t need to be worried. Now I know why you were acting so weird when I woke up this morning, having you oddly touching and staring at my gut.\u201d She wallows deeper into the pillow to remain unresponsive. It takes a moment to ponder on how to get her out of it before mentioning, \u201cYou know, I think Jackal has a real thing for bellies too. Ever since he \u2018saved\u2019 me, he\u2019s been forcing me to do whatever he asks, but I\u2019ve noticed that he really prefers a good tummy rub.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Really?\u201d Star\u2019s head slowly shuffles out from the cushion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere she is~\u201d You sneer and quickly grab her again, pulling her back into your body to face you. The red glow of her cheeks reflected of your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cU-U-Uhmmm\u2026could you back up a bit.\u201d She stammers to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one with her tail spiraled around my leg.\u201d You whisper. She eeps and checks under the sheets. Her long tail was indeed neatly coiled around your calve, cycling down to end with its pointed tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another soft yelp, she quickly unravels it and begs, \u201cS-Sorry\u2026I\u2026\u201d Cutting her off, you lower your head down, pressing your lips to hers. The cat winces at the sudden gesture, panicking at first until settling down after a small moment passes. Her tongue cautiously digs into your mouth, licking over your own tongue as her saliva slips inward. You slide out with a bridge of spittle connecting your maws together. Star quietly asks, \"Isn't my eye-patch sort of...a turn-off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle, \"Nah. It makes you look more like a <i>badass</i> to me. What about me then? Am I a turn-off?\" Her face began to burst with burning fireworks.</span></div></div>",

Your other arm is hooked under her backside and running along her slim figure as it reaches closer to her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luxray\u2019s eye shrinks back in embarrassment, \u201cA little\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA <i>little</i>?!\u201d You retort with surprise, grinning as your circle and tickle her furry rump with your groping hand. She twitches and squirms, giggling in misery. Her arms weakly press against your chest to push you off, failing miserably of course, as her head shakes back and forth to dodge your kisses. Suddenly, with a tight grope of one of her bum-cheeks, she gasps followed by a \u201cmrrrowl\u201d sound.

You uncomfortably shudder at her words and thoughts of pleasuring her body, but attempt to remain calm. \u201cPositive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar grins and lashes out to grab your hands. With a fast swift of your arms, your forepaws are brought and clasped over her large breasts, cupping over the fuzzy orbs as her black nipples poke into your palms. \u201c<i>Positive</i>.\u201d Your hands do their work with eager excitement, swirling over the Luxray\u2019s voluptuous breasts as Star groans occasionally, gripping the sheets. Her nipples poke in between your fingers, pinched lightly by their sides as your hands alternate in their patterns. Star\u2019s hands plant themselves over yours, aiding your efforts during her intense pleasure. Throughout her moans, the cat\u2019s legs slide against yours, kicking softly within her humps as your cock presses on her hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exhale and crane down to Star\u2019s neck, nipping at her furry throat to rouse more of her meows of pleasure. One of your hands release a boob to glide down over her sides and pause at her groin, sliding two fingers at the basin of her pussy. Star groans loudly while you feel around the wet folds, poking the padded digits in every now and then as her pre slathers your hand. In return, you fell the Luxray\u2019s forepaw reach down and stroke your knotted rod, squirting out bubbling pre to stain the blankets. You growl through the muffling flesh of her neck, grinding into her hand with more power. With closed eyes, the two of you wind closer together atop the bed, helping each other masturbate as your arousal gets the best of you.</span></div></div>",

Unable to fall back asleep, you yawn out with an outstretched jaw and quaking muscles before sitting in the bed. Glancing to your side, you spot Star cuddling up to her pillows, breathing softly with a closed eye. You take the moment to just stare at her as she sleeps and smile in the sweet time. You rub a hand down and up her leg, petting the cat to comfort her in her rest that actually gets her to mewl lightly. You recall the events last night of how she orgasmed around your fingers several times over. The handjob she was giving you didn't last long since she was overcome with arousal that she began to feel at her own body before passing out. You didn't mind though; you still took care of your business thanks to the lubricated hand she had drenched for you. You shudder suddenly, figuring that that would be something Gold would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut by remembering what took place last night, you couldn't help but think of an interesting way to wake Star up. Checking beneath the blankets, her legs were widened out some. You felt like an even more perverted Gold than ever before, yet it still wouldn't stop you. Sliding down under the covers, you nose at her crotch before sliding your tongue over her exposed slit, driving a sudden 'mrrrowl' from the Luxray. Star remains asleep but squirms at the new sensation lapping at her vagina. This only coerces you to continue to lick at her nethers, discovering that they are starting to moisten with pre and saliva, marinating the ride for your tongue to wiggle in a bit deeper. With the tip inside, you worm the muscle inside her pussy, stretching the vibrating walls around as the girl squirms in bed and bites her pillow corner. The Luxray remains asleep, but with a blushing face and muffled groans of pleasure. You smile and thumb at her clit, rubbing and circling against it to have Star gasp violently loud. With her body suffering from so much torture, Star begins to awake once her eye slowly peeks open. Her crotch was willingly grinding into your mouth as her hands clenched at the bedsheets and blankets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luxray comes to find out that she was biting harshly down on her pillow with her vagina being penetrated and licked. It took only a second that she knew it was most likely you. \"A-ah-ahhhh-hahhhh...L-L-Laaace...what a-are you, <i>nyaaahh</i>...~\" She tosses her head back with her body shifting out and around the bed as you continue to lap at her folds. You open your mouth more, shoving it against her groin to jam your entire tongue as far as it could dig inside of her, scooping, licking, and fattening inside. It didn't take long for Star to tense up and orgasm, showering your tongue to soak around her abused tunnel and your muscle. You murr at its warmth and taste, noting that the walls were clenched tight around your tongue to keep it inside for awhile. When they lose their strength and give out, you slide your tongue back outside, licking around your lips to collect the last of her juices into your mouth before dragging the wet tongue over her sensitive clit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Star. I didn't mean to wake you.\" You snicker to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit.\" She scoffs as she tries to regain her senses after the experience. The cat softly rubs a hand over her gooey crotch and murrs quite pleasantly to herself as you slide back up to her, nudging yourself into her side while wrapping an arm around her shoulder. Star leans into you as she tries to catch her breath, \"But good morning to you too, Lace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub her arm and shoulder as you hold her, smiling and sarcastically asking, \"...I'm not in trouble for waking you, am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel her lips smooch your cheek in response, along with, \"Hmmm...I suppose not. I guess I deserve it actually, now that I think about it. I'm sorry that I kind of lost it back there last night and didn't help you off. I just...sort of...\" The Luxray trails off, humiliated that she passed out so easily by your mere hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give an affectionate lick to her face, making her smile more and hug around you closer, \"It's fine. I like making you release again and again. You're pretty easy when it comes to making you wriggle and cum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushes hotly and clings to your fur, brushing her palms around to comb through it. The Luxray quietly answers, \"Yeah...I'm not very good to when it comes to, you know, sex. Bell would always be the one to top me.\" Her own fur begins to bristle after the comment. \"...b-but you probably don't want to hear that stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her body a tug into you. \"Try me. I also like to hear your lesbian stories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar laughs, rolls her eye, and elbows you in the chest, \"Pervert.\" She settles into your side with her head resting on your shoulder; her hand rubbing softly over from where she had hit you. \"Occasionally if things ever got, <i>close</i>, between us, she'd be the dominant and controlling one every time, and yet, she was really sweet in the way she did. She was really good with wordplay too. And <i>mmmgh</i>...that belly of hers...\" That last statement was followed with a grope to your own stomach, but you doubt Star had realized that she even did so. She looks up at you suddenly, \"Have you ever tried Bell's milk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost feel yourself having a blush glow out of your face, \"N-No, can't say I have.\" That didn't mean you haven't thought about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luxray continues, \"I'm addicted to it, and I'm not one for the whole stereotype of how much cats like milk, but...her creamy nectar...I always felt like a humiliated little girl whenever I had to ask her to drink some, be it her breasts or udder. She'd tease me at first, yet she'd sing to me as I did. I find it so amazing how much she loved me...I was like her daughter...\" You can sense that Star was developing some sadness by her memories of Bell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo calm her down, you remind the Luxray, \"She <i>loves</i> you. She's still out there. Herox would've eaten her on the spot in front of us if he wanted to kill her. We can still find this cure, and we can still save her, Star. That's our mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar feels her eye almost begin to water, and she rubs her face into your neck. \"I...I know...and Lace...\" She lifts her head out of your neck to look at you. \"Th-thanks for being a great guy...and...stuff.\" She pouts and looks away, \"Ugh. I'm still not good at this whole affection thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've just spent so much time with Bell you don't have a lot of experience. That's all.\" You press against her to have the girl lay down on her backside as you lean over her, smiling, \"And thank you for being a wonderful woman. I'm glad we found you, I'm glad I met you, I'm glad with our time together, and I'm glad I rescued you from that infected town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar got her motivation and confidence back finally. \"Excuse me? Rescue? I seem to recall being the one who saved you. <i>You</i> were the damsel in distress by that poison, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lower down and kiss her mouth, molding your lips together to have Star muffledly protest in surprise some before mrrowling happily. Her long tail coils around yours, clenching at it as her hands explore around your backside, comforting you by her touch. You release the kiss and softly reply, \"I'm going to go get you some breakfast now. I can hear some of the others outside eating.\" You get off from atop of Star after giving her another kiss and walk out of the room to fetch her some food. The Luxray smiles in deep thought, snuggling into the bed as she thinks about you and what to come.</span></div></div>",

You feel a hand suddenly pat your back as you glance over to discover a robed Draxius at your side. He chuckles with his lax voice and coos, \"Good morning there, Lace. Go ahead and dine on this meal. Gyro and I have more than enough ingredients and food here, plus you'll need the strength to get across the mountains to battle our enemies.\" He suddenly gives your rear a firm pat, and a wink. \"You've earned it, but you could also put a bit of more meat to that body if you understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Drowzee chuckles to himself as he walks away back to his quarters. Blushing a tad, you set up Star's plate of food, (scarfing down a pastry hungrily to discover that this food was practically made from heaven itself) and took note of how everyone else was awake and enjoying their breakfast together. The party are seated around a longer table farther off in a room, chatting amongst themselves with Hex having an arm slung around Jackal's shoulder to pull the Typhlosion in close as he scandalously points and talks about Gold while the duck was attempting to flirt with Rose. A loud vine whip smacking his cheek explained what Gold was rudely saying about her body. And close by was Yuli the Abra, seated calming on her stool in her silky crimson robe as Gyro pours her another cup of hot tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that simple sight, you grin to see everyone enjoy themselves like this, with no fear of the apocalypse or evils outside. Just taking the time to forget about all of the tragedies for a brief moment together. Finishing up with setting up Star's meal, you head back to her room discretely before you could be spotted and invited over. You arrive in the room to spot Star happily smiling at you, still cuddled up in the bedsheets sitting up with her tail dancing lightly behind her on the bed. Smiling back at her, you step over and set the plate in her lap as you nestle back into her warm fuzzy body, pecking another kiss to her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou calmly tell her, \"I hope you like Cheri and Mago berry pastries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar takes a moment to bite down and try one of them, immediately closing her only visible eyes to murrl deeply as you listen to her slowly chew the baked dough. Savoring the rich texture, the Luxray's subconsciously wraps around your waist as a small tingle of electricity courses through her body, making you wince some. Her eye jams back open and she tries to swallow down the bite to say, \"Oh! S-Sorry about that! It's just been awhile since I've actually had this kind of quality of food...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nose into her neck. \"It's fine. I <i>liked</i> it.\" You then slide your arm over to begin rubbing a paw over her flat tummy, brushing at the soft and short fur to have the cat shudder in place against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flashes you an unwilling look as you attack her weakspot, knowing that you know that she loves it. \"You're just being plain cruel now. I take back my apology then!\" The Luxray huffs to try and seem like she hated you for her belly interest, but she quickly escalates into soft purrs of nourishment as she continues to eat her breakfast with you to aid her stomach. The comfortable fur smoothly glides against the pads of your forepaw while it makes it's way around her belly in circular motions. Star would be overwhelmed with that satisfaction for her to limply lay upon you, dining down on the delectable meal with your loving cuddle and massaging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice softly speaks out when she finishes, \"You know Lace...this has been just...absolutely fantastic having this time together...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" You finish for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs as her hands cling to you. \"I...need to figure this out really. I'm not sure about staying with the group more and staying at this Redeemer's place all alone. That, and I need to think some stuff through about Bell's ou-outcome in all of this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou understand exactly what she's feeling and debating about in her head, so you plant another firm and wet kiss to the cat's forehead and answer back, \"Take as much time as you need. I'm happy with whatever decision you make, just remember that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou receive a caring smile from, and are rewarded with a kiss after she closes her eye and leans her head in close. The two of you connect lips together to pucker against one another, suckling at each other's mouths with the Luxray being the first to use a tongue. It shyly slips into your maw, awkwardly swirling from side to side around yours as you happily dance it along with hers. You could feel her face grow hot and her nipples slowly erecting into your chest, so you slide out of the blissful kiss before Star would lose herself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for that, and it's not that I don't like you...I just feel like I don't know what I want, especially with the world we live in now. I don't want to care deeply about you, only to have you taken away from me too.\" She whispers softly, looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her a rub along her side and nod, sliding right back out of bed while taking her empty plate for her. \"Everyone else is ready for the most part, I believe, so we leave when you're up.\" You stop at the bedroom cloth door and glance back at her. \"Thanks for last night, including this morning. They meant a lot to me and made me feel pretty content with life, with no fear or stress of what might happen when I step out of this tent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives you a wink. \"You're welcome Lace. Tonight probably won't be the last time we have a time like this together.\" And with that, you give her some privacy and leave. Your tail was wagging pretty happily, and you wondered how long it had been doing that or if Star noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(To continue the story, please click the link!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1799220-Viral-Pokemon-Vore/map/11531211111111111111111121221111111111111112111111121111112121112111111121111211111111111112111111122111111112111111\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/ite...</a></span></div></div>",

Her hand slithers down your chest and stops at your groin, cupping your sensitive purse into her gentle palm. You breathe in a shuddering inhale of surprise and arousal, wondering if this was a good decision to follow through with. It was obvious that you would be spending a night with a woman, and after the intense experience with Yuli\u2019s attractive upbringing, what else were you to do? Even if you chose not to have sex with Star, she would rape you in your sleep was you got into the same bed with her, plus, you didn\u2019t have a real reason to say \u201cno\u201d to the offer anyways. You smile lightly as the Luxray circles her hand under your ball sac, feeling the fur and loose flesh sit atop the forepaw with pleasuring ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar\u2019s voice moaned out, \u201c\u2026Touch me\u2026\u201d The heat was talking, but you had no intentions of ignoring the desperate demand. Eager, your hand lingers over to her panting chest, scooping a large breast to fit within your hand. You shiver with pleasured nerves as you move the weight around, experimenting with the orb\u2019s structure and luscious thickness in the mere gropes. It was a thrilling sensation surging through your hand and into your body to cause yet another tremble. With haste, your horny forepaws play with the Luxray\u2019s fuzzy tits, jumping them, squeezing them, rubbing over her nipples, and occasionally pressing them together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStar releases mewl after mewl, pushing down against you enough to force the two of you to topple down. You land on your back, ignoring the pain as the weight of Star\u2019s warming body grinds atop of yours. \u201cTake me\u2026\u201d Her breath begs. Your already-hardened cock springs with crazed lunacy. Her crotch rests limply against it, pressing it deeply into each other\u2019s abdomens. Following through, the cat lifts her rear up, but descends it down hard around your cock, stabbing it into her blooming lips. She shoots out a quick claw-dig into your shoulders after purring helplessly, letting the tall member slide deep within her slick love tunnel. Her wet vaginal walls squish against your doghood, riling you to bark and growl through your teeth from Star\u2019s wondrously compacting pussy. Her waist repeatedly slaps down against it, riveting pre-spurt after pre-spurt into her vagina from each rapid bounce. Your head tosses back against the floor, helplessly moaning and stuttering in joyful bliss during the Luxray\u2019s heat. Star bends down, hooking her chin on your shoulder as her hands clench down on your chest, coiling her tail around yours to beat against the ground together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sex-line waters with fluid, washing down over your cock after your knot pops in between the squishing folds. Your jaw struggles to close against your muzzle, being forced to stretch and pulsate out along with most of your body from the overwhelming rush of Star\u2019s horny desires. The mad spur of heat travels throughout both of your bodies as you drill inside her with each hump. You grunt with your fat knot tightly plugged into her pussy, clenching your member with each bounce she topples on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cF-Fill me\u2026Lace\u2026Flood my insides\u2026\u201d She pleads. You didn\u2019t really have a say in the matter because of the packing arousal flowing in your nerves. Cum rumbled in your flopping sac while it lightly smacked the girl\u2019s furry bum during the course of hard sex, rousing it to erupt at any moment. You roll your eyes back, experiencing a traumatic amount of your seed to burst into her vagina, fountaining up through the burning caverns of her nether-lips, forcing Star to powerfully clasp her vaginal walls over the short volcano. Gathering the majority of your orgasm, she lifts up to yank your knot right out to elicit another one of your gasping barks. You cock slides out, shooting out the last remaining strands of cum you had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou loosen and relax a bit, amazed that you survived that entire wild experience. Although, the Luxray grabbed her lower cheeks, spreading them apart before she sits done forcefully over your pleasured cock again. This time, the throbbing rod enters the narrow sphincter of her anus, having to go through the intense feeling of the tight tunnel pucker over the thick rod. You gag out and never expected such a move, now beginning to struggle against this cat\u2019s crazy moment of animosity. However, Star starts working your cock like a motor once more, pumping it deeply into her rectum as her hands latch back onto her breasts for her to finger. Wet spills release out of her leaking pussy, spitting out globs of your cum back onto you throughout her mad thrusts against your plunging member to cease any of your efforts to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted sex with Star, and now you were surely in for a ride of cruelty and abuse for your dick now. The feline\u2019s heat removed all of Star\u2019s common sense, becoming similar to a feral\u2019s interest and use your body as her toy. The last thing you could think of was cumming inside of her rear while she mewls a crying tone of satisfaction before passing out.</span></div></div>",

Rubbing the blurriness in your eyes with your fists and fluttering blinks, your sight returns to Star's bedroom, laying down in the floor still with dried cum stains along the fur of your waist. Your softened cock rages with aches from last night's encounters, but you manage to ignore it somewhat for you to check on the Star and the reason of the strange sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up with a groggy grumble, you tiredly scan the premises for the Luxray, shocked once you actually found her across to the opposite side of the room. The cat was down on her knees with closed eyes, having her arms wrapped firmly around a female Umbreon's backside as the other intruder was leaned in close, making out with Star in audible licks. You are taken back with awe, bewilderment for who this stranger was, but highly arouse at the two females embrace each other. Their hands feel around each other's bodies, clenching fur, and grind their breasts against one another. The Umbreon opens a single, purple eye, noticing that you were finally awake. Tensing up from discovering that it was a feral, presuming that it simply wandered into the hut and luckily found a jackpot meal with Star's sex-driven season of a moment as a willing victim, you try to crawl back in distress as the Umbreon ceased in kissing the Luxray to crawl towards you in a seductive fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her body in full view, you soon and quite unwillingly observe her heavenly figure. Her breasts were the largest pair you have ever seen a female protrude, and her rump blatantly rounded out into voluptuous spheres. Mainly carrying quite a thin figure for everything else, save for the thighs to support such a butt and contains a slightly pudgy gut, it was obvious that this feral's meals had added wonderful contributions to this Umbreon's frame. Star was left sitting on the ground, masturbating violently with her digging fingers as her blushing face watched the Umbreon's underside and furry bum from behind, ignoring the fact that it was infected just to pleasure herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp, unable to think of anything from the tantalizing sight of this woman finally reach you, cupping her hands over your chest to lightly push you back all the way down again. You stammer for words, but all that comes out is a dumb-founded exhale while the Umbreon straddles your entire body below her with her own. Her violet gaze fixates on your worried, yet pleasured, eyes, making you focus on her forepaws rubbing over your figure. You moan softly during her exploration, shifting her body up and down along your frontside to drag her tits and groin over the surface of your fur. Seeing that you're stunned with enticement, the feral slides back, scooping your legs between her underarms to lock them into her sides, bringing her torso to your crotch. Bring her hands back up as your waist was lifted a bit now, she plants your newly-erect cock in between her black breasts, jamming it within the tight crease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yelp out with a terrified grin, preparing for yet another fuck-course as the Umbreon's titjob initiated. She presses the fuzzy orbs together, compacting against your muscled rod to jump with glee as the orbs began encircling around to squeeze the tight flesh. You effortlessly hump away at the compressing pleasure, thrusting against the bouncing breasts to get closer and closer towards the feral's chin. The darker nipples poking out of the Umbreon's torso pucker out madly, slightly beading the sloshing milk hidden inside the large tits jostling about on the Umbreon's chest. Her underside drips with heated pre- clumping her slimy fur as you listen to her growls of domination. Pawsteps echo through the floor to force you to look up from having your head craned back against the ground, seeing Star approach you with the same exact horny expression. She crouched down above you, sitting down on your face to squish your lips at her pussy. You lick over the gooey line, getting a jolt of sensitivity from the cat as she leaned over to the tit-playing Umbreon and pressed her mouth against its own. The two females then proceed with their previous session, deeply kissing and licking each other with moans of luxury in their moment together. You finally hit your peak for a third time, jetting out your dog seed all over the Umbreon's face, roping it with a smaller amount of hot cum to collect onto her. Star begins to lick up the cum for the infected creature, eager to pleasure herself as much as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely enough, her only unconcealed eye began to evolve into a new color, slowly fading into a more lavender color. It seems the Umbreon's saliva she was ingesting was quickly coursing inside her to infect her mind. As if it matters to care anymore. You were already at the work of this Umbreon's toy, and had long ago submitted to its pleasure. Star rains down her orgasm, slathering your face in her love juices that amazingly remained in her body all this time. The Umbreon limply lets your legs slide back to the ground, and nudges back a little. Grabbing your ankles, she raises your hindpaws in front of her mouth-watering jaws, ready to finally fill her belly. You shiver helplessly as the Umbreon's tongue dances over your hindpaws, licking over your soft pads, dabbing around your fur, and nibbles down on the squirming extremities. The feral's mouth works down on your calves, sliding her brushing tongue under them as her salivating maw lubricates it for a comfortable slide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up to your waist, you are treated by how you had expected be treated, forced through sitting through the torture of the Umbreon's tongue toil with your member, ball sac, and anus, jamming and wiggling wherever it could around them to see you writhe in gorging bliss. Star humped at your head, cupping her hands under your chin to thrust at your noggin from behind while growling with more ferocity. After your arms and chest fall deep within the Umbreon's swallowing mouth, the feral looks at you a final time with satisfaction and victory in claiming another meal to digest away and add to her beautiful form. The Luxray releases your head to finger herself, watching it slowly shift into the gaping tunnel consuming you. You whimper out as slimy darkness envelops your vision, dissolving any light away from the fanged frame surrounding your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Umbreon rests on her rump, planting a hand over her now-enlarged black belly, rubbing over the dome's surface to feel the tight skin contracting down on the wiggling dog trapped inside her. The Lucario sobs out in despair and wriggles in defiance at the digesting pool preparing it for the Umbreon's midnight snack course. The feral checks back at the masturbating Luxray, seeing that its only visible eye reflect a similar purple as her growls grow more fearsome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat crawls over next to the Umbreon, pressing a hand over her gurgling belly as it suckles on her nipple. The Umbreon purrs in amusement at the willing slave to suckle its alpha member's breast, drinking more of its infected milk. Maybe it too can become a seductive and all beautiful predator like her. The Lucario passes out within the tightened stomach, beginning to digest nicely into fat for the Umbreon to layer out across her posture. The rest of the tent riles out several stomach gurgles and pleasured moans, signifying that the other wandering ferals who entered the curious tent collected themselves a wonderful treat. Thus ends the quest of a hero who was so close to stopping an apocalypse, only to be seduced like most of the fallen ones who set out to stop the infection.</i></span></div></div>",

You padded your way over to Gold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room, automatically passing it without giving it any thought. Sleeping with Gold was out of the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approach two curtains. One led to Draxius\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 room and the other to Hex\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room. You could hear the muffled speech from Draxius, conversing with Gyro with some topic about tea while Hex was croaking to himself, doing something that sounded like rubbing or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a fickle decision to make, wondering which one to encounter. Draxius seemed nice, but rumor has it that Drowzee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tend to eat pokemon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dreams in their sleep, whatever that meant. Hex seemed like a great choice, but you wondered if he would try to pull anything off in the night. He tended to be a little too flirtatious, yet you found a way to sort of enjoy it. The Toxicroak proved to be a comforting companion, and you saw little objection to ignore a night in the same bed together. Then again, there was something about that Drowzee which caused you to be awfully curious. That lax octave of his voice, his slurred movements, and even his presence caused you to become overwhelmed in sleepy comfort. That chubby body of his distracted your concentration plenty a time. You especially didn't forget the last time you spoke with him, where in fact, he seduced your senses so glowingly that you were eager for the psychic to do it to you again. It was like an orgasm for your brain.</span></div></div>",

Draxius seemed too good of a choice to abandon. The big bellied Drowzee would be a perfect way to find quick way to fall asleep, figuring that he could whisk you away with a quick subconscious spell or something. Hex, on the other hand, would probably take it the wrong way in seeing that you chose him out of everyone to stay with first. You liked Hex tremendously; however, he did appear to be a bit over the top when it came to flirting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the tall curtain, you could see the outlined silhouettes of Draxius and Gyro, discussing over sensual topics that mainly focused on the tea they were apparently drinking. You braced yourself and enter the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two psychics' words were silenced in your sudden appearance, as they stared at you in somewhat of a surprise. You noticed that Draxius and Gyro were resting down on their knees across a small flat table with teacups at hand. Neither of them blinked or said a word, forcing you to speak your reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...in need of a room tonight and I was wondering if...I could possibly rest here unless you have another spare room somewhere else.\" You falteringly ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxius sets his teacup down with a coy grin, answering, \"I wouldn't mind it at all! Yes, yes do come in. Gyro and I were just about to break for the night and take off to bed.\" The large Drowzee rises up onto his feet, showing you to the bedroom. You follow Draxius as he nods over to Gyro, signaling the Hypno to scurry into his own bed for the two of you to be consequently alone. You enter the candlelit vicinity as Draxius closes the curtain doorway, turning around with his tired, yet oddly joyful, expression. Two end tables stood at the end sides of a large, blanketed futon bed that resided within the center-stage of the room, giving off a dark and luminescent texture to the room that almost caused you to pass out in the relaxing sight. A three-fingered hand slowly cupped over your backside, urging you closer to the mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice carried out as usual, \"You would not mind if we shared the bed, do you? It is a tad small being that only I sleep in it...\" His face is within your peripheral vision, and his face looked quite devious as his tone grew more deviously. \"But I can make us fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flash back a smile and a quick nod in response, confused whether you made the right decision or not. You reluctantly release your bag onto the floor while the Drowzee climbed into bed, murring to himself some form of happy song. But once you look over to him, you come to discover that he's removing his robing apparel! The velvety cloth limply glides down around the curves of his shoulders and belly, coming down at his sides as carefully picked it up by his fingertips to discard it off the bed and onto a hook next to it. His lazy glare strikes at your body, catching your blank stare from his slight strip-tease. He smiled, grateful that he caught you in the act for him to pursue his lust longer. He lifted the edge of the blanket up, beckoning you to join him on the futon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou silently gulp as you pad your way closer to the curious psychic. Even your sheath was curious, distressingly urging to poke out your pecker to see what all the hub-bub was about. Plopping your rear against the bed's edge, you slide your legs under the covers, shivering in warm bliss in the comfort the futon blanket shrouded you with. The last time you slept in such a heavenly position was back at Redeemer's Grotto when the Village Chief generously offered a room to stay in. That was by far the greatest sleep you have ever experienced, save for the abrupt infection invasion. Suddenly, a second source of heat snuggled its way to your body, giving off ways of pleasuring heat. It was Draxius' body heat, wavering over around your own form to cloud a warm, cozy setting you could melt in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comfy?\" Draxius question severed your sensual moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very.\" You hesitantly reply. What you really wanted to say was, '<i>Holy shit, yes!</i>' It was difficult to fight your random urges to approach Draxius, finding your nightly wood to naturally grow from the wondrous feeling of the heat. Your cock ignores your silent pleas to keep it hidden and snakes out from its comfortable home. The next physical sensation was an unwilling accident that tipped you over your edge. Your member's head jabbed at a soft wall of flesh, pulsating at the large dome to nudge its underside along the surface of whatever your erection was striding over. Your cock found its way to stab at Draxius' belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, you <i>are</i> <i>very</i> comfy.\" He whispered as his body seemed to drag closer to you. You felt his legs shift over your genitals, gliding them across as your member screamed out in pleasure from the sheer touch of his skin during the Drowzee's advances. You weakly press your arms against Draxius' shoulders, unsure if this was what you really wanted. A part of your mind begged for the male to take you as you were to violently and sexually punish you. The other part remained truly unsure about the sudden embrace. Draxius would force himself over to you anyways, stroking your crotch with his own as he slowly slid under the covers to your doghood. You grunt in sensitive passion as the Drowzee's trunk began to sniff at your jabbing arousal. You tense up and tremble as the cool air vapors over and back around your hardened prick. The trunk's circular tip pokes and investigates your cock deeply, finding each and every twitch of your body more reason to go deeper in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-D-Draxius...p-please stop...I...\" You struggle to speak out. Your hands dig down under the blanket to plant themselves over the Drowzee's cranium, performing a horrible job in preventing the psychic to suck your musk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You what?\" He asked in a defiant manner. \"You wish for me to try harder?\" Before you could protest, his trunk suddenly wraps around your cock and strokes along your length. The trunk helps to masturbate for you, forcing Draxius to breathe out of his mouth in a happy moan, which in turn, blew over your furry sac. You groan loudly from the odd job the Drowzee was forcing upon you, tightening around at the large pole of meat to elicit pre glistening from your urethra. \"Dear me, you are quite the horny one. Are you sure that you needed a new room, or was that just an excuse for you to spend the night with me? Tell me as you're being pleasured, are you fantasizing about me? I could find out for myself, but where would all the entertainment be in that? I want you to confess. Tell me the sick and filthy desires you lust for. I can make them real for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only growl in response as your hands clench his head while your legs wrap and cross over his back, hugging him tightly and giving soft humps into his tight trunk. You felt an urge for him to completely dominate you, yet there was the other sensual end for you to pleasure him instead. Either way, you whore yourself out, and either way this night would end with Draxius on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou softly cry out...</span></div></div>",

I w-want your body.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You weakly cry out through each gaping breath of pleasure. The chubby Drowzee ceased his trunk motions for a mere moment, surprised at your sudden, yet embraceful confession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled in return, licking his tongue over your sac as a delightful reward. You groan aloud with each lick that dragged your furry scrotum up with the long muscle to flop back down for another go. The trunk begin to twirl softly in small circles, enraging your cock for a massive appeal of pleasure. His voice reverberated under the covers, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy body, hm? Well, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect you liked it that much, however, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not one to argue with that fact. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve caught your eye lusting for my round physique. Who knew that you were one to be such a, hee hee, <i>chubby chaser</i>!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour blushed face had no ability to grow brighter than it already had. There was such a physical attraction in which you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand for such an alluring fat creature, yet you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stay away. Whatever creepy fetish you had right now fixated you into a long night for Draxius to pleasure your groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter delivering a final amount of licks to your ball sac, Draxius retracted back and crawls out from under the blanket. You felt his pudgy body climb over you, rubbing his slight girth over your furry sweating body to compel more murrs of kinks to roam out of your mouth. His face floated above yours, staring passionately through your pupils as your breaths mixed together into a cloud of sexual steam. He lifted his trunk, encompassing his lips to smother yours to intertwine a binding kiss of love you had never felt before. His tongue burrows itself into your muzzle, dancing with your own as his saliva seeped out around it all. Your mouth fluids mixed in the loud squelching sounds of your make-out, dripping the thick drool to accidentally slip out from your jaws and down under your chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you close your eyes to savor the feeling of your mouths connecting; murring and groaning loudly that others may possibly hear you. His fleshy form rubs over your fuzzy type, pouring its heat to coat over it all. Your hands slide down and travel Draxius\u00e2\u0080\u0099 wide curves. From past his shoulders, your padded palms attach themselves around his plushy breasts, experimenting around with the flabs. The Drowzee answers with stimulated groans, humming through his long kiss during your intrigued hands' groping test. You lower down and stroke his spherical belly, skipping past over the jagged line separating the yellow and brown skin to descend all the way to his groin. Your fingers tease his sheath, which in turn, emitted trembles to quake Draxius\u00e2\u0080\u0099 body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mouth finally had to pull away as his knee nudged your waist-rubbing hand off. The Drowzee licked his lips of your saliva as he cupped a hand around one of your tall ears, scratching it slowly as he mocked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDear me, you are quite the cuddler. I must say, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re quite flattering, Lace. You have caught my arousal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m positive you have a rougher side to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolled off of you, sending the cold tent air to prick at your skin with a sudden release of heat. You were overcome with a bit of disappointment that you lost your snuggly pudge to wallow in, however Draxius had something better planned. On his hands and knees, he presents his rump up high for you to devour your sight into. You vision binges down on the meaty bum it so highly craved for; the plump brown cheeks and the pulsating dark pucker that clenched tightly together taunted you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just sit there like a dumbfounded statue! My posterior is getting cold and dry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Drowzee teased you. You quickly crawl over to your bedmate, wincing as your saliva covered sac swung between your traveling legs. Atop the bed, you nuzzle your mouth in between his ass cheeks, nudging closely for a cozy warm stop. The round globes grip your muzzle tightly, urging you to take in the psychic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s undermusk. Your nostrils are flooded in his scent, igniting your animalistic needs. Your tongue penetrates the small hole and digs into his rectum. You place your hands over his ass to massage the obese orbs, kneading through the pudge as your tongue violates his anal tunnel with spurting drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxius groans louder this time, clenching his hands into the bed sheets as he sarcastically begged, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAgh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6be gentle\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Afterwards, the Drowzee bites his pillow, nourishing the defiling motions of his ass. You tug your mouth muscle back out and dab a finger into his anus. You swirl your saliva over the rim of the pucker for needed lubrication for you next move, while of course, forced Draxius to cry odd high pitched sounds. You crawl farther up and onto his backside. Spit stains and bite marks plot all over Draxius\u00e2\u0080\u0099 pillow, while the fat psychic looks back at you with weaker eyes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTake the body you want so desperately.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou happily complied and stab your rod deep into the slickened rectum you had just marinated. The Drowzee yelps once as his anus numbs up to fit the fat knotted pole. You growl once you begin what you had fantasized for so long. Your cock pummeled his fat rear, shoveling deeper each moment your fuck-attacks enforce into the swollen anus. Your body hugs Draxius powerfully, doggy humping the pokemon to shake the entire bed to rock back and forth. Your heated pores swelter with sweat to mix together as a salty taste stings your tongue. Your fangs clench together as your legs rub up The Drowzee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, feeling him willingly bounce with each of your hard pounds while your mouth drools over his backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour balls tighten, already at the extent of their arousal by just a few minutes of butt ravaging your icon for lust. You howl out as white slime spurts out from your cock. The flood pools into the musky crevices to seep into his stomach. You felt the shaking trembles of Draxius\u00e2\u0080\u0099 body as the cum funneled within his lower end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnplugging your knot, your throbbing member retreats from the comfort of the Drowzee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hole, letting you have time to hug Draxius even further. You lower your head down and press your muzzle back into his ass. You cleanse the sweating crack of your own seed, licking up the thick hot substance to swallow down with a tingling enticement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPecking a kiss onto the chocolate brown spot, you fall back in exhaustion, hyperventilating madly as Draxius attempted to recollect his senses. He makes his heavy and sweaty form over to you above the dampened sheets. He rests his fat wet rear over your chest, spilling his belly out in front of you as you struggle to breathe by the new weight. His brown cock pumps with his heartbeat, leaking pre onto your neck. Without a word, a small yellow hand strokes along the Drowzee cock, squirting out the clear slime onto your lips. Draxius grunts and fidgets atop you, masturbating violently to satisfy his own penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, jets of pale goo shoot out, hitting your face and open mouth to string and bridge over your fur. You moan woefully under the stress of satisfaction, finding it hard to remain conscious. Draxius\u00e2\u0080\u0099 orgasm ends, letting the Drowzee slide back and lay fully down above you. The two of you hug each other deeply, never speaking a word from every deep exhale you release. Your seed coated mouth nestles up to the Drowzee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, opening around it for the two of you to enter another round of sensational kissing. Your tongues tie together, barely moving during the time you could have together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxius retraced away from you, wavering his three-fingered hand in front of your fainting eyes. His soothing lazy sound echoed in your ear tunnels, \u00e2\u0080\u009c<i>Sleep, my love. We will spend time together again, but for now, sleep\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</i>\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou happily obliged, finding it hard to even stay awake. Your eyes close, and the sound of your breathe fades away.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Stirring back into consciousness, your mind revives to the sound of faint, but obvious, wet slurping. A pleasurable sensation was comfortably exciting your body that even with closed eyes, you are smiling once you awaken. Tiredly and curiously peeking an eye open, you discover last night's bedmate underneath the blankets some with his mouth suckling your morning wood, loudly licking over it and murring to his sweet joy. You feel a forceful groan escape out of your mouth that causes Draxius to open his own eyes to see you finally awake and present for his blowjob. Grinning maliciously, the Drowzee swallows around your pre-oozing cock to elicit another moan of arousal out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding his wet lips off your bathed member, he gives it another generous and heavy lick before cooing, \"Good morning. How was your rest last night, my little pooch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder at his relaxing voice and tease, having your drenched rod bob in his saliva. \"<i>Mmnghh</i>...extremely well. After all, you exhausted me more in our time in bed than the energy it took to fight ferals and travel back here to your home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Drowzee lightly squeezes your cock with his hand, guiding it up and down the lubricated pole to have you trembling in bed. He soothly laughs with a closed mouth and comments, \"Hm hm hm. Well, as you know, we Drowzees specialize in tiring Pokemon out. Although I tend to use <i>different</i> and more pleasurable methods than others.\" His 'thumb' on his three-digited hand press at the summit of your cock, squishing down on the head to bead out more pre from its tip, using the finger to slide back and forth over the slit of your urethra just to see your reaction. Struggling to keep willpower and train of thought, he continues, \"So did you have any dreams last night that you can remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not that I can think of...Hey wait a minute! What do you mean 'that I can remember', huh?\" You ask in a worried tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxius laughs as he stroke you off, \"Oh ho ho, do not worry poochie. I was just making sure that I didn't miss any of them.\" After the strange comment, he removes his hand to lick each of his fingers, making you wonder if he was just doing that to clean the pre off them, or if it was a gesture of having 'eaten' your dreams. You knew Drowzees were known as <i>Dream Eaters</i>, but you didn't know how that would even work. Thinking about it only makes you shiver more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxius lowers himself back down, stuffing your wet meat back into his mouth as he softly and carefully nibbles on your penis, suckling it deep into his squelching jaws. Your grip the bedsheets and cram the back of your head powerfully into your pillow, gritting your teeth together as you wish to bark out in ecstasy. The way the Drowzee rings his tongue around your cock, how his cheeks work in a parallel motion around its sides, and how much he was able to wash it with drool, it wouldn't be long until he milks you dry. You wonder how he got all of this experience, yet it didn't take long to figure it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, your excitement would soon end as you hear a voice interrupt the slurping sounds of Draxius' oral work. A familiar Typhlosion's voice calls out, \"U-Uh...Dr-Draxius? <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">C'mon Jackal, you have nothing to be worried about</font>. I was looking for where Lace is. I can't find him anywhere that he had stayed in the tent and was making sure you had h-...ha-....haaad....\" Before the end of that sentence, Jackal had entered the room, only to solve the mystery of where you were in a way that he never expected. The Typhlosion's cheeks flare a beaming red, as do yours, as the two of you have the most awkward of silent stares either you would ever encounter. Jackal comes to find you with ears folded behind your head in Draxius' bed with the Drowzee slurping away at your knotted cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe psychic raises his head up, licking over his lips from your taste before coyly cheering, \"Ah, Jackal. So thoughtful of you to join us!\" He gives his large, brown rear a firm spank towards the Typhlosion. \"Do not be shy now, come! I could use a delightful, harsh ramming inside my rectum, and I'm positive your length and rage can satisfy my anus' craving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal was too shocked to even understand that it was a joke, and he merely skids back slowly out of the room with distraught eyes, feeling his heart practically explode within his chest after the disastrous revelation he just witnessed. Draxius laughs to himself actually loudly for once, holding a hand against his chest with his belly bouncing some from the body convulses of his amused laughter. It actually rubs up against your cock which doesn't help you in your humiliating moment. Your feel like crawling into a dark corner, shriveling up and dying there. The Drowzee cools off from his humorous laughing, glancing back to see you terribly embarrassed now. Draxius rubs a hand over your shoulder to comfort you, \"Oh Lace, you shan't need to worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't believe him for a second; you only manage to reply with, \"Ah....ah....he...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxius leans in close, smiling at you, \"Now now, poochie. I'm a powerful psychic as you seem to have forgotten. I knew he was going to come inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you didn't stop him...?!\" You retort back with some irritation and glowing cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxius chuckles again, reassuring, \"...Even if I was not born a psychic, it should be obvious to the naked and dim-witted eye anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wince in confusion, \"...What was obvious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly feel the pudgy Drowzee hug up into your body warmly, sliding his hands over your fuzzy chest and arms with his leg brushing past your still-aroused penis. He whispers into your curious ear, \"<i>He liked what he saw</i>~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears retreat once again, and fold back. You couldn't believe it, but a part of you wanted it to be true. \"Wh-what? N-n-no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do not trust me? You doubt my abilities? I can still read body language and emotions, my silly pup. Psychic abilities were not needed to see that eager Typhlosion's face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shiver with arousal and interest. \"What...what did you see in him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxius closes his mouth close to yours, licking softly and hungrily over your lips. The Drowzee clings onto you, still whispering. \"...<i>Jealousy</i>.\" He plants his mouth to yours, making you connect into him with surprise from his answer while his tongue hugs around yours. You feel like Draxius was marking something here; you feel like he owns you now. That thought almost makes you melt on the spot as you return the favor by making out with him as an answer. The Drowzee pulls back, \"Of course he would feel that way. Infected creatures are not the only beings out there that crave for your body, Lace.\" His hand circles its palm over the side of your neck, and he looks into your eyes proudly, \"...And I get the honor of having you for awhile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush with flattered passion now, rather than humiliation. You glide your hands around Draxius' smooth backside, unsure of how to respond. \"Draxius...I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe psychic chuckles as he slides off of you and the bed, walking towards the room's exit. \"I will gather you up some breakfast in bed. Now be a good pooch and stay there.\" He gives you a wink before walking out of the room, purposely strutting in a way that makes his rear show off side-to-side in just another way to tease you. You're surprised that Draxius made such a comment about you, thinking that he really only wanted sex out of you. It almost felt like hearts were bubbling out of you adorably.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were left with your still aroused cock to wince in impatience, having no Drowzee around to treat it. You glance around the calming candlelit room some, finding a mystical relaxing vibe to it. The aroma of the burning scented wax with the soft glow of orange made the area, almost romantic actually. You wish you had more time to sleep. In fact, you wish you had more to time to cuddle up into Draxius.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReminded of him, you actually daydream of him hugging you affectionately, pecking several kisses to your face as you giggle childishly. He would call you his pooch again and again, rolling with you in the covers to rub each other together. You then picture him stroking away at your cock again, squishing it into his hand with his lax eyes glaring at you mischievously as he faps you off. You feel a bit embarrassed that you were already thinking of that, but your morning wood was still at an all time high of throbbing. Feeling that shameful humiliation finding its way back into you, you sheepishly reach down and tug at our cock some more, masturbating as you picture several images of Draxius playing with you. You're on your knees with a dog collar on as he tugs it with his leash, \"Now now, pooch. It's time for your milk.\" Your mouth would press into his large, brown member by each yank of your leash, and you feel obligated to suck around his cock for your cum-delivery. Another situation with you down on the ground as your legs are held at his sides. At that point, the Drowzee holds you like a wheelbarrow and rams his cock deep into your fluffy, plump rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in reality, you groan in slight whines as you imagine all of the ways Draxius can use you. Its only when you feel a strange presence that your eyes open to spot Draxius there in the flesh, smiling at you as you take care of your business. You eep and stop, having pre spit out of your cock as the Drowzee chimes in with a snicker. In his hands are a tray with a plate of small pastries and a tea set, however, he sets that down on an end table next to the bed while chuckling out, \"I see that breakfast can wait. I have no other choice but to satisfy a different craving of yours first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush for another unwelcomed time once the Drowzee climbs back into bed with you. Resting his hands on your shoulders with his body lifted up, the Drowzee towers over you for once, even though he was a little shorter than you. Wetting his lips, he asks quietly, \"So what were you thinking of that made you so hot with arousal, poochie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are ready to make a comment about his mind-reading capabilities, but you also realize that he knows that already. He simply wanted to hear what you desired. Gulping heavily, you whimper out, \"Y-y-y....<i>you</i>....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxius licks his broad tongue under your chin affectionately. \"Want me to wheelbarrow-fuck you then?\" You gasp and tense up violently under him. He can't just read your thoughts, he can <i>see</i> them. The psychic laughs as he grinds his round belly over your member, squishing it against your groin to spurt out several globs of pre while he coos pleasantly. \"Silly, silly poochie. If only we had more time together, I could satisfy you with every fantasy that you could imagine. I could keep you here and make everyday a new adventure, forcing you to orgasm again and again until everything has been squeezed out. Then I'd treat you with Gyro's cooking, tell you how much you matter to me, I can massage you, teach you some valuable zen tricks, help you fall asleep every night, manipulate your dreams to contain anything you want them to, and I can even devour you in them, or have you devour me without suffering any of the consequences. Just you and I, together for a perfect life for just us together. Would you like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are completely left speechless. You couldn't find anything more lovely in this world then to have that kind of life with Draxius. His belly rubbing up and down against your cock wasn't helping either, tempting and corrupting your thought to actually want that. You want it. <i>Now</i>. You pound your rod against his belly, grunting out as you hump away at the taut gut for Draxius' amusement. He sneers, \"Oh? You can also attend to giving my belly some attention too if you would like. I figure that if you enjoy my body any, then it would have to be because of my heavier physique. Go ahead, thrust away my pooch if you really need to jizz that badly. Hee hee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gladly accept the offer, driving the cock hard against his blubber. His belly rounded out so perfectly that there weren't even rolls and flabs; just a single, round and curvy dome. You feel as if your hands are about to tear the bedsheets in their vice grip while you struggle to contain your animalistic behavior to orgasm this much. At last, you whine out loudly, spewing out your jizz to glob out and slather Draxius' stomach, making a large mess on him. Your cock spurts rope after rope of hot cum onto his gut as it sticks and slightly seeps over them globe of flesh. Draxius leans back, smearing his hands over his newly slick belly in a seductive manner as he gently rubs himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm...good doggy. Feel better?\" He asks with delightful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pant heavily as your cock empties out onto his stomach, struggling out, \"Y-Yes...yes I do...hahhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Drowzee chuckles at you again, sliding up over your body more on his knees to where he was resting down on your chest, presenting that adorable belly of his directly in front of your face. \"Go on now, give it a little kiss~\" The great and powerful Draxius instructs. You eagerly oblige and press your lips to his warm belly, smooching around it with several kisses before losing yourself to give hungry licks to it. Your tongue smears around, licking up the cream you spewed onto it to swallow down, also getting a taste of his gut. Draxius murrs pleasantly, sated with you happily there to serve him. Your own stomach growls for food though by the act however, causing the Drowzee on top of you to slide off the bed and present your breakfast to you. \"I almost forgot that I came here to feed you. Now eat up! We want you full and energized for your next trek.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give him a warm smile, finally gaining your senses back after the orgasm to admire the food there. Taking a tea cup into your hand, you wash the taste of your surprisingly sweet semen with the warm liquid, making your mouth change into the taste of an herbal soup now. The hot drink is swallowed down to your delight to warm your flat belly, reminding you to actually scarf down the edible food. You bite into one of the pastries, tasting the berry jelly inside it tingle at your tastebuds. Gyro and Draxius should really open their own bakery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to say through your full and joyful mouth, \"These are really amazing. My compliments to Gyro.\" You continue to eat and drink with leisure as Draxius simply watches you with a smile stretching across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let him know he has a new favorite consumer to cater to. I'm sure he'll blush when I notify him about how much you're enjoying yourself here.\" The Drowzee lazily coos. It made you a tad surprised to hear that from Draxius since the Hypno has never shown any form of emotion to you. You quickly finish your breakfast afterwards, unaware of how hungry you really were. Draxius takes your tray away after pecking a small kiss to your cheek. \"When I was out there fixing your meal, I noticed that the others were already up and eating. I suppose it's time for you to go then...No need for you to dilly-dally here when there's a world out there that needs you.\" You could hear the false amusement in his sentence, and you yourself didn't feel like leaving just so soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping out of the covers, you finally exit the bed and stand before the chubby psychic, \"Draxius, I...\" You trail away in silence as you see the Drowzee simply looking at the tray, quiet as well. You wrap your arms around him, embracing his body as you find the courage and words, \"...After this is over, I wouldn't mind coming back and seeing you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxius hums with bliss as you hug him, pressing his head over your shoulder. \"Yes, I would not mind that either. I am surprised at myself that I even ask this, but if there is a particular mate out there for you that you are, well, interested in rather than me, I will not hold it against you if...if...\" The tray was rattling from his hands shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou press your forehead to his, looking directly into his eyes. \"I doubt that there's anyone out there that can outmatch you, but even if I do, that won't stop me from seeing you again. And when I do return, promise me that you'll have another tray of food like this hot and ready for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxius' eyes were growing a bit more red and faint, in fact, almost teary eyed. \"Y-Yes...of course I will.\" You smile and open your mouth, kissing the Drowzee's yellow lips before patting him on the head and grabbing your bag. Behind you, the Drowzee regains his coy nature and posture, smiling. \"And a warm bed with me will be waiting for you as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remark causes you to grin as you make your way outside to the main tent room with everyone inside.</span></div></div>",

Spending you time within the psychic's home made you reflect on how peaceful and wonderful life had been before this crisis, back when you could look forward to the next day instead of worrying if you would make it to that point. You stretch your legs out some in preparation for the long walk ahead, along with any battles that may come your way on the travel there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxius, Gyro, and even Yuli stand outside at the entrance of the home, saying their goodbye and 'good lucks' to you and everyone else. You would have offered for the psychic's to tag along, but their abilities may have been useless against this master villain hiding out there in the darkened heights of the mountains. You had already talked it out with the male you actually slept with last night before departing with the rest of the group, confirming that you should just keep it to yourself and focus on the task at hand right now, but you knew you would be together with him soon enough. As you finally depart, your team heads out into the directions of the mountains in the distance, but not to fight the psychic just yet. You still needed to swing by Redeemer's Grotto to tell them the revelations you discovered about the infection, along with the hopes of gaining some of the city's troops so you wouldn't be outmatched by the psychic. You glance over to Star remembering that the original plan was to drop her safely off there as well, but you hoped she would change her mind about it. The Luxray had already proven to be a valuable asset, plus you've grown to enjoy her company along the trip. Perhaps through time she could feel better and bond with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You remain ahead most of the group, silently looking forward the whole way through passing the dense forest and following a dirt path that supposedly lead to a village according to Draxius. However, he didn't know if it was abandoned or safe there anymore. Either way, you still planned on setting that as a good checkpoint to head to. But as you were calmly walking, a familiar heat approached you from behind as Jackal walks a bit faster to catch up to your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire type didn't say anything at first, or even glance at you for that matter. His eyes keep a firm aim around at the forested environment looking out for ferals, but mainly just to pass the time trying to find the right words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou speak first, \"Hey.\" The last time you saw the Typhlosion was him entering the bedroom seeing you in not exactly the most wanted time of your privacy with another man. You wonder if it affected anything about your friendship with him, but seeing as he wanted to obviously talk with you, it was a good sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" He responds, but avoids his eyes away still. You glance down at his gut to see that it had worked nicely on the Ninetales feral he had devoured yesterday, the same stomach he became so enraged over last night of when he forced you out mid-rub. Jackal awkwardly paused for a moment before continuing, \"...I'm sorry, uh, about you know. Last night, and...stuff...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then rubs at the back of his head, scratching it some as you reply with a smile, \"Don't worry about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal's face burned a bit red as his voice got quieter. \"Thanks...so like, we're still buds, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" You keep your answers short and simple, waiting for the real questions the Typhlosion wanted to ask you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe in fact did so, mustering the courage to say, \"Soooo...you're into dudes and stuff, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grin and flash a look at him, \"I have a preference aimed closer at some guys, yeah. Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! U-Uh. Well well well...uh...it's just. <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Fuck, what do I say?</font> It's cool.\" He stutters and frantically panics of what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...cool?\" You mockingly retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour friend's cheeks flare even more red as his struggles for words become humorously more difficult. \"W-Well, uh, it's just that I didn't know that a-about you and it's fine if you are.\" The poor Typhlosion's voice was shaking and you almost thought he was beginning to sweat for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pat a hand against his back, rubbing it some before returning it to  your side, \"Don't worry about it. I'm still the same guy you met at Jade Gorge.\" Jackal calms down some he keeps a tight grip around the satchel of his bag. Peering back at the others behind you to see if they were listening in, you spot Eden and Gold loudly arguing with each other about something to do with the clouds. You swear they could rant against each other about anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would some <i>flat-chested</i> plant know about the weather, huh? It isn't going to rain anytime soon.\" The Golduck quacks out with confidence and anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Roserade quickly gives Gold's cheek a firm smack with one of her vine whips, huffing back, \"Excuse me? I can tell by the moisture in the air! Plants thrive based on what's in nature, and how dare you think some 'chest size' has anything to do with it! How would a useless piece of scum like you understand anything about rainclouds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Golduck rubs the red mark left on his face with a shut eye, growling back, \"I'm a water-type if I need to remind you, you pesky little weed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFarther back was Star and Hex quietly walking with each other as the frog explains past times before he lived in the swamp and how he came to learn different natural ingredients could cure different illnesses. The Luxray calmly listened with her tail even wagging some behind, keeping her eyes glued to the Toxicroak while he dramatically used body language and fancy descriptions for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head away and change the subject before anything became too awkward with Jackal by saying, \"So how'd you sleep? Did the feral give you any trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal scoffs, \"Please, that bitch gave up its fight as soon as is was guzzled down and trapped. Heh, I'm pretty sure I'm getting stronger with every feral I beat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And <i>tubbier</i>.\" You joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Typhlosion looks down at his soft belly, pinching at the slight pudge there, \"You think so?\" You didn't know if he was insulted or complemented by the comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, but it's cute in a way. You seem to really like belly rubs, and so does Star. You should ask her for some.\" You chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal's face ignites again, along with the flames on his mane just a bit. He peeks over at the Luxray, having his voice almost stutter, \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured from how I woke up in the nursery that one time and I found her hands on me like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal grunts, \"H-Hey, now wait a minute, don't go try flirting with me or anything!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour smile stretches out long on your muzzle, \"Oh I wouldn't dream of it Jackal. In no way do I find you attractive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Typhlosion sighs out, \"Oh, whew, that's a relie- Hey, what do you mean by that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snicker and continue walking along the path, avoiding in giving a straight answer to Jackal. Maybe you were serious. Maybe you were kidding. Who really knows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the most part, the trek was beginning to look nice and easy for your group. The only time you met confrontations with ferals was just one at a time, and with a whole group of companions to fend them off, ferals seem to pose little of a threat. They either ran away from being outnumbered, or were quickly beaten unconscious from the group. Although, as much as Jackal or Gold wanted to eat their defeated prey, it would only slow the group down so they merely left the knocked out ferals on the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were proud to make it through most of the forest with plenty of the day left, arriving at...</span></div></div>",

The surface ripples with the soft, yet cold winds and reflects the team standing near its coast. Although, there wasn't much else to see with the steam everywhere. Which was strange since the water itself looked cool enough and the weather seemed too nice today. Your curiosity is sated though once you hear a sudden loud hiss shake the earth some. Just then, a pit in the ground shoots out with natural water and steam. Glancing around, you see similar other holes in the ground, all fuming with the same kind of steam. Your group discovers they've walked upon geysers around the lake. You look up to the sky to check the distance of the sun's travel ever since you left the tent, and you still had plenty of time to get to the mountains from this point. As long as everyone avoided stepping into any pits in the dirt, things could go easy for all of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex behind you takes in a nice inhale of fresh air before happily sighing out in relief, while Gold walks on down to step into the water some to wet his legs. You call over to the duck, \"Hey now, be careful. We don't know if ferals are in the water or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Golduck rolls his eyes, enjoying the cool water but remains to stick to the shore as he and the rest of the group walk around the lake. \"Don't worry about it. I'll take care of any of em'. Besides, do you see how calm these waters are? There's no way any Pokemon are down there especially with these geysers to scare em' off, so just leave it to us expert water-types.\" He closes his eyes and crosses his arms behind his head, not caring for another word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just have to take his word for it and continue on with traveling. The mist did provide more of a security to you rather than a threat with its beautiful texture and occasional creation of a foggy rainbow to appear in the sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll seemed well until a cannon of water shoots out in front of you to wash you and the others back! You gasp only to receive a mouthful of the liquid as you're sent splashing away closer to the coast of the water to instantly get grabbed by a pair of hands. You cough out some the water and endeavor to free yourself from the captivating hands. Growling, you notice several purple dots shine from the blanketing mist of the environment, and out from stalked several water-type pokemon who thrive at the lake. The ferals had actually planned an ambush for any travelers to this lake, knowing prey wouldn't just dive into the pond. They were actually learning and able predators. You then feel a fat tongue drag along the back of your neck, making the saliva-glazed fur there prickle and to make your muscles suddenly tense up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a powerful lash of your head flinging backwards, you headbutt the infected grappling you from behind to the scutter away with your skull pounding some, but at least you weren't in the hands of that hungry rapist. You swing around to find an infected Marshtomp growling at you and pouncing outward. Luckily you jab a fist into its stomach as it goes flying back for you to knock back far into the lake, allowing you time to check back on your companions. Star and Eden were fending the ferals off well for their type differences to the lake Pokemon, and Gold was sustaining most of the water attacks fluently. It was only Jackal and Hex who were having the most trouble, with the Toxicroak being attacked by a Huntail naga with the eel struggling to get its coils around the frog, while as for Jackal, the Typhlosion was breathing heavily and soaked with water to weaken him squaring off against a chubby Floatzel. From the looks of it, you didn't know who needed more help, but you decide to go aid...</span></div></div>",

As you bolt away from the coast to let Hex and Star manage on their own for now, you head towards the Typhlosion and infected Floatzel duking it out with both fire and water to see Jackal being bombarded with a crashing jet of water to force him against a tree. You rush with aura burning around your whole body as you body-slam all of your possible weight on the slightly larger Floatzel, forcing it to the ground howling after your charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkidding to a stop, you check back on Jackal struggling to force his body off from the tree, only to fall down face first on the ground, panting and drenched with water. With the Typhlosion down for now, it was all up to you to take this feral on. As the infected Floatzel finally recovers from your previous attack, you size your opponent up to note that it was a bit taller than you, and definitely outmatched you in weight with wide hips, a large belly, and thick thighs once it stood upright again. The weasel growls some as its tongue licks along its chops, more than completely content now with claiming you as its meal instead now. You gulp and get your aura ready again into your palms to do whatever it costed to keep you and your team alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feral barks and suddenly blasts itself at you like a giant dart with jets of water skidding behind it. You barely manage to have enough time to roll out of its way as your coated with the water splashing at it sides. Soaked and on the ground, you get back up in time just for the weasel to collide into you, sending you far back against the ground skidding until crashing harshfully. You yelp out once you reach impact and fall back to the dirt floor, groggily shaken while your head and backside ache with pain. Using your wobbling arms to push you slightly back up, you spot the Floatzel coming back around in another sharp u-turn again. Scowling viciously at the weasel as it returns for another attack, you return your focus with aura to form a burning sphere its power into both of your hands. The orb glows a bright and menacing blue, plus once the weasel sees the impending trouble ahead, it quickly tries to swerve out of the way. But seeing in which direction it was headed, you blast the aura sphere out to send dirt flying around you as it cannons across the field to strike the Floatzel and explodes. The soot-covered body of the weasel is sent tumbling over in a trail of smoke into the lake water to sink down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching your victory against that feral, you check back on Jackal who managed to at least get onto his knees, giving you a thumbs-up as he tiredly pants. You grin and look back over to Hex, only to then lose that grin after you spot the Toxicroak having been coiled up by the Huntail naga and trapped. The infected Huntail has its hands around the frog's head, pumping it back and forth with its cock inside Hex's mouth to slide the meat back and forth over his tongue. The frog muffledly groans as his corrupted mind was overwhelmed with both fear and arousal that he was actually suckling and licking at the member some. Knowing that there was still time to save Hex, you dash over to him down the same thing you had done to the Floatzel earlier and surge energy once more into your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou call out, \"Hex, stop! I'm co-\" Although, you are cut off once an eruption of water shoots out from the lake and smashes down against your body. You are taken back by the massive wave and forced against the ground in the mad torrent. Gagging and coughing out the lake water, you struggle to look back to see two glowing purple dots within the rippling surface of the water to witness the weasel emerging with a toothy grin along it muzzle, making its way back to the coast in a menacing stride. Maybe launching that water-type into the lake wasn't such a great idea as you thought. Crawling back in an attempt to get back up, you are instantly knocked back down with another wall of rapid water jets from the Floatzel as it makes its way past the Huntail humping its almost willing frog victim's mouth to approach your downed form. You writhe in the muddle of water on the ground, coughing out some and preparing to charge whatever aura you can in your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, it would all be too late once the Floatzel stops to stand in front of you as that tongue its smacks at its chops again to strike an amount of fear in you, and it was working. Before you can unleash an aura kick at your foe, the chubby weasel actually turns around to surprise you. You actually only discover what the feral is doing after you see it beginning to teeter over backwards with its large rump looming closer to you, which truly spikes your fear factor at this point as you gasp from the sight. The Floatzel falls to the ground on his ass with a wet splat while your face is shover against the crease of it. The orange fuzzy orbs clench around your head as the infected weasel grinds his rump back and forth atop your body, murring and drooling from his maw as your muzzle is forced to nuzzle up against its warm anus. Your entire body writhes underneath the chubby Floatzel, gripping your hands at its thighs to try and push away, your legs kick on the ground aimlessly, and your tail beats down against the wet dirt and puddles. Yet the heavy weight of the weasel keeps you pinned underneath it for it to relishing in the moment for grinding its chubby rear down around your face. The fuzzy cheeks cling onto your head as its anus welcomes your muzzle inside with a mere tug, beginning to slide your body into your eternal fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes flash open, your heart shudders within your rib cage, and your fur tingles in a mad terrain of prickling spikes. This was it. You were beaten, and now you're going to end up losing just to a normal feral and not even getting the chance of fighting the psychic and dying a hero. Perhaps Jackal could recover and save you? Maybe your aura could finally get a jumpstart and save you? You beg for anything to happen, just not this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, the infected Floatzel bites its bottom lip with laxed eyes and a murring throat rumbling in its wonderful moment. You provide as a wonderful dildo for the animal, constantly trying to shift back, only to get sucked back in; things seem to only turn worse for you with each passing moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fleshy anal walls cling onto your upper body as their soft and flexible texture aids the infected in dragging you along quite quickly with each draw of its butt cheeks. Your head is completely crammed into the powerful rectum suckling at your body, with your chest making its way though with arms pinned at the sides to be nothing more than a weasel's ass food. Heart racing and sweat beading out your body, you can only feel the humiliating shame of your loss once your own rear is slid into the anus to follow with you, but not before the Floatzel gives it a spank with one of its tails to elicit a short yelp from your mouth. With most of your wet and furry body inside already, the Floatzel teeters over forward this time to lay on its chest and knees, groping its ass cheeks apart for your legs to slowly descend inside the toasty pucker twitching the whole way down. A steamy exhale escapes the weasel's maw and its anus winces with tightening grapples as your throbbing hindpaws find their way inside to completely encase you within the animal's body now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only communicate through startled and exhausted gasps of air as your body is stuffed up inside your predator's stomach with slimy walls contracting around you to fit you into a nice, stable pose to create comfort for the infected water-type with it laying atop its fat gut to rub and roll against. The fleshy surroundings ripple like tight rubber soaked with saliva and stomach fluids that's pooling into the chamber around your defeated form. Making any movements just emit a juicy sounds and tightens the walls to refrain any way of escape. You can only lay in wait as you're forced to listen to every squelching gurgle and panting as well, but rather in pleasure and heat, acting like a cruel taunt towards you including your failed mission. Trying to think back on your companions outside, you can only hope they could still save you from your doom. The faint optimism is short lived as you finally pass out inside the gut beginning to heat up and stew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The orange bandana'd Typhlosion yelps again and again in a round of grueling torture with an infected Floatzel mounted behind him. Its round stomach weighs him down as it sloshes on his backside, having the weasel's cock hammer its way into the fire-type's rear. The Typhlosion's asshole is already swollen and numb from what seemed like an hour of vigorous sex with sweat dripping from his body and bruises darken his butt cheeks. The infected had already creamed inside his ass twice already, but simply wouldn't release him to be infected just yet with the excitement of his Lucario companion probably dead and belly fat now. And yet, a thick boner throbs under the fire-type as he humps the grass flooring with the over-pent arousal of being used like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, a Toxicroak with purple eyes that had recently been infected had pounced and pinned a Golduck to the bird's backside. The amphibious duck squirms and quacks in distress as his previous friend drags its thick tongue over his tummy and chest to elicit a shuddering fear from him. Whereas for the Luxray and Roserade trying to defend themselves from the rest of the horde, they had been easily vanquished by a single Quagsire feral once their friends were easily conquered. They writhe and moan inside the wobbling belly of the feral, only allowing it to enjoy its meal more and drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so ends the journey for these heroes, having been too optimistic and focused on the psychic overlord to realize that ferals still posed a decent threat.</i></span></div></div>",

The rowdy fire-type could probably overpower his foe by his rage alone rather than his type difference. Besides, if Hex was ever coiled up, it would be all over for the frog. You head over in a dash towards the infected eel naga while powering up your fist with aura, using your speed to your advantage to deliver a heavy blow to the Huntail's head. The feral yelps from the sudden strike, sending the serpent creature's torso part to the ground to splat against the muddy sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex glances over to you, happy to see you aiding him at his side. \"Oh, thank you Lace! Whew, that one almost had me!\" You can tell from the sound of his words and heavy breaths that the frog wasn't kidding. With the Huntail slithering back up and hissing, you're giving a cruel view of its open and salivating maw. Its fat tongue rims along its lips that causes the Toxicroak beside you shiver from the sight to where he immediately dives out and swings with his knuckle claws in order to poison the eel. With it distracted, you force aura to begin swirling in between your hands, forming an orb of energy as the Toxicroak swings his arms at the very evasive Huntail. At last, Hex manages to scrape his poison-tipped claw across the naga's chest, however the Huntail seemed to be unfazed by the venom. It's cheeks then bloat for it to release a hot purple liquid to shoot from its maw to splash over the Toxicroak in return, having used a toxic attack. The frog gasped as the poison didn't do much to him either and forced him to stumble over and fall. The Huntail was quick to then coil around the anthro frog before he had a chance to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears shoot up and your eyes widen in surprise, but you charge in with a large aura sphere to shoot out at the eel. Although, its cheeks bloat again to shoot a ray of water to force you back some along with the aura sphere exploding as a reaction! The blue explosion sends you tumbling back to the eel, collapsed in front of it for it to coil you up as well. You grunt and squirm within the constricting hold of the Huntail's spirals, unable to attack him with your arms trapped to your sides and your legs uselessly missing it with kicks. Hex, too, was in a similar situation, but still with poison smeared over his face and shut eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga hisses with delight to your horror and happily opens its drooling jaws again. It hovers the maw over Hex's head, chomping wetly and loudly around it to suckle in. Inside you hear the Toxicroak groan and whine as that thick tongue explores around the frog's face, occasionally swirling around inside Hex's maw from the even more muffled and squelching sounds emitting out. You glance back at the rest of your group to see if they could help, but all you spot are more hope-depriving scenes of your friends. A Quagsire is happily slurping around a Luxray's kicking legs as it rubs its bodily bulges that lump out with Star's squirms, along with a bloated belly sloshing about with Eden's cries from inside. Gold was in the midst of laying against the ground on his backside, gasping as an infected Croconaw straddles on top of the duck. Keeping Gold's arms to the ground, the chubby croc murrs as it slurps its hot tongue over the duck's belly, smearing saliva to glisten at the light blue flesh that only elicit more squirms from the panting meal. Jackal was on the ground, completely unconscious and soaked with water to the point where his mane was extinguished. The Typhlosion was then at the mercy of the Floatzel, who eagerly smacked its lips and grabs Jackal by the ankles to plop his hindpaws into its mouth directly afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp heavily, wondering if this was it. Checking back on Hex only increased your doubts of making it out as you see his writhing froggy-paws slide down the Huntail naga's mouth, eventually hearing a heavy swallow to watch the bulges of the amphibious meal descend down to the infected eel's hungry belly. The Huntail murrs and uses the extra space of coils now to wrap around the bulge and squeeze tightly with the moaning frog trapped inside. Opening its scary violet eyes, the eel once again opens its maw at you in a last taunt of where you were going. You struggle with all of your might, yet the eel continues to pull you closer to its open jaws awaiting your hide by its coiled body. The chin of your muzzle meets a wet flooring slide against it as your face is crammed into the drooling muscles of the naga. It clasps a hand at the back of your head, pressing you in deeper for its tongue swirl and smash against your muzzle and face, adoring that rare Lucario flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunt and whimper all you can, heating your body up with aura to try and force the naga off of you, although the plan fails once the Huntail bites down on your with icy fangs that cause your whole body to stiffen up and feel incredibly cold from the attack. Wincing from the ice attack, you're left with nothing but to twitchingly shiver as your head is taken into the slimy tight depths that await below. Your misery wouldn't end there once the Huntail grabbed your rear end by both cheeks though, spreading them open and groping them tightly to cause a small yipe out of you. You then feel a throbbing muscle slide along the crease of your furry tush, knowing fully well that it was the eel's cock aligning towards your clenched anus. The ring attempts to remain closed as the head of the cock dares to enter inside, prodding at your anus again and again before forcedly ramming up to slide half of the cock into your rectum. That act alone has you gasping loud again and shiver even more abundantly for all to see, that is, if your companions weren't already devoured yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth pants helplessly in the narrow throat muscles with your legs and cheeks being spread to be used like this, causing your face to burn with both arousal and humiliation that you were going down like this. The Huntail on the other hand enjoys the moment and slides the rest of its length inside your body to let it some time to just sit there and throb fatly inside. A heightened inhale and exhale occur with each pulse the cock beats into you, until it and your heart-rate accelerate with the infected eel naga beginning to drill its member through your rear in and out. The cock plunges slickly with pre to blanket around the sensitive flesh, shaking your canine body back and forth with the pulling motions that splat your face into the throat muscles continuously. But through time, you feel the naughty hands of the eel really push at your fluffy rear cheeks, nudging you up a bit further to where the naga was literally just humping you into its mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whine, almost like a sad puppy, with your cock unwillingly erecting out from the forced stimulation and sexual abuse forced onto you. The cock rams at the anal walls to shake your entire rump with each rough pump, which in turn causes a heavy and aroused pant from your maw, even with the little space to breathe or move your mouth in. The feral's tongue in turn explores over your neck and fuzzy chest, digging around at the delicious yellow fur to lap at the somewhat fit flat chest there. You can only groan in compliance as the naga's wet slapping to your rear gets the better of it, at last erupting hot jizz to inject into your expanding rectum and into your stomach some. The hot goo strangely felt comforting from the frigid temperature you were feeling at the moment, enjoying every thick shot the naga squirts into you before taking a short swallow to drag your limp form in deeper. The Huntail's member slides out from your abused anus, leaking out with eel seed as the member pumps the last of its load onto your furry blue orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour flat belly is assaulted by the naga's tongue, along with your genitals and rear was more of your body slid into the expanding jaws of the water serpent. The tongue roams over your penis, bathes your ball sac, and cleans the warm cum off of your squishy rear for you, all before tilting its head back for your black legs to sink down. You feel yourself sliding in the fleshy tunnel with the walls tightly hugging you the entire way down as your hindpaws feel the last of fresh outside air before being tortured with licks and sent to follow you to your devoured doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slimy innards force your slick body into the same chamber as Hex, sliding right up against the frog for his purple rear to smoosh against your face. You groan, without energy or space to move it away from you as the Toxicroak's willpower was already broken. The frog was at the point of grinding his cock against the slick and compacting stomach walls, desperately trying to get off within the chamber and panting hotly. His cheeks clench around your head, giving him more unwilling pleasure as stomach juices begin pouring inside the organ. They splash over the two of you, disorienting you to the point where you quickly just pass out in the bubbling pool with the poor Toxicroak, ending your journey by being captured, raped, and devoured by a simple feral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Huntail murrs as the Lucario hindpaws slide down its mouth, making it lick its lips while rubbing the now round and fat bulge close to its midsection. The sloshing mound of blue scales gurgles happily with two defeated meals inside, and from the sound of their moans, sadly enjoying it. The eel hisses with content and wraps his coils around the thick bulge again to squeeze and hug tightly to tease the morsels inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, an infected Quagsire pats its overstuffed belly and releases a heavy belch. It rests on top of its round gut with the mewls and whines of a Luxray and Roserade inside, with the growls of a Typhlosion's head sinking down into the jaws of a Floatzel and the moaning quacks of a Golduck being humped by a Croconaw. The Lucario and his group had been too cocky from their numbers, that they were outmatched by mere underlings, now to become belly fat.</i></span></div></div>",

You can only imagine the wondrous positions and dirty things floating in that psychic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxius released his trunk from your cock with an audible yank, emerging from under the cloth with a devious grin that causes you to squirm about slightly.

You attempted to call out, but something was stuffed inside your jaws to disallow such an attempt. Realizing something was seriously off, you attempt to move or struggle, however your endeavors would yet again fail. You felt some form of strappings tied along your body, tight and fixated to cease any small motions. Struggling was rendered useless. Suddenly, light invades your blurry vision, stinging a bit before your pupils adjust to the surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was once Draxius\u00e2\u0080\u0099 tent has transformed into an environment you never expected. There were no walls or ceiling. In fact, it appeared as if the floor was invisible. All around you was a pink-purplish foggy texture flowing with random fades of various colors here and there that scattered about so calmly. You could only compare such a sight when one closes their eyes while looking into a light. The same blurry and rainbow transparency could only be the closest thing to one such as this. The next thing you saw horrified you. Black leather strips were wrapped and chained to collars along your body. A strap from the ground held your neck back, proving that it was impossible to move your head. Your body rested amongst its knees, with collars over thighs were firmly planted into the floor. Your tail tied up high with your rump oddly pointing out in a suggestive position; your wrists were cuffed behind your back along with a red ball tied inside your muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious that you were in some sort of bondage get-up. But you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but wonder where this \u00e2\u0080\u009cplace\u00e2\u0080\u009d even was. Your ears suddenly detect a familiar chuckle, hearing the echoing words, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow does my toy enjoy his attire?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Your confused eyes dart toward a naked Drowzee with a blindfold softly clutched in his hand, presumably the object that had been previously blinding you. The other object really snagged your interest. A small thin whip dangled from his black leather gloved hand, and catching your interest with it, Draxius gave it a loud crack in the air. The single sound caused your fur to bristle up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo get the best out of this request, I thought that it would be a better environment for me to have my fun with you. After all, this is a dream and anything can happen in a dream.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The psychic teased. You shudder under the arousal of his words, making you very anxious to begin. Your attention is suddenly brought towards Draxius\u00e2\u0080\u0099 crotch. His cock was double in size than it was in real-life. The length and width of the brown monstrosity completely flushed over you in a mad rush of enticement. Fat globs of pre oozed out from the pulsing tip to puddle beneath the bulging ball sac dangling under Draxius, which in turn, was also increased in size. The Drowzee laughed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be that painful when I fill your rump with my meat. That is, unless you want it to hurt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His lowered eyelid gave a single wink that almost had you cumming on the spot. Your fiery boner slaps in anger against your abdomen, waiting to be abused by the chubby psychic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMrppphk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Is your only response through the gag toy. The Drowzee huffed in amusement and waddled over to your bound spot. His hand reached out and delicately brushed along the side of your head, cupping under your chin as he spoke, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou appear to be such an adorable slut.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His voice was meant to insult you, but in a sweet fashion. And it worked. The hand slithered around to the back of your head, unclipping the buckle of the gay toy for the red ball to slip out of your mouth, covered in spittle. Draxius held the saliva coated sphere to his own mouth, licking it over and murring at the flavor before ordering, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBeg.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTake me\u00e2\u0080\u00a6Please\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d You answered. Out of nowhere, a flash of a blue line streaks across your vision, and your rump jumps at the sudden burning sting of your captor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s whip with a loud thwack! The sound and after-feeling have you throbbing helplessly. Unbeknownst to you, a glowing red mark pulses from one of your rump cheeks by the soft burn of the punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c<i>Ah-ah-ahhh</i>.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Draxius coyly remarks as he waves a finger at your face. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must properly address me and what you want. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be my pet dog, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to need some manners.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fur wafts a shiver down your imprisoned state while you attempt to recollect yourself from your desperately horny thoughts. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDefile me, Master. Ruin me. Make me never want to wake up from this dream.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood boy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Draxius leans closer to your lowered head, allowing his erect girth to wobble in front of you. You desired the taste test eagerly. Your mouth plopped into the large, chocolate brown cock with a fast motion, opening your muzzle to stride your tongue up along the underside. The Drowzee shuddered a single time and his mouth released a mild groan of bliss. Your tongue swirls over the head, picking the urethra and pumping vertically for the best pleasure you could offer your master. It was entirely impossible to stuff the entire length down into your throat, so you would have to adjust to suckling the head into your jaws. Pre and drool mixed together over the darker cocktip, slickening it to the point where you struggled to keep it to remain in your mouth from Draxius urging humps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Drowzee pulled out of your mouth with a slimy plop, and exhaled a breath of satisfaction. \"I chose the best Lucario to be toy, it seems.\" Your cock suddenly meets the sole of the Drowzee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hindpaw. Your lips gag out a rumbling moan as the soft texture of Draxius\u00e2\u0080\u0099 skin brushes along your knotted meat. A single spurt of pre reacts to the reward. The two-clawed paw ditches out from your pleasure, letting you realize the next procedure your master had in mind. The Drowzee approached your rear from behind, using his powers on the chain tied to your neck collar to yank down, tugging your rump to rise up higher along with your tail to shoot straight up. Your anal pucker pulsated in the wide open. Draxius licked his lips whereas his hands plant themselves around your furry butt-cheeks and spread them open a little more, sneaking a grope in there too. His thick body mounts itself into position, exciting your deadly senses with a mad rush of arousal that sent your thoughts swirling for him to penetrate you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s elongated member enters with a brief stab, using its slimy texture of Lucario spit and Drowzee pre. You howl out loud, only to receive another lashing to your bum. The whiplash causes a gruff startle of pleasure to surge through your nerves as a voice explains, \u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery time you bark, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get a spank, pooch. I want to hear you beg for this whip.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour pupils dilated, and your ears lower back. With a blushing face and an open mouth, you release groan after groan to feel that hot mark along your butt pulsate with each whiplash from Draxius, all the while of having the large cock dig through your rectum, plunging in and out of your stretched anus. \u00e2\u0080\u009cM-M-Master\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the only word you could mumble from your panting lips. Finally, the Drowzee stabs inside you for one last push, roaring as the hottest seed you could imagine floods inside of you, Your belly poked out by the stretching bulge of Draxius cocktip jabbing in already, but it truly began to expand after slimy cum filled inside your stomach. Your growl helplessly to receive one more spank on the thigh as your master faps the rest of his large batch deeper into you. The heat of the goo forces you to tremble under its might, also forcing you to cum yourself without any contact to it. Jet after jet, your doghood cannons your semen all across the floor under your curled-over state, splashing into thick puddles to collect beneath your somewhat pudgy belly. In fact, the milky fluid sloshed and swirled inside your small gut with the quakes of being humped into and shaking from the largest orgasm you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething was off though. You had already shot ten strings of cum already yet it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t decreasing in cum levels. It was like a never-ending ejaculation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope you would not mind, however\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Drowzee behind you started off, \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u00a6You shall soon discover that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m allowing orgasms to last much longer than they potentially are. You seem to be enjoying yourself though!\u00e2\u0080\u009d His thick length slid out with a brief yank, which hurt a little, but felt very pleasing. You breathe heavily while your cuffed wrists struggled to move throughout your cumming-season.</span></div></div>",

Your back rests against the ground with your limbs spread out in an \u201cX\u201d routine. Calming down some, your orgasm settles to mere white lines dripping slowly from its width as Draxius chuckles for his next move. His chubby from lays atop your bounded body, fixating the two you into a sixty-nine position with his mouth hovering less than an inch away while his ball sac cock limply rest over your head, smothering you in his large genitals. The loose brown flesh ripples from your low moaning as its warmth surrounds your body within its veil of arousal heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour master jabs his trunk over your cock as he had done before in the tent, swirling and suckling on the length. His tongue busies itself with licking around your groin region while you had your own job to do.  Having difficulties to move in your trapped style, your open jaw managed to scoop the head of his prick into your mouth. You slurped it deeper to drag the upper half of cock into your stretching cheeks so you could please your dominator as much as possible. The portion of the swallowed flesh wobbled In joy as your mouth began to suck around its size, and for your tongue to nestle along its sides. it was unbelievably like a toasty texture and it swelled along the inside of your muzzle so pleasantly to the point where your orgasm was building up again already. The Drowzee\u2019s trunk tugged and pull at your cock relentlessly, never ceasing to discover patterns to mess with your hardened prick which was on the verge for a second cum-spree. What he had done with his cock into your anus earlier, he repeated so with his trunk. It plugged off the cock for it to smack against your abdomen with a wet slap, tensing in burning enticement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe psychic replaced the trunk\u2019s actions with his tongue, stroking the cum-slathered prick around in slow circles and lines, causing a multitude jumps and wiggles from your excitement. It occasionally spiraled around, cupping over the hot material to blend the Drowzee\u2019s saliva with your seed. Below the depths of his nether regions, your maw was completely stuff with Drowzee cock, having the fat member constantly squish inside your cheeks to squelch aloud with each grind and hump he delivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMrahhh-ahh\u2026\u201d He grumbled with a hint of appeasement. It was a sign his second round of a climax was coming, and it felt as if yours was too. White slime volcanoed down your full throat, seeping down into stomach to add with the cum-pool already frothing inside. The hot jizz flowed through your midsection, poking your furry belly a tad more outward to press against Draxius\u2019, sliding across his special skin to rouse you to your peak. You copied his moans, dispersing your load down into his swallowing mouth for a long-lasting session of squirting large amounts of pre into each other. Your mind flickers on and off, endeavoring to remain stable through the impossible feeling of pleasure tingling within you. Draxius exhales happily as he slides his somewhat chubby body off of you, leaving you to simply cum in the air now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears pick up on his chuckling and the sound of his fingers taking a snap. Just instantly, your bondage disappears without a trace, letting you wallow in puddles of cum to shiver in. His footsteps approach you, daring you to look up from the floor up to see his shiny gleam of victory. Your legs throbbed at the glare. Exhausted, battered, and covered in your own cum, you pant with heavy whimpers as the Drowzee slides your head up with his hands in a precious manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat an excellent toy I've collected, wouldn't you agree? Your service was greatly appreciated and I doubt I\u2019ll ever experience such a time as this again. Unless, you wish to stay with me. I can do this every night you if you wish.\u201d The Drowzee winked at you. You wanted to blush from his comments and hump the junk out of his belly. \u201c\u2026Let me show you why they call Drowzees, <i>dream eaters</i>\u2026\u201d The psychic opened his steamy maw, letting you stare down through the columns of thick spit and pink walls of slimy flesh to see the dark pit that awaited your filling. With a tiny pluck, your head is tucked inside Draxius\u2019 mouth, as you let your shoulders to be swallowed inside. You could care less what happened next. As long as you could cum again and satisfy your master in any way necessary was all that truly mattered. The Drowzee mumbles something during your descent down his mouth, but you guessed it was about your flavor due to hand gropes and tongue lashes. Your chest and arms are deeply cleaned in his spit, all before being sucked down into the clenching fleshy walls of an esophagus. To Draxius, although, would prove to have a challenge with your belly. Even if it wasn't obese in size, the sloshy texture and expansion didn't help either. Braving for a slower task, Draxius strengthened his grip along your sides, tugging your gut to begin entering the sphincter of his watering maw. His tongue scoops under the furry globe, smearing and lubricating it in drool that tickles you slightly, making you twitch and squirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour master murrs zestfully through the taste of your Lucario flavor coursing through his mouth. The pulsing pleasure erects his cock once more, jumping in each tongue dive around your small belly full of his cum. You inhale the steamy moisture of innards and shudder by the fumy air collecting around you. The slimy walls relentlessly pull your body further down, vibrating over from your pleasant arrival. The muffled gurgles of the Drowzee's stomach neared you as a pucker hole snaps around your nosetip, sinking your trapped form down to your destination. Draxius' jaws stretch wider to be able to take in your gut, using his tongue and head tilts to push it deeper and deeper until it finally is pushed into his throat. Grinning with your waist resting atop his muscle, his tongue rises and lowers at your member's sides, eliciting your violent jolts and leg kicks every now and then. Although, he only toys with your balls for a minute before plopping down upon his thick rear and craning his head all the way back. Your blue thighs and black calves slide down the slimy tunnel after slipping between his lips, letting your body enter farther into the stomach pooled with gloppy Lucario seed. Once bathing your ankles and footpaws, the Drowzee munches and nibbles happily on the extremities, getting a good kick at their soft rumpling and paw pads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe act makes your smile and blush inside the cramped space until, they too, trail into the stomach of the psychic. A rippling belch sends the cum and stomach walls closing in on you to tremble, squeezing and slathering you in an imprisoned slimy mess. The bath of semen rises up to your knees and shoulders around your curled up posture, heating your spittle-coated form for a comfortable place to fall asleep. You arousal throbs in the hot cum, pulsing madly before shooting out another round. A small bump of a geyser rippled in the surface of the thick goo, revealing your third shooting orgasm before your very own tired eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Draxius licked his lips, pressing his hands into his massively round belly and feeling the dog-filling within it cum again. \"Mmmmm....I cannot explain how delightful it feels to have your prey climax inside you. You've been an excellent pet, so why don't you just take a nap? You shall get to wake up in my arms tomorrow morning, unless I've eaten you already in reality. I'm completely stunned at your flavor!\" He begins to masturbate while watching his stomach quakes and sloshes. You felt ecstatic about your fate tomorrow morning either way. Though, you doubted Draxius would ever eat you anyway. Becoming drained of energy through your never-ending orgasm, your fluttering eyes fully shut down, allowing you to pass out in the digesting belly of your master.</span></div></div>",

Foggy from the dazed mind by your immediate awakening, you sit up and groan, rubbing your eyes as your legs stretch out. Blinking repeatedly, you hear odd wet sounds next to you. Your ears fold back and blush to hear soft purrs emit through the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Is Draxius...masturbating</i>?\" You think to yourself. You open your eyes fully, getting the hang of your thoughts and actions now, only to get a full-blown surprise to shock you. Off from the side of the bed stood an anthro Raichu, obviously male with an orange furry sac and long cock dangling between its legs. It's white belly seemed somewhat chubby and the entire being seemed to not contain much muscle if anything else. With closed eyes and a full, drooling mouth, you discover a Drowzee's thickly brown legs and waist dangling out from the Raichu's maw. The spit-covered legs twitch a bit and the bulging lumps protruding out from the rodent's neck and upper body groan through muffling flesh. Draxius must have still been asleep and this Raichu sneaked in during the night! You watch them slowly slide down as its tongue rubs over his hindpaws, moaning while it felt the bulges of the body it swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost petrified in fear, you burst from the covers of the bed and dash towards the large rodent standing in front of the doorway. The Raichu blinks a single and purple eye open, discovering its other meal to have woken up and try to escape. It quickly lashes out a stunning wave of static from its long tail, sending the voltage to jitter down your bones and causes you to fall down, writhing in paralysis. You grumble atop the cloth floor, struggling to move anything as the Raichu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thunder wave did quite the number on your nerves and muscles. You look out of the ripped opening of the bedroom that the infected Raichu had gone through; ready to call for help until your trembling eyes gape open. Out in the hallway of all the rooms stood several infected pokemon, but you mainly focus on the female Blaziken standing closest to your fallen body, which was swallowing a pair of squirming Abra feet as its red feathered belly kicked out with Eden\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quiet cries coming out from it. The avian slurped the extremities down after a few powerful licks, sucking down the long yellow tail that followed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind you, you listened to a soft belch along with louder purrs of the Raichu behind you. Apparantly it finished its Drowzee meal and was prepared for the immobile Lucario next. Desperate and scared, you wiggle your body as much as possible in hopes that anyone within the tent could still save everyone, yet hearing all of the moans and stomach gurgles around you made it very clear that that dream wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to happen. The infected Raichu picks up your legs, licking over your hindpaws until scarfing them down between its cheeks. Its loud suckles and squelches emitted into your ears specifically, forcing you to realize there was no hope left. Your ears fall down to the sides of your head as you close yours eyes. You fully surrendered to the feral, ready to join Draxius in its round belly to become mouse fat. The Raichu murred in response to your completely motionless body, whereas you simply let out whimpers once your body begins to be dragged back, sliding ever so closer to the pit of your fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing down your legs and tail, its wet lips slip past your groin and furry rump after delivering a few nibbles and lashed out its tongue across your midsection, tickling your abdomen. Staring ahead, you see your arms slide in front of you limply as your chest is sucked inside the slimy warmth of the infected\u00e2\u0080\u0099s jaws. You no longer cared to survive and merely waited to be with your master once again, even if it is a stomach. Your peripheral eyesight begins to notice the outlining frame of the Raichu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s teeth and maw surround your head, and its tongue begins to stroke your neck and chin. Deep inside the feral\u00e2\u0080\u0099s esophagus, your wet footpaws press against a different object that shuffled by your touch. Feeling your pads around, you soon find out that you were rubbing the saliva-drenched Drowzee tightened within the organ. He seemed to have finally woken up due to his struggles and muffled grumbles. Your head is chomped down and arms slurped in, sending your entire body to the gurgling depths that surrounded you. The light of the outside world fades while the fleshy, slimy walls constrict you powerfully and yank you deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body soon enough mashes together with Draxius\u00e2\u0080\u0099 thick body, writhing in hot spittle. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAghk\u00e2\u0080\u00a6! My pet\u00e2\u0080\u00a6! This can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be happening! I am Draxius, the mighty psychic of the western ridges! I shan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t accept this fate\u00e2\u0080\u00a6as\u00e2\u0080\u00a6as\u00e2\u0080\u00a6blubber of an animal\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d His struggles appear to grow weaker and his eyes begin to close once digestive fluids began to fill the throbbing chamber compacting the two of your slimy bodies together. The oozing liquid around you rises up to your chest, fizzling at your hides in a non-painful matter. If your fate truly led you to be eaten, you preffered it this way; mercifully and with your master. Forced into a hug with the unconscious Drowzee anyway, you too pass out, relieved to longer have to worry about the infection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Raichu curved its hands over its chubby belly, gripping under it to slosh the two pokemon inside it all about. It grinned after licking its lips, enjoying an excellent breakfast to start the day off. Working with a pack certainly had its benefits, as the ambush on the interesting-looking tent in the basin of the field truly had easy prey that waited to be gobbled up. A fight wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even needed to catch these tired anthros.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Raichu laid back against the bed its prey were originally sleeping in, who now ironically slept in their new home now. It began to stroke its hand down at its growing morning wood as the loud bubbling gurgles sounded from the spherical tummy. Nestling the dark-furred fingers over the tight white belly, the Raichu relaxed its full state in the cozy texture of the bed, releasing one more belch while it listened to the rest of the bodily sounds of the other ferals binging down on their room\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prize.</i></span></div></div>",

You make your way closer and closer towards Hex's room, a little anxious to request to stay with him. You did find the frog to be a little attractive and alluring, but you wondered if Hex shared the same feelings. \"<i>Only one way to find out...</i>\" You shyly thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin just a few awkward steps, you arrive at his room's curtain, listening to the soft wet sounds emitting from it. Your cheeks flush as your ears listen to the repetitive noise emitting from the room. By the mere sound, your sheath growled while your mind popped a dirty image of the Toxicroak masturbating. You gulp a heavy weight down your throat as you shake the thought away, yet, there was a large possibility that was what Hex was actually doing. The slick sounds sounded a bit too <i>kinky</i>. Either way, you open the current to find the Toxicroak's backside facing you with his legs crossed over one another and hands resting in his lap. Your fur winces at the sight as you feel compelled to remain silent. You weren't sure if you should interrupt Hex's little...time, or if you should just escape while you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that plan dies out quickly once the frog turns to find you. To your surprise, he grins happily instead of cowering in embarrassment. \"Ah, Lace! A pleasant surprise. I was just in the middle of making some lotion...\" The frog slid around atop his bed to reveal a wooden bowl filled with a colorful white paste. He continued, \"It's my own little concoction I created in my free time in the swamp. It's just a little activity I've busied myself back at my residence within the swamp, and it certainly passed the time of being isolated inside a tent all day everyday. Being an amphibian and all, I need to keep myself moisturized. This lotion does just that and keeps my rubbery skin slick, shiny, and healthy!\" Chuckling a cheerful smile, he dabs his fingers into the mesh and glides it across his legs. Throughout his rubbing, his golden glare crept over your body viciously. \"You look quite worried, Lace. Is something the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself distracted by his hands gliding over his body and quickly muster your explanation, \"Er-ergh...uh...Sorry, but it, uh...\" You close your eyes, sighing out as you regain your composure. \"I guess I went too far in a joke towards Jackal, and...well, you know how his temper works.\" You walk towards the frog's bed as Hex scoots a bit back on it to make room for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so he kicked you out. Well that's quite alright, Lace. I wouldn't mind sharing a night with you in bed...\" He answered a little too flirtatiously. You flash a brief blush while you lower your bag onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks...\" You reply before resting your rear against the edge of his bed. Suddenly, one of Hex's legs rests down over your lap, forcing you to stare at the frog with a uncomfortable look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex grinned as he slid his calve over your groin. \"You wouldn't mind helping me moisturize my legs, would you?\" You look down at the purple limb below you, taking in the sight of his glazy flesh to tempt you into nourishing it eagerly. You struggle to nod while your hands go down to his leg, rubbing slowly back and forth up along the limb to feel the sensation of his slick skin. He was right; it <i>was</i> rubbery. You do your best to hide the heat in your face and fail miserably as Hex croaks happily at your reaction to his body. \"You're so cute when you're nervous.\" His voice cooed. You look over to him with a slightly open and dumb-founded muzzle. During your daze, you found yourself awkwardly staring at the anthro toad so you quickly return your eyes down to the leg you were massaging. Hex's croaks emitted louder as he leaned in closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then again, you're cute in any mood. I usually prefer reptiles or other amphibians...\" The frog teased while he crept closer to you on the bed. \"...So, I've noticed your stares. You appear that you like looking at my body, and I never see you flirting with any of the girls, so is there something you want to admit? I'm feeling very horny since I haven't slept with someone for far too long, so we can either do this happily or I might just get a little <i>rough</i> with you...\" You suddenly found yourself being lowered down onto your back by the guide of the Toxicroak's hands, pinned underneath him as he slides his slippery legs over your dry furry ones. You whine in arousal as Hex giggles in response. Beneath the frog's body heat, you couldn't help but enjoy his breath exhaling over your face.</span></div></div>",

Your eyes perform a terrible job to avoid Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s golden glare to infatuate you by their lustful shine. It was true that you tended to enjoy a male\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body and character over a female, finding yourself to bring about dirty thoughts and ideas to your brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was also an emotional tie between you and other men that you honestly couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t explain. A form of love between another male\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soul and yours appeared to be absolutely\u00e2\u0080\u00a6astounding. Your eyes purposely focus at Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dominating expression.allowing you to gather up enough bravery to face the attractive frog head on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith enough courage, you finally admitted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah\u00e2\u0080\u00a6I tend to like...<i>men more</i>.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face glows a pinkish color while his mouth remains slightly open for what to say, which you in turn reflect the same dilemma. He slides a single finger down your chest as he chuckles, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, so big <i>thick</i> cocks and <i>hot</i> ropes of cum help you get off\u00e2\u0080\u00a6?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wince and lose your confidence again, \u00e2\u0080\u009cEr-errr\u00e2\u0080\u00a6eh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe croaking snickers grew in volume. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHee hee, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re adorable\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Toxicroak wavered his nourishing hands to your face, brushing his thumbs over your blushing cheeks. There wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much to be said after the compliment, so you simply gesture a cute smile towards your new bedmate, satisfied that you lifted your orientation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s predicament off your chest. Speaking of your chest, you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but feel the hot arousal lying atop it while leaking hot, glistening pre through your yellow fur. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo what are your perforations in a man? What kind of filthy fetishes do you usually crave for?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEh?

But it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to be that easy\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Toxicroak\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words hit you as his head lowers down. His wet tongue strokes up along your neck, eliciting an excited shrill of delight to trickle down your back. Your tail between both yours and Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legs beats against the bed in the thrilling spur of having his saliva seep down your neck. Finally, the frog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth looms over to your muzzle, pecking a kiss on it before invading it with his tongue. His horny maw wallowed through yours, sucking and writhing your tongues together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel your eyes roll back as your eyelids flutter by the relief. Submitting to the act, you wrap your arms over Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back to pull his body closer into you. You couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe that it had taken this long just to be able to get this close to Hex, but it was actually happening! He was even attracted to you! You writhe happily throughout the make-out process, purposefully acting sloppy and letting his frog dribble blanket your face in its sticky warmth. The Toxicroak\u00e2\u0080\u0099s muffled croaks clearly spoke for themselves, showcasing how much pleasure the frog was earning. Hex was even grinding his cock and balls over your abdomen. Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet slid against each other as your paws rumpled together with them, sliding and rubbing on one another adorably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, the Toxicroak pulled away with a bridge of saliva to connect your mouths. Eagerly licking the thin strand up, the frog scratches your ears which ironically made you want to twitch and pound your leg. Suddenly, a sudden wet slap causes you to yelp a bit as Hex straddles you down more tightly as his hand scoops your furry ball sac. His fingers lightly wobbled and his palmed softly circled around in a small radius under the scrotum, rousing you to growl out and even curl your lip. Fingering your balls a tad longer, the inevitable hard-on rises from your groin, stabbing towards the sky at an impressive pillar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand lets your balls spill from his palm as he gripped your newly aroused cock. After an evil croak, the Toxicroak began his handjob in motion and stroked your knotted member thoroughly. You groan and slide your legs over the frog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own, grabbing a pillow and tightly hugging it in physical bliss. Hex chuckled again and placed his cock behind yours, nestling their undersides together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peek a struggling eye open as the frog demanded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to play a game. Whoever gets the other to explode first gets to decide what we do together. If you win, I get to discover your little fantasies\u00e2\u0080\u00a6<i>but if I win</i>\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d He leaned in closer and licked his grinning lips, \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u00a6You get to discover <i>my</i> dirty fetishes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears fold back as your face scorches with red. The frog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stroking hand made it almost impossible to answer immediately, especially with his pre-beading cock grinding against yours within his grip. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You manage to blurt out; however, your thoughts of winning are slim.

The rubbery texture of the Toxicroak\u2019s palm was glazed with pre and Hex\u2019s magical lotion, giving off the wildest ride for your cock during the storm of wet sounds. Your grit your teeth and throb your entire body, unable to contain your whines of hot breath and excitement. Your leg even raises a little in the air, kicking and twitching by the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex clearly noticed he was winning, gifting him with more evil confidence to really dig his fingers into your cock, focusing on your cock. In order to win, which didn\u2019t really matter to you since all you cared about was cumming at this point, you would need to form some kind of tactic to \u201cdefeat\u201d the frog at his own game. You look up at the Toxicroak, grinning coyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really going at my cock there, Hex. What\u2019s wrong? Do you want my <i>hot cum</i> to slather your face instead or something?\u201d You stated to the best of your abilities to try and look unfazed by his handjob, yet might have done a terrible job doing so. Hex\u2019s eyes widened a tad as his glowing face lightened vibrantly more. It was working. You continued, \u201cIs it my thick dog seed that helps you get off? If that\u2019s what you wanted then we could\u2019ve skipped this little charade so I could fap in front of your face, squirting all of the strings of <i>boiling</i> semen to slather your face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frog croaked loudly in interest, finally revealing some weakness to your words. He was showing his submissive side, just ever so slow. \u201cUh-oh, Hex. I think you\u2019re losing your touch. Your hand is curving towards your side now\u2026Do you want me to <i>help</i> you?\u201d Unable to see your own face, you could only pray that your expression and smile look seductive and sexy. You weren\u2019t necessarily good at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex whines and starts to hump faster in his hand, bouncing his waist to the soft rocking motions of the bed. \u201cDo you have a real handful, Hex? Here, let me help with that.\u201d You mention as your forepaws go to place themselves over Hex\u2019s hand, making sure he pumps his member more powerfully. The frog shook his head to answer your remark, but your hands force themselves around the purple rod, helping it spurt pre over the entire handjob process. Hex whimpers to use his free hand grope one of your legs. It appeared the Toxicroak wouldn\u2019t go down easily. \u201c<i>Game on.</i>\u201d you think to yourself as you press your paw pads at its sides, squishing the thick fleshy pole with your cushiony texture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex cried aloud and croaked madly. After biting his bottom lip, the Toxicroak finally released his seed, having it string over your belly. Your hands slow their pumping motions, pausing to feel the spasms of Hex\u2019s cock as it ejected its entire load onto your yellow abdomen. The frog trembled once the orgasm finished, exhaling loudly before letting his upper body timber down on top of yours. He laid down atop you, letting his head rest against your frog-seed covered stomach as his pillow. You release a sigh knowing you made it through and almost exploded. Hex is known as one of those \u201ctough cookies\u201d people say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wince as the Toxicroak\u2019s tongue drags along your flat belly, slurping up his cum to clean it for you. His hand retracts back behind him as he does this, lightly wrapping his hand to your cock to slowly stroke. \u201cI never would\u2019ve expected you to last so long, Lace. I had presumed you to be the easy type.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving his head below yours now, all because of his tallerish height, you were the one who pecked a kiss on his forehead. \u201cI can be timid about some things, but that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t know how to put out.\u201d You softly murr to the motions of Hex\u2019s palm nudging your knotted shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex winks in return, cutely answering, \u201cI\u2019ll say.\u201d A wide grin spread across his face. \u201cSo what kind of filthy things is Lace attracted to? Aside from <i>Toxicroaks</i>, that is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled at his statement, happily responding\u2026</span></div></div>",

The Toxicroak\u2019s eyes lit up from the suggestion, beaming their golden delight with perverted, yet sensual interest. Hex stares at you with eager passion, anticipating for you to explain your fetish a bit more clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell don\u2019t just stop there\u2026\u201d Hex begged, \u201c\u2026Tell me some of the juicy deets.\u201d Apparently, <i>deets</i>, stood for details; a simplified term that you never expected from someone like Hex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUrh\u2026\u201d You started off, slightly hesitant, \u201cWell, I guess I really like them when they\u2019re big and stuff?\u201d Hex\u2019s eyelids lowered and a scowl had spread across his face. You clearly disappointed him. You tried collecting a few excuses to even figure out your attraction to rears. \u201cNot exactly in a fat kind of way, but just when they\u2019re\u2026you know\u2026meaty. And uhm, I guess just how they\u2019re round and squishy really turns me on, even by just looking at them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex\u2019s expression brightens up again, \u201cEven by a simple glance, hmm?\u201d You figure that revealing that statement was a regretful mistake. Having the Toxicroak on top of you, Hex steadily turns around, purposely letting his kneeling legs slide against your body. He apparently knew that you enjoyed his smooth skin. After ending a complete one hundred-eighty degree spin, the frog\u2019s purple, boisterous rump faces directly towards you, shining in the candlelight. Your cheeks glow as he shifts it from side to side and looks back over his body on his hands and knees. \u201cSo, you might be intensely aroused by something liiiiike\u2026<i>this</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRockets flare out riotously from your face. The spherical bum glistened with Hex\u2019s lotion, along with the natural and beautiful aroma emitting from it like fresh dew from the grass. The Toxicroak\u2019s twisted expression and rear-motions were enough to reinforce your knotted cock to sprout right back up to its tall stature. It pulsed and beckoned to fill the frog\u2019s rump, to squeeze between the tight crevice of its cheeks, to violate its rectum, and to fill its inner workings with its hot spooge. You stammer out finally, \u201cY-Yeah\u2026like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex grins in response and nudges his butt closer to your muzzle, \u201cWell go on then, grab it. It won\u2019t bite.\u201d You dare to raise a hand towards the seductive rear, placing your palm over a globular cheek. It fits nicely into your paw, rubbing up against your hands while you give a small grope on the fleshy plush. Hex giggles in response, urging you to go ahead and have at it all you want. Your hands attach tightly to the amphibious bum and circle over it, running your pads across its dry, yet slick nature while digging deeply into it all. The frog\u2019s throat sac began to croak once more, as Hex happily enjoyed your little \u201cplaytime\u201d with his butt. Feeling a new found sense of courage, you lean over and manage to pluck your lips onto his dark purple pucker, stabbing your tongue into the sphincter. Just through your hands, the entire Toxicroak body shivered from a jolt of surprised pleasure, cycling through his blood vessels to rouse his own member. The previously soft and dangling cock\u2019s downward arc began to straighten out, slowly hardening and pumping with the excited blood. Your tongue circled deeply into the anal walls, spreading your drool to web throughout the slim tunnel. Hex\u2019s croaks increased as his waist grinded with your tongue pumps, thrilled to have it drilling inside his rectum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull out with a wet slide, insisting one last surge of bliss to trickle through Hex\u2019s muscles before spanking his rear with a loud slap. An excited yelp eeps out of the Toxicroak\u2019s mouth while his body tenses from the gesture. You grin and revert back to feeling over his bare rump again, juggling the loose weight into your forepaws and pressing them together. His pucker leaks your warm dribble as a red glow beams out of a cheek where you lightly struck him. Your cock couldn\u2019t handle the sight any longer. It needed to penetrate something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u201dHey, you could turn around now, Hex.\u201d You suggested to the frog. The frog shoots his golden look back at you as he reluctantly returns to his original position facing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww, is the fun time over now?\u201d He asks in a sarcastic whimpering tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour muzzle curls up as you slap your hands down on his hips while replying, \u201c<i>No, It\u2019s actually about to start.</i>\u201d With a little force, Hex\u2019s waist is sent down atop your own, piercing your throbbing member right into his stretchy anus. A single and barking croak ripples out of his chest once he was fully sitting on your pole. His shut eyes peek an eye out as his blushing face smiles a toothy smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cErgh\u2026You\u2019re bigger than I imagined.\u201d He found the capability to say through his somewhat painful, however heart-raving feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve imagined me sticking myself into you before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak\u2019s face lit up as much as the spank burn left on his rear. \u201cThe thought may or may not have crossed my mind at some point\u2026\u201d He answered your inquire. Figuring that it would be best to start, the frog planted his rubbery hands atop your ribs, digging into your chest fur as he lifted his rear up for the cock to slide along with the Lucario spit you left trapped inside. The ride became more intense once Hex rocked his bum up and down, striking your cock deep into his rear to hit the rectum walls over and over again. You grunt and exhale more powerfully while the frog pounds around your shaft with a tremendous pace. The audible slaps, including Hex\u2019s moans, fluttered about inside your ears with such enchantment that your orgasm was already on the verge of exploding. The Toxicroak had his head tilted back, whining in ecstasy from your cock penetrating his tight anus vertically. The lubrication inside Hex\u2019s ass would unbelievable magic as you slam into his prostate repeatedly, forcing out more of his croak yelps to sound out. Leaning a bit back further, Hex manages to squish the entire basin of your knot inward, plugging his anal tube as his own genitals slab onto your abdomen with each shovel thrust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the immense pile drive, Hex mutters, \u201cH-Hot\u2026\u201d Right there and then, the Toxicroak croaks loudly, stringing out his seed to arc over your laid down body to cover your muzzle and face. The hot cum strands droop through your fur while a single line of it drips over your single closed-eyelid. You smile at the odd gesture, although in a strange sense, it was also sweet. The frog groans in orgasmic wonder after spurting out the last of the amphibian spooge out. His froghood goes right back to laying lazily atop your flat belly, pooling out with cum. Hex\u2019s weak hands slide to grasp your legs as handles before commanding, \u201c<i>Fill me</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow through with the plan as you strike upward one last time, howling out to the night sky\u2019s moon once your cock could take no more. It empties your cum load deeply inside the slim innards of the Toxicroak\u2019s waist, filling and shooting every tight crevice of his rear with your steamy creme. Hex giggles or moans some form of enjoyment sound and lifts his beaten rump up, The Lucario seed drains out and pours over the pulsating muscle, coating the satisfied member into a milky and delectable state. You lick off a drop of frog cum lining down your lips and swallow loud enough for Hex to hear. The Toxicroak grins and lays down on top of you, pecking a kiss on your nose tip and licks some of the seed stringing around your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFull now?\u201d You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex winks back, \u201cFor now. But it\u2019ll need more stuffing later now that you've stretched it out so much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Oops.</i>\u201d Is all how you answer before the two of you snuggle closely together on the bed. The Toxicroak pulls the covers over you for a night that would involve much more fooling around then you just experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd every second would last a lifetime.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Your eyes open softly, peering tiredly through the bright surroundings of light glowing through the ceiling of the tent. The sunlight in contrast to the brown tent produces a golden hue of light to glow in the room, acting as a calm awakening while you try to get a hold of your attention. Blinking your eyes continuously, you are greeted with a soft snoozing sound. Glancing a bit down, you spot Hex cuddled on top of you with his head underneath your chin, snuggling close to your warm and furry body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile and stroke a hand down his back, petting the frog who was still asleep. The Toxicroak winces in reflex from the touch, making him moan a little and twitch. It makes you smile as your eyes mischievously peer farther down to look at Hex's bare rump and teases them by it's taut and purple gleam. Your back-stroking hand snakes down farther along Hex's spine, eventually arriving at his meaty rear for you to cup your palm over. Your body shudders from the globes pressing into your forepaw, and you dare to give them soft clenches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good morning to you too, naughty <i>poochie</i>~\" a voice quietly sings out. Your fur spikes in surprise as the Toxicroak peaks an eyes open, having been awake the entire time. Not only that, but the frog is maliciously grinning at your too as his cheeks tighten in your grasp. His cuddling hug around you turns into a trap as his arms hold onto you tight and rolls with your body and his on the bed. You chuckle helplessly until you slip off the side of the bed, landing against your back to the ground without suffering any harm. Hex peers over the side of the bed on his hands and knees down at you, snickering. You smirk at him, and in retaliation, you grab the loose bedsheets curtaining off the bed and yank them down tightly, forcing the Toxicroak to eep out loud as he falls over too. However, you lose your grin once you see the descending amphibian fall towards you, making you gasp until his body crashes into yours. Hex's eyes widen once he figures out that he landed sitting upright on his tush. Although, something seemed a bit off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing down, he notices that your muzzle and face are firmly crammed into his plump butt, groaning helplessly as Hex sits on you. The frog couldn't help but laugh as he grinds and burrows your face deeper in between his large cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeheehee. You asked for my rear, and now it's what you're gonna get, Lace.\" The Toxicroak chimes in his face-sitting session. You groan muffledly through the round flesh squeezing and clenching at your head. What was once a beautiful and cold morning has been twisted into some dark, hot torture room. The Pokemon's butt squishes your head within its firm globes, causing Hex to croak happily with closed eyes and blushing cheeks. Your arousal begins to show as your sheath thrums out with your cock slowly rising from your waist, all for Hex to enjoy. His fingers wiggle in the air while the amphibian cheers, \"Oh goody, it's my big friend again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel his rubbery fingers tug and fiddle with your knotted member, eliciting it to grow from your pleasure as you suckle the meaty rear pressing over your face. But suddenly, you swear that you hear a suppressed voice somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Jackal's. \"Hey, uh, Lace? Are you in there? I asked everyone else where you might have slept and I guess I'm a little shocked to think you'd stay with Hex.\" From what you could tell, he was talking from outside of the room, unaware of your current position. Thankfully that cloth door was closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex retorts with a smile, \"Hey, what's that supposed to mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to press your hands against Hex's waist, endeavoring to push him off, but the Toxicroak wouldn't budge and his cock-stroking plus face-sitting weren't doing you any favors. You manage to lift his bum off of you for a bare moment, just to be able to see. Although, it was already too late. You stare from the floor as Jackal stands with the room cloth brushed to his side, and his jaw open wide. The Typhlosion witnesses his companion on the ground with the group's flamboyant sex-offender sitting on your face. A strand of your saliva bridges your mouth to his anus while the frog doesn't cease to stop giving your hardened cock a handjob. Hex himself was looking back at the in-awe fire type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to sit that large rear of yours on Lace's face too? I know he'd appreciate it~\" The Toxicroak teases. A hand clenches Jackal's chest as he attempts to catch his breath from his soft, wrenching gags. \".....Ah.................ah........................ah.....\" Jackal gulps a large weight in his throat before he tries to start again. \"I.....uh......\" The Typhlosion was unable to muster anything that could have been said about the encounter, and he merely exits with his back turned and his cheeks burning with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms give out and Hex's tush returns to squish against your face. You grumble with embarrassment, acting as if you were defeated by something. Hex chuckles and releases your cock from his hold and spins around, making his rump grind on your head in doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tries to reassure you, \"Oh don't mind him, Lace. It's not like it's a real surprise that you'd find my butt so alluring.\" You scowl as the Toxicroak sits up, allowing your face to free itself from its punishment. Hex stands up and offers a hand to you, smiling in a sense that comforts you some. \"Now get up then. I smell a nice breakfast Draxius and Gyro have prepared, and with everyone up, I want to be able to snag some food before it's all gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take his hand and are guided up generously to Hex, holding hands with him cutely as he gives you a wink. Your cheeks flare up again, so you try to make an exit. Yet again, things don't go your way and your body is spun around into Hex's arms. The frog smiles while he lines a finger down your chest. \"Unless you want me to sit on your face some more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself give a short laugh before delivering a firm spank to the Toxicroak's rear, causing the cheeks to jiggle slightly for a moment. \"Dirty frog.\" You sneer before leaving the bedroom with your hand slipping out of Hex's grasp.</span></div></div>",

Draxius and Gyro had generously served your group with a 'goodbye and good luck' gift to send you on your way without empty bellies. You were going to need all the strength you had for the next trek you were about to set on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak lowers down his bowl of food, nearly finished with his meal. \"Lace...\" Hex states without looking at you directly. The frog picks up his cup of tea and blows against the hot liquid to make steam pillar out of it. He continues the sentence and follows it with a sip. \"I don't know exactly any other way of saying this but, I...\" He trails off, sitting the cup down now. You had completely ceased your breakfast eating, listening intently to the Toxicroak with raised ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glances up at you, smiling, \"I appreciate your presence and drive for this journey. I love to know that I can help others in our cause at your side, along with everyone else. You're a beautiful creature, with an even purer heart. And I...\" You notice that the hand holding his teacup was quivering slightly. \"....And I know last night may bring some '<i>complications</i>' between us and the party, and I'm willing to work around them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Hex, but what are you really trying to say...?\" You inquire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widen a tad before looking away again, darting around in very short spots. The frog was struggling to think. When his attention is brought back to you, Hex appears to have more confidence this time. \"...I tend to be a very open-relational kind of person, and if you want us to be a...<i>couple</i>, I wouldn't object to it, however, I can't say that I'll keep my <i>interactions</i> to just you alone, if you know what I'm saying...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are amazed to see the Toxicroak becoming the one embarrassed and blushing. You place a hand over Hex's, comforting the frog. \"I understand. In fact, I don't mind for that really. I just really like making you happy, because you make me happy.\" You flash a smile at him, and it appears to work as his expression lightens up some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Lace...I still need to truly think about...'us' here and I'd prefer that we simply act like there's nothing too special between us in the meantime, if that isn't too much to ask for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lift his hand and kiss him on his knuckles. \"It isn't. Take as long as you need to, but that's if we don't end up being gobbled by some monster out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckles from the dark humor, \"I'll have to think more quickly then, won't I? But don't worry. I'll still flirt with you in front of the other's to make sure they don't catch on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou retort with a chucklign tone, \"Oh sure, <i>that's</i> the reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, your breakfast with Hex seemed quite normal after that, as if last night's events never even existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(<i>To continue the adventure, please click the link!</i>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1799220-Viral-Pokemon-Vore/map/115312111111111111111111212211111111111111121111111211111121211121111111211112111111111111121111111221111111211111\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/ite...</a></span></div></div>",

Your fur spikes up when the brief moment of silence chilled through the room. It felt completely creepy and weird that you mentioned your paw fetish and recommended to keep it a secret, yet you only hoped Hex would be at least tolerant of the idea. You opened your mouth to suggest another idea, but it was fiercely interrupted by Hex's chuckling laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ooooh</i>...It seems we have similar interests...\" The frog responds while you felt his foot drag up along your ankle, sliding it oh-so-softly at the bare surface. Involuntarily releasing a slight and roused grumble, your head flies back into a pillow, pressing down on the soft cushion hard as his rubbery extremity nudges along your footpaw. Your ears caught the sound of his chuckle. It was such a compelling and adorable sound. \"My, I'm discovering an all new side of you, my little puppy. And here I thought you were going to be the only man to ever dominate me. I should've used my froggy paws to win our fast paced cum-race.\" The Toxicroak laid down in front of your laid out position, raising a leg so you could get a great view of the bottom of his foot to hover in front of your face. You shudder at the looks, having your vision dive right in and devour the eye-candy just mere inches away. With glowing red cheeks, you throb violently. His voice echoed in your attentive ears. \"Ah, do you find my hindpaws attractive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head reluctantly nods, and your urges were getting the best of you. <i>Again</i>. Your tongue dares to dab out, giving his purple sole a single, wet lick. It tasted like magic, or well, how you imagined it could taste like. It must have been that lotion he put on. Hex giggles and gives his three toes a quick clench in response. By the act, your maw shows no mercy as it binges down on Hex's foot, bathing it over in your tongue and slimy slobber. Closing your eyes, your tongue glides over the sensual paw, shuddering in its presence as it wiggled happily by your mouth's bewildered desires. The frog giggles in response, wiggling his toes softly too once he whispers seductively, \u201cHee heeeee\u2026You\u2019re so <i>cute</i>.\u201d Your eyelid cracks open a little, just to sneak in a small peek to watch Hex\u2019s reaction to your wildfire of a blush. However, you\u2019re rewarded for your bold and timid actions to see the Toxicroak beginning to lift his other footpaw and press against your face! The mere body heat expelling from your face sends shivers from Hex\u2019s feet to the tip of his head crest. The amphibian paw strokes along your lightly parted muzzle, creasing along your lips and furry face. Exhaling a breath of arousal, you tongue alternates between the extremities, licking over one and switching to the other for equal treatment of pleasure. With the same peeking eye, you struggled to know how Hex was enjoying it. Did he simply tolerate it, or felt the same satisfaction as you were? He appeared happy with it, so you pressed on more thoroughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth carefully nibbles on his toes while you clean and comfort his soles with your hot spittle. With your slick tongue, it works downward to glide along his arches and heels. Hex in turn explored your face, spreading your very own saliva to blanket your muzzle and cheeks after Hex\u2019s paws nestled around them. You break a quiet moan, submitting to the whim of the Toxicroak\u2019s hindpaws. Hex giggles again, looking down with his beautiful golden eyes towards his cock emerging back to its tightened shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like my arousal is back at it again.\u201d He mentions, attempting to contain another snicker. \u201c\u2026And it looks like yours has too.\u201d Your eyes flash open, darting towards your groin between the blurry frame of Hex\u2019s feet. He was right, of course, seeing that your cock was much harder than it was previously before. It was practically going to pop off if you didn\u2019t do something. You nose a foot again, brushing your tongue up from his wet sole to his pleasured digits. Hex lowered his coated paws off from your face, only to squeeze your skyrocketing boner in between them. You wince with an obvious and embarrassing jolt, struggling by the soft touch of the slick and sensual flesh. The Toxicroak initiated his plan, stroking the sides of the rod with the crease of his digits and the balls of his feet. A single squirt of pre answers to the footjob, forcing the Toxicroak to grin and stare at you again, \u201cYou like that, <i>don'tcha</i> boy?\u201d It was a rhetorical question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weakly nod in agreement and pant steam from your jaws. Hex in the meantime plays with your meaty stick, curving it side to side during his pleasing tune of humming. You worriedly ask a question this time around, \u201cY-You can stop if want to\u2026I mean, if this is t-t-too weird and all\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex\u2019s signature grin managed to evolve into a smile you never fathomed to even exist. His reaction was to only continue to fiddle around with your cock, clenching it occasionally for a while. His smiling mouth finally spoke, \u201cOh please. You think you\u2019re pestering me? I thought it was very clear that I also share a paw fetish, Lace, so why act so scared? It\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of. In fact, you should be quite excited to know what ends I\u2019m willing to go forth to pleasure, especially when it\u2019s something that I might enjoy more than you do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore than me\u2026? You\u2019re into them that much?\u201d You ask with a dumbfounded expression, although you immediately follow it with smiling giggles and paw rumpling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex reaches his hands back, rubbing over your hindpaws, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see about that, won\u2019t we?\u201d He answers, while also adding, \u201c\u2026My, your paws are so nice and soft.\u201d You couldn\u2019t help but laugh a little like a child and give your padded digits a quick scrunch.  That\u2019s when an idea strikes your head. You slide your legs in between Hex\u2019s which have extended to your groin. It was a bit of a tight squeeze to fit, but you were able to place your own footpaws around the frog\u2019s groin. \u201cOoooh\u2026You <i>dirty, fiendish</i> dog. You\u2019re going to make me cum again with that attitude...\u201d His glaring voice warned you. His feet give your cock another soft squish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, heh. I guess I\u2019m just a little eager to finally try with someone now that I know we\u2019re even on the whole fetishy stuff.\u201d Squirming a little, you do endeavor to toy around with Hex\u2019s froghood, caressing the member the same way Hex was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex croaked, \u201cAwww. How sweet of you.\u201d His soles glide up and down swiftly. You suffer from yet another wince, all the while tossing the cock between your feet as if you were kneading dough. Placing his hands over your stroking paws, he massages them as they worked around his pole and making you wish to do likewise. From all of the strokes and rubs, you shiver violently, gritting your teeth while you\u2019re at it by the wave of pleasure coursing through your muscles. Hex easily noticed the shiver too before he began to dig his fingers deeper into your footpaws\u2019 fur and thumbing their topsides in circles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moan loudly as your face explodes in red heat. Unable to control yourself, your feet tightly tense against Hex\u2019s dick, squeezing it forcefully for it to swell. The frog gasped a surprised croak, and quite loudly for one thing. \u201cS-Sorry\u2026\u201d You panted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex winked at you, \u201cNot a problem. I liked it you silly pooch.\u201d You loved hearing to be called that. Your wagging tail made it very apparent. Hex\u2019s hindpaws suddenly come together more closely around your cock, eliciting more pre to jet out. \u201c<i>I want to hear that moan again.</i>\u201d And he will. You release more gasps and trembles from his grinding feet and paw sweeps. He happily strokes away more determined now, pounding at your member with his soft, rubbery soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fail in stifling your shaking now. You balls cannot handle the most amazing pleasure you have ever felt. Streams of glowing white seed shoot out from your treated cocktip and onto his gliding footpaws. He wiggles his spherical digits, murring aloud, \u201cMrrrgh\u2026such gooey warmth\u2026\u201d You tremble during your orgasm, gripping the sheets as your spooge slathers its last batch on the stroking extremities. Hex\u2019s croak randomly began to grow in volume and pitch somewhat. You soon would discover cum to begin spurting over your own paws, seeing the frog suffer from an ejaculation too. You look away with a blush, lying fully back now, exhausted, satisfied, and lightly nervous from this wild experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak feet retreat away from your softening dick as you felt Hex twist around and climb back along your body. His chest tucks itself behind your back, letting you feel his heavy yet calm breaths, as the steamy wind blows along your neck. His arms wrap around you, pulling you closer into his frontside while chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex responds with his own giggles, as the two of you share a hot night together in sleep. Not another word was spoken after your footjobs.</span></div></div>",

Shivering in the cold air, you tighten in your bed covers to cocoon any exposed part of your body in the nurturing heat of your tenting bed cover. Suddenly, you are met with a wonderful and quite recognizable rubbery texture that grinds against your backside with arms wrapping around you. Hex pulls you into a joyful hug and kisses your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his cheery tone you hear, \"Good morning my paw slave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh and squirm to flip over so you can face your lover and return the favor. Your arms scoop under his, latching with love as the two of you share each other's body heat in the frigid room. You feel around the bouncy-like material of the frog's flesh while you note, \"I seem to recall winning a certain game to see who dominates who. I think I was declared the winner, <i>paw slave</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex chuckles and grows a malevolent expression, \"Hee hee, is that <i>so</i>?\" Just then, you felt the Toxicroak's slick leg move up, rubbing his foot against your ankle to rouse that submissive nature deep in you. You shudder helplessly as the frog tortures you with more hindpaw rubs. \"Are you saying you would have a problem with being a personal attendant for my lovable extremities, Lace? I bet you would just love to give them a good morning kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was absolutely right. You blush and nuzzle close into the taller pokemon's neck. With a pleasured murr from Hex's foot pokes, you dig your fingers deeply into his purple flesh, gliding down his spine in a caring manner as you quietly answer, \"Mrrrrrrgh...I would actually...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak grins, \"Atta' boy. That's what I like to hear from you, <i>poochie</i>.\" There was that name again, making you wriggle as usual. Hex dared to abandon the blanket to make room for him to rotate his body all the way around. You sit up, eager for your early treat as the heat of both of your arousal eliminate the attention of the cold environment. Sitting on his rump, as are you, Hex lifts his legs a little to present his feet once more to your face. You immediately clasp your hands over them to nose into his soles, forcing giggles and twitches out of the amphibian. While you caress the froggy paws, you happily drag you tongue along the underside of one, picking up the taste of lotion with a hint of your semen from last night's antic. Just then, a voice alerts your ears, and it wasn't Hex's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA certain Typhlosion was behind the carpet covering of the room's entrance, and through, Jackal said,  \"...<i>Ehem</i>...uuhhh...Lace? I asked Draxius which room you slept in. If you're awake in there, I kind of wanted to talk to about...what I said and stuff yesterday to you...I mean, <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">gah I'm so terrible at this apology shit</font>, well, I'm sorry I sort of yelled at you. Maybe I pricked a nerve or something, but tell you what man, I'll make it up to you if-\" He was going to finish, but at that moment, he had already entered the room. His eyes practically bulge out of their sockets and his body freezes in place amazingly still. The motionless fire-type is at a loss of words, for the last thing he expected was to see his Lucario companion sharing a cum-stained bed with the flamboyant homosexual of the group, licking one of his paws clean as the two of you throb with erect cocks. The zombified Typhlosion appeared to start having a heart attack as his body lost balance, forcing Jackal to take steps back as he stutters for what to say. \"...Eh....eh....eh...I'll...<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">just, come by</font>...<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">later</font>...<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">then</font>...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in the next heartbeat, he was gone and far from the room, closing the concealing tent covering a little too quickly behind him. Hex snickers loudly, removing his feet away from you disappointingly before stating, \"Ehehehheh...He's almost as adorable as you are. Well then, I suppose that means most of everyone is up then. Come now, let's enjoy some breakfast together!\" He slides his rump off the bed, stretching as he stood up in a flexible, and quite sexy, way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel one last jolt of pleasuring reflex surge inside your body before you too get out of bed. Hex kindly opens the doorway for you before you make your exit. Your belly grumbles for food, (not whole bodies, thankfully), and you were excited for a cooked meal given the warm and delicious scent filling the large tent. Draxius was kind enough to share his home, and even his meals with your group. You would have to thank him later for that. A cold shiver suddenly revolts in you once you began to ponder how Draxius knew you stayed with Hex last night. Maybe you were a little too <i>loud</i> together...? You would have to ask him about that too, but in private for that question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[<i>Click this link to continue</i> --&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1799220-Viral-Pokemon-Vore/map/1153121111111111111111112122111111111111111211111112111111212111211111112111121111111111111211111112211111112211111\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/ite...</a>]</span></div></div>",

The rubbery texture of the Toxicroak's palm was glazed with pre and Hex's magical lotion, giving off the wildest ride for your cock during the storm of wet sounds. You grit your teeth and throb your entire body, unable to contain your whines of hot breath and excitement. Your leg even raises a little in the air, kicking and twitching by the feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex clearly noticed he was winning, gifting him with more evil confidence to really dig his fingers into your cock, focusing on your member. In order to win, which didn't really matter to you since all you cared about was cumming at this point, you would need to form some kind of tactic to 'defeat'\u00c2\u009d the frog at his own game. Deciding that it would be best to just think of other things and not the utterly arousing allure of Hex's body and handjob, your mind pictures yourself sitting at the edge of stream with your legs in the water. It was calming and you enjoyed the sensual peace to the point where the fapping noises around you disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearing as if you were going to win, your mind betrays you as the peaceful picture in your head turns south as an infected normal Dewgong bursts from the water, stuffing your feet into its maw. It's fat tongue licks under the paws, sliming it by its saliva for you to wince by. You open your eyes and gasp of the image of your body being swallowed in by the beast, becoming nothing more than a fat, round, white bulge for its belly to rub by its fins. You shudder under the thought, letting Hex get the better of you as his thumb folds over the top of your cock to press it down on your squishy head, working the knotted rod like a joystick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moan a little to the frog's enjoyment and your eyes close again. You were a little uneasy after the previous image, but you figured you'd try again. You thought of Gold, your ultimate bonerkill. You grinned that less blood was packing in your cock. You were slowly losing interest in sex already. Your mind jabs the second knife into your back by presenting Gold's legs and tail sticking out from an infected female Grovyle's maw. They struggled aimlessly while the lizard slurped them inside, thrashing its tongue to coat them in drool. Gold's cock was blasting duck-jizz throughout the trip, tensing his limbs and talons during it all as the Grovyle rolled her breasts by her own hands to intensify the pleasure. A gooey liquid seeped from between her legs as her tail happily wagged. After chomping the Golduck's feet down, you growl in sheer arousal at the sight of the lizard sloshing her spherical and scaled belly, jiggling the victim inside to quack his moans inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-F-Fuck...Agggh...G-Gold...\" You stutter in your weak state. You open your eyes excruciatingly wide from what you just choked out, finding Hex to mirror your exact expression. Although, it later transforms into a teasing manner, growing a sly grin with lowered eyelids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gold eh? I didn't know that when you mentioned you preferred men, Lace, that you were truly in love with Gold? Does his little body help you get off? I can call him in here if you want, and I'm sure the three of us can have lots of fun together.\" The Toxicroak urged as he tugged on your cock more. You were at the edge of your orgasm and trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No no n-n-n-no...You have it a-all wrong...<i>hnngh</i>...I was thinking of him to not...c-c-cum...hrrregh!\" You reply with heavy pants. Your tongue even hung loosely from your muzzle for Hex to snicker at watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooooh! Of course! Hee hee, Lace, it's okay to admit that you're completely infatuated by Gold. I mean honestly, the feeling of his tight rubbery skin! It reminds me of my own sexy texture. Hmmmm...just imagine those webbed hands of his groping your rump and body. I can only fathom what the feeling of his flat beak would be like suckling your dick. I can tell by feeling the heat of your throbbing penis that it agrees with me.\" Hex furthers his taunts. You whimper and toss your head back, howling in the humiliating sensation. White cum spurts from your cock, fountaining out to arc back onto your exposed stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShivering in pleasure while humping your groin into the open air, you submit under Hex's body as the frog lowers his face down to your ejaculating cock, squishing the rest out with his stroking hand before licking the canine seed up. He twirls a finger into your abdomen's sticky fur, collecting a coat of semen to glisten the fingertip before he brought to your exhaling mouth. \"Would you like some too?\" The Toxicroak asks followed by a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo spent and horny, you clasp your lips over the purple digit, suckling along the finger to taste your own slimy contents. Hex's finger begins to feel around your maw, sliding over your tongue and swirls over your inner-cheeks. Finding the mere act erotic, you moan through the muffled jaws, grinding your body beneath the frog. Satisfied with digging around your mouth, Hex's finger glides through the crease under the muzzle lips before pulling away for him to put into his own mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmm...your cum and your spit taste good...Well Lace, you certainly are easy to get off. I expected you to last a little longer, but I find this side of you to be adorable. You're as much fun to tease as much as Gold!\" Hex chuckled as his hand rubs your cheek on the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush brightly and give off an embarrassed smile. You loved the way he talked to you and the thought of him dominating your body both physically and verbally aroused your cock to wish to harden again. \"Yeah, yeah, I lost...Guess I sort of did it on purpose though.\" You respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oooh</i>?\" Hex rose a brow of intrigue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush again and roll your eyes. \"So what sort of things does Hex the Toxicroak enjoy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes could catch the hint of menacing wrath behind the frog's expression. In a coy tone, Hex answered...</span></div></div>",

Your head shrugs back into your shoulders with rosy cheeks and a charming smile, understanding why Hex was so pleased with digging his finger around inside your mouth. The frog grimaces a hand over your chest, kindly rubbing you before continuing, \u201c\u2026Have you ever given anyone a blow-job, Lace? Something about you appears to me that you\u2019re a sufficient <i>dick-sucker</i>. Am I wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart skips a beat once hearing his question. His body atop of yours emits his heat and flesh over you, like having a bath with Hex\u2019s soul. \u201cHow is he just\u2026so\u2026flattering\u2026?\u201d You asked yourself in your head with confusion. It was true that you\u2019ve never actually given anyone actual mouth-to-sex contact, but how hard could it really be? And as a bonus, you could actually clasp and fill your maw with that beckoning, succulent member of his. You have yet to get a taste of his semen and the thought of it was tipping your rod\u2019s angst back over the edge. You check back to his shining golden eyes, replying with a smirk, \u201cNot really, but I guess there\u2019s only one way to find out then, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll Hex over to his side along with you, reversing your positions to where you now sit atop the frog on the bed. This time, you ease back a little, making sure that you were closer to his crotch that beckons with a pulsating, purple cock. The purple flesh-colored froghood wiggles to tempt you, and you were prepared to just dive-in and dine your tongue over it all. Hex releases his signature chuckle before answering, \u201cI suppose you\u2019re correct. Now then\u2026\u201d The Toxicroak widens his legs out, letting his meat stick out from the opening limbs for an over-the-top arousing posture. His sleek thighs line up perfectly to his groin as his purple ball sac sags just above the tight anus clenching in anticipation with the cock\u2019s beats. He finishes his statement, \u201c\u2026don\u2019t make too much of mess. Go on now.\u201d The words fluently bounce from his lips. Your nerves ignite with flames of arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou forepaws reach and clasp over his rubbery legs, nudging down close to his warm crotch for a good hold to lap away at his length. After leaning your head in, your nosetip hovers above the erect cock, allowing you to watch in mesmerized awe at Hex\u2019s meat. The frog snickers and rubs the top of your head, instructing, \u201cFirst off, you don\u2019t want to just swallow it all at once. Just take your time with it, poochie, and it\u2019ll be fun for both of us\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at him in his sincere care and choice of a nickname before initiating your end of the deal. Your tongue slaps up against the rod\u2019s underside and steadily makes its way to the top with a slow dragging motion. Hex winces immediately after the gesture, gripping the fur on your head. Now with a confidence boost, your tongue prances along the member with thorough licks and brushes, wiping over it to coat a nice layer of glaze of saliva over it all. Up and down you swish the muscle with your bed of taste buds, taking a slight interest in the texture and flavor of the Toxicroak\u2019s private flesh. The heat, oddly enough, excited your mouth to dig in more powerfully for your lips to peck wet kisses to the cock\u2019s head. Plopping off your mouth from his arousal, you discover the pole of throbbing flesh wiggles happily in its lubricated form while Hex\u2019s fingers rummage through your fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttaining the benefit of your dominator\u2019s pleasure, you swallow down his cock\u2019s flavor before lowering down again. This time, your mouth patiently opens up, a little timid at first as your widened maw scoops up the member\u2019s head, but you instantly retain your confidence at the pre-slickened rod\u2019s summit poking at your mouth\u2019s roof. You shudder at the cock\u2019s extravagant filling and soft texture. The way it throbs upon your tongue, nestled in between your suckling cheeks and spurts out pre. You lick up the slimy fluid in a heartbeat and shudder as it oozes down your throat. Hex closes his eyes as he arcs his back against the bed, crisscrossing his legs over your own backside tightly afterwards while you suck him off. His calves press deeply into your fur, clenching your upper body with loving embrace to show you the frog\u2019s appreciation. Seeing that you\u2019re doing a good-enough job, you swallow the entire rod inside your watering mouth, stuffing quite the amount of space for you to lick. At this point, you then rock your maw over Hex\u2019s pre-drooling cock, bobbing your head back and forth like a hungry feral which forces Hex to whimper loudly. The Toxicroak begins to follow the motions of your mouth, and eventually speeds up to the point where he\u2019s humping into your jaws. His hands struggle to find objects to grip and share his peaking pleasure with, groping and sliding his hands over the bed sheets, his legs, and even push the back of your head closer to his groin. The act has you deepthroating the frog penis, forced to have it wiggle deep inside the entrance of your esophagus as it spits our more oozing contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes roll to the top of your skull while Hex glances at you. Your ears are folded back, your muzzle and cheeks are outstretched to fit the tall rod in dripping a mixture of saliva and pre, your cheeks burn with a glowing red fire, and your garbled murr sound out through the muffling stuffing Hex\u2019s cock has jammed into you. With a final buck, the frog croaks out, curling and stretching his body in and out with his final humps as slimy shots cannon inside your throat. Hot frog seed blasts down the narrow tunnel of your neck and seep into your stomach.  You tremble at the molten cum coursing inside your body, spilling out more bubbling spittle and cum while you gag with each cumshot. Hex releases your head which allows you to back away to breathe. Your panting mouth accepts air as columns of body fluids drip and strand down in a sloppy mess. Continuously swallowing, you lift up off of Hex and still rest on your knees breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith low eyelids and an unclear mind from the exhausting sex, you ask your partner for the night, \u201c\u2026Hrrregh\u2026So how\u2026was that? Hrrghhh\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex calms himself down after his large orgasm, chuckling through his own air pants and leans up with you. Placing a hand to the side of your face, the frog leans in and presses his lips to yours, kissing your slimy mouth with cheerful and soft croaking. You submit to the gesture and wrap your arms around Hex to bring him close, sharing each other\u2019s warmth once more as you blend your mouth fluids together again. Your tongues dance with one another, spiraling, nudging, tasting, and wrestling in the longest and most compelling kiss you\u2019ve ever experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex pulls away and grins, rubbing the fur against your blushing face. You feel embarrassed that the Toxicroak was trying to take in all of your cute features in his tremendous gaze, locking eye contact and never breaking it away. He finally speaks in a quiet yet excited voice, \u201cLace\u2026that was <i>extravagant</i>!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile back at him, \u201cThe pleasure was mine.\u201d You accidentally release a gay little giggle afterwards and the Toxicroak seductively lowers his head in a dangerous expression. Uncomfortably, you ask, \u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow it\u2019s your turn!\u201d Hex cheers in a predator expression. He suddenly pounces on top of you, pinning your back to the bed while he lowers down to your cock. Without even seeing the action, you feel a rough tongue glide up along your knotted cock, eliciting a desired gasp out of you. And in the process of having your own dick being slurped up by the sexy wet dream of a pokemon you amazingly discovered, you think hard and pleasingly about the future to come with Hex. (Your pun was absolutely intended.)</span></div></div>",

Your eyes had flashed open and your body jumped a bit at the sudden chilly air. Both your and Hex's hot actions under the comforting blanket must have mustered some contained heat around the bed. A soft croak welcomes your ears as the Toxicroak rubs his cheek against yours, cooing, \"Mmmmm...good morning Lace. I hope you got at least <i>some</i> rest from last night.\" His arms were crossed around your body, locking you in close to his beautiful and warm figure that rubbed against yours. You shudder under the pleasure of having Hex softly grind his rubbery form into you, stroking his legs and arms at your furry sides that you wish you could just explode with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I surprisingly did. You're very snugly you know.\" You tease back. The frog presses his forehead at yours, staring into your eyes. His hand reaches up and brushes your face all before he leans in, smooching you right on the lips. Making a muffled giggle in the kiss, you felt it was alright to act like this with someone like Hex. It turns out he was the greatest thing to happen in your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLosing the adorable sense of the kiss, it begins to evolve in a binding twist of love, sincerely gifting Hex's body to yours for what seemed like a zipper between your mouths. His tongue slips itself into your maw and dances around inside, wiggling and thickening out to stuff your mouth and take as much space as possible. You moan through the suppressing wall of tastebuds wobbling inside your mouth, licking his tongue's underside during its stretches and widening. The Toxicroak strokes your side, rimming over your hips to reach your waist and cups your genitals. With a soft groan, it gives Hex all the more reason to nestle his conniving little fingers over your loose cock. He gropes the full package, your softened member into his palm as his fingers hammock your ball sac which easily makes you yelp out a high-pitched whimper of arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex pulls out from the kiss suddenly, grinning as he looks away from you. Before you could ask why he stopped, he coyly spoke out, \"Oh? Care to join us? I'm certain we can fit a third into this bed.\" You look over to the entrance to the room, feeling the color in your fur drain to a disturbing once you realized Jackal was standing by it, matching your same reaction. The two of you end up in a silent and dead stare, never moving a muscle or blinking to break the motionless awkwardness you were going through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Typhlosion's cheeks flare up as he begins to back away, \"I...I...I'll just come back later...\" And not a moment sooner, he was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrivel back into the covers, rolling onto your other side and hide beneath the sheets and blanket. Hex checks back and smiles at your embarrassed reaction. \"Oh Lace...what do you care that he knows? Are you ashamed of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peek over the blanket, sighing out, \"Of course not...it's just awkward now, I guess....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex chuckles and pulls you right back in, pecking a kiss at your nosetip. \"Oh please. Jackal was already quirky. Who knows? Maybe he's excited to know you're on the market for a man like him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scoff at the idea and roll out of bed and stand atop the cold, rugged floor. Shivering a little, you see yet another visitor come in. Draxius stood by your only exit, looking off in the direction Jackal had walked away in before saying with an amused tone, \"Hmmm, what a nervous fellow.\" The Drowzee slowly turns his head towards you, and as if it was still like you had met Draxius for the first time, he still intimidated you just as before. \"One could say he was somewhat jealous in hearing last night's little midnight show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat blushing sensation returns to your face as Hex approached from behind you and hugs your waist into his side with a single arm, replying, \"Oh dear. Were we that loud? Oh! Draxius, I'd like to let you in on a small fun fact. Did you know that Lace here gives some of the best blow-jobs one could only dream of? If I didn't know any better, I'd suggest that he's had <i>plenty</i> of practice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chubby Drowzee's expression lit up even more, which didn't help your case of being anxious around the psychic at all. Draxius raises a brow, \"...Really now? You should have chosen my room then, last night. I'm certain we could have had a wondrous time together...\" You grab Hex by the hand and try to nudge past Draxius, not wanting to hear another word, however, he quickly stops you with a halting hand. Continuing, he says with a snicker, \"Oh, it was only a tease, Lace. Now, Gyro and I made breakfast for all of you before you venture out again, and I'd hate for it all to get cold, especially in this weather right now. So come! And fill your bellies with food and not just semen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cock wanted to unleash its fury at the sound of the sexual taunt Draxius stabbed you with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak at hand croaks with an entertained mind and releases your forepaw, leading you towards the main room to eat instead of being by Draxius who also might say other things that'll have you squirming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[<i>Click this link to continue</i> --&gt; <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1799220-Viral-Pokemon-Vore/map/1153121111111111111111112122111111111111111211111112111111212111211111112111121111111111111211111112211111112211111\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/ite...</a>]</span></div></div>",

Herox stomps down onto Jackal as you had been before, crushing the poor fool for a tremor to shake the ground for a brief moment. The Typhlosion roared as his electrocuted form was pinned underneath the scaled extremity. The bird pushed his leg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weight against the writhing Typhlosion, nudging out gags from the trapped fire-type. Herox looks over to the two females tied together in a fearful hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zapdos sent a quick bolt to strike them, forcing them to yell and release each other. Herox quickly swiped them up into his large wings, chuckling mischievously as they wriggle in his scooped grasp to humor the bird.  With a lick of his tongue, he sneered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMmmmmm\u00e2\u0080\u00a6such nice wiggling bodies. I can tell you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll feel great in my feathered sac.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lowered Star first, pointing her face towards the fleshy pillar spitting out pre. The Luxray cried out as she was dunked head first into the bird cock, sucking in quickly for its massive muscled length. Her cries rippled through the slimy urethra walls, as the rod\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slit grappled her body to be pulled inside. Herox released a groan of pleasure, trembling his thighs as his tongue twitched inside his grinning beak. His talons dug into the earth by sheer enjoyment, pressing more force at the Typhlosion growling and wobbling underneath the scaled orange mass. The wing that cupped Bell lowered the Miltank closer to the Zapdos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 crotch, giving her the strange aroma by the bird\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sweating musk. There, Bell found her lover\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feline legs kicking madly out of the cock, only to be slurped inside with a precum squirt afterwards. The Luxray\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tail vanished from the world, sending Bell into a deep panic as she watched Herox\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scrotum swell out on one side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cock throbbed for the cow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fat body, as Bell attempted to slide away from it. Her hooves were sucked inside the gulping member, terrifying the Miltank as the lips worked over her thick sides and belly to roll over her round breasts. She cowered under the tight hot flesh as Herox dragged the rest of her obese milky form inside his lower tunnel. He cooed as the cow squirmed her way down his cock to splash into the pool of cum within his other testicle. The wailing girls struggled in the thick white slime as it began to blend together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, now Lace, I guarantee you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll like this nice serving of cum I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m cooking up for you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Zapdos cheered as he laid down against his back, keeping Jackal contained between Herox\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clutched feet. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow come here my little servant. I need you to drink my hot fluids in order for you to correctly serve me. My seed is tracked by my master, so we know who to infect once it has been injected into a separate body. Afterwards, we can decide the fate of your troublesome follower here\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jackal whimpered as his strength was decaying away from all of his struggles, loosening his body just so the Zapdos can squeeze him even tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou regretfully walk over to Herox, avoiding eye contact with Jackal from your betrayal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you surrender Jackal\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d You thought to yourself as you weakly stood before the Zapdos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 groin. His meaty rod towered up for a sight to truly behold, beading with veins of pre as the seeped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u00a6T-traitor\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d A familiar Typhlosion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice called out. Your ears lower in shame as Herox constricts Jackal even tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSilence, food! You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re distracting my humble servant in pleasuring me. Now, Lace, climb up to my cock. Taste its forming contents, and bathe in the slime.\u00e2\u0080\u009d You simply nod and hug your arms over the loose feathered flesh of his ball sac, as the bulging bag drooped over the land between his hot legs. Struggling to hide a rising boner, you climb over the sac that contained Star and Bell as they digested into Zapdos seed and finally arrive at your destination. The tower of muscled cock. You gulp as you wrap yourself around the rod, opening your muzzle for its globs of pre to slide down into your throat. The murky flavor of the clear goo was somehow erotic, forcing you to randomly enjoy the thick substance. Herox laughs as you practically become seduced by the pre fluids, drinking it down like heavenly waters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour belly throbs at the burning slime, as your own cock rides up along Herox\u00e2\u0080\u0099s during the groping hug. You lick up his warming contents with great arousal, swallowing a good amount before you fall back for a breather. Fat strings of his cock slime seeps out of your panting jaws as your body is suddenly rumbling with a strange feeling. Even after the huge binge you managed to gulp down, your stomach growls for meat, as your member begins to pulse violently for it to stab something. A sudden wave of energy surges through your blood vessels and muscles as a gift for unimaginable power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision is getting blurry and slightly lavender as a voice voids through your mind. \u00e2\u0080\u009c<i>You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re mine</i>.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mad rush of heat flares in your body, causing you to growl angrily while your body is being taken over. Your last recognizable thoughts are of Jackal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s whimpers and Herox\u00e2\u0080\u0099s audible laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing an excellent job, my servant!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Herox called out as he lazily rests his rump upon the ground with open legs. A winged curled over his pulsating cock, fapping leisurely as the Zapdos watched his orders ensue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lucario he had infected was happily swallowing down a Typhlosion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chest, giving off a grumble of pleasure with the fire-types screaming struggles. Its pudgy belly squishes into the dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s maw, presenting the Typhlosion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s genitals a wonderful prize for the predator to slurp up. Herox watched in heated enticement, increasing his masturbating motions to feel the bodies in his sac swirl into the cum, fully liquidated and ready to shoot out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infected Lucario murred during the descent of the Typhlosion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legs dipping into its esophagus, gulping the entire wriggling body down after his feet were licked inward. The canine burped and pressed a forepaw at its jiggling round belly, kneading the yellow bulge as the Typhlosion cried in his curled state. The infected canine plopped down against his rear, squishing its hands deep into the tight round flesh of its furry gut. The fire-type pokemon inside twitched unhappily in response, slightly kicking at the stomach walls of his once companion. Thick fluids began to spurt inside the shamber while he whimpered in misery, cursing himself in failing to stop the Zapdos. On the outside, Herox couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t contain his excitement. Seed strings ejected from his cock, spilling out over his chest and face with each rope of hot cum. The pale fluids slathered his body for the bird to squirm in joyfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough his pants he called out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood work my loyal slave. Now come\u00e2\u0080\u00a6I must take you back to the mountains to tell my leader your pack has been dealt with.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Lucario nodded and climbed onto the Zapdos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 back, clutching the feathers tightly as its belly resumed to writhe by its victim to begin digesting. The two psychic followers disappeared in the mountains, ending your journey you had simply given up on.</i></span></div></div>",

Hex whipped out his knuckle claws, prepared to inject poison into the infected for an easy battle. However, the plan fails when a vine whips across Hex's side in midair, striking the frog to fly back down to earth again. He smashes against the dirt, groaning out hurtful croaks as Gold shines his forehead jewel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jewel still had a small crease though, causing Gold's beam of energy to misfire and shoot in an indirectional angle, exploding the ground beside him to where Eden was almost hit. The Tropius smirked as the Roserade was left to stand alone after Gold's body toppled to ground, covered in soot. She fired out her vines, slapping away the infected Tropius' while Hex struggled to stand. He raised his upper torso by his arms, ready for another attempt to attack. Again, his plan fails once a vine encircles up one of his ankles, flinging the Toxicroak outward to smack Eden away. She cried out as the frog's body came at her in full force, slamming her to collide into a tree. The Tropius bellowed a deep chuckle-like noise from its muscled neck, as its arms reach for Gold's downed body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Golduck quacked as he felt thick meaty hands grasp his arms, squeezing them together to bind his sides. The Tropius craned its elongated throat down to Gold's short body, slapping a pink muscle to glide along the struggling duck's neck and face. The wet tongue coated the duck's face in the steaming drool that thickened into long ropes, bridging across Gold's head as he whimpered aloud. Eden endeavored to recollect her senses, struggling up to only be knocked down by Hex's limp body again. The Tropius used the frog's tied body as a mace, smashing the Roserade to weaken her and the Toxicroak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Eden smashed into the ground for the fifth time, coughing out dust as her leaflet body were gouged with several bents and bruises. Her sorrowful eyes have difficulty remaining open as she tried to lift herself of her caped back. Her energy has disappeared though, inevitably causing her to fall down. The Tropius watched the defeated Roserade plummet as it never stopped its constant licks over Gold's succulent body. It slithered a tendril over her, slowly but surely wrapping her body into a tight coil. The planted spiral lifted the Roserade, dragging both her and the weak Toxicroak to their dominator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tropius let out a single and final whisk of its tongue, releasing his Golduck prisoner from his hot maw. Gold hung down from the infected's grasp, gasping for air as his eyes stared blankly at nothing, all the while his faced showered curtains of the thick clear slime slopping down his writhing form. Just then, another warm wet sensation slickened its way to his dangling tail tip. The duck gulped and resiliently looked down. He yelled in distress as he came to find his tail being sucked down into the Tropius' cock! His feet squished in between its urethra lips, sliding down his legs into the pre-leaking slimy rod of leathery flesh. His squirms adapted into frantic wriggles, forcing the Tropius to groan out its deep voice in erotic pleasure. The penis bulged out from Gold's body as it descended down towards the depths of its swinging balls. The duck's belly was slurped inside, leaving the Tropius to simply let go of Gold as gravity did its natural work for it. Gold quack out sobs as his view of the forest would soon come to a close, making his fate nothing more than a batch of Tropius cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex couldn't fight his hormones' urges, growing himself his own erection while watch the Golduck's head become encompassed by the fat cock head's lips, contracting his body down to stretch one of the testicles within the brown musky sac that throbbed in his presence. Eden groaned, coughing out as she opened her pink eyes. She gasped and wiggled her limbs, grunting as the tentacle around her constricted its strong grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tropius hummed a pleasuring tune, feeling the duck within his ball sac squirm inside the pool of cum he was imprisoned in. The infected plant beast pressed its hands back around its belly, sloshing the beetle that continued its furious calls and buzzing. It had room for one more victim in order for a full batch of cum digesting bodies, and required a victim to erupt that large load into. Lucky for the feral, it had just the right amount it needed to for its pleasure. The Tropius looked back and forth between Eden and Hex, wondering who would be the perfect fit for its mighty pulsing cock.</span></div></div>",

She meekly wobbles within the vine coil as it laddered her down the dark slimy tunnel, driving in her legs, belly, backside leaves and arms, up to her shoulders. The throbbing walls clenched around her plant form and dragged it down, gulping the Roserade to the point where only her crying head remained unentered. Tears dripped from her eyes as she stared into the Tropius' purple gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt lowered its face down, cooing softly that almost comforted the girl. All of a sudden, its tongue slapped up against her cheeks and licked across her face, tasting the salty tears of its victim before its forced its cock to swallow her head. It chuckled defiantly as Eden saw the gesture to be purely cruel. She was sucked down into an orb, pushed into the rising pool of cum the thickly bubbled over her body filling. The Roserade gagged at the feeling, pulling up her arms as columns of the white slime dragged with them. She kicked at the testicle walls as they clenched together, forcing her to curl up to the point that the semen pool surface reached up to her neck. She screamed and wailed in her distress as the Tropius bellowed again, shaking its girth and moist cock to quake with each laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex squirmed uncomfortably, trying to press his thighs over his cock to nestle it in pleasure within his vine bindings. The plant monster pointed its purple eyes at Hex, watching the horny frog struggle to fap its cock by its own legs. The feral grinned in compliance, knowing it picked the right body to hump into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak suddenly felt his body shift as the Tropius teetered onto its back, letting his brown gut and rod to stick out. Hex discovered himself to be be laid out, chest down, over the Tropius massive belly. The tall cock's tip nudged in between the Toxicroak's purple rump, squirting globs of pre juices to splatter over and within the frog's butt. Hex shuddered as he felt the musk of this mighty beast wash over him by its male scent, moistening his amphibious body while the constant wobbles of the belly beneath began to work in the Heracross trapped inside. The frog's cock was flatted between the bellies, expounding with each and every heartbeat Hex's chest thrummed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tropius bucked its hips, slamming the meaty member into Hex's ass, resulting in a loud cry from Hex's mouth. The croaking exploded throughout the floral woods, bouncing off the trees and wind for the whole forest to hear. The length was playfully sliding deeper inside his rectum in a lax motion, pressing as far as it would go within the Toxicroak. Hex trembled even harder as he felt the cock's tip and heat press out from his belly. He loosened his sweating body as the tendril wrapped around him released his pinned state, freeing the frog to escape. However, Hex willingly clasped his arms and legs around the Tropius belly bed, hugging the gut as he willingly began to bob his body back and forth. His horny mind tossed away his common sense as the slimy cock split his body, hammering his expanded ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex cried out with each ram the cock pummeled into him, feeling his abdomen stretch from the cock tip hitting his anal walls. Precum bubbled out of the tight crevices of the frog's anus. The lubricating goo forced the wet slaps of the monstrous cock humps to spurt out loudly, while Hex grappled the swinging gut's sides with his hands and feet, grinding his own cock with the Tropius' waist motions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Splat! Splat! Splat! Splat! Splat! Shplaaat! Shplaaat! Shplaaaaaaaaack! Shplaaaaaaaaack!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slimy sounds of the Tropius' cock sounded out in Hex's innards, squelching louder and gaining velocity. The Toxicroak groaned as his sweating form gliding over the brown dome in rocking motions, as he violently beat his own cock into the tight hot flesh of the Tropius' belly while its rod violated the frog's groin. The Tropius curved its neck to reach its face to Hex's, planting a kiss to smother Hex's mouth. The maw lapped inside the Toxicroak's lips, exhaling its steamy breath into the frog's lungs. Hex shuddered even more as his hands were losing their grip in the massacre of humps, feeling the lumps of Tropius flesh dig into his body from both ends. He stared at the closed feral eyes, finding his own eyes to roll backwards into his skull in pleasure as one last tense cock shove tunneled into his rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis already widened legs stretched out painfully, poking outwards in a straight line as he scrunched his feet and tensed his wrists in great pleasure. A tidal flood of cum bursts into Hex's anus, filling and ejecting the boiling slime to encase all of the Toxicroak's lower innards. Hex screamed excruciatingly as Tropius seed spurted from his mouth as his stomach was flooded with cum. The digested remains of Eden and Gold packed into his slick state, forcing every atom in Hex's body to cry out in arousing bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tropius grunted from the magnificent orgasm, yanking out his cock for cum to fountain from its victim's pucker. Hex toppled off the Tropius' gut, slamming against the floor next to it while panting harshly from the wonderful sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the amount of semen in his system, the Toxicroak was instantly beginning to turn into an infected feral. Violet lights flashed in his pupils as his sloshing belly growled for meat, even if it was full of the Tropius' batch. Hex cried in joy and sorrow for his fate. He was doomed from the start to become eaten or infected, and he preferred his demise this way. His sad croaks change into predatory growls, and all that was Hex was forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A Garchomp howled in distress as venom within his blood vessels forced his body into submission. He fell to the ground, growling as he winced in agonizing pain. A croaking sound emitted from behind the grounded dragon, forcing the Garchomp to look back at his predator. An infected Toxicroak that had been chasing him overshadowed him, watching it smile cruelly knowing that its poison had taken effect. The frog smacked its jaws as it gripped its meal's ankles, hoisting up thee Garchomp's legs to face the hungry frog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak began to lick at his caught prey's scaly feet, feeling them writhe in return as he slathered his dribble over the dragon's wiggling talons. The Garchomp whimpered as his hindpaws were swallowed inside the frog's gullet, fully aware his next stop would be the Toxicroak's stomach, only to end up as its belly fat like many others will.

The tightly wound Toxicroak pecked his head down, staring at the cock head he was \"standing\" on. The moist member sagged it loosened flesh to sweat its musk onto the aroused frog, finding himself overwhelmed by the scent and heat. Hex's cock jumped once the Tropius' urethra opened up, slipping his footpaws down as the inner slick genitalia walls clenched around them to drag the Toxicroak within itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex trembled at the strange event, squirming to escape but to also enjoy the ride. His common sense had been ripped away by his dirty desires, allowing the Toxicroak to fall into a sex-induced state of enticement. He playfully wriggled his legs inside the Tropius' throbbing tower, rousing a few sensational grunts to burst from the cock voring infected. The thought of Hex being swallowed alive by the growing prick to send him within its fat scrotum caused the frog to shiver happily even more, yearning to be plopped into its boiling pool of slimy Tropius seed to become a part of it. Hex could only fathom how large of an orgasm it would erupt from its mighty rod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak hadn't even noticed that his head had been squeezed in between the cock head's lips, gulping the horny toad to dwell into the depths of the Tropius' brown sac of cum-producing orbs. Cold sweat collected around Hex in his shifting descent, making him nothing more but than a bulge distending from the enlarged penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEden's eyes began to sting as her throat painfully convulsed on itself through her sobbing bound state, watching her temporary company wriggle inside the duo-balled bag of flesh. The Tropius grumbled in appeasement and fell down to rest against its fat rear. The colossal plant monster slid its beefy hands to run over the rubbery round gut that sagged above its pre-spurting cock. The sweating member was wedged in between the beetle filled belly and the beating and bulging sac underneath it, churning the duck and frog into thick hot seed. The Roserade funneled tears out from her pink adorning eyes while the Tropius opened its own purple gaze at her in return. After a sloppy slap of its tongue to hit its cheek, Eden was retracted closer the predatory beast as just another offering for its cock to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unraveled vine that once tied Hex was used to ensnare the plant girl's legs, gaping them open as her vagina lined up with the Tropiushood which thankfully was shrinking back to a normal size after stretching around its meals. Still, the rod seemed almost as big as Eden, sending panicking twists to struggle the Roserade's body. She cried out, \"Please...! I beg of you! Don't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sticky wad of flesh shoved into her folds, forcing them to stretch out to even accommodate the cock's head as Eden screamed. The feral smiled while it tunneled its obese dick deeper into the plant girl's love hole, getting a squeaking cry each time to alarm out of her. Her widened pussy squirted out with her own pre-juices, splattering a sap-like substance over the diving cock from her plant body. The maple slime coats the brown rod, giving another roused growl to rumble through the neck of the Tropius. Now that their job was done, the tendrils strapping Eden released her. Before the Roserade could shove herself off, the Tropius instantly clasps a hand over her white flowered head as it began to pump her body up and down, nailing her groin to tauten the ever-stretching walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shrill of physical bliss cried out from Eden's mouth during her mounted ride, feeling the tall cock jab its head to distend from her abdomen and slightly her torso to poke out with each driving hump. Her hyperventilating mouth whimpered out as the Tropius split her groin, \"...Hurr...hurr...s-stop...y-y-you're hurting my...hurr...b-belly.\" Even through the pain, the Roserade couldn't deny that she loved it. Her virginity be ripped away from her by this infected feral was the greatest joy she had ever felt, and the plunging plant woman happily anticipated her its gargantuan load to cum inside her frail body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tropius' exhales grew louder as the round sac spilled along the ground throbbed violently, ready to expel the already seed digested bodies inside its orbs. Against its rump, the Tropius dunked Eden's body one last time, erupting its volcanic cum explosion to geyser into the Roserade. Eden's orgasming cry was immediately deafened by the white slime bursting from her mouth. The stream of thick cum sloshed into Eden's belly, extending it to its full limitations as each monstrous squirt sent her raining maple cum to shower the twitching cock while the Tropius roared loudly. The force of it large orgasm pushed Eden off to fall face first into the plush cushion of the Tropius' belly as its cum-cannoning cock continued to eject the burning fluids. Tropius seed slathered all across the Roserade's body, squirting from her panting maw and waterfalling down her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first and last sex trip was greater than she imagined, and Eden was flooded into the cum induced tiredness of her body. She fainted within the lap of the infected Tropius, soon to become a feral like it to do the same to other innocents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A Plusle anthro dashed through forest with her Minun sister in hand to trail behind her. The two twin sisters continued through pursuit in the woods when all of a sudden, the Minun screamed as a vine wrapped around her waist, tugging the blue and peachy mouse girl back. The Plusle felt the gripping forepaw leave her hand, as she halted to look back at her sibling. The infected Roserade that they were trying to escape stood before them, using its vines to contain the struggling Minun before jabbing its tendrils into the anthro's pussy and anus. The double penetration forced the Minun to cry out as she wriggled along the grass as the Plusle bolted back to save her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moyla! No!\" The Plusle called to her twin sister before vines suddenly entangle her too. She gasped and thrashed within the tendrils, yet it did her no good as the purple eyed Roserade pulled the her closer to it. Throughout the Moyla's moans, (the Minun), she managed to call out in her submissive squirms, \"Risil...ergh...I'm sorry...\" The Minun moaned out as her wet folds were continously raped and fondled by the Roserade's plant tentacles. Risil, (the Plusle), whimpered as she was popped into the infected's mouth head first, finding a wet tongue to dig through he face and mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the squelching sound and murrs of the Roserade thunders around Risil's ears, her only thoughts were of the horrible fate that awaited her, her sister, and this Roserade that lied ahead in the future.

The plant tentacles immediately made their way around the fallen Toxicroak, encircling and coiling around his body. The frog lightly struggled in their spiraled grasp, but did little effort to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, Gold pursued for his escape, evading all sweeping motions of the infected\u2019s vines while getting closer and closer to her. With a difficult angle, the duck managed to jump over just more vine as his cheeks suddenly started to bloat out. A jet stream of water poured from his mouth, crashing the wave into the Roserade to back up. Gold smiled as he landed atop the ground, all until he frowned to see the Roserade suffer little to no damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStupid type difference\u2026\u201d He grumbled as he bolted outward for a different attack. Just then, a vine was able to catch up to his speed, wrapping around his ankle to tug the midair to plummet back to the forest floor. He released a brief quack of surprise from the sudden recoil, as the Roserade\u2019s tendrils hastily ensnared the writhing bird. Gold proved to be a difficult catch with his never ending squirms, constantly wriggling and grunting with the vegetated spiral. The Roserade retracted her vines back somewhat, dragging her meals closer to their demise. Gold yelled and twirled within his tight entrapment whereas Hex limply lowered his head down, remaining still and accepting for what is to come. The Roserade smiled at the single surrendering victim, however he other victim was providing too much of trouble for her to enjoy. Orange spores bursted from the flowers of one of the feral\u2019s arms, scattering over the Golduck to cry out at their touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tightened limbs devolved down to into slight twitches until they froze still just as Hex\u2019s has. The stun spores had paralyzed him. The jolted duck whined out as the tentacles surrounding him begin to knead around his soft flesh, lightly feeling his taut skin along their tips. Even though his muscles refused to move, Gold could feel every poke and nudge the vines gave off as they ventured around his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rumbling growl alarmed out, reminding what the Roserade was here for. Seeing that the Toxicroak silently croaking to himself in soft sobs. His eyes lye shut, his limbs completely still. He would be the Roserade\u2019s first course! She dragged him close enough for her nose tip to touch his face, smile as she opened her maw. Hex leisurely cracked his eyes open to stare into the wet depths that throbbed in their anticipating wait for his filling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold stressed out of his beak, \u201c\u2026H-H-Hex. Stop-p-p\u2026h-her.!\u201d A vine silenced him after that once it had coiled around his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex mumbled back to Gold as he pressured his gaze into the Roserade\u2019s watering maw. \u201cFace it Gold. <i>We\u2019re meat</i>.\u201d Those words would be his last. His face was forcefully slapped against the infected\u2019s broad tongue, allowing it to guide him his way into her gullet. Her suppressed moans rumbled around the frog\u2019s body as his head slid inward. Gold regretfully watched the Toxicroak descend into the Roserade\u2019s throat, bulging it out and sinking downward to her belly as his chest and naval were slurped inside. Her vine coils slowly loosened up as more of his body slipped inside, lowering down to his legs to lift them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tongue slopped its way at Hex\u2019s purple ball sac, toying with the amphibious baggage by juggling the cum producing orbs inside. Hex\u2019s body winced in recoil from the feeling, but remained limp through the entire trip down. The flower woman\u2019s gut began to bulge out from Hex\u2019s head once his firm rump squeezed inside. With a slant head, the infected Roserade gulped down the Toxicroak\u2019s tender thighs, marinating her thick ropes of spittle to glisten his froggy skin and calves. Finally, his feet struck out of her jaws, causing a muffled giggle to wobble along the Roserade\u2019s larynx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe danced her muscled tongue around the footpaws, tasting his soles by dragging the fat taste buds against the undersides. Hex was forced to twitch the extremities, wriggling them about in the open air as his shoulders accompanied him with the hot stomach. The lump of slimy meat slobbered over his writhing toes and soles, slathering more clear mouth fluids to slicken them for an easy trip down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bit her lips past the frog footpaws, slurping them down to follow the legs in the organ awaiting them. Gold\u2019s cock pressed under the coiled vines, pulsing violently with his heartbeat from the erotic sight. The Roserade\u2019s warm pussy began to swell out, glowing a bright green to spill a sap-like substance from her plant form. She licked her dripping mouth to swallow down the rest of the Toxicroak flavored spit and look over at her second course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold squirmed as the purple eyed flower woman began to\u2026</span></div></div>",

Hot strands of her saliva collected and stretched around the duck\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head, drenching his groaning state in the clear slime. The Golduck lightly convulsed in response, grunting from the paralysis as the Roserade shared her mouth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s warmth unto Gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vines that had spiraled around Gold intensified their grip to yank the duck into nose-diving towards the cavernous infected\u00e2\u0080\u0099s maw. His beak slid atop the muscled bed of taste buds which squirm at his delectable flavor. It lapped at the elongated jaw-line as the Roserade moaned in flavorful relief. Her violet eyes closed while her tendrils glided across his petrified form, toiling with his mad drive as the plant whips convulse around his beating cock. The tone item of musky flesh was wrapped carefully around, as the feral uses her now free arm to travel her open vines to the ducks legs and crotch. His thriving thighs and tail are simply coiled up and tugged into stillness while the duck\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head is fully encompassed by the Roserade\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plant woman released a groan of amusement as she grind her legs together, dripping sap between them as her pussy leaked her slimy fluids. The maple substance trickled down in long strands that collect at the grassy floor. Gold grumbled inside the slimy Roserade throat walls as the vines played around with his cock from the outside, pulling at it as they tickled the rim of his anus. They curiously poked the navy blue pucker, tapping at it to feel it clench together from any touch. The Golduck\u00e2\u0080\u0099s member was pulsing wildly during his entire treatment, throbbing within the tendril spiral as the tentacle happily fapped the tightened flesh away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold pondered the thought of being digested by a feral, squeezed into the dark constricting organ as the pool of acid begins to churn your body. Hex was already experiencing that life-ending, yet somewhat pleasuring adventure. Gold joyfully tried to squirm at the thought of being a part of this beautiful Roserade, forming as the thin layer of fat, (if plant pokemon can), becoming a part of tone body, her heavenly flowers, strong vines, and even the vaginal seeping out molten sap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis chest was already gulped inside, allowing the infected Roserade to arrive at Gold\u00e2\u0080\u0099s belly. She tucked her tongue beneath the soft paunch, scooping and tasting around to force more muscle tenses along the duck\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immobilized state. Gold couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hold back his rising heat any longer, as his ball sac thrummed with semen on the verge of erupting. White burning ropes of cum cannoned from his cock, stringing against the Roserade\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chest and green breasts. The pale oozed across her torso, sliding down in thin lines over her Toxicroak-filled belly. The infected roared in a muffled cry, shuddering under the duck\u00e2\u0080\u0099s warming heat as his belly was slurped down and the satisfied penis entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold\u00e2\u0080\u0099s balls tinged once the tongue frolicked over the tense sac. It lapped at the sweating taste between his legs as his tail and calves began to sink down. Gold\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beak could feel a tight opening gape around his mouth, tensing out to force the Golduck inward. He had reached the stomach valve to join Hex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith much effort, the Roserade reached Gold\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taloned and webbed feet. They struggled to move as her tongue basked them in thick goo as the vines had fully unwrapped Gold to tickle at his soles. The Golduck cringed in response as his wiggling talons disappeared into the plant woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold fully slid into the tight chamber that rumbled at his entrance. He was involuntarily pushed against Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body, forcing them have to curl each others limbs around one another for the small confines of the short Roserade. Their saliva covered forms were slapped and locked together, forced into rocking with the motion of the ever-ending vibrations of the rocking stomach. Hex cried tears through his closed eyes, tightly clenching Gold as the duck attempted to finger himself already. The moment was too good to pass up for him, and if he was going to die, then he would pleasure himself as much as possible all the way through it. The Toxicroak grumbled as he felt an outside force tugging at the massive round bulge they formed together, crying out softly to the Golduck, \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u00a6<i>I hate you</i>\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thick acid pool began to rise around them, fizzing at their nourished slimy bodies to start digestion. Gold moaned aloud as he came to his second climax, ejecting his seed over himself and Hex, along with any possible crevice of the stomach. The digestive overtook their bodies up to their shoulders, however, Gold continued to masturbate, determined to get the best demise he could hope for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Roserade belched out loudly. Her leaflet belly sagged out immensely in a soft dome, throbbing by the motions of the masturbating duck within. The carnivorous plant woman laughed in her predatory tone, hissing out as she felt her stomach work on her meals inside. Her vines then began to marinate themselves in the Golduck seed splattered over her chest, collecting it over the tendril tips. Her finger-like vines then reached all over her body, one plunging into her leaking pussy to wriggle inside, two over her chest to massage her spherical breasts, one in her mouth to suck on, and the other two to comfort and knead her belly churning the hides of the frog and duck tucked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infected Roserade laid out an her back, opening up legs wide in her own tentacle bondage workhouse to pleasure herself furiously. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGrrrrrreeeeh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She roared, forcing the vine in her mouth to pop out as sap exploded from her nether lips, sticking around to the grass beneath her. She smiled defiantly, and just as the duck inside her did, she continued to finger around herself, satisfying her horny desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Golduck and Toxicroak suddenly grew still in her fat gut, dissolving away as the Roserade was coming to a second climax.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Gold was traumatized in a mere second. Expecting himself to slide down the infected Roserade's gullet to accompany Hex or crawl up her vagina willingly, it came to his awareness that the Roserade had actually enveloped her mouth around his sensitive cock. The feral wanted to pleasure <i>him</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duck suspected that it was weaken or humiliate him, however he was already bound and paralyzed to even think of escape and the humiliation part made no sense. Did the Roserade possibly find him...<i>attractive</i>? The Golduck's thoughts quickly disappeared once the Roserade worked her mouth along the item of flesh inside her panting mouth. The warm steam exhaled over Gold's crotch, evoking a shot of pre to squirt into the infected's throat. The Roserade smiled lightly with her stuffed maw, swallowing down the cockslime that performed wonders for Gold in the slight motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat began to bead at his skin, heating up as his beak began to shudder. \"...H-h-ho-holy-ly sh-shit...!\" He scantily coped to exclaim. Never in his life had a woman actually give him a blowjob, and to his best guess, this Roserade had plenty of practice. Her tongue lightly scraped along the member's underside, coating a nice wet blanket of saliva over the pre spurting rod. The infected pokemon made sure to toy with its prey before burrowing down to the real treatment. Her tongue curled into a U-shape, squeezing Gold's pounding prick between the budded walls. At that moment, the tongue began to suckle and drag against the cock, forcing Gold to tilt his head back and groan. He was just able to wobble his fingers and tail in an aroused answer to the tugging sensation. Moistened with pre and spit, the Roserade tightly clamped her lips and cheeks around the long rod as she mumbled out accidental enticed whines. Her hot breath clouded over the duck's kneading cock, forcing it to tense up and twitch inside the compacted gooey flesh it was trapped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold jolted his head back in forth while his hands curled into fists. He bucked his hips as best he could within his immobilized state, scrunching his feet as his tail writhed within her vines. Sweat profusely dripped from his body, soaking his groin and undersides with his moist arousal. His musk washed over the Roserade, tormenting her as she spat out his cock, dripping a flood of stringed drool to pour out from her mouth. A vine tied around the end of Gold's cock, holding back his orgasm as he screamed in agony of pleasure. The plant woman tilted her head, wrapping her lips around the meaty pole as her tongue jabbed at it. Her deep panting steamed across the Golduck's already wet cock and balls, heating it to impossible temperatures that Gold couldn't comprehend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nibbled along the blushed prick, squeezing the cock from tightened bottom up to the fat head. Gold quacked a loud bellow, feeling his seed collect at beneath the vine bundle concealing the urethra's path. The burning slime packed against the closed exit, screaming out to Gold's nerves to be expelled. Yet, the Roserade simply wasn't finished yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving Gold tied in the air with the strength of her plant tendrils, the feral tilted the duck's body back, revealing his tailhole to face her with Gold's belly and cock to point to the sky. The Golduck dangled his arms, legs, tail, and even included his moaning head down, desperate to explode. His blushed face heaved air in and out, flopping his tongue from his mouth as his saliva covered dick remained wincing in arousal. The Roserade plastered her face to Gold's sweating groin, brushing her slimy tongue along his anus, which in turn, coerced the duck into cringing again, yelling out helpless breaths. The burning flavor rocketed up like a geyser inside the infected flower woman's mouth. She dug her lips into the dark blue pucker, trickling her thick spit down into his rectum. The feeling of the goo sliding down his anal tunnel was too much for Gold to bare anymore as tears of ecstatic joy overwhelmed him. He cried out as the vine around his cock had great difficulty in keeping its bind. The Roserade in her mid-horny drive looked up at her victim, finding out that it was time for his release. After spitting more into his ass, she retracted her mouth and planted it around his cock once more, stroking its sides to wiggle madly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifted the duck back upright as she finally loosened her vine around Gold's cock. A cannon fired away explosive rounds of cum, flooding the Roserade's face and and breasts. The white slime erupted from the member's head, jetting out frantically to stick over the feral's heaving face. The strands of cum stretched in arc bridges the drooped down while Gold's never ending orgasm barraged the Roserade. Her mouth couldn't contain the invasion of seed into her slurping maw, forced to waste it as it oozed down to drench her green bust and large belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold roared and roared, striving to extend his body in all cringing directions from the massive release. The infected Roserade retracted her finger vines back into their flower bundled homes, dropping the satisfied Golduck smack the ground with an audible wet slapping noise. He fidgeted his entire sweaty form within his grassy bed, quivering for the repeated words through his powerful breathing retractions, \"...Holy sh-shit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Roserade padded her cum coated body to Gold, laying over as she wrapped her arms underneath his slicken backside. She tunneled her mouth into Gold's beak, forcing the duck to undergo an impossibly wild ride as he played tango with each others tongues. Her slimy leaf belly sagged around Gold, twitching lightly from Hex's struggles as the Toxicroak had to sit through a downpour of Golduck cum and saliva to spurt over his curled body, emotionally destroying the Toxicroak as he passed out within the bubbling juices of the Roserade's stomach at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duck suddenly broke the kiss, wondering why the Roserade didn't just devour him in the first place. Gold experienced his second dawning. He remembered being lifted back as the Roserade salivated into his rump, which was odd for him but didn't mind it, but that her bodily fluids entered his body which meant...which meant...he suddenly couldn't remember what he was thinking about. In fact, he began to forget who he was and why his body was sweating so horribly and his dick hurt badly and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes suddenly gloomed a purple hue, flashing brightly as he felt like his body being stolen away from him by someone else. He opened his mouth to speak, but a low growl seemed to be all that he could muster. He soon became lost his sanity; zombified and born anew as just another infected feral to roam and devour innocent pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Roserade watched as the Golduck's vision became ensnared by her saliva, listening with glee as the it released a growl in return. She hoisted her bellied body off the new feral, watching as the duck rose to leak drool from his open beak. That was the end of their time together, as the two infected anthros headed in their separate ways, walking off in different directions. The Roserade hugged her bouncing gut with her small steps, sloshing the fainted Toxicroak inside for a nice willing meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe disappeared into the collection of bushes as the infected Golduck wandered off for a meal of his own.</i></span></div></div>",

The fat sac of milk thrummed at your muzzle's touch, as the Miltank's hoof hands give a quick grip in response. The infected cow mooed and nudged your face into the heated flab, rubbing and grinding your face along the musky wad in circles to slosh the milk inside and massage her belly. You can only groan as the large teats pat and wipe past your face, sometimes squirting a few drops onto it. Your face, now smeared with cow saliva and milk, was forcefully shoved off the udder by the bovine to stare up into her violent predatory gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple pair practically gleam a smile, well as for her tongue, the long muscle flicks across her upper lip in hunger while staring down at your defeated state. You softly whimper as your dampened face returns back to her fat udder with another shove. This time, a teat squishes between your lips, filling your mouth with the lump of throbbing meat. Your stuffed maw gags as the teat is swept over your tongue, settling itself along the bed of tastebuds. The Miltank removes a hand from your head to slap it against her udder, squeezing the tight flab to shoot a stream of her milk down your mouth. The white fluid pours into your mouth, forcing you to swallow the sweet tasting nectar down your throat. With a loud gulp, you tremble at the liquid ejecting out of your esophagus and into your stomach. Your belly involuntarily purrs as the milk spreads over the unconscious Pidgeot, churning the body with much pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou accidentally release a murr of joyful bliss while your tongue begins to knead the underside of the long nipple atop itself, squeezing it for a few more drops of that delicious cream into your mouth. Your senses were dulled down into intoxication. Whatever was in this milk deranged your sanity into crying out for more! You completely forget that this infected's liquids will transform you into a feral like her, but your mind begged and pleaded with all of its thoughts for more of this cow's nectar! You clasp your hands around the obese udder, squeezing the sloshing sac to burst milk out of the Miltank from all four teats. Your cheeks bloat out to an outrageous amount of milk to flood your jaws, as the other three remaining teats shoot streams of milk at your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infected cow mooed a high pitch sound as you continued to grope and squish all of the udder's contents out. You swallow and swallow and swallow and swallow squirt after squirt after squirt after squirt, gulping down for your belly to grow out even larger! Milk began to splatter over your chin from the pressure within the fully flooded mouth, while her other teat cannoned your form in massive puddles of her cream. The white fluids drenched everything around you, and inside you. The Miltank started to pant as you continued to drink her load, as her hands firmly cupped over her large bust, kneading the orbs to slosh the thick liquids in those too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAway from you sat a fat Typhlosion, lying against his back as the infected Luxray sat crouch above his face. His tongue had been dabbing out, licking the blushed folds above him. His mouth muscle strided along her sex line, while occasionally stabbing inside to wiggle about. \"<i>Mrrrrowl</i>!\" The feline purred out as her climax was about to hit its peak. All of a sudden, your mouth is plopped off the Miltank's udder, disappointing you once her fat teat slid out of your milk drooling maw. The massive bovine slammed down against her rump, placing a hand to rub and stroke her snatch as she mooed out in utter ecstasy. You lazily plop on your back into the puddles of her udder's fluids. Your belly gurgles at the colossal size your gut protrudes out, giving the Pidgeot inside you a pool of milk to bob in. You respond with a low groan as your forepaws do their best to rub and ease your stomach's painfully stretched size. The milk along the wooden flooring seeps into the creases and cracks of the panels, as you heave air as an erection throbs and slaps your fat furry gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flip your head to the side for a disoriented sight of the Luxray screaming out as her orgasm waterfalls down onto Jackal's blushed face. The horny Typhlosion gladly drinks her hot fluids, licking up any drops he may have missed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Miltank suddenly hugs her heavy arms around your expansive belly, massaging the fuzzy girth as she humps her underside along the sloshing globe. Her pussy glistens her pre-juices to stick amongst your fur, slickening it in a trail of clear goo. She slides her crotch up and down your belly, causing it to jiggle in quaking motions to force even more moans from your mouth. With the amount of milk in your system, you finally realized how quickly you could turn. It could happen any moment now, yet, you accepted the fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were too weak to carry on this quest, and because of it, you had failed. You had given up. You thought to yourself on how you could hope to ever defeat this psychic culprit to the infection if you could be defeated by a cow's udder. Jackal was just as doomed as you were, and Hex and Gold were probably kicking and squirming inside some feral's belly right now. Finding that your demise would be from a tasteful calming end instead of being eaten alive, you willingly rest your head back and close your eyes, awaiting for the infection to overcome you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Miltank bellowed loudly from the boarded medic house, vibrating her lungs violently as her orgasm splattered all over the Lucario's sloshing belly. The cow shivered as the warming heat exited her body and onto the floor as she stumbled back. The creaking floor groaned under the weight of the fat canine's body, as the heavy clops from the Miltank's hooves didn't make it any easier for the flooring. The cow looked over to its companion feral, watching smother the Typhlosion's face with her tongue as the fire-type responded with enticed moans. Her let the cat's tongue slither and writhe within his open mouth, as his boner pulsated from the oral pleasure he gifted to the Luxray's vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe purred before placing her groin at the Typhlosion's face once more for another go. The Typhlosion began to lick at the throbbing hot flesh as the vertical lips began to quiver. Urine streamed down the feline's legs, spewing onto her victim's face as he oddly drank it, too horny to care what it was. Her golden brew steamed onto his head as his eyes began to fade into purple. She lifted her body back up with trembling legs, watching her pet turn into a feral like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Miltank stretched a witchy grin before looking back at her victim. The Lucario grumbled awake and hoisted his backside off the ground. He murred as his belly sagged over his legs with his stomach churning gallons of milk and a body inside. He rubbed his forepaws over the massive gut sagging out of his abdomen, shining purple eyes for a satisfied gleam. The thunder outside boomed across the sky, and your story ends here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of you, more survivors will become infected, and as one of them, you will devour many innocent pokemon before being eaten yourself. Hope the moment of appeasing your sex-driven desires was worth it.</i></span></div></div>",

You stared deep down the Miltank's open maw, revealing her lowered fat tongue and saliva columns to stretch from the roof to the flooring of her gaped mouth. Moist breath exhaled onto your face, dampening your fur while stinging your eyes. Wet muscles suddenly clamp around your muzzle, dragging your entire head in! You whimper softly as your limbs fail to move by the Seviper's poison, lightly twitching from the pain each endeavor costs. Your hindpaws lightly wriggle in compliance and your muscles weakly tense up. It was the best effort you could do to survive. The Miltank muffledly laughed at your sad attempt and resumed to eat you. Your shoulders squeeze past her flexible lips, enveloping over your torso and back, and finally arriving at your swollen gut. Your legs helplessly slide along the cow's udder and belly, tickling the short fur from the soft touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal, on the other hand, received the bad end of the deal. His head was fully crammed between the Luxray's ass cheeks, as the infected cat constricted her rump together to suck his writhing shoulders in. She purred at a loud volume, growling some as the Typhlosion roared within her rectum, causing the anal walls to vibrate while the drag his heavy hide up. The Miltank, at this point, was continuing to work on swallowing your Pidgeot-filled belly fully down, struggling with too much to squish the fat in. You grunt within her thick throat, sobbing in a grim tone as the wet muscled walls slide you down in slow shifts to your dark hot doom. The Miltank's tongue dances under your furry belly, jabbing at the stout flesh and toying with the round flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith much luck for the infected cow, she is able to fully encompass your massive stomach down into her neck, denying you any hopes for survival. \"<i>I was...too weak to stop a Miltank. I couldn't even help Jackal take her down.</i>\"\u00c2\u009d You insult yourself in deep thoughts. Your body is lowered down the tube of tight slimy flesh for a pucker to open around your face. You were arriving into the Miltank's murky stomach. The cow happily lapped at your groin, grinding her slippery warm tongue over your brick-hard erection and bloomed knot. She scooped your furry balls in the roll of her tongue tip, juggling the weighted sac as her teeth nibble your cushioned rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour rear end is gulped inside, removing your brief moment of happiness as you nose dive into the squelching sac chamber of her belly. Your trembling legs are licked over by the fat cow's tongue, sliding past the muscle to marinate your black fur all until she arrives at your footpaws. The budded tongue wiggles and worms its way over the sensitive pads of your feet, poking the soft skin as saliva oozes around the extremities. You sorrowfully wiggle them in return, giving the Miltank her final pleasure in tasting you while her throat muscles drag the paws for your entire body to slide into the stomach. Your frail frame curls within the slimy prison, as the wobbling walls constrict around you to fit your body shape. You wriggle inside the Miltank as hoof hands clutch your heavy form, shaking you about to jiggle her girth. You sob out loud as the digestive fluids begin to squirt in, tingling your fur. You close your eyes, awaiting to be digested and turned into steamy excrements, pooped out in sloppy patties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Miltank sloshed her massive belly around, forcing the Lucario into a deeper submission. The cow licked her lips as she peered over at the Luxray. Typhlosion feet pointed out of her rear end, scrunched and tensed in complete desperation. The two paws suddenly loosen up once the cat used her long tail to tickle their soles, forcing them to wiggle more for the Luxray's pleasure. They're suddenly slurped up into the musty tailhole between the furry cheeks, bulging their way into the fat belly the Luxray she protruded out. She growled happily as her meal moaned inside, constantly struggling in a desperate fritz. She simply patted her hands atop the massive gut, lying down on one of the beds as the Miltank did the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir shifting stomachs came to a halt as they slept their digestion off, breaking down their fat victims for energy on the next day.</i></span></div></div>",

Your fat body is raised up onto your buckled knees, posing you up to stare at the Luxray face-to-face. Her purple gaze simmers through our fearful eyes, seemingly to crumble your soul to the depths of your chest from sheer terror. Her mouth released her tongue to splat against your face. It makes a quick scrape across your cheek, rousing a satisfied murr from your predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infected feline immediately dominates your face by her mouth, smothering and covering your face to drip large amounts of her hot saliva down your body and past your fat belly. It collected it long strands to seep through your fur, while you quiver in the heat as an answer. The Luxray completely licked her tongue over your entire head, not missing one spot to be left dry. She removes her maw from your slimy face, turning around to reveal her backside, and to your pleasure and displeasure, her fuzzy large rump. Her black furred cheeks opened up, presenting a small pucker to pulsate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou catch a whiff of her lower musk, gagging a bit in distaste, yet your sheath chimes in with a happy rumble from her horny musk. You felt very indifferent on whether or not this was a pleasurable way to go down. However, the Luxray's intentions where with your body going up. She firmly nudges your muzzle in between her furry ass cheeks, as her anus opens up to take your nose-tip inside. You thrash with all of your drained might to pull away, yet the musky pucker swallows your face inside her rectum, pulling in the rest of your head. Your suppressed groans vibrate the anal fleshy walls around you, forcing her to growl out from lovely enticement. Jackal also received an interesting way of being devoured by having the Miltank squeeze his footpaws within her blushed pussy, absorbing the legs to slide as they kick out in anguish. The Miltank smiled as shivered with pleasure, have the constant twists and turns of the Typhlosion's leg struggle within her throbbing walls. Jackal squirmed along the flooring, grunting and losing energy in his endeavor for life. However, a thick and tall erection had sprouted from below his jiggling belly, beating against the round flab of his furry ball-sac tingled with excitement. Even through the horrors of being unbirthed, the Typhlosion noticed how awfully warm the fat cow's body was as pre-juices squirted out onto his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour torso slips into the lower tunnel, as the Luxray's musty hole gulps around your sagging gut inside to bulge out the cat's blue-furred midsection. You continued to squirm and wriggle despite the fact that you knew you were a goner. The Luxray, on the other hand, enjoyed your slow ascent as she clasped her forepaws over her large bust, groping and swirling her fuzzy breasts in definite excitement. Her legs trembled to stand as the cat's cunt continued to leak her lower fluids in trickling down her sexy calves. Your crotch is involuntarily pressed against the tight confines of her rectum once your waist was swallowed inside, as the shifting walls rub up along your hard member, You angrily yet happily groan while the hot moist walls did their job in pleasing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour writhing legs sink up in between the infected Luxray's ass cheeks, arriving your wiggling footpaws to her tailhole. It clenches and tightens around them as the feline anthro uses her starred tailtip to leisurely poke your feet all the way in. The compacted dry hole constricts your paws inside, ending your trip as your body squeezes into the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Luxray purred loudly for her victim to hear. Her struggling belly bloomed out to a wondrous size, wriggling and bouncing is discomfort as the fat Lucario inside struggled. Her steaming stomach walls massaged and gurgled around his wobbling form, shifting the thick stretching muscles over the weak canine's cock, forcing a howl of ecstasy. The Luxray felt her meal shoot ropes of his cum inside her stomach, sticking to the slimy walls and her victim himself. She purred as she stumbled over to the infected Miltank to watch a Typhlosion's grumbling head squeeze past the cow's nether lips as they blasted their orgasm across his face. The fire-type was fully dragged inside, squeezing into the womb to sport the bovine's belly to an even larger size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two infected females chuckled in witchy hisses as they rubbed one another's bellies against each other, working on the whining bodies inside.</i></span></div></div>",

The duck fell upon the forest floor, having the hot semen rain down against him in heavy wads to drench his body. His amphibious-bird form was smothered by the goo, coughing and gagging it out as the load never ceased to shoot out. The ropes fell on top of him, marinating him in an entire pool of the bubbling seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold tensed up, as his mind went insane. His brain couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t handle what had just happened to both him, and Hex. The Toxicroak\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body was\u00e2\u0080\u00a6all around him. Gold was slathered in what was once Hex, causing the Golduck grow lightheaded and dropped back against the ground, splatting in the cum patch again. From the mortifying experience, he had fainted, ironically making him a sitting duck for Rune. The Heracross tried to regain his composure from the extensive orgasm, just to find the Golduck sitting motionless in his seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, yet awkwardly happy, this saved him time to go find the Gold duck anyways. He made grabbed the duck\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thick tail and lapped his tongue over it. His cum made the flavor scream out in a tasteful sensation. Rune wanted more. Lowering down, Rune rested his body over Gold, licking and swallowing the cum around his body. The Heracross murred and patted his stomach, feeling it fill up with his own seed. The Golduck was bathed in the beetle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s saliva, still remaining unconscious throughout the entire treatment. The Heracross hugged his new toy, rubbing his small belly to spread its sticky semen across it. Getting up to his knees, the bug balanced his soft prick at the base of the Golduck\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anus, while he tightly grabbed its ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTime for the ride of your life.

Right there and then, he stabbed his member deep into Gold\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rectum, humping away at the duck\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motionless body for another go at his enjoyment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Rune kneaded his bulging stomach.

After a prideful belch, Rune stroked and jiggled his new fat belly, shaking the bird meal inside the outstretched organ. The Heracross defiantly claimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks for the easy snack!

The Heracross grinned, fully aware that Hex had succumbed to his new master\u2019s wishes. The Toxicroak slid his inner, slick cheek walls along the sides of the penis, tightening and stroking its sides. The prick spasmmed on the tongue, while the muscled bed brushed its saliva along the underside of it. Hex had surrendered and fell victim to his own dirty thoughts. To be honest, he saw little reason to not obey Rune and abandon such an opportunity. For whatever reason why Rune decided to show this sudden dark and dominant side of him, Hex was infatuated by it, and begged to be punished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRune placed both of his hands on top of his new sex-whore, getting a good grip to rock the Toxicroak\u2019s mouth around his large shaft. \u201cOh, so you\u2019re finally going to be an obedient little slut, eh? You dirty eager frog!\u201d Rune began to pummel Hex\u2019s face with his groin by smashing his crotch against the horny Toxicroak, causing Hex to violently tremble under Rune\u2019s dominant power. The cock tunneled down to hit the back of Hex\u2019s throat, retreating back to just stab it again. Hex began to bubble saliva from his full mouth, as his eyes began to circle to the back of his skull. The Toxicroak lacked any oxygen in his lungs, as his body began to cringe and shake from the beetle\u2019s forceful motions. He was dying as he sat on his knees, having both hands lose their grip in lack of strength. As the world darkened around Hex, the sounds of the wet slaps the Heracross beat into Hex became muffled in sound, while the heavy breaths and moans from Rune died down. Sweat seeped from Hex\u2019s amphibious body, slickening his skin to the point where his laid out legs began to slide in small shifts from Rune\u2019s massive humps and slippery sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex\u2019s lowered eyelids closed all the way, as the sex-driven toad was on the verge of passing out. Rune suddenly shoved the Toxicroak\u2019s mouth off though, sliding out his cock from Hex\u2019s mouth as the frog fell onto his back. Hex gagged and cried out, violently breathing again as tears welled up in his wide eyes. With his moist backside among the soft grass patch, he laid there to heaved more air into his chest in a sweaty mess, as his satisfied penis started harden once more, sporting its full stiff height a moment later. Rune approached his toy, while saliva dripped off of his burning cock. Clawed hands gripped Hex\u2019s calves and it lifted the frog\u2019s legs to rest atop his shoulders. The knee pits hooked on, as the legs folded over the blue beetle\u2019s back. Rune nudged Hex\u2019s rump close to his steamy shaft, poking it at the crevice of the Toxicroak\u2019s slick cheeks. The Heracross was able to speak between each of his loud breathes, \u201cAlright you fuckin\u2019 whore\u2026hrrr...your slutty needs been dealt with yet...? Nngh\u2026Well have they?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex groaned out in misery, panting out moist breath as he attempted to answer his master, \u201cN-noooo\u2026P-p-please just fuck me already\u2026\u201d Rune bit down violently on Hex\u2019s legs, forcing the Toxicroak to cry out loudly. Rune snickered, \u201cC\u2019mon, I can\u2019t hear you\u2026heh\u2026You want me to fuck your bitch ass or not?\u201d Hex groaned as his hand gripped his thriving cock, striking it with tight grabs as the purple ball sac hanging below slapped against his crotch. Through his grappling pleasure, Hex screamed out, \u201c<i>I\u2019m your bitch! Just fuck me alre-AAGH</i>!!!\u201d Before the Toxicroak finished his sentence, Rune had stabbed his rod into Hex\u2019s ass, lubricated by the frog\u2019s own spit. It sank deep into his rectum and started to force its way around, just as Hex\u2019s mouth had done before. The frog cried out as his split cheeks were violated by the Heracross\u2019s manhood. His defiled rear ached with each passing hump, as the claws gripping his legs tightened, stabbing them to point where they didn\u2019t pierce through his sweating flesh. The purple cheeks gripped the cock as it made one final stab, as Hex cried out with tears streaming down his face. His feet scrunched together in the air, and Rune bellowed a pleasurable yell. Bursts upon bursts of cum flooded inside Hex\u2019s anal tunnel, filling every crevice to burn inside his body. Hex whimpered as semen spilled out from his anus as Rune jabbed his cock back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Heracross dropped the Toxicroak\u2019s legs, letting his dominated slut lay in anguish as Hex continued to masturbate violently along the forest floor. Hex lay against his side, panting and whining as he continued to stroke along his shaft. His body dripping with sweat, white slime leaking out of his anus, the Toxicroak beat his palm against his tuckered cock, finally rising to his second orgasm. Rune approached the horny frog to watch Hex spurt out a smaller amount of cum. The liquid splatted at the grass by Hex, which forced him to fall against his back again, hyperventilating. The Heracross stepped in front of Hex, looking down and admiring the Toxicroak\u2019s sleek body. His tongue brushed along his mandibles, giving the beetle more dirty desires on schemes he could torture his toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the bug\u2019s belly growled to signal Rune about its hollowness.

The Heracross moaned in delight, as his hands began to brush along Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms to feel their slick skin slide against his exoskeleton. The blue beetle detached his mouth from Hex, smirking with it as it opened wide for the Toxicroak to stare into. Hex stared down the dark tunnel before him, watching it throb in impatient premonition. It drooped and reeked of drool while his tongue ducked down to open enough space for Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head to enter.

Every anthro was doomed from the start, and Hex would rather be devoured by a sane pokemon than some ravaging beast whose only purpose to eat and poop its victims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex ceased his struggles and cried to himself during his descent. Rune watched as Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legs stop thrashing, and his arms stopped resisting their pinned state. Rune smiled with the best of his ability from his full mouth, and gulped the sweat covered purple frog deeper inside of himself. Rune\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cheeks bubbled out, bugling his throat and chest out from Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s filling body. They occasionally shuffled from Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slight twitches, but Rune could easily handle that. The Toxicroak\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chest slipped past the tongue, letting his floppy rod sag down across the muscled taste buds. Rune throbbed the tongue around the satisfied meat, licking it to slap the cock around as it tasted his tightened balls. His groin slipped into the esophagus, letting his tender calves sink past to arrive at his feet. Rune snickered a muffled laugh, and ate the wiggling frog paws. The Heracross belched loudly, as the Toxicroak slid inside the stomach to expand the organ to a great size. Rune\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blue belly stretched out to a beautiful orb, pulsating from Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inner movements. Hex, curled up and hopeless, writhed his entrapped form, pressing his hands and feet against the slimy stomach walls only to feel rubbing from the outside in response. Digestive juices splashed against his body, slickening his frog skin even more. Hex groaned in agony as his air depleted, trying to climb his way back out. Rune jabbed a fist into his fat gut, punching Hex to stop his ascent. Hex slid back and closed his eyes. He admitted his death to overtake him, for he surely would not want to live in a world of rapid sex and voracious survival. He happily fainted away, as Rune hugged his hefty belly, churning the Toxicroak into his energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Rune slapped his massive beetle belly, watching it slosh around to torture the Toxicroak inside. His cock, moist in the cold saliva from his meal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s previous blowjob, hardened out to a stiff size from his new adored weight. The Heracross ventured out back to the lake. He needed to separate the two anthros if he wanted any fun and food. That was the entire purpose of Rune\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seduction to Fex, or whatever the stupid frog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name was. Rune could care less about what his meals\u00e2\u0080\u0099 names are, as long as they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re filling and delicious. That Golduck would surely make a nice victim\u00e2\u0080\u00a6and meal.</i></span></div></div>",

The wet footpaws cringed in the flattened grass, feeling the dull plant blades brush and stroke the sensitive amphibian skin to tickle along their undersides, poking out between each of the three spherical toes. Rune fixed his edacious yellow eyes on the Toxicroak\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet, adoring their striving trembles. His hankering of podophilia began to kick in. Bound by his own greedy libido, the Heracross clutched Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ankles, dragging the frog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body against the ground towards himself by a violent yank. The soles of Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet were nudged up against the seed covered meat of Rune\u00e2\u0080\u0099s groin, slathering their undersides with the pale slime. The Toxicroak mumbled happily, \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u00a6Eh-h\u00e2\u0080\u00a6eeee-eh-ehhh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding his soaked legs, Rune forced his submitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet to rub along his sated shaft to enjoy an after-sex footjob. The anthro frog yelped through the crotch treatment, digging his sticky seed hands in the grass from the blissful feeling. For his dominator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pleasure, the Toxicroak leisurely stroked his hindpaws around the kneaded cock, as he wobbled his toes to tickle a rouse from Rune. The Heracross shivered in compliance, but burrowed his hands into Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s froggish flesh. The slick skin bent under the beetle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claws, bruising from the sharp digits to push another brief croak from Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chin sac. Rune lifted the frog legs up to his mouth, slithering out his tongue to dab at the struggling feet facing it. Hex cried more tears of agony and joy, licking up any of the salty drops himself while the Heracross nibbled his mandibles around Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s toes. Rune chortled a menacing chuckle. He glared down at his victim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s half-conscious face, panting out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFuckin\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u00a6hrrugh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6toad. Guess what\u00e2\u0080\u00a6? Your little sweaty meat is gonna fill my belly. I can hardly wait to feel you squirm inside my belly\u00e2\u0080\u00a6heh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6to feel you digest inside me alive. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re nothing but my fat\u00e2\u0080\u00a6right?!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hex only responded with a few more croaks, all until he coughed out one more breath. The Toxicroak lay against the ground within his sweat and cum puddle, passed out. Rune huffed at the horny slut, and embarked on his dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motionless feet were squeezed inside the bug\u00e2\u0080\u0099s maws, gladly accepted and slurped inside the tight confining muscles. Rune\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tongue basked and tasted the Toxicroak footpaws, throbbing in complete sensation of their ecstatic flavor. It wriggled around his toes, toying with them as it swept across the frog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heels. The Heracross\u00e2\u0080\u0099 throat convulsed around the extremities, sucking the still paws down to its ankles. Rune fell upon all fours, resting among his hands and knees to slip the Toxicroak\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faint form down his gullet. Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legs slid deep into his salivating maw, while Rune stabbed his claws into the dirt by sheer pleasure. Chomping down past the calves, Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s satisfied genitals spilt in between Rune\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lips, giving the Heracross a great opportunity to suck around the wet sac for a flavor bonus. Sweat and cum dripped from the Toxicroak\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beaten form, and Rune growled while forcing a hand around his cock for a second round, awaiting the pressuring joy of ejecting his pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak\u00e2\u0080\u0099s torso was fully encompassed, arriving Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head and arms to their final destination. The beetle increased the speed and power abusing his cock, flopping and straining in the harsh treatment. Rune\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tongue nudged around Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moist backside to erupt another growl of enticement to throb around the Toxicroak\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body. With much effort, Rune heaved up to a full stance, lifting the remaining portion of his meal to easily slid down the rest of the Heracross\u00e2\u0080\u0099 body. Rune could even feel Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet enter his stomach and stretch the organ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tight walls. It encased them tightly, and nudged his legs to begin folding inside. No longer needing to hold his frog treat any longer, the blue bug instantly shot his other hand down around his wincing member, beating the poor pole of meat with both hands. The frog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head had already entered Rune\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth, forcing his arms to fold up above him. Hex\u00e2\u0080\u0099s form bulged and stretched Rune\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exoskeleton body at an erotic sight, as the lumps lazily began to group together at Rune\u00e2\u0080\u0099s belly. The Toxicroak\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands were seal behind Rune\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lips, only to be swallowed down the bug\u00e2\u0080\u0099s esophagus. The Heracross couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t contain his tension a moment later once he throbbed at the motions and rumbles entering his stomach. He gave his cock a thorough and final beating for it explode a second orgasm, shooting out into the puddle of sweat Hex once laid upon. He fell against his bum, yelling through his small breaks of oxygen. The blue beetle savored the boisterous belly spilling over his legs. It rested heavily against the ground, growling in satisfaction from its new filling. Rune hugged his arms around the working form, feeling it convulse and squeeze the foolish Toxicroak for a burning demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Gold fell against the muddy ground of the pond\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coast. The Heracross he watched to leave with Hex had suddenly come back with a full belly. The Golduck automatically knew what had happened to his traveler, and figured the homosexual deserved it for being so na\u00c3\u00afve. However, sitting upon his back and heavily beaten by Rune, The Golduck could only growl out in painful misery to curse his attacker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRune stepped out in front of the defeated duck, laughing in amusement. He stroked his large gut as he sneered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTough luck duck! You thought you could get the drop on me? Man you must be pretty stupid to attack someone who just ate your dumb friend. Wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you take a moment to ponder about my power?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He walked closer to the fallen Golduck, only to get spat in the eye from him. Gold snickered through his pain, but Rune only continued to smile as he rubbed the saliva from his face. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in for it now, food. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to make this your worst day\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRune knelt down and bit at Gold\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taloned-webbed feet. Gold quacked out in pain as Rune forced more hurtful chomps along the duck\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bruised legs. Gold whimpered and squealed at each chomp, giving up in struggles as the Heracross made his way up the duck\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body. He would soon join Hex in the bug\u00e2\u0080\u0099s belly, digested and mashed for the Heracross\u00e2\u0080\u0099 body and energy.</i></span></div></div>",

Your paws had been swallowed inside a vine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head! The plant tentacle encompassed your feet to case its spherical lip-like structure up around your ankles, stretching its width once your hindpaws bulged out of the green tube. The vines held your limbs to reach out at their full lengths, reducing your struggles to become pointless flinches. Jackal, in the same fashion, Choked up once the vine around his neck tightened together, strangling the bound Typhlosion into suffering. I caused him to kick his legs out over again. Allegedly, the Bayleef loved to have his victims struggle. A vine that had wrapped upon Jackal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ankles twisted to suck his footpaws inside; all the while the Typhlosion gagged and cried out occasional tears to sink from his eyes. The salty droplets curved their way down his face and splat against the grass underneath him. It was a horrible sight to witness, and there worst of it was that you could only wait and watch for the infected\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s devious sick plan to unfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour legs stretch along the innards of plant tube, slipping over your waist as the tentacle that had tied most of your body began to unravel. Your mouth gaped open to yell in the demented anguish, just to receive a vine to welcome itself into it. Plunged within your maw, it wiggled and squirmed its way around mouth, sickening you by its wormy effect. The devouring tendril ambushed your arms and sides, surrounding them to scoot deeper into the tunnel. Your bloated mouth gagged and sobbed throughout all of the abuse, as for the Bayleef, it continued to snicker and rub its empty stomach, stroking along its pale-yellow gut sagging beneath it. The belly growled in utter hunger from deprivation and anticipation. Your other companion was now up half-way into the voracious cirrus. Your own yellow belly was pressured into the vine, spanning the sides to stress around the boisterous fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eyes seemed to roll far back into his head, all the while his face and been flushed red, dripping sweat. His weak arms made feeble small swished through the air and a strand a bubbled drool sank down out of his mouth. You closed your eyes to look away from the horror. You had expected him to die there and then, all until you heard a violent gasp through your ears. Peeking up, you noticed the vine strangling Jackal had released his throat, allowing the dying Typhlosion to breathe once again. His eyes fluttered in fast paced blinks to return to normal and his facial coloration returned. A red crease mark was left to scar around his neck, as his chest made powerful blows of air to circulate inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would all be pointless though, as that pummeling chest of his would sink deeper into the vine slurping him up. And as for you, the tentacle had already made its way to your neck, rippling in triumph. Jackal gives you once last empathetic look before you disappear into a greenish-black darkness. You felt the rubbery tube vibrate your entire body to a pucker hole which snapped around your footpaws. The tight plant organ sucked you inside the compressing chamber, closing up right after your head slides through. You curled up in the new environment. It was dank, slick, small, and for the most part, slimy. You realized that you had hit the Bayleef\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stomach. A recognizable gurgled echoed around you, as the stomach walls squeezed and contracted you around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was over. The infected had won. You would become nothing more than fat for this pokemon, jiggling around and the Bayleef would continue to eat other pokemon like you until your world was extinct. It was the worst discouraging you could think of. A pucker gaped open inside the stomach, and Jackal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s kicking footpaws squeezed their way inward. Pressed into his legs, you whimpered softly as the rest of the crying Typhlosion slipped out of the vine and into the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Bayleef riveted the throbbing green bulges distend out of the two vines. The ovular orbs wobbled their way to the infected\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s backside, squeezing into its stomach. The Bayleef released an enticed growl as its belly began to expand outward to fit the two sobbing anthros into its underside. It protruded out to sag out greatly between the Bayleef\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thick legs. Digging its feet through the grass during the embracing moment, and rolled onto its back, placing its fore-hands around the peachy globe atop itself. It pressed into the flab, feeling the struggles deep inside while listening to their pleas. It aroused the Bayleef. It wanted to feel and hear more. The infected plant pokemon slapped the fat belly around, jittering the fat Lucario and Typhlosion to fumble around each other. They slid their feeble drenched bodies across the slimy walls and digestive juices, whimpering and groaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter rubbing the gut a few more times, the Bayleef hurled itself back on all fours, getting an erection just from its belly bouncing from the force. It walked deep into the patches of tall grass, swaggering its way through the forest with a hammock of a stomach to sway back and forth with each heavy step. It could feel its juices working on the hides of his writhing victims, as they cried out for the last time. The Bayleef could hardly wait until it could dump their leftovers as slops of excrements, for then, it could hunt all over again.</i></span></div></div>",

Gravity shifted in a peculiar way when the ground under your hind paws disappeared without warning. Your entire body was lifted up from behind, forcing the back of your head to press into the Sudowoodo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wide mouth, which ensconced around your ears and noggin. Your heart skipped a beat as the elastic lips engulfed your muzzle to wedge inward, sinking your upper body down along its tube-like body during all of your tussling and scrambling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears were forced to listen to the muffled distant rumbles of its squelching innards, breathing, and loud purring. Your legs were striving through the cool air outside, while the rest of your body was beleaguered in hot damp muscles, constricting and squeezing your limp frame in a shroud of saliva. From the outside world, Jackal was suffering from shock after the Sudowoodo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earthquake, jerking in short spasms along the grass floor as Hex dug himself out of a pile of rubble. Gold, who was left with the infected Gastrodon, suffered a deadly blow when the pink and brown slug rammed its head forward, flinging the Golduck off into the creek water. Gold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unconscious body floated up to the river surface, with his head and belly sticking out of the water, leaving his arms, legs, and tail to drift underwater in slow waves. The Gastrodon licked its lips and swam its way to the out-cold blue duck. Its mouth smooched around his beak, encompassing his head inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to your ill-fated demise, your waist slurped its way down into the throat of the infected Sudowoodo. Your legs, debilitated of strength, fell limp to the biting jaws of the mockery of a tree anthro as they slumped into the feral mouth. Your tail-tip was encased behind its wet lips, concealing your body to be packed and digested into the infected\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy. Due to the Sudowoodo being neither tall nor thick, your body was left to remain upside-down inside the tight tube of a stomach, with your head restricted into balancing the rest of your body above you. Your hind paws were close to the entrance of the infected tree\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s throat, pressing at the pucker hole of the esophagus. The Sudowoodo rubbed its entire pipeline form, stroking along its stretched bark-like flesh. It grew fat from your body, overhanging its long belly out for all to see. The gut softly bounced back and forth from your struggles, rocking its hips to its glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the Sudowoodo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relishing moment was interrupted by sudden violent coughs. Hex crawled along the ground while gagging out the rest of the dust from his body. The purple-eyed feral chuckled a devilish cheer and approached the frog anthro. Hex, on his hands and knees, stared up to the outstretched reaching arms of your consumer. The branchy hands captured the Toxicroak into his clutches, as Hex was lifted face first up to the Sudowoodo. The infected tree anthro took no time in plunging his open lips forward, smacking themselves at Hex\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mouth to surprise the frog unwillingly. The weakened Toxicroak thrashed around and kicked his legs against the grass, pressing his feet into the ground to stop the sudden embrace. The Sudowoodo continued his pleasure in kissing the frog, taking up his flavor by pecking at his forehead, head-crest, and even cheeks. Hex\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flavor was to his liking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Sudowoodo pressed a spherical leaflet finger at his newly added girth that trembled at the nudge. The Toxicroak and Lucario wiggled around inside the bulged surface of the infected\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s belly, arousing and satisfying it with each wiggle. The Gastrodon worked its slick snail mouth around a Typhlosion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head, as a curled up Golduck cried muffled beckons of distress, shaking and quivering deep inside the jelly-like sac. It swallowed the anthro into its stomach, sending it to curl against the agonized duck that transitioned its movements into weak pushes. The infected Gastrodon slithered back into the water, sated with its filling meal. The Sudowoodo belched proudly, walking back into the dense forest to camouflage himself once more to catch prey. The trees echoed the gurgles of its belly, creating an ominous atmosphere, as the two bodies broke down inside.</i></span></div></div>",

You were fully swallowed inside...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGold panicked and bolted his tired arms and legs, cursing through the bubbled surface when approaching the infected slime creature. You, at the end of the line, were encased in the oval shaped container that was surrounded in a thicker jelly substance, leaving you just enough air to keep you alive and squirming inside the Gastrodon's belly. In your torment within the bright pink walls, there was plenty of light that shone through the infected slug's body, giving you a foggy glimpse of the outside world for the final time in your torture, and it wasn't even clear enough for you to see anything clearly. You felt your predator shift in motions, sliding along the ground for you to bounce inside its tight stomach. Your body felt even more tuckered out from the lack of rest and struggling, resorting in you finally just giving in to await digestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, two webbed and taloned feet sponged in from the hole you had entered, writhing in anguish and slathered in saliva. Gold's feet were unwillingly pressed against your face, pressing your cheek along your muzzle to squish out while his legs were pulled inside. They kicked out, thrashing inside the tight slick container when the rest of his drool drenched body squirmed inside the stomach area. Both of you were pressured to press into each other unwillingly, but Gold wouldn't cease his resistance. He pushed with all of his might with his arms, legs, and back, expanding the throbbing soft walls of his tomb as he barked angrily, \"I will not be some stupid snail's snack! I will not!

It slid its way back into the water, with a trail of goo following it. The infected Sudowoodo on the other hand had a fat sphere bouncing outward from the delicious Toxicroak it had consumed. However, it rammed its crotch back in and out of the Typhlosion's rump, leaving the fire type to yell out from each forceful pound as gripped the grass he laid on. The branches of the Sudowoodo gripped his posterior tightly, as it pummeled its cock inside his tight hole while its wooden belly flopped along his back. Finally, the impression of a plant cried out, releasing his orgasm in a burst of tree sap to fill the Typhlosion's anus. It squirted out of the crevices of the pucker, and the infected feral jammed his cock back out, releasing the fire type to fall completely to the ground, raped and tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sudowoodo chuckled to itself as it walked away from his work, rubbing his belly while the Typhlosion's eyes began to slowly transition into a dense purple.</i></span></div></div>",

You were practically vanquished as it already was, and Jackal's struggles beneath the pile of the infected naga's body were dissipating. You lower your head and patiently wait in defeat before watching Gold's body was about to be raped. The bottom cock poked at the rim of the duck's anus, as Gold trembled at the sick feeling. He was then pushed down with a forceful shove, violently piercing the rod of musky meat into his asshole, causing a loud quack of pain from Gold's beak. The Golduck tinged and twitched occasionally, shutting his eyes as he felt the cock squeeze its way through the tight tunnel before it came to a stop. The shaft was fully inside Gold's anal tunnel. The top cock was then nudging Gold's beaked lips, poking itself in, forcing Gold to gag a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his cocks in position, the infected Seviper naga began to pump the bird against his waist. Gold hollered out muffled cries from each forceful pound, glistening out pre from both ends of his body. The rods humped to their fullest lengths while rising in their pleasure. The Seviper released his forked tongue to flicker about, enjoying the heated arousal, as Gold's cock began to nudge out of his sheath to flop with his ball-sac up and down from the powerful ride. His muffled whines were rewarded with more pre, jamming down his throat and lower intestines. The Seviper's hands tightened at Gold's pinned arms, almost clawing at the Golduck's tender blue skin from its sensation as Gold's tail was forced to lift up higher in order to take the expanding size of the anus-raping cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the infected naga roared out a sensual hiss, blasting his hot fluids in thick gushed inside the poor Golduck. White eruptions of slime splattered out between his rump cheeks and beak! The Golduck was released from the hemi-dicks of the infected serpent with a violent tug, drenched in the hot fountains of the Seviper's orgasm. Being held in front of the erupting cocks, the stout rods cannoned ropes of its heated semen against the Golduck, splashing and sticking to his violated form They fountained all over his body, drenching the whining Golduck to the point of almost covering his entire body.

His belly had expanded out from so much seed that it was bulging out with great proportions, while cum continued to drip from his mouth and pucker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA forked tongue slithered around the Golduck's face, collecting up the Seviper's load to entice the snake even further.

You helplessly cower in fear from the horrific sight, looking away but was still forced to listen to the Seviper's slurps and purring. The large infected naga began to work Gold's cum covered body into his jaws, squeezing him in between his sharp crimson fangs to avoid a bloody meal. The duck wriggled in the Seviper's hands that pressed his chest in, twinging his legs and tail that dangle in lost triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bulge grew out of the Seviper's throat, globing outward in a large black scaled lump that shivered in struggling twitches. Gold's overfilled belly reaches the naga's mouth, giving the infected a bit of trouble to withstand in its mouth. Lifting his scaled hands, he wrapped them around Gold's tight rump, groping the cheeks and pressing them inward. The blue hide squishes together from the serpent's fondling, forcing Gold to groan miserably before his large gut plopped inward. It jiggled and sloshed from the sudden forced as it was quickly engulf by a forked tongue, lubricating it in warm drool. the Golduck slid deeper into the Seviper's neck, bulging out from his waist as his legs and tail are quickly slurped inside. The Seviper pressed his hands against the round bump, wiggling its way down into his belly to bulge out abundantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt his coils circle around your body, acting as they were since you had already given up from seeing his power over you, and they happily rubbed themselves to slither past your fur, compelling you into shivering from its their touch. Finally, it lifted its spiral body of Jackal, revealing the Typhlosion to be passed out on the ground. It's tubed smooth body wrapped around him, heaving his body up to the Seviper's salivating mouth. Just as Gold was devoured, Jackal's faint head was plunged against the fleshy wet walls of the infected's mouth, cushioning and cradling his body as he slid downward through the tight tunnel. His legs disappeared after the snake poked them in with his hand, dipping his finger between his lips before licking it clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Seviper's black finger popped out of his lips, carrying a strand of saliva with it. Your stomach urged you to throw up after watching Jackal's bulge slowly descend into Gold's bulge, forming together for a smooth fat bump throughout the snake's body. The infected naga clapped its hands together, rubbing them together as his mouth slowly craned open to release hot drool to spill out before you. Your cheeks blushed as your eyes began to water as they watched the Seviper claim his final course; <i>dessert</i>! His hands pluck themselves under your shoulders, cupping around them to be yanked out of his coils and closer to his large face. His forked tongue flickered out and began to swipe at your face, forcing pressuring you to moan relentlessly. It traveled its way down your tired body, lapping at your furry chest as it tickled at your flat belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasped out loud once it nudged your groin. The long muscle trickled down to wrap around your dropped sac, pulling and playing with it to taunt your hormones to force your cock to gradually poke out from its sheath. It hardened by each lick, popping out the knot as your balls became more loose as your mouth moaned from the teasing. The infected Seviper chuckled, releasing your furry blue scrotum. It had finished its playtime and moved onto his awaiting snack. Your head suddenly transitioned into a dark pink color, suddenly constricted by slick soft walls. Whines echoed around you as you whimpered while your body was sucked inside the tight confines of the Seviper's throat, accepting total surrender to await your close demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands press deeply into your rear end, groping it inward as your legs are pressed against the roof of the snake's mouth. You feel gravity working you down inside his esophagus in the process of your legs plummeting inward to feel his wet lips clasp around your foot paws. Gurgling vibrates around the tough constraining throat walls around you during your downfall, finally emerging your head into its already cramped and filled stomach. You are pressed uncomfortably between Gold's seed drenched body and Jackal's unconscious saliva matted-fur body as all of you are squeezed together. Rubbing against each other within the steamy gut, both you and the Gold softly sob while pressing around one another. At least Jackal didn't have to live through the embarrassing shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body gave out, passing out just as the digesting fluids began to spurt in the tight organ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Seviper licked the wiggling paw pads of the Lucario.

The black scaled globe sagged out across the tall grass flooring, rumbling from the churning victims inside. The naga turned his upper body torso to the side, reaching a hand over to rub at the smooth lump as its other hand fondled around his unerect floppy cocks. It slithered its entire body in a coning spiral, encircling around its fat belly to squeeze it into its coils, squishing the non-infected anthros around each other.

Gold unhappily fidgeted within the Seviper's grasp, but seemed to be at a loss of energy from the wild ride he just experienced, still continuing to drip hot semen from all over his body. The Seviper purred aloud, nudging the blue tail downward into the wet rod, bulging out as the cock tensed up in excitement. Gold was going to be cock vored, and you could do nothing but pity him! The encircled coils never released their grip, clutching you tightly in the smoothed black scales of its lengthened body to keep you from intervening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infected naga demanded for another round of sex, and his victims were already to weak to fight against his whims. Gold's taloned-webbed feet were squished into the small tunnel as it rumbled in enticement from his touch. The duck trembled in the thought of being devoured by the swallowing cock, feeling his head loosen out as it flopped back behind his neck while his eyes stared up at the top of his eyes before closing. The Golduck had fainted, letting his arms droop and small struggles cease. His tongue even hung out from his open beak during his consumption within the Seviper's groin. The infected naga happily pushed Gold's passed out slick body deeper in, expanding the cock at its potential width! His shoulders slip inside, contracting his head between the member's lips with a loud and wet <i>pop</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook in horror as you watched the cock bubbled out and wiggling in pleasure as it began to churn the duck into cum within itself! The coils shifted, nudging Jackal out from his underbelly and close to his waist. His eyes were shut closed, thus he peeked an eye open, spotting his vision to be engulfed within the head tip of the Seviper's lower cock. He angrily grunted, thrashing tiredly within the spiral of the Seviper's length that continued to squish the Typhlosion between the urethra. It constricted the fire-type evermore slightly, squeezing out the air in his lungs, forcing the Typhlosion to submit to be able to breathe once again. The infected snake placed a hand around one of Jackal's ankles, pulling it in to make the cock bulge out just as much as the one above it to throb out pleasantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal gave out muffled groans of loss, disappearing within the vertical lips of the Seviper's lower cock, spurting out pre to splash along the Seviper's tubed scaled body. Both cocks were engulfed with their victims as they began to bounce up and down, digesting their meals into hot loads of semen. You felt your head began to collect cold sweat when your eyes unwillingly gazed upon the churning rods, numbing the anthros as they slowly formed into thick cum. The infected snake licked his fanged lips, using his hands to pluck you out of his coils and onto his pulsating thick members. Your ears fold all the way back as your whimpered slightly, knowing what was to come. <i>Literally</i>. The Seviper lowered your rump onto the top cock's head, forcing it in with a powerful tug. You yelp out from the sharp quick pain as it traveled as far as it could from its enlarged state. Only a couple inches were able to stick inside your outstretched anus from their unbelievable size. However, you felt the bottom cock press at your tailhole too, shocking you as you struggled to get free. You were answered to your begging with another strong piercing, as the bloated member struck inside your anus also, leaving two enlarged cocks to vibrate inside your wide pucker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears welled up into your eyes while the hurtful humps began to pump your rear end, bouncing you with each strong pound as you rode the infected Seviper's crotch. Their meals were fully processed into pools of cum, urging to be expelled out into your anal tunnel. The two engorged rods stretched your tailhole to its fullest extent, making their way inside your body to cause you to bark out with each thrust. Your growls of pain yet overtaking pleasure roared out as the Seviper humped further while pleasantly hissing to itself, ready for its second round of an orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the tips tingled, <i>erupting</i> the boiling thick strands into your rump, exploding out in loud spurting gushes of massive amounts inside you. You tilt your head back to howl out in misery, feeling your entire body put on edge and stretch to its maximum proportions. Your belly quickly bloated out, bulging out a globular yellow furred dome to sag and press against the Seviper's bare chest. It quickly overfilled as the infected naga continued to ram your rump at a fast pace, ejecting what was once your companions into your body to the point where cum was dripping and squirting from your mouth! It yanked out, causing another howl of pain before you were dropped to the ground. The Seviper pressed his hands tightly around the two cocks, continuing its constant blasts of his load to jet out in thick ropes to hit your body. They splashed over you, drenching you in a nice hot white puddle to pant in as the infected serpent squeezed any remaining cum out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fat belly sloshed with all of the semen boiling inside your stomach, while your arms and legs failed to respond to your motions. Your mouth coughed out more of the warming fluids before you finally passed out, fainting from the pain, the pleasure, and the colossal fullness in your sagging gut. The Seviper towering above your exhausted body also pants in response, releasing his cocks to flop down, now satisfied from their fill for fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Lucario passed out from the sex spree the infected naga put him through, laying his back to let his yellow belly to bloat out atop his nasal area. The Seviper slithered over to his toy pooch, placing his scaled hands on the the flabby gut as he squeezed and played with it. The heavy liquid sloshed around the organ, being what used to be his other victims his cocks so happily digested for him. The Lucario suddenly blinked its eyes open, sporting purple eyes and a blank feral expression. The infected Seviper realized his job was done as he crept back into the tall grass to let the Lucario happily rub his tummy while licking the random cum over his lips, ready to digest the fluids so he can find whole food to devour. Whatever remained of your life and personality disappeared along with your friends as your body forces itself to rest upon a rock, stewing up a Golduck's and Typhlosion's remains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun fully sets, and so does your story.</i></span></div></div>",

His shy grunting became simple muffles when his head plummeted softly into the Vespiquen's crotch, as her lower lips worked their way around his cocoon for unbirthing such a large meal. Gold still remained in a Beedrill's grasp, impatiently waiting for his turn. Another nibble broke your concentration with Razz poking your neck with his mandibles, dabbing his tongue between his lips to your soft fur. Murrs roused from your bee captor, and it was almost getting you aroused a bit as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly felt yourself twirl around, and you were staring at Razz face-to-face now! His red eyes seem to tighten their gaze at your head, especially when he stared at your muzzle. Licking his chops, his tongue smothered the tip of your muzzle while it dragged itself across your face and fur. You couldn't help but get a bit enticed by the warm tongue that danced itself around your head, picking up your flavor and texture to the point that a strange feeling began to press against the inner walls of your honey cocoon near your waist. Your cheeks glowed a specific bright color as your eyelids lowered past half-way down your eyes. You attempted to look away from the Beedrill from sheer embarrassment. Maybe Gold is right about this. Just being realistic here, what are the odds of escape by now? Shouldn't you just enjoy what you have? Whether it was the random horny temperature of the room, the intoxicating aroma of the honey inside the honeycomb cavern, or your own deep and dirty fantasies, allowed you to accept being Razz's \"boy toy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost to the point of begging to be satisfied, you forget all about the consequences of your actions and willingly submit yourself to Razz. Your unwiggling struggles cease within your capsule, and you direct your vision back to Razz who still has his rough salivating muscle slop around your muzzle. You press your face closer towards Razz's mouth, enjoying the hot moist air gliding around you while more of his dribble oozes down your fur. The Beedrill took complete notice to your submission and pulled his mouth away, letting a string of drool stretch from his chin to your noggin. \"Well, look who finally decided to serve his <i>master</i>.\" He said in kind of a sadistic yet flirtatious method. A hand suddenly clutched the scruff of your neck, and you suddenly felt your head fly forward, straight at Razz's smooching mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mandibles had stretched wide open for his mouth to begin sucking against parts of your face, meanwhile brushing his slick tongue over to your mouth. The tongue dug under you lips, licking itself across the soft inner canine edges and squeezing itself against your teeth. Uncontrollably, you released your jaw to open up your maw, allowing Razz's tongue to squirm and taste your entire mouth. His hand clutched your skin even tighter, and a little more uncomfortable, and squished your mouth closer to the point to where his tongue could slurp up your own saliva!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour erection flattened itself against the cocoon wall, ejecting out pre from the Beedrill's splurge. You felt as if your body could simply melt in the tight grip of Razz'z arms, but all things must come to a close. His kissing binge ended, as his content tongue was now sated from flavor. His exoskeleton arms lifted your prison high up above his mouth, until it the tip end of the capsule reached Razz's mouth. Your tail its best to wag happily inside the tight space as you cock throbbed effortlessly to at least be touched or pleased in any way possible. You quickly learned that Razz was a fast eater though. His mouth expanded of the honey cocoon with no trouble while your body slid along the tunnel of his throat. His neck expanded when your legs had been sucked inside with your waist to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou joyfully licked all of the saliva Razz had left smothered all across your face with, as he worked his arms like a ladder to push more of your delicious honey covered body in. The Beedrill groaned happily, accepting your still embodiment, when suddenly, you check back to Jackal and Gold. Jackal's cocoon's foot-end disappeared between her vaginal lips as the puckered out pre-juices afterwards. Gold's face bloomed a fuzzy red as he was hovered over by a Beedrill servant as a finishing coarse to the Vespiquen's insatiable lust. Still lost under the control of her own erotic mind, the exhausted Vespiquen could only order her minion by rough enticed groaning. Her hands were to busy rubbing her engorged abdomen, squeezing at the flab and the wiggling Jackal inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, a jolt of heat sprang around your neck. Your shoulders had already passed Razz's mandibles, and your furry throat was being given a thorough once more! You shivered in the blanket of heat, surrounding its warmth around body, hugging it as it descended into the Beedrill's stomach. After a pat on the head, your vision was closed up from a spiny mouth outline, and your cocooned dog-self was fully trapped inside Razz's belly after a trip down his gullet. Gurgles emitted around your long ears, when you instantly felt four hands circle around the globe you made from the outside, always poking at the gut and teasing you. You were certain enough that you even heard Razz chuckle devilishly somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe honey cocoon around you suddenly began to melt inside the hot sac, freeing you at the last few minutes of your life! As if you cared by now. You were too busy thinking about your own satisfaction then your own survival. Springing out with severe impatience, your cock throbbed angrily from its lack of demand. Covered in slick, hot honey and saliva, you took little time beating your pressured member away. The stomach walls began to converge on you, loosening your grip on your knotted rod and pinning your arms. You whimpered in disappointment for your delayed climax, but the fleshy slimy walls did the work for you. You felt yourself slosh back and forth in the organ sac, bouncing forward and backward in the pumping of the stomach as digestive enzymes started to pour in. This is what you needed for your end result. Your blue ball sac tinged in, expelling and emptying all that you had to give out of your cock's tip. Being inside the constricting walls of flesh was too much for you. You finally passed out in complete bliss in a mix of honey, drool, and seed-fluids drenching around inside the bug's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Razz licked his lips one final time before resting next to his now satisfied queen in her large throne. A Golduck's blushing head still stuck out of her already-orgasmed vagina, almost fainting from the sheer joy of his pleasure. His beak still had his tongue flop out, tasting her inner walls before he was fully consumed into her fat abdomen. Razz pressed his fat belly against his master's newly added girth, rubbing the yellow-shelled globes together as they pumped and jiggled from working the bodies into nutrients. Razz was sure that his next catches would be this easy, and willing.</i></span></div></div>",

Despite his emotionless eyes, you swear you can make out sadness on his face. \"And I doubt that even with my help you could save them. I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>((Gold and Jackel have left your party))</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mixture of rage and sorrow wells up inside you, the aura returning to your fists as you approach the Beedrill. \"Where, exactly, ARE THEY?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRazz stands firm even as you approach him, his voice flat and without any apparent sign of fear. \"They're at the hive, likely having been presented to the queen by now. If she's hungry, at least one of them is probably already dead, both if she was generous enough to grant the spare to whosoever presented the catch. On the off chance she's not, they are likely imprisoned in the storage chamber below her own, awaiting their... execution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gently places a hand on your shoulder. \"Now then,  I can help you, either to avenge them, or if you're lucky, to save them, but in return, I need you to help me. I have a... well let's call it a disagreement... with our queen. See she wants us to stay here and isolate ourselves, surviving off of whatever or whoever we find, but from what I figure, that won't end well. Either this infection will spread to our hive and we'll become a bunch of mindless beasts, or we'll eventually pick off more than we can chew and die out. I want out, but if I was to just leave, the queen would have my brethren bring me back as food. So the way I see it, there's two options for me, either I die, or she does.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Beedrill suddenly releases your shoulder and turns away, his stinger lowered to avoid accidentally stinging you. \"Now, I'm going to stare intently at this wall for a minute, if you're still here by the time I turn back around, then we leave for the hive, if not, I won't go after you, but you're on your own. Think carefully.\"</span></div></div>",

Eventually, you come to the conclusion that Razz is your best chance at seeing them alive again, and thus decide to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short time Razz turns back around, seeming to be happy to see you're still there. \"Well then Lace, it seems we will be working together after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise a hand for him to stop. \"If I'm helping you, I expect one thing in return, if my friends are alive, we're rescuing them, asap.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Razz had eyelids, he'd probably blink in surprise. \"As you wish, though the easiest way to find out if they're alive would be to head to the queen's chambers... well... now. So we'll have to... accelerate things.\" He picks up a belt off the ground with a pair of stinger like \"lances\" latched onto it and puts it on. \"I'll signal my fellow revolutionaries, and we'll go, wait outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and turn, climbing up the ledge to the entrance. The hole you end up climbing out of leads back into the forest you had been wandering through when you were ambushed, though the repetitive scenery of the forest leaves it impossible to tell how near you are to where you were picked up at. Shortly after you step out, a loud sound, like someone blowing into some kind of horn, echoes out from the hole, followed quickly by Razz who grabs you like before and takes off. \"Time to go, act unconscious, this flight won't be a very long one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and close your eyes, and for a minute or two, the only sensations are the odd feeling of Razz flying while carrying you, and the sound of his buzzing wings. But soon you hear an unfamiliar voice. \"Hey Razz, is that the Lucario that got away earlier?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I found him nearby, I think he was planning on breaking in to try to save his friends... By the way, why are you guarding the entrance to the hive alone?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, something's going on inside, a bunch of the older Beedrill just started attacking everyone, apparently they're causing a lot of trouble, 'cause they've only left a skeleton crew of guards not out trying to stop them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll take this guy down to storage and find out where to go to help then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good, head on in.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of Razz's buzzing wings resumes as he apparently flies in, before tapping you gently with one of his hands. \"Alright we're in, I'm putting you down now.\" You open your eyes as he does so, finding yourself in an unusual environment. The interior of this hive is a large series of snaking corridors, some going literally straight up or down, and all lined with the same waxy material from the chamber from earlier. The scent of honey is strong, and you can hear fighting far up above, likely from Razz's cohorts. Razz himself notices you looking around and grins. \"Impressive, huh? It's kind of a shame I have to just leave it behind, but hey, I like living.\" He chuckles a bit. \"Alright we're heading for the queen's chambers, we'll kill her and then release anybody trapped in storage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou growl at him. \"We go to storage <i>first</i>, my friends could still be in danger!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRazz shrugs. \"The easiest way to find out if your friends are even alive would be to find out if the queen has eaten, and if she has, then any time we waste means she's had more time to uh... adjust to her new weight. If we waste time heading to storage and she's eaten one already, we've only made things more difficult for ourselves. And if she hasn't eaten them, I'd prefer to not risk us getting injured before we fight her, even if it will be two on one. But I did agree to help you save them, so I'll leave the planning to you.\"</span></div></div>",

It seemed to enjoy your taste! Frightened, you panic inside the blue gator\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trap, pushing and pulling body parts to escape his ensnarement. Nothing loosened. Nothing let go. You were trapped under the heavy girth of the infected reptile, condemned to be guzzled up and swallowed by him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour weak whines sobbed out as your ankles were lifted up to place your foot paws at the base of the infected Feraligatr\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drooling mouth, ready to be consumed. The croc chomped down at your feet, biting down to your knees! His teeth caused a quick sharp pain to your legs, but then loosened to an innocent nibble to avoid cutting your legs. You felt a small fleshy hot tentacle inside his maw lick over your pink foot pads, lapping up around your toes and fur, insinuating a surprised pant from the enticement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tongue tickled the soft skin, nudging it while basking it slick dribble that your paws began to unwillingly wiggle around, pressing against the roof of the Feraligatr\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mouth. Your legs relaxed, allowing the infected feral to gulp your feet down, gaining him to chomp down at your body again which sank down to your hips! His tongue did its work, exploring around your ball sac, sweeping and encircling the loose furry blue bag. You gasped louder this time, twitching uncomfortably in the sexual activity that you even forgot that the anthro had released your arms to eat you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head tip of your member pulsed out, stretching its length as the Feraligatr\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tongue had moved on to your anus, squishing itself inside the warm pucker hole. Your cock impressively struck out, bouncing its knot out at the end to press against the slimy hot walls of flesh within the reptile\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mouth. Your body was slowly being dragged into the pit of his stomach, but you were too busy giving slight humps in the Feraligatr\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mouth to even care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tongue popped out of the anus, finished with its desire to lick and continued its purge in swallowing your body. You grit your teeth together, clenching and humiliated while the Feraligatr\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nibbles more of your body closer to his stomach, finally arriving at your head. Your blushed sees the last of your hope wither away, noticing the newly fat Charmeleon, fapping away to his new globed gut, and the Mightyena licking the top of her furry duck-filled belly before your vision is enveloped by the toothy jaw outline until finally shutting close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTraveling down in the tight slimy tunnel, you are forced to curl up into a ball with your legs almost going past your head. Your cock still throbs with unsatisfaction, as you decide that you might as well enjoy what you have before you eventually digest away. Craning your neck down, you are just able to press your lips over your cock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head, licking its sides. Your hands squeezed through your thighs, pressing at your ball sac to caress it as you suck against your own member. The knot bulged and the head tensed out, ready to expel your last orgasm. After massaging your balls one last time, your own seed bursts out over your face, spreading at the wet stomach walls that began to contract together, pressing you into a still pose.  You wheeze one last time before panting away into a faint state of mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Feraligatr licked the edge of his lips joyfully. It had never tasted a Lucario before, and it certainly misses your distinct flavor. He squished his belly together, rubbing the chubby scaled fat with the captive inside to moan within. The infected croc released his gut, watching it bounce back and forth without him moving it as he listened to muffled moans deep within it. Was the dog still struggling to get out? No matter. Plenty of pokemon have tried to escape his mighty jaws, however, none have ever succeeded.</i></span></div></div>",

The Feraligatr's musk envelopes your nostrils, presuming its masculine standards and needs. Moving was not an option, as the heavy weight from the infected croc undertook you by massive amounts of strength, making gravity your worst enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infected Feraligatr grunted, pressing his cock tip at your anus, awaiting your reaction. Your face drained into a pale color, fearing and denying what was about to happen. After watching the evil toothy grin that stretched across your predator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, he slammed his waist forward, penetrating your body with strong force that released a pained howl to bark out from your lungs. His scaly hands gripped your legs, using them as handles as he began to pump his meaty member further into your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shivered your spine, quivered your legs, and felt sick in your stomach during the event of having the large fleshy rod dig through your anal tunnel until finally reaching its stop. Then it began. With a slow pump, the infected horny gator started his pleasure, humping your ass while quickening in pace. Feeling constant afflictions you could only sit while clenching your hands through the dirt, grabbing and ripping the grass as you continued to try to brace yourself in the mad humping spree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Feraligatr\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tongue rolled out, swinging back and forth out of the maw to swish with the rest of his cubby large body. The cock slammed and pressed as deep as it could go, already spreading pre-cum to leak out. Your anus became numb, unable to feel the pain of the wide rod as it pushed through with all of its might into your frail body. The blue reptile thrusted one last time before growling again, closing its eyes before roaring. His seed exploded into you, crashing and pouring through your body until spewing out inside your stomach. You barked out loud, scrunching your foot paws and tensing your rump cheeks together from his large load. The warmth of the semen fumed its way around, just like the Feraligatr\u00e2\u0080\u0099s musk had done to you earlier, trapping you in its steamy attraction. Your eyes roll back before you faint, watching the croc chuckle menacingly before eternal darkness shrouded you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infected Feraligatr released your unconscious body, finished with what he really wanted. The feral reptile looked over to the Mightyena, finished unbirthing her meal and rubbing the furry dome. The Charmeleon, however, was gone as a saliva covered Typhlosion stood in its original spot with an expansive struggling belly. Somehow, the non-infected was able to escape the Charmeleon's mouth and devour it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, get away from him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d It roared gibberish to the Feraligatr. He exhaled a beam of fire in his direction causing the infected gator and the infected female dog to retreat away into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You awoke to a pounding headache inside your head, a sudden sense of starvation.

The Charmeleon charged at you, roaring out with fangs as it held up a claw to slash you. Ducking under the swift swing, you tackled him down from the knees, both of you tumbling around each other on the grass to growl and fight while rolling around. The Charmeleon gnashed it teeth at you, clamping down its fangs right in front of you in a near miss! Droplets of warm drool splatted against your eyes during the ferocious biting of the Charmeleon, never ceasing to devour your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire on its tail ignited even more sweeping a brush of fire at you. The only way you were able to dodge the violent attack was to crash down fast, landing down on your soft rump. Being given a few moments of recovery, you checked to see how everyone was doing. Gold was\u00e2\u0080\u00a6eh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6half way jammed inside the Mightyena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vagina, being unbirthed by the happy canine as she squeezed the horny blue duck inside. Gold\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet twitched some, and his tail occasionally wagged a bit. His waist was entering inside the vertical lips of her crotch, and he humped his body out, pressing his erect cock against the walls to finally cum out a splash of his seed inside. He wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even trying to escape! He was enjoying it, and willingly pulling himself inside! <i>Stupid Golduck</i>, you thought. Well, he finally got what he wanted which was a female to come by; you just thought that he wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be so desperate for it though. Jackal seemed to have some trouble though. The Feraligatr had shot him with a water gun, extinguishing his flame and draining of whatever energy he had. The Typhlosion was craned down some, tiredly breathing and looked like he was about to fall down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attention was suddenly nabbed away when scaly hands grasped your arms to your sides, pinning you! The Charmeleon hissed out a devilish snicker in the victory of finally capturing you. Ready to use your power, your hands began to glow their blue flames until your concentration was suddenly interrupted when the red lizard head-butted your skull, ceasing your attack! Wincing from the sudden jolt, you felt the long warm tongue begin licking and lapping at your face, spreading saliva to drip over your furry head. The hot steamy breath exhaled over you, stinging your eyes a bit until his taste test was over. You were ready to call for some help from Jackal until you looked back to see your friend. Only his legs were visible, as the Feraligatr sucked them up into his anus, growling enticingly from the anal vore. Your vision flipped to Gold, noticing that the female Mightyena was caressing her new large furry belly while cum leaked out of her pussy. Both Gold and Jackal were goners, and you were next!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face plunged into darkness, as your head sank down into the toothy maw of the Charmeleon to glide past the dancing tongue and inhale its hot breath. Moist air enveloped around your muzzle, while a rough yet damp tongue wiggled its way around your neck when it came sliding in after a powerful gulp. Swallowing more of you inside the hot cavern, the forked tongue swept across your torso, lubricating it in dense slime of drool as it continued its path down his throat. The Charmeleon closed his violet eyes, murring aloud as your black furred legs kicked heartedly for desperate freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Charmeleon tilted his head back more as the black foot paws of the Lucario drifted into his jaws. The tongue happily twirled around his pads and toes, feeling them wiggle from the ticklish muscle's binge as it curled around them to gape them inward. After another swallow, his snack eventually slid down his throat, ending up at the ranks of his stomach to let his pale tan belly bloom out, sagging out extensively. He rubbed the fat girth of his scaled gut, toying with the moaning meal inside him. After another conquering laugh, the Charmeleon left the lake, along with the other infected with rumbling bellies of their victims.</i></span></div></div>",

It was a Hitmonlee, and it was also male from what you could tell since a large abnormal cock was blooming out extensively! Things grew from bad to worse then.

You gasp and halt your proceeding dash, struggling with your arm to retract back out, however the immense of muscled flesh proved to be too strong with its vice grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscovering that you were only being drawn closer inward the swallowing rod, you yell out to Jackal who was directly behind you with fire glowing from his maw. The feral notices the fire-type before he attacks although, and spins around, dragging you within the whirling move, to strike the Typhlosion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s side with its massive prick! Jackal gags as the heavy weight sends him back to the forest floor. Grumbling yet still conscious, he rolls onto his back to get ready for getting back up. The Hitmonlee would counter his efforts once again by using one of its legs to flex out and stomp down at his head. Jackal obtains a face-full of the clawed foot tossing his upper body down to the ground for the second time, knocking him out cold immediately. His mane of fire vanishes and his body remains motionless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour innocent eyes widen as your tail goes limp by the sight of your hopes being unconscious. You look back at your cock voring predator to receive a skull-rocking headbutt by it, stunning your thoughts and actions for a moment. Seeing that you were dazed, the Hitmonlee resumed his urethral absorption, swallowing your trapped limb even further to bring your head and shoulders at the cock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head. The glistening brown head tugs down with help of its thick lubrication, forcing your muzzle to stick inside the tight lips until your entire head was imprisoned. Your eyes continue rolling in the blurry vision along with your ringing ears. The only thoughts were focused on the sudden warmth blanketing your body as something gooey spurted across it. The Hitmonlee released muffled murrs through its mouthless face, using its hands to stroke and grimace its rod engulfing a nice Lucario to fill its sac. Climbing over your shoulders and chest, the cock throbs upward, lifting your lower half up in the air for gravity to slide you down. Your brain managed to recuperate its attention, which allowed your thoughts to get a jumpstart of focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grow dreadfully pale when all you see is slimy darkness. Attempting to move, your arms barely budge in the narrow constricting tunnel, disabling any struggles you strive for to be useless. You whine out loud and open your mouth to yell in misery, but you simply get a sudden glob of thick pre-cum to pour inside, forcing you to swallow it down. You shiver as the hot goo seeps down your throat and into your stomach, compelling you to tremble helplessly as your body dives farther downward towards the Hitmonlee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sac. This fate didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t please you in any form, yet, what else could you do? You had heard the stories of those cock vored, and being turned into the predator\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cum never seemed any better than being normally devoured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifted vertically somewhat, your waist and legs descend into the fleshy hot depths of the Hitmonlee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s member, all until your hindpaws disappear between the brown urethral lips of the cock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head. You feel the outside air vanish before you, making it clearly obvious that if you do ever escape the penis prison you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trapped in, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be as frothy Hitmonlee cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel an opening pucker around your outstretched arm in front of you, pushing you into the stretching testicle hand-first inward. You slide in slowly to the pool of cum within the tight sphincter, curling up inside as the wet walls compact against your immobile frame for you to squirm in. You pause to feel and listen to the slight bounces and sways during the Hitmonlee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard masturbation, causing its bulging sac to sag down to the grass as it begins to work over your body. Caught and slurped in by a feral, your deepest fear has come true and your mission to stop the infection has failed. You close your eyes while the boiling cum begins to slicken your fur up, preparing you for semen transformation. With a slow exhale, you quietly pass out to the powerful and wise Hitmonlee, awaiting your fate to be ejaculated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The fire-type roared as his rear was violently being defiled and raped by the oncoming Hitmonlee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rod, penetrating his anus again and again from its forceful humps. The infected\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hands held the Typhlosion deeply into the dirt during the mad rush of sex and groaned loudly by the feeling of the swaying ball sac sloshing with huge batches of seed. The Lucario and Golduck were easy to snatch up, plus, they would provide a wonderful dispersal for an orgasm; especially if it were to infect its victim. With one more thrust, the Hitmonlee dug its claws into the ground, gripping the Typhlosion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fur in wild pleasure as cannon shots of semen spurted into the rear. The struggling Typhlosion ceased his motions and cried out through the dense forest, feeling his belly expand outward greatly from the massive flood of cum filling his stomach. It stretched out to press against the grass, just as the Hitmonlee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sac had done before, rounding out for a gurgling bellow of arousal. His eyes rolled back into his skull before he passed out, rolling onto his back for his pale-tan belly to jiggle about from the force of the motion. The Hitmonlee purred within itself as it stroked the last of its seed strands out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding that it was threw with its sexual binge, it deserted the unconscious Typhlosion to lie there for it to wake up as another infected feral. Surely it would happen quickly with the amount of cum the Hitmonlee had pumped inside him.</i></span></div></div>",

The Typhlosion flew back against the ground, crashing against his back while holding his jaw. The Hitmonlee landed back down, his sac bouncing from the force. You flowed the blue flames of aura around your clenched fist, tossing your arm for a blow at the Hitmonlee\u2019s side; however, the infected would prevail again when he ducked under your flaming paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made a quick low kick at your gut area, hitting your yellow furred portion. You gagged out, releasing dried saliva to leak out from your maw as you collapsed to the grassy floor from the deep impact. It didn\u2019t stop there, with the Hitmonlee extending his other leg to kick the side of your head, causing you to plummet off a few more inches from the ground. After the rough landing you rolled off your back, clenching your chest for air. A strange yet devious victorious murr aroused from the mouthless Hitmonlee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt walked over to the wincing Typhlosion, picking up his legs by his ankles to lift his hind paws to his crotch. Pressing them against the head of the cock, Jackal took a shot for escape, attempting to spew a fireball but all in vain. Only a puff of smoke coughed out from his jaws, as he wheezed more from his aching lungs. The Hitmonlee presumed to drag the Typhlosion into his throbbing cock, squeezing and sliding Jackal in the slimy erect tunnel. You endeavored to stand, although your legs decided otherwise. You fell completely back down, landing on your chest and chin to watch your friend get devoured by a colossal penis. The brown stretching shaft grew as more of Jackal\u2019s body was slid inside, enveloping over his chest and shoulders to leave his head to remain outside for his last breath of fresh air. Pre-cum flooded out from the crevices of the member tip, lubricating  Jackal to hiss out before being consumed eternally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rumbling vibrating bulge wormed its way down the grown cock, sinking into the other testicle next to Gold\u2019s fatal entrapment. The Hitmonlee turned, to you, continuing to rub his hand against his fleshy cock to ponder on how to finish you off in an endearing <i>punishment.</i></span></div></div>",

You lifted your aching back to sit up straight until you felt something wet at your nose. The infected Hitmonlee stood highly close above you, balancing his pre-leaking rod of meat at the base of your muzzle. It flopped above your nose, riding along your muzzle and almost over your head! Its musk fumigated warmth to your environments air, swelling out a wave of steamy heat. You attempted to back away by crawling with your arms; however the infected Hitmonlee grabbed you by your blue ears, gripping them tightly as he got into position to hump along your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings couldn't end here for you in such a way, so you kicked your legs out in complete desperation at the fighter Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon. Although, this was in vain. The Hitmonlee prevented your escape by planting a firm stomp on your tail from between your legs. The pain was like a drill digging into your bone, which easily silenced your growls to sad whimpers and endeavoring kicks to simple twitches. You could only wait or what the infected Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon had in store for you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bulgy weighted brown sac that hung in front you caught your most attention as it pulsated and occasionally bounced from the futile kicks inside the testicles from their victims. Nonetheless, the long sticky member lay between your eyesight, rippling some from enticement. The Hitmonlee began his work, humping his waist to slide the cock across the top of your head as his hands used your ears like handles. He retracted back, until humping again except with a little more force. Soon enough, he was at a pumping barrage, quickly squeezing his cock on top of you for the erection when he decides to infect you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPre continued to pour out into small strands from each forceful thrust which in turn leaked down past your eyes and rode along your muzzle and mouth. Your hands were digging firmly into the ground next you, using your straightened arms to keep you from toppling over from the powerful momentum of the Hitmonlees ecstatic humps. After rubbing his mighty shaft against the fur on your head, the infected morph lowered his cock down against your chest, pressing the drenched hot tube into your yellow fur. You twitched unwillingly in pleasure by the sudden jolt in your dick, as your own knotted shaft poked its way out. The Hitmonlee increased his rate of speed, squishing out even more pre-cum than before from his tip to splatter on you! The heavy clear slime drenched over you, expelling the same warmth and scent as the Hitmonlee's flopping rod. The globular ball sac that sagged down was swinging and bouncing up against with each pound, squeezing the messy penis between your body and even the sac itself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fighter anthro tensed, seeing how his climax was soon rising to his conclusion that he slowed the process of humping to lift the long muscle to the edge of your lips, poking the head into them and tempted your tongue to stroke along it. Fearing another stomp to your tail, you willingly complied and lapped your tongue out, brushing over the large head of the wet cock to receive a murr of enjoyment from the Hitmonlee. Not even after a second that occurred, he forced the entire rod in, expanding your full mouth to its limits! Your cheeks bubbled out, your tongue had little room to lick or even move for that matter, and your face grew red from taking pleasure in the horrible act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meat stretched itself longer into your maw, pressing at the back of your throat from its long size. The Hitmonlee growled internally, humping at his greatest speed to expel his newly cum-digested meals. The ball sac sloshed with the pools of semen within, wallowing in white ripples that urged to be ejected out. Your tongue was forced to brush along the steamy cock, forcing the strange burning sense to ignite inside your jaws as the penis persisted to hump deep into your throat. The purple dense eyes of the Hitmonlee widened from the actual heat of the moment, feeling the rumbling in its balls tinge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head erupted out an entire flood of cum, spewing deep down your throat to your own belly. The Hitmonlee released your ears, but grabbed the sides of your face to pull you in closer, squeezing every inch of his ejaculating shaft inside your maw. Your eyes shut tightly from the pressure in your mouth, feeling as if your head and neck would burst from the seed. It waterfalled down your esophagus, streaming its sticky slime to expand your gut greatly from the amount of two bodies! After a quick squish of the head, the Hitmonlee withdrew his cock, flopping it out as the last of its drops dripped on your already pre-cum covered body. The Hitmonlee's hands dropped your head, allowing you to fall back onto your spine to forcefully gulp the rest of his seed to be able to even breathe. Your belly sloshed and bounced from the heavy infected liquid as it began to mix its contents into your body. You gag out from the semen, wheezing air into your lungs as your head began to grow dizzy when your world began to spin from the exhaustion. Your eyesight was growing fuzzy, but you could still feel something a bit pleasuring<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour own cock was being rubbed, fapped away by the infector, making sure that he finished what he started or maybe he was doing it for the pleasure of it all. Either way, he continued to pleasure you by whatever he was doing to you. Clenching your teeth together, you softly whimpered in emotional pain and enticement. You briefly wondered if you truly were going to become infected, just like the Hitmonlee and every other feral you met, forever to roam the land eating others until you too are eaten by an anthro. You were so close to getting a cure though! It mattered not, because your blue furry ball sac twitched, initiating your knotted cock to spurt out its contents, splattering against your waist and expanded jelly-like stomach. Your eyes forced themselves to rise to the top of themselves, as your eyelids twitched in joy. Your world grew darker than usual and your mind seemed to float back. The last thing you ever saw was the Hitmonlee, laughing softly and hissingly to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Hitmonlee let his Lucario victim drop on his back, falling down to spurt out white cum from his lips from his tiring experience.  The infected's ball sac returned to its original size as his cock receded back to its smaller and floppy form. The Hitmonlee noticed the weak dog was still somehow conscious and took to note that his erection still poked out, begging to be satisfied. The Hitmonlee nudged his foot at the member, pressing its claws around the knot of the dick to give it a quick squeeze. The Lucario fidgeted from the small clutch and apparently liked the feeling. The Hitmonlee shrugged and began stroking the heated shaft between the claws on his foot, fapping the fleshy wad with soft speed and nourishment. His dog victim gasped in arousal, clenching his teeth and blushing red from the pleasuring foot-job, as the Hitmonlee deeply pressed his sole against the warm rod. The Lucario gripped his hand-paws into the ground, digging from the pressing feeling until he released a soft roar, bursting his own cum package at himself and over his globed yellow gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made a single gag before falling back, flopping its loose tongue out of his mouth from pleasure. The Hitmonlee wiped off the canine cum off his foot by wiping it on the soaked belly of the Lucario, jiggling from the brush. The Hitmonlee wasn't hungry and it certainly left much more cum than needed to infect the Lucario later on. The seed would soon be digested and form a new infected in the dumb mutts body to travel and devour hose it sees. The infected walked away, smiling defiantly on the inside.</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A heavy gulp anchored down in your throat as you suddenly began to crawl away with your back turned to the infected pokemon. Scoffing at your inevitable fate, your futile escape ceased when there was a sudden tug around your ankles. You flipped your head back to watch the Hitmonlee facing away from you and picking your black furred legs up. Knees bent, the infected crouched closer to you, pressing your paws at his already gaping anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour paw pads pressed against the musty pucker, expelling its fond heat to your feet. Eager to survive, you kick your legs out to escape, only to manage slight pushes of your foot paws at the Hitmonlee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hole. The Hitmonlee murred joyfully from the small tickle and proceeded to devour you the opposite way by pressing your paws in. You tried twisting and turning your body, clawing at the ground to brace yourself, and continued to try and kick your legs. This however seemed to only pleasure the Hitmonlee from your rapid motions, as your turning seemed to nudge you in even closer! The hot pucker stretched out, clamping around knees and pulling them further inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infected even commenced to take a few steps back for a faster consumption! Your attempts for freedom failed to provide any closure for you as you seemed to work more as a butt dildo than a difficulty to the predator. He was already past your waist and up to your chest now, leaving you with only one option of escape left. Lifting your arms, you pressed your hands around the anus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rim, pushing against it to stop the strange suction of the hole. The Hitmonlee grunted, angered by your unwilling tries of freedom. The infected pokemon strained his bottom cheeks together, squeezing at each arms to squish them closer. You wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more infuriated now, the Hitmonlee forcefully sat his rump down, pressing your head against the grassy floor pressuring your arms to give out and suck within the pucker! It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop there, as the Hitmonlee continued to slide you in until your shoulders finally met at the rim of the anus. You could feel your hind paws enter through the stomach opening, frightening you of was yet to come. The Hitmonlee made a muffled and conquering laugh through his mouthless face, sitting down on your upside down head at the edge of the lake. The infected Hitmonlee grabbed his brown expansive cock with his hand tugging away at it for the two meals he recently digested into cum within his ballooned ball sac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to see anything on the ground with two brown rump cheeks squeezing your head in between them; however, you certainly could feel everything. The fapping motions rock the Hitmonlee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s body back and forth, sloshing the pools of cum inside his weighted sac, as the portion of your body within is forced to hump and rub against the anal warm walls. The Hitmonlee raised his rump a few inches in the air, slowly lowering it back down to gulp up the rest of your head inside the pucker hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFapping even harder now, the Hitmonlee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brown belly began to expand in size as more and more of your body is forced to curl in the organ. You whimper feebly while kicking the slick stomach walls. Feeling sorrow of your doomed life, you felt a sense of pity for Jackal into being formed into a splotch of cum to be humiliated by from the Hitmonlee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s masturbation. The stomach rumbled back and forth from the Hitmonlee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s continuous pumps of his hand, rhythmically drifting you into slumber before the digestive juices began flowing in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Hitmonlee humped even faster. It had been almost an hour of searching from when he anal vored his Lucario victim, and his gut was certainly filled afterwards. But now, he had found the perfect victim for the patches of semen thanks to the help of his catch of prey from the Golduck and Typhlosion. He continued to forcedly rape the Pikachu girl he had recently found, cautiously running through the woods to get to another town. After trapping her in his grasp, he had already proceeded to begin infecting her from his earlier prey. His large member pumped into her bloomed vagina with determined thrusts, letting his large brown smooth belly to flop with his motions and his ball sac to sag with him. She hollered aloud, hoping someone could hear her cries, but the sound to only drown into the atmosphere until disappearing. The hands of the infected Hitmonlee gripped more firmly on her yellow rump cheeks, tensing his cock upon reaching his end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pikachu anthro gasped out loud from the sudden crashing burst of cum into her body. It spewed deep inside her fleshy cavern, flowing straight into womb area. Her furred belly expanded, growing in small size after the Hitmonlee ejected his digested seed into the vagina. After a few more humps to squish out the last of the hot white liquid, he plopped the meaty shaft back out, letting his victim twitch and tinge from the exhausting experience. It would be a matter of minutes for her to turn into an infected with all of the cum he just delivered. The Hitmonlee walked away, rubbing his large brown belly that slowly dissolved your body for more energy to start the infecting process all over again.</i></span></div></div>",

The frog quickly crouched down until kicking his legs back at the ground, lifting the infected anthro to blast through air towards you. You were already running to Jackal's aid and couldn't find the time to stop sprinting to dodge the hungry Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Toxicroak kicked its legs, knocking you to the mossy marsh floor while sliding across the wet land. You finally braked your sliding with your chest down pressing on the dirt, only to feel the pressure of a foot to stand on your back. You could hear the Toxicroak's sinister chuckling above your body as his dark shadow loomed around you dreadfully. Picking yourself back up seemed to be impossible at this point with his leg keeping its hold on your spine, thus leaving no room to press your arms up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of your eye, you noticed the orange sac that hung under his chin, expanding greatly until deflating out a croak of anticipation. Something else began to drag across your back. You felt a quick sharp pain until having an odd sense of numbness overcome you. The frog was poking an orange knuckle claw from his hand to your back, sending venom into your body with its poison tip to weaken your body for less struggles. Your mind began to panic while you tried desperately to stress your legs to move, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmphibian hands quickly grabbed your ankles, and your foot paws were gobbled into the Toxicroak's salivating mouth. The drool was lapped over your feet by the frog's dancing tongue, and it gladly licked more of your legs into the happy maw. You sighed, lowering your ears to their sides to admit defeat. Whimpering was the only thing you were able to do from this point, for the poison was too strong to exceed. More and more of your body would continue to be consumed over the last minute of your life, giving you the special show of watching your friend be unbirthed by the Leafeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis legs twitched under the infected girl's groin, soaked in her hot orgasm that she dispensed. Her soft furred belly poked out with quite the round bulge, globing outward significantly. You quietly sobbed to yourself in pure misery. Your journey led you to this point: becoming nothing but belly fat for this Toxicroak. By now, your shoulders were crammed into the Toxicroak's mouth, with his slobbery tongue prancing under your chest. The last thing you ever saw was the outline of his dark mouth, and the Leafeon patting her new spherical gut before being enveloped in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Toxicroak closed his mouth, sealing the Lucario inside to digest away for new energy. It happily licked its lips, pressing its hands against the large purple belly that sagged out from the ingested dog. It had achieved victory, earning a great meal for the day since not many uninfected anthros roam the swamp. Some credit had to be given to the Leafeon though, distracting it for him by unbirthing the Lucario's companion. The accomplished Toxicroak waddled over to a fallen log, poking his amphibious hands at the stomach walls that constricted the live, yet numb, dog inside. It croaked devilishly before yawning and drifting off into awaited slumber, breaking down the encased Lucario within.</i></span></div></div>",

It was floating up vertically, holding your body in a standing position as you look up to see small pincers stretch out wide, revealing a hungry open insect mouth.

The mushy walls reveberate all around your furry body, as the infected giant dragonfly hisses a delightful murr, stroking a leg across the bulges your body dents out from the Yanmega's plated stretching green form. Your squirms couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even be felt as your legs are sucked inside the pincers, closing around your foot paws right after they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re swallowed up to their fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Yanmega belched out loud, using its legs to rub the outstretched lump in its neck travel down the midsection. They poked around the bulging green belly, feeling every struggle and whimpering of the doomed Lucario inside. It jiggled the gut around to torture the digesting pooch in its final moments, right before it dissolves and turns into bug fat. Looking up, the infected insect saw the Leafeon claim her prize as well. Two Typhlosion legs twitched around in unwilling pleasure, as her cunt was releasing a wet orgasm over the fire type. His scrunching feet disappeared in the puffed slit, and the infected anthro plant girl rubbed her furry belly, enjoying the kicking and crying out the Typhlosion had to offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Yanmega flies away, pleased with its full stomach as the pulses from its gut die away. The Leafeon rests against a tree, rubbing her pale tan belly as it jiggled her gut and boobs around. After digesting the squirming fire-type, it would certainly make them bigger.</i></span></div></div>",

Your attack has been rendered into nothing but smoke in the air with your opponent still blasting forward at a rough pace. You try to step back with no idea on what to do, only to feel a wet embodiment collide right into you. The Golduck grapples against you, tackling your body against the shoreline of the pond that has both of you rolling about on the ground with trying to defend yourself from his greedy clasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a blue fist jabs straight into your thin gut that uppercuts you off above the Golduck. You fall back, crashing against the grassy floor on your spine sending a wheeze to alarm out of your mouth. Flipping over in the agitating pain, you hold yourself up on your frail shaking black furred arms, trying to breathe back air in again. Wobbling up to your knees, you suddenly spot the Golduck standing before with his fists clenched tight. There, you feel a swift punch across your cheek to almost knock you over onto your side sending a bit of loose saliva out from your groaning mouth and wobbling jawline. But then you only receive another punch from his other fist, swiping and connecting hard against your other cheek that does knock you down. You clench the grass with your eyes spinning, struggling to retain your focus as the duck straddles himself onto your abdomen. \"Poor poochie. Just hold still and this'll be over quickly for ya~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, several repeating punches swing your head from side to side, knocking it about against the wet, grassy shoreline to leave your face bruised with a dark black eye after his final swing. Tiredly panting some, The duck gets up to shake his hands some, snickering out, \"Damn man, ya have a pretty tough skull. Why'd ya have to go and hurt my knuckles like that, man?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cough out again, rolling over onto your stomach to try and push yourself back up, only for a clawed and webbed foot to softly press you back down. Your body is squished back into the grass, unable to move now. The duck easily beat you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Golduck grumbles while standing on top of you with uncaring tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t women ever decide to come to this pond\u00e2\u0080\u00a6?

Pushing you over onto your back with his leg so you could look up at him, he softly placed a foot against you again, pressing down on your torso. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey! Look at me when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m talking to ya!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind was shaking while your legs and back ached in bruises. Your face wasn't in the prettiest shape either. You try to growl, only to wheeze out pathetically again as he removes his taloned hindpaw off of you. His hands grasp around your shoulders, picking you up to his eye level. He was actually shorter than you, probably with the top of his head getting to your shoulders, but your legs were awkwardly down on their knees laying against the floor to make it so the duck could still look down at you. Through the groggy vision, you look at the Golduck with feeble, angry eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pats one of your cheeks and taunts, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAw, cheer up pup!

Being a water-type, the duck's maw resonates with a vapory mist the collects dew on your face the closer you get to the rippling muscles inside that wish to claim you as food. You attempt to jerk away, but your battered body was no match for his stronger mouth. Your muzzle feels the hard lips clamp around it, sucking against your face that pulls it in! Striving to free yourself from the Golduck's grasp, you twist your shoulders around even if your arms are pinned by his hands and your legs kick out weakly, making feeble chances for escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head continues to become engulfed by the ever expanding beak of the Golduck though, and your shoulders squeeze inside the bill. The Golduck's tongue frolicked along your face, enjoying such a rare Pokemon flavor that he had never witnessed beforehand. You whimper some inside as you writhed within his powerful grip, despite the fact you continued your fall, sliding further and further to be contained by the blue duck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumiliation and defeat courses through your mind that this perverted duck has overpowered you to end your journey here, as stew for a duck. If anything, you would roast this duck yourself to eat, but perhaps that makes you no better than him. Either way, you were doomed, and so was Jackal most likely. You assume the poor lug was rendered unconscious or too battered to aid you in this crisis. He would probably join you in the stomach soon enough anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bill slips your plump rump inside with the Golduck gagging a bit when your crotch passes over his tongue, forced to have your furry sac and sheath to rub along his tastebuds. Your flavor and meat was perfectly fine, but the confident duck seem to prefer slits of shafts. He brought his mean smug murring back once he had tilted his head back, pulling your wincing black legs in. The pink muscle in his mouth explores your weak calves, pleasantly purring in yet a quacking tone of delight as the tongue invades your personal space as esophagus walls clench tight around your upper body. You can even feel the heat of his stomach closing in quick. Your hindpaws are gobbled up in the wet drooling beak with your head finally pressing against the stomach walls of the Golduck to meet the end of your trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour waist and legs slide into the small constricting organ, forcing your entire body together in a tight wet mess. The air was thin, if there was any, and every limb you had was tucked together uncomfortably together against yourself making for a tight place hard to even move in. You feel his hands press at the dark round walls around you with the hefty duck now shifting his gut around, seeming to enjoy his new meal. A muffled belch is heard outside that causes the walls around you to vibrate together taking more of your air away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Golduck murrs on the outside with a beautifully round light-blue gut domed before him. His webbed hands smear around the tight flesh to even lightly scratch at it with his claws, getting a pleasured growl from his grinning beak. \"Ggghhhhhh~ Not bad for a man. Ya certainly had a curvy body with that fat ass of yours. I guess I wouldn't have minded ya that if ya were a twink.\" He gives his belly a slap that audible sloshes you about in the stomach uncomfortably with his hot stomach juices pouring inside the stomach some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom inside, you struggle to find the air or energy to protest or curse this bird, feeling the overwhelming sense of uncsciousness cascading onto you. From inside in the swaying motions of the stomach, you guess that he's waddling over to somewhere. His mouth begins to make more sounds with swallowing being the loudest. Your only best guess is that Jackal was one his way to join you into this triumphant and evil duck. But it wouldn't matter in the long run. Your eyes are rolled back now with the stomach juices passing over your face, submerging permanently under the hot liquids to made into a soup within the hot, digesting sac. You pass out without another thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>The Golduck presses his webbed hands together, slapping his hefty round belly to get it jiggling. His blue gut flourishes with his motionless gut that was packed with two helpless, knocked out meals gurgling away. After eating the weak dog, the Golduck had waddled over to claim his other prize; a Typhlosion laying unconscious from his charged Psybeam from earlier. It made for just as easy of a meal as the Lucario had been. The fire-type was even larger and chubbier than his counter-part, allowing the Golduck to truly savor his body the more he swallowed Jackal inside his gut. Now the two heroes were nothing but future duck fat, stewing hotly inside with loud gurgles for the aquatic bird to enjoy listening to as he lies on his back, letting his sphered out stomach do the work. Through selfish desires and sheer surprise power, the Golduck inevitably ended Lace's quest there and then.</i></span></div></div>",

You feel his pucker compress around your digitigrade paws, pressing them into his warm tight tunnel much to your surprise. You were going to be food for his ass, just like a feral would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kick your legs inside the hole only to get slow twitching from them in response. The slight nudging movements squish your hindpaws within the Golduck's musty hole, pampering and massaging the inner rectum walls. The blue duck pops his head up from the enticing pleasure as your legs ride up inside his underside, using his anus to suck your body into his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Nhh...st-stop. W-What are you d-d-doing?\" You groan through your locked-together teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the stuffy pucker flex around your legs, swallowing them inside with your waist following as the duck responds, \"Mmmmrrrr...qqqwwwrrrr...A trick I've found that I've seen the infected do. Figured it's a time to cram up in me through a different way. Past five meals I've had were through my beak. So why not mix things up every now and then. Now be quiet and stay still. You're tickling me down there~\" The warmth of the anal flesh from the Golduck sends shivers on your upper torso, so you place your hands against his crotch to push against it. Your restraints may have helped, but the duck bends over, raising his small-tailed rump in the air that helps sends you to decline straight in the hungry anus. Squeezing your hands in, you thrust your arm-pinned body about, distressed and panicking! But to no reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms and shoulders slide through, stretching the oddly soft walls around your neck in a tight clamp with your legs beginning to enter inside of his stomach. Not only did you lose to a non-infected on your journey, but you've be devoured by one in such a cruel manner to digest away anyway. You gasp, breathing your last bit of fresh outside air until your head is enveloped in a ring of darkness closing aroudn your vision. Whimpers echo around you when you whine out in the thick and kneading tunnel, slithering your battered body up into the Golduck's empty stomach to change that. Coiling up inside the hot organ, you feel the strong, unyielding fleshy walls constrict your body like food to vibrate a bit as webbed hands press on the outside, brushing around your body as it faded its consciousness away. With no air and your brain still rocked from the Golduck's punching, you can't last another second and forced into defeat with the duck belching proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Golduck breathes in relief. He loved women, but men seem to fill his stomach out more. He adores his new big blue belly, wrapping his hands around it and jiggling it out with the dog trapped inside. The Lucario is already long gone now, but it does give a reflex twitch that tickles the Golduck's stomach walls. The water-type squirms about in pleasure when standing up, growing even more excited when he hears some groans sound out behind him. Walking over to the source with his protruding belly bouncing from each step, he looks down in his delight to see the Typhlosion he shot a Psybeam at earlier unconscious on the floor, practically begging to be devoured!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Golduck frowns though as he takes a seat against Jackal's face, slowly forcing him headfirst up into the ass. \"Hmph.

His legs had been snapped inside the wet pressed lips of a massive Gyarados! The blue water dragon's eyes shimmered a sinister purple, glaring down at the trapped Typhlosion, toiling his body in the ensnaring mouth. You yell out to Jackal while standing up straight, only to wincingly grunt when a certain sharp pain stabs at your leg, forcing you to remain immobile. Watching the disaster before you, you take notice that this Gyarados was large in size, and had a naga body. A clear torso and set arms adorn its long and scaly body with lake water dripping off from it. It was incredible and worrying that something of this size was able to calmly wait in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gyarados crooks a long smile of amusement from the fire-type's endeavors of escape. It opens its massive maw out, snapping it closed once again to bring in the entire Typhlosion in its mouth. Gulping, a wriggling bulge extends out, descending the dragons long blue snake body you are forced to watch. Jackal groans and yells inside before becoming completely muffled out in the thick dragon hide and stomach walls. The Gyarados exhales pleasantly, dancing its tongue around its pale tan lips while patting its barely bulging tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, it sees another pokemon that catches its eyes; you, the already weakened Lucario that's standing in front of the towering beast in the water.  Hearing a loud deep chuckle from the finned blue dragon, you press whatever energy you have into a ball, blasting it forward in a howling rage! The Gyarados easily swifts its head to the side to let the aura filled orb flash by and deteriorate in the air. It wastes no time in claiming its prey when its mouth creaks open and plunges its head at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to move back, but your leg stabs at itself again with a pained strike, letting your vision become engulfed into darkness. Half of your body is already gorged with the steamy jaws of the dragon once you hear the deafening boom of its bite! The infected Gyarados raises its head high, with two Lucario legs thrashing outside. You feel an impossibly large tongue press against your upper torso and face, dragging you against the entire fleshy and slime-covered wall in a defeating stride. Heavy dribble floods the mouth, dousing your body in the wet slime with no way for you to escape. The beast was just too massive and powerful, with you just being a bite-sized snack for it. \"G-Grrahh, N-No!\" You growl out, only to be silenced when the dragon's tongue wrestles around your body and pulls you completely inside the slimy cavern. With a shift in its throat, your body suddenly feels the cheeks of the naga beast constrict against you, forcing you to slide into the moist hot tunnel towards your awaiting fate. Your wailing cries are drowned within the thick confining walls hugging against you, slipping your deeper through the curvy rubbery mess of a slide. Darkness, saliva, round curved walls of flesh, heavy and ambient breathing are all that surround you now, and this is that last you see, hear, and feel. You are nothing more than meat to be processed into dragon fat. Quickly sliding on top of Jackal, both of you wriggle the best of your abilities for a chance of escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Gahh...h-how...how do we get out?\" Jackal whines, unable to move in the cramped space compacting him into a still position. You try to push your way through the tightening stomach walls to reach the valve you entered, only to feel that it's closed tight, and the stomach walls drag you back towards Jackal anyway after the Gyarados pokes a claw-tipped finger at its abbed tummy, pushing your down to be trapped in its belly until the very end. Your end. With slimy bodies, you just groan with Jackal as you're ground together and drift into sorrowful slumber, ashamed of falling as meek prey so easily. The digestive fluids pour in as the Gyarados snickers deeply in response of your dissolving hides, listening to you beginning to gurgle away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The infected Gyarados grins maliciously when hearing and feeling the small bulge in its belly wobble with weak discontent. It pokes a finger to make sure the two meals stay together in the acid bath it was dousing them in. It especially murrs when it hears their cries silence away with bubbly groans rippling inside of its powerful stomach. Patting a hand at its hide, it would soon appreciate the little snacks it had to help supply a little bit more fat and muscle for its body. Being a powerful water dragon, this beast would surely never be beaten by anyone, and the world surely doomed. The Gyarados naga dives headfirst back into the water, ready to curl up and resume its nap to digest the remainder of the two fallen heroes. With its size, they wouldn't last long.</i></span></div></div>",

However, you <i>literally</i> fell into its trap! Its maw had opened up, gaping wide enough for you to fall straight onto its tongue as you finally realized its trick, leaving you to ignore your attack and flail helplessly in the air. Nothing could save you though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land with a loud and wet splat, cushioned by the large thick purple tongue of the Aerodactyl to save you from falling to your death, yet dooms you to be eaten now. By the time you regain your stance, its mouth closes shut, trapping you inside the dark maw of the infected dragon. \"No!\" You cry out as you attempt to beat at the walls of its lips. However, you slip before even attempting such a useless tactic, and slam into the thick taste buds of its throbbing tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Aerodactyl quickly lands on a near by cliff top, ready to enjoy its prey that dared to even kill it. The unbelievably large tongue wraps around your puny body, tossing and juggling you inside of the murring jaws as thick hot saliva splashes all across your body. You endeavor to press all of your limbs against the extensive muscle, but can only squirm within its tight salivating grip. You then feel constant shifts, being lifted inside and pressed at the roof of its mouth, dragged along the backs of its teeth, then flopped and rolled over its tongue to gather all of your flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was completely and utterly humiliating, including exhausting of all things. Your breaths become hard pants of air with your muscles tighten and ache from each tumble and lick. Finally, the Aerodactyl tenses its cheeks together, spitting you out in a stream of saliva to have you splat against the canyon-top flooring with a splash of large drool. It oozes around your body as you lay face down in the gloppy puddle, defeated and blinded by the sudden bright light of the sun from the dark caverns of the infected dragon's jaws. Your arms stagger to pull your face out of the thick slime, plopping out to heave in fresh outside air. As your arms try to lift you up, the Aerodactyl's tongue swipes your back, pushing back down into the drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts foot looms over your body, pressing down and sliding your body to be slathered by its saliva. It motions your pathetic body in circles, occasionally flipping you over to get the other side too in the clear goo surrounding you. You cough out the hot liquid, squinting your eyes from the misery until its three-taloned foot releases you from its underside. You can only watch as the Aerodactyl stares down at you with its purple evil eyes, smiling in a cruel gesture that it wasn't done with you for hitting it. You can't stand back up as it scoops you back into its mouth once more, sealing you into almost complete darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, the tongue beats at your body, slapping it around and pressing you in between crevices of its glands for the dragon to playfully chew at your limbs, murring loudly at your taste. Light would sometimes come and go through the openings that occasionally widen when the Aerodactyl softly bites down. Your heart pounds at your chest for the tongue to stop while your muscles begged for mercy in the entire carnage, but no mercy would be given for waking this beast so abruptly. Its tongue wraps around you once more, pushing itself outside of its mouth so you could see the face of the infected dragon once more. It smiles its toothy grin as your body drips its thick drops of saliva below you. You open your mouth to speak, but all that could be heard was a weak wheeze of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied that you had been punished, the dragon's tongue pulls your body back in again, and you pass out before you could even could feel the throat gulp around you to send you into its mighty stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Aerodactyl, now sated with a digesting Lucario in its belly, decides that it would be best to fill the rest of its stomach by following the scent of the canine's previous locations, hopefully luring it to more prey to devour. Jackal waited with Darcy and Morro in their home, waiting for their companion to return after he had hopped on the Aerodactyl as it took off. Suddenly there was a noise at the burrow's opening, and Jackal went to go see. Darcy and Morro watch as the Typhlosion was instantly lifted out of it, followed by yells until a deep and loud gulping noise could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Golem presses a hand at his mate's chest, pushing her away from the opening as they both stare in terror of a purple eye looking down into it, spotting both of the potential meals inside. A large scaled grey hand digs its way into the hole, struggling to grasp both of them. Darcy screams as the two Pokemon retreat to the back of the room, safe from its grasp. But then, the hand slowly pulls out, and the Sandshrew expects the dragon to have finally given up, all until its foot stomps down and destroys most of the ceiling to where the dragon could see them clearly in the bright of day and out in the open!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sandshrew and Golem tense up as they were both grabbed in each of its winged hands and squeezed within its clutches. No matter their writhes, the Aerodactyl releases its tongue and smothers them in its thick saliva. It then tosses them up above its head to snap their bodies into its maw, taking the time to swallow them and feel their bulges travel down its throat. The dragon pats its grey scaled belly while joyfully experiencing the wonders of four bodies to churn inside of it. And it was all thanks to the digesting Lucario that led the infected there.</i></span></div></div>",

Recovering from its daze and growing more furious rather than any dizzier now, the Aerodactyl loudly smacks its fat tongue at its grey lips, licking along its chops that Jackal sees to make the Typhlosion stop dead in his tracks on his way over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Aerodactyl then mightily roars with a raging force of wind, blowing you to slide a few meters against the ground once more that sparks Jackal's attention to run over to you completely this time and help you get back upright as the dragon approaches in thick stomps that were just any ordinary footsteps for the beast.

The ground shook a single powerful rumble with each step while the dragon's eyes focus on the two small morsels it would soon have squirming inside of it. Two large and grey breasts plump out over the Aerodactyl's potbelly, adorning its lustful femininity with puckered dark grey nipples and between her thighs resides a pulsing vertical slit, slightly already glistening from pre already from the large reptile's greed of what was to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal lowly growls before breathing out fire, exhaling a storm of blazing heat to unleash at the beast as you have time to crawl back some and stagger onto your feet. The Aerodactyl merely flaps her violet wings, scattering the fire around to extinguish it easily into nothing but smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal grunts and yells out, \"Fine! Take this then you fat bitch!\" His cheeks stretch roundly out before he spits shots of fireballs from his maw at the Aerodactyl as you aid him with your own ball of aura shooting out from your palms. Those attacks fail as well once most of them miss the dragon once it takes a bounding leap forward. Once it lands, it sends a small tremor through the ground to cause both you and Jackal to stumble and struggle to keep your balance. The Typhlosion worriedly growls now once the dragon is now much closer than before than the two of you would like, and seeing its breasts bounce from its landing mainly caused for an awkward distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong range attacks wouldn't work against her, but getting near her may cost you and Jackal your lives! Running away wouldn't possibly work, because the dragon would simply charge forward and chomp your body into her gullet the second you turned around. You didn't want it to be this way, but close-combat was the only remaining solution at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts impressively long tongue licks at the edges of its lips, eager for your consumption as you explain to Jackal, \"We're going to have to take her at the same time. You attack her left side, and I'll go for the right side. Perhaps then that could confuse her movements some at least if we want any chance of getting out of this alive.\" The Typhlosion glances over to you with an unsure look, but was willing to try anything in hopes of not becoming food.

Jackal attempts to brake in pursuit and digs his heels into the ground, but only to manage to sliding straight into the Aerodactyl's grasp as well! You gasp and struggle within her curled hand, barking out in agitated spat of anger that you had been captured so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infected dragon seemingly rumbles a chuckling noise, giving off a toothy grin as she eyes the two of you squirming within her hands, now at the her not very promising mercy. You glance over to the cavern entrance then had led you up to the plateau to spot Darcy still there with a hand cupped over her mouth and her hazel eyes wide with shock. You bark out, \"Darcy, help us!\" The Sandshrew can only stand there silently before taking a few steps back. \"Darcy, no! You can still help us, just-\" You attempt to plead with her more, but the desert rodent quickly makes her way back down into the cave to leave you and Jackal to your demise. Your ears fold back and your whole body feels an ominous drain from the feeling of being abandoned so easily like that. Although, as if it had mattered. The best Darcy could've done was just end up as an extra plumply appetizer for the Aerodactyl, and you had already promised to take care of the infected yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peer back over to only get a steamy exhale washing over you as the thick tongue of the dragon drags powerfully against your face to push your head up as far as it could. You can only pant and whine in response while the dragon takes a liking to your taste but has other plans for the two of you. You discover what that is once she lowers Jackal closer to the ground, seeming as if she was going to let him go. As if that either, because holding his wriggling body in place below her, the dragon leans her waist towards the Typhlosion to let her large, pulsating sex press against his face. His growls become suddenly muffled and startled protests of confusion and unwilling surprise as he's pushed into her vagina, causing the Aerodactyl to grumble out a joyful murr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could slightly see Jackal being absorbed within the thick pussy as the grey-to-pink lips tighten around him, but you could most of all hear it. Every wet squelch of the pussy to signify the Typhlosion being forced in deeper, the happy murrls of the dragon enjoying the living and wriggling dildo entering inside of her, and the suppressed sounds of Jackal as he unhappily moans with the confusing arousal getting to him. There was a sudden shift in movements with the Aerodactyl's fist grip then, and you are squeezed even tighter with your lithe body from her pleasured grip that she gives off with the warm body moving into her sensitive folds, almost crushing your back in the process! All of a sudden, you are now lowering down between her legs as you gape your mouth open in terror once you see two Typhlosion legs kick endlessly into the air until they slide upward, disappearing between her pulsing vaginal walls. The complete unbirthing of your friend forces her pussy to drool with more pre out from it to even strand out some. You want to be both horrified and pleased from the unfortunate sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grasp then flips you upside down, letting your hind paws stick up into the air and your head aimed at the ground to where all of the blood rushes there, as well as your cock the more you stare at the sexualized doom awaiting for you. You struggle and struggle with all of your might, but it would all prove to have no point for you though, especially when her grip never ceases in strength while with you just raised and dangling at the entrance to her hot vagina that you could the warm temperatures already from how close you are. Your footpads touch the outer-surface of the slick, wet walls, letting you gasp from their thick hide yet soft slickness. This was it. Just like you had witnessed back in Redeemer's Grotto, your journey would wind you up into a death many others have faced. Not just some crazy animal's jaws, but their own vagina. Then again, you try to think of other ways that could possibly be better, but your concentration is broken as your pleasantly forced in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infected Aerodactyl forcefully plunges you inward, jabbing your body already half way inside to be eager with your consumption. Your legs are subjected to the warm hot-spell of her vaginal walls as they creep around your body in an odd but comfortable way. Sucked inward again with a strong tug and pre squirting out tightly through any remaining crevices of her pussy onto you, her hand finally releases you once you're at last sucked in by your waist to pin your arms to you sides, deep in enough that you no longer needed leverage to stay stuck in between the thick grey lips of her crotch. With her hands empty once again, the Aerodactyl firmly grasps them onto her grey breasts, rolling and squeezing them around from the pleasure her Typhlosion and Lucario dildos  give off to her like the toys you both are now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the blood is still packed in your head from the upside down gravity, and you feel yourself growing tired from all of your feeble attempts of escape and wiggle out. Although, your head at last is suckled inside the strange gulping function of the Aerodactyl's blazing pussy as your arms manage to get free from your sides once the walls loosen up some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands grasp tightly at the outside edge of her vagina, making your last attempt for survival a pathetic one. You groan weakly as you stare at the barely open slit as your only light source within the dark, slimy madness of the vaginal tunnel continuously pulling at your body. Suddenly you feel the walls of the pussy beginning to vibrate madly, and a flood of her orgasm washes over you in an attack of thick, hot cum to coat over you and spill a bit from her snatch. The thick liquid droops around you to the point where you're taken back completely that this was your end and how things ended up for you. In fact, the dragon's love juices made it impossible for you to keep your grasp and longer, and your hands slip! You whine as you see the light beginning to fade away once the pouring lips seal together and you're pulled deeper into the squelching darkness of her womb with the help of a force also pushing down on your head, making you slide next to a still-struggling Jackal as he presses all of his limbs out against the tight walls, only to have them converge around you both in their overpowering strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Typhlosion can only exhale out in exhaustion and fear with barely enough room to even open his mouth, \"Ahhh...hahh...L-Lace is that you? Wh-what do we do?\" You don't bother answering, not knowing what was going to happen to you at this point if you weren't inside a stomach. It wouldn't matter either way, because you quickly pass out from the very thin air left in the completely tight chamber along with your fallen friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Aerodactyl roars from her climax, ejecting out her cum as she lays back down against the ground. She opens her legs wide as she releases a hand that was earlier fondling a boob down to her vagina to feel the hands of the foolish Lucario to slip. She wrings a finger into her pussy, feeling its tip press against the top of the canine's head. She pokes the doomed dog even deeper inward as she pulls the wet finger out, letting a long strand of her hot fluids carry along with it in a beautiful arcing strand of clear goo hanging downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Aerodactyl goes to rest again into her nest on her backside as she feels her potbelly shudder with excitement, bulging out two struggling meals within it as they shift around some. The infected Aerodactyl places a hand on her scaly belly, sloshing it around as she hears the two anthros whimper aloud while their bodies would soon digest away inside the womb to be processed into her cum. The infected grins and closes her eyes again, digging a clawed finger around inside her pussy more to tease the slick walls. With her arousal and new meals, the time it would take to boil them down into the heavenly ooze would quicken for her to leak their spoogy remains out.</i></span></div></div>",

However, not everyone gets to live out their fantasies, because the Aerodactyl steps forward as well to quicken the ground covered between both of you. Your vision is quickly enveloped with the toothy and open maw of the Aerodactyl, letting you get a brief look of the rippling flesh awaiting to take you before the wet jaws chomp up both you and Jackal in one bite! The lips instantly close with a low snap, trapping you inside completely whole with Jackal. The two of you splat against her drenched tongue, covered in her slimy dribble that doused Jackal's flame behind his neck to be extinguished completely. The act had Jackal's eyes go wide as he suddenly found himself to be completely sapped of strength in just a matter of seconds with his fuel source gone now. After the wet collision, you both collapse onto the tongue with Jackal writhing softly, unable to even get up as he groans. You struggle to get up as fat taste buds pressed at your body, flicking you inside the constantly motioning and very tight maw to where you slam against the inner cheek walls, large fanged walls, and palate of mouth. Even with the Aerodactyl's large size, there wasn't much space to truly move without being constrained and hitting something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven within this toil, you're more at a mental war with yourself rather than with the Aerodactyl. You can't comprehend the fact that it was so easy for you to be just eaten like this, to where you were once a potential hero to the world one second, and then tongue-toy the next. Now you understood why all the other pokemon who came through this canyon valley just disappeared. This colossal monster has gobbled them all up and shown its true superiority in this kingdom it reigns. The Village Chief had given you instructions to pass through this canyon, most likely fully aware of the dangers at hand here, and you could only wonder why he had set you up to this. Unable to have the time to power any of your aura without colliding into something, you're beyond help now as you are forced to submit to the wrestling tongue of the large dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour are knocked into Jackal on multiple occasions as you two tumble around within the Aerodactyl's mouth, already exhausting yourself completely just trying to move at all. The infected murrs happily, mockingly to chew softly at your bodies with her teeth lightly grinding down on you, sometimes even wrapping her tongue around you entirely to smother you in the thick flesh and saliva. Darcy on the outside having to witness could only worriedly look from afar, shaking her head as another hero fell to the might of the Aerodactyl. Having seen enough, the Sandshrew turns around and leaves, never looking back as she was forced to listen to the wet slurps and whining moans from within the maw sound out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of gloating in her victory, the Aerodactyl was finished playing her easy meals and goes to end you off by giving a large swallow, sending you and your companion downwards to finally digest in her large stomach. You are squished into Jackal within the extensive tunnel in her neck, sinking down together in the extremely narrow space to be laddered down by the esophagus walls to bulge out in a thick lump on the outside for the Aerodactyl's neck, sharing the same fate same fate as you meet her churning stomach welcoming your hides in. You could barely manage to breathe inside the confined organ, especially with the Typhlosion whimpering and wriggling softly as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal's voice mutters out, \"Th-that bitch...I-I'm not some fucking p-p-piece of food for some...s-some...\" The Typhlosion loses his sentence as he faints at last. He was using all the strength he had left in his body just to stay awake. You whine and try pushing the stomach walls away with your arms, only to give in to the elastic strength of the flesh to have the just smack back around you and hug you so powerfully that you couldn't move anywhere at all. Stomach juices begin to pour inside to bathe both you and your friend in their hot wetness, preparing you to the digestive fate you face. You could only hope that Darcy would help you, or Morro, or even anyone for that matter. You didn't think it was fair that you are left like this now in your quest, within a gurgling cauldron of flesh to become scaly fat for a dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo much air was used up at this point now, and your lungs begin to dwindle weaker by the second as your mind drifts off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Aerodactyl gropes her winged hand at her grey belly, fumbling and toying with the meek prey inside her to feel as it gurgles and groans with food back in her system. She chuckles at the failed heroes' pitiful attempt to take down such a powerful predator as her, and her breasts and protruding gut bounce with each deep laugh the dragon bellows out in its daily food claiming with the intent of the Typhlosion and Lucario going to join the pudge of those very orbs on her body. Satisfied, the infected dragon crawls back to her den to finish the rest she wanted in the first place, knowing that the aching headache she was given by the Lucario was indeed worth the meal she easily got. The infected lizard's tongue rims along her lips as she dreams of their flavors again and eating the two in all sorts of ways.</i></span></div></div>",

Both you and Jackal are clutched within the Aerodactyl's tightening grip, trapped at this point in the palms and large claws pinning your arms to your sides to make it impossible to strike back with any punches or kicks; your legs were even just uselessly hanging in the air and thrashing uncontrollably. A deviant chuckle musters from deep inside the Aerodactyl's extensive neck, and his purple vibrant eyes flip its sight to each of you simultaneously, seemingly to decide what to do with you first. Jackal growls and wriggles more, exclaiming, \"L-Let go of me! I'll tear your fucking head off you dumb, fat lizard!\" His words meant nothing to the beast however. The Aerodactyl stretches a toothy and drooling smile once he made his mind up, and lowers his hands gripped around you both down to be presented in front of the his hot crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel the heat expelling off from his stout meaty cock to the point where it could even steam with it, scaring you of what this meant for your fate. Jackal's eyes widen and his struggles became more apparent and messy. \"H-Hell no! You're no-\" The large underside of the penis presses against Jackal to muffle the rest of his protest as you watch with shock with the Typhlosion forced against the wall of sticky, bulbous flesh smooshing his face and body into the cock to be treated like a masturbation post. There, the hand faps some to grind the thick dragonhood against the Typhlosion for the Aerodactyl to enjoy and sate itself with. Jackal, on the other hand, was in complete turmoil and humiliation as he's played with, subjected to a cock in front of you, all before he was lifted suddenly and held by just his ankles by the claw-tipped fingers of the dragon to dangle the Typhlosion over the vertical lips of the Aerodactyl's pulsing member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Typhlosion writhes in the air, trying to swing himself away from the head of the cock as he watches the lips slowly part open lightly to let pre drizzle out of it and beckon the meaty fire-type into its hot depths. He yells to you in desperation, \"L-L-Lace! H-Help me!\" There wasn't anything you could do though. You knew at this point you were both cock food now. The fingers poke him in head first and you fidget uncomfortably in the Aerodactyl's grip while the chest, stomach, and legs of your comrade shudder madly from being swallowed inside the big, grey penis. It was an unholy sight of seeing a feral use its sexual organs to feed on, but it was exactly what you had to witness during the battle of Redeemer's Grotto. Except this time, you're going to share a fate just like those soldiers did. Jackal's scrunched hindpaws disappear within the bulbous tip, making a throbbing bulge slide down the pulsating dick to plop into the dragon's ball sac, and with that scarring image, you look up to see the Aerodactyl maniacally smiling down at you. It's <i>your</i> turn now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcy from afar witnesses the horror of what has become the two of her relied heroes, but can't help to oddly feel a little wet from the sight of the dragon's cock bulging like that with Jackal inside. The Sandshrew didn't even realize it at first, but her hand rubbed over her belly to slide in between her thighs to dig around at her nethers. Pre coats her at her fingers as she bites her bottom lip until she catches herself with what she was doing. Her cheeks glow red as she takes pleasure in seeing your demise, and quickly makes her way back into the cavern to go home and tell Morro the sad news that yet another traveler was gone...and then maybe help her with her heat afterwards to get over the moment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you unwillingly meet a whip-like tongue as it slurps around your apparently delicious body that drenches you in its slimy saliva as lubrication for your upcoming trip. You can only gasp and whimper as the muscle takes its time to shower you with its predatory affection with the hand occasionally squeezing you in aroused reflexes, all until you feel your footpaws have two fleshy lips squeeze around them. Looking down to your horror, the powerful cock begins sucking you inside with tugs and pulsates with the anxious heartbeat of the Aerodactyl's delight The bulge of Jackal that had traveled down the thick tube was already stretching a testicle inside the Aerodactyl's sac, making a single orb on one side a little rounder and heavy-looking. You could only guess that you were to fill the one for heaven-knows-what will happen to you next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFolding your ears back and giving off puppy dog eyes to what was happening to you, you glance up to the Aerodactyl looking for some kind of act of mercy, but the dragon is only murring and smiling while watching is cock slowly slurp you inside. Your body is easily dragged into the sex organ with your wet body practically sliding its way down on its own thanks to the glaze of dragon drool dripping off you. At last, the Aerodactyl places a finger tip at your head when it was the only thing left outside the capsule of cock completely surrounding the rest of body, pushing it down. The outside world ends for you when everything was obscured by a dark slick wall crammed against your face with pre sticking to your body the whole way down. Sinking down inside the massive penis, you are submerged into an orb like prison filled with hot cum that take up most of the space inside. You squeeze into it as the sphincter entrance behind you closes once you plop into the tight prison, sealing your fate forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls of the testicle begin to swell out, making sure you are completely immobilized in cum and flesh to begin its digestion. You pant nervously, trying to fidget or budge in hopes for anything to help you, but the murky seed simply bubbles hotly around you like a thick, slimy jacuzzi that you find oddly tiring. You simply are forced to just sulk down as you sink into the cum, with only most of your head above the surface of the warm broth. This was it, you were sure at this point. If this feral wasn't going to digest you in stomach, it certainly was going to digest you at least somewhere in its body. You couldn't believe this was your end now to your adventure. Being slid down into a penis to probably become this perverted animal's semen. You curse the Aerodactyl for getting a lucky grasp to you to where everyone who hears the story of Lace be that he was devoured by some stupid animal's cock. Soft banging could be heard next to you along with the muffled cries of Jackal, still fighting to escape his inevitable doom. He was non-purposely kicking you through the thick flesh between you two, make the cum slosh over you to completely obscure you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if you cared at this point. You sink completely under the pool of cum now to lay at the hot bottom of the blending chamber, quickly passing out as the walls mash against you to turn you into more Aerodactyl cum...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Aerodactyl madly pumps his bulging cock into its hand as it falls on his back, lying on his nest once more. The dragon grunts loudly with his smiling and open maw, feeling the two small, weak Pokemon churn into his seed inside his newly heavy weighted balls for a nice new batch of cream to release. He feels the duo slosh around within his swaying sac, conjuring up a mighty white brew to erupt.

White blasting strands lunge out of the twitching cock to spill all inside the Aerodactyl's small den.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sweating dragon flops his tongue out as he fondles his fingers firmly against the penis and strokes it upwards, squeezing every last hot drop of the cum of the digested failures to rope along the rock walls. He lets his head fall back and his heavy breathes subside back into long snoozing breaths once he falls asleep again from the magnificent orgasm of the two cock-meals.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The large Aerodactyl spots you dashing towards it while separating to take on a different side of it. Had it been a simple feral like most are, it would've easily been fooled and tricked by this tactic, however this Aerodactyl was far superior than that. There was a reason no one ever escaped this canyon, and the feral would show you and your companion that this was its domain. Knowing that it needed to keep you both in its sights, the dragon merely spins around in a violent twist with its massive tail sweeping by. Both you and Jackal see the long tendril coming and are left completely defenseless as it swings around to slam against you two. You crash into the ground tumbling in a roll, bruising occasionally with the pounding dirt and rubble from your assault until the momentum finally slows down to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms wobble as you pick your face out of the earth and struggle to get back up, only to look at the ground and see the shadow of the Aerodactyl's tail looming around you and becoming large and darker quickly. Before you could even comprehend what that meant, the tail crashes down on top of you to smash you into the canyon dirt some more. You bark out once the muscled tendril slams against your back as your body is flattened to the floor until it lifts its tail for a moment, letting any rubble left stuck to it eventually drop down onto your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Gahh...Jackal!\" You call out for your friend in hopes that he would attack it since its distracted with beating you down. Although, you soon hear weak coughing from nearby, and with an unwillingly glance over to your side was the Typhlosion a few meters away from you. Jackal was holding his head with one hand and using the other to prop his upper body up from his back on the ground. The groaning Typhlosion gets to a knee of being upright before the Aerodactyl's tail slams down on him this time. You wince once you hear Jackal yelp out with the dirt-ripping sound of the impact. Doing the same thing and letting any stuck rubble to its tail, the infected dragon murrs and shakes its tail above Jackal to let the remaining rubble plop of its scales and crumble onto his body in a sick taunt towards you two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou growl and endeavor to get up as fast as you can, only then to have the tail ram down on you and then to Jackal, and then back to you. The Aerodactyl murrs with great pleasure as it just alternates the slams of its tail onto each of you, smashing you deeper and deeper into the dirt as you form a Lucario-shaped crater into the ground some with plenty of bruises scattered your body, as well as thick rocks falling down on top of you with each tail-hovering moment after the brutal smashing. Even Jackal was in the same predicament, whipped under the tail as it beats against the dirt until both of you have gone deep enough to where the dirt now was nothing but wet clay. This in turn causes the groaning Typhlosion to stick to the large reptile's tail once it raised back up in the air. The Aerodactyl glances back behind it to grin from the fire-type almost being embedded into the scales from the sticky clay, and happily waggles its rear and bounces its tail in the air until Jackal finally peels off from the muscled tentacle. The Typhlosion crashes down on top of you, too battered to even try and get off you so that you're both just laying against the ground panting at each other's faces. You even take note that his face was a bit puffy and suffered a black eye, along with his mane of fire barely even ignited at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarcy sees this from afar, appalled by the sight and starts to back away, \"I-I...I told you that this was a dumb idea! Don't say I didn't warn ya, mutt!\" She calls out before disappearing into the cave to take security back into her home and tell Morro the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only whine as the Aerodactyl looks back behind to check on you two again and see that you're completely beaten at this point. The tail lowers down softly this time to your surprised and wraps around both you and Jackal together in thick coils. Your two pummeled bodies are squeezed tightly into each other within the encircling tendril as it lowers down to bring you closer to the dragon. Unfortunately for you though, you're confused as to why it holds you directly in front of its large, scaly ass, thinking that you and your friend were going to be chomped up and swallowed for good. You then recall earlier this day of the Redeemer's Grotto battle, and witnessing all of the different ferals using their sex organs to devour the poor soldiers they defeated. Your heart drops into your stomach as you begin writhing again inside its grasp, desperately trying to escape knowing that it was going to cram you into its rectum!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal coughs out and grumbles weakly, \"Wh-what's it doing?\" You didn't bother telling him as he was about to find out. The Aerodactyl is still looking back over to you two, grinning maliciously with fangs and drool as you see its aroused cock swing and throb between its legs to where it happily paws at it to squish curtains of pre onto the ground under it. Your focus is then brought to it using a hand to grope one of its butt cheeks, tugging at it to part his rear some for you to stare at the dark grey anus pulsating with winces. Jackal can't help but blush at the strange sight and worriedly asks again, \"What's gonna h-happen to us? L-Lace! Help us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm...nngh...trying...!\" You try to wheeze out as the tail clenches strongly at that moment. Although, there wasn't anything you could do but wriggle around for the Aerodactyl's own pleasure. Your aura wasn't charging anywhere in your body, and Jackal certainly couldn't fight anymore. Your ears fold back as the tail smooshes the both of you against its rear, squeezing your heads inside its asshole. The thick, powerful ring suckles your head in and immediately tightens, trapping you both from pulling out. Jackal gasps and fidgets his head around the narrow tunnel of muscles compacting all around, unable to do anything to stop this from happening. The tail happily begins motioning around in circles to dig your bodies around at the large pucker to tease the stretchable walls, all before stuffing you two almost completely inside the hot embrace of the infected's rectum. The anal walls hug around you with the Typhlosion squished against you, forced to take this ride into your doom together as your legs simply dangle outside in between its chubby scaly buns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tail then pulls away just to use its flat spaded tip to press against your hindpaws and shover them in, stuffing inside the anus as well to have the dragon roar out with arousal. Getting onto its chest and knees, the Aerodactyl strokes away at its fat member while the tail slides into its rear to push you and Jackal together closer to its stomach before at last, a sphincter opens, and you are pulled inside the dank and empty chamber that you guess is your last stop. Jackal struggles to kick at the stomach walls, whining out, \"H-How did this thing...beat us...<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">it's just some</font>...<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">dumb</font>...<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">a-a-animal</font>...\" The rowdy fire-type finally passes out, but you are still forced to grind bodies with him as the tail ramming the Aerodactyl's ass causes the whole stomach to slosh back and forth in its motions with stomach fluids splashing all over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou whimper as you think of your journey up to this point, nothing more then being defeated by a feral and squeezed up its rump. Now you were going to digest away into fat and become a part of the very thing that doomed you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Aerodactyl tosses its head up with tightly shut eyes and a rolled out tongue swinging around as its tail slide back and forth inside of its butt, rubbing against the hot fleshy walls inside the has the dragon almost yelping out with each thrust. At last, it roars out a mighty bellow as hot jizz squirts out in thick globs onto the dirt, oozing out with bubbling cum and vaporing steam that it finally emptied out from its sac. The dragon falls back, panting and sweating furiously from another delightful meal for its ass, adoring every second those two pesky anthros put up with struggling inside. It cups a hand over its chubby belly, squeezing and rubbing around to feel their unconscious bodies churning into fat and energy for the Aerodactyl to just be another addition to its trophy case of a gut to signify all of the pokemon it has claimed for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking it lips, it will recollect this memory in its dreams for weeks to come. And thus, the potential heroes Lace and Jackal fell to the might of the infection and the apocalypse.</i></span></div></div>",

The Aerodactyl flashes its furious gaze to you, filled with rage in its interrupted slumber from an uninvited guest preparing to attack it in its sleep. It opens its steamy maw wide, roaring directly in front of you to blow your body back far to fall off the nest and onto your rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Lace!</i>\" You hear Jackal's voice yell out to you after you witness a large and hungry mouth come towards you. A long, purple tongue whips out, leaking heavy drool to overflow the Aerodactyl's mouth at your temporarily downed body to feel it hook and slither around your backside wetly. The infected dragon snaps you up quickly, taking half of your entire body inside its long jaws. Your legs thrash desperately in the air outside as your chest and face are attacked by the slimy fat tongue, feeling it wrap around your canine torso to taste and tug at. Murrs rumble from deep within the infected dragon's throat, enjoying your rare flavor. You gag and bark inside the dragon's mouth, struggling to free yourself from its sealed lips while they suckle at your smaller form pinned in between them. \"N-No! Let me go!\" You roar out with the infected Aerodactly not caring for whatever you were saying, although you were pretty sure it knew what you wanted anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt opens its maw to snap its jaws together again, devouring your entire body with just two bites! Trapped completely inside its mouth now, your little furry body is subjected to a torture of a massive tongue wrapping around you and smacking you around inside the already tight and non-spacious jaws. Wet muscles collide to play with you as hot saliva bathes you entirely. You can only unwillingly groan as the slick flesh smacks you about, showing you the food that you are at this point. Just then, you feel a sudden drenching, tight feeling as you are suddenly compressed within its throat and sliding down its long elastic neck with a loud gulp emitting around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal from the outside barks out, spitting fire at the Aerodactyl in an attempt to save you. His attack would fail in the end though once the grey dragon sprouts its large purple wings and unleashes a fierce wind to swirl the fire away with just a single flap. The Typhlosion is knocked back by the force, crashing into a wall by the cavern entrance all of you had traveled inside. Darcy, by the opening, presses a hand against her mouth with fear flooding her eyes in absolute horror of the failed mission, and turned to run only to have two large winged hands lashing out and grabbing the Sandshrew and unconscious Typhlosion in each palm. You have no clue what's going on outside except for the bounding movements of the Aerodactyl the sloshes you around within the narrow and tight stomach. Juices inside the chamber splash onto your body as its constricted together by fat fleshy bumps of the stomach walls, happily squeezing you to trap you inside and wash you with their enzymes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting harder from the slimy darkness and less air inside the chamber, you can only hope that Jackal is able to defeat this monster. Even then, you didn't know how you were going to make it out of its powerful stomach. All hope was lost though once you feel the knocked out head of a Typhlosion begin sliding in next to you after some loud slurping and swallowing. The fire-type's mane of flames was completely extinguished from the thick slime of the dragon's saliva, meaning that Jackal would have no strength to do anything even if was able to awaken again. Whining out, this is not the way you wanted things to end. You still had a mission to complete. Promises to keep. A world to save. But those thoughts are quickly gone once a chubby Sandshrew slides into the stomach as well, wailing and squirming around to escape. All three of your bodies are compacted together inside the gut with the organ beginning to pool up with more of its fluids. Your body is pushed so tightly that your face returns to being smooshed in between Darcy's breasts and against her belly as her writhing caused the soft pudge covered in warm saliva to rub around you. It was the only thing you could appreciate as the stomach overwhelms you. The last thing you hear are Darcy's words of, \"Ahhhhh! I-I thought you said you could st-stop it, ya mutt...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Two fat Sandshrew legs squirm outside of the Aerodactyl's jaws for the dragon to joyfully slurp inside, sending a third piece of its lunch down. Its mighty and scaly belly pushes outward, sporting an impressive new size thanks to the foolishness of the Lucario. It rubs its large gut to knead its hands into the added weight as its stomach churns the three anthros inside. Not expecting anymore trouble, it stumbles back into its nest, slamming down on its back to have its protruding potbelly poke out at the top like a gurgling trophy for it. Placing a single hand on the belly and the other behind its own head, it slept pleasantly to enjoy the writhing within its stomach to digest. The Aerodactyl could finally catch up with its rest it lost thanks to that stupid pup.</i></span></div></div>",

Your eyes grow wide as you attempt to move back, however, the Sandshrew approaches you with large heavy and footsteps closing in onto your quivering body. She's a bit more on the obese side of things, with thick arms and legs surrounded by light golden brown scales, sporting an impressive large potbelly with big spherical breasts resting at each top, covered in a soft plushy skin/flesh. Her under-skin part felt like a fluffy layered cushion, poking her gargantuan girth out. Her hands and short claw digits, with her feet mere oval-like stubs with two claws jetting out from their ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tongue wipes across her lips, lazily allowing a drop of drool to trickle from her chin and down her neck. The Sandshrew stretches her thick arms wide, hugging around your frail body and pressing you deeply and surprisingly powerfully into her fat. You are constricted into her large and tight grasp, being pinned against her big belly and bone-crushing arms that never cease to release your throbbing body. Once again, you came face first in between the breasts of the Sandshrew, hearing her laugh as she continues to squeeze you in throughout your constant writhing. The desert rodent lifts her arms up a bit, letting your feet pick off from the floor to kick your legs maniacally out aimlessly. You try to yell Jackal's name, but only muffled speech ripples in the Sandshrew's pudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Golem happily waltzes over to the stunned Typhlosion, receiving a surprise view of Jackal's rump up in the air, ready for the taking. He grabs an ankle hungrily, and starts to lick at his hindpaw with the ground-turtle's long throbbing tongue, tasting while lapping up his flavor. Saliva drips in between the three digits of Jackal's right foot as he wriggles them some while groaning out loud, still semi-conscious from his impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmm...it's been a bit of time since we've had some company! Should we have some little ol' fun with our guests, hun?\" The Sandshrew flirtatiously asks her mate. The Golem grumbles...</span></div></div>",

He immediately plunges both of Jackal's feet in, basking his tongue all across them. The tongue would scoop its slimy texture over the hindpaws, pressing against the soles and licking up the ankles, slurping wetly and loudly, which results in Jackal murring for a moment before shaking his fuzzy dizziness away. He feels a strange wet tightness to his feet, and as he looked up, he spots a Golem nibbling happily on them. The Typhlosion then panics at the sight, thrashing around as he lays on the backs of his shoulders. The rock tortoise keeps his vice grip around the Typhlosion's ankles, placing Jackal to lie on the top of his head for his legs to be swallowed up in the descending and chomping maw of the Golem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly feel yourself lift a bit higher up, reaching your head to meet face to face with the fat Sandshrew woman. Her tongue dabs out, licking around your lips and wrapping against your muzzle to slather it in thick trails of slobber. Her tongue pushes through your lips, tasting the inside of your mouth even when it pumped against your own tongue!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmghpph! Mmmpph!\" You whine desperately, mashing your hands and knees into the strong plush fat of your captor. Trying to fight back, her hefty thick arms prove to outmatch any of resistance! She breaks her long devouring kiss, leaving your head to be drenched in dribble as it seeps down in long, sticky strands. You cough out some her spit from you own mouth, only to receive the view of an open maw closing in on your head. Warm breath releases against your face, feeling the moist steaming temperature from the exhale to dampen your fur woefully while you're being eaten, and not by a feral like you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth chomps down, taking in your head more and shutting out all the light from your vision. Your face is pressed against the dripping wet walls of her throat as the Sandshrew makes quick time in her swallows. With a juicy gulp, your torso is crammed deeply into her cushioned flab, squishing the soft fat as your body is slowly brought into her mouth with each moment passing of her Lucario-dinner binge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour upper body sinks into her throat very easily as your head begins to nosedive into the inside of the fat Sandshrew's neck. A bulge forms in her soft underbelly, pushing out and squirming for life during your constant whimpers of distress. After your blue rump is eaten into her greedy jaws, she lifts her head up, allowing your exposed black legs to kick awkwardly in the air and she seals your fate when she closes her lips around your hindpaws. Your face enters the stomach, jamming your head inside while the rest of your body covered in a clear slimy liquid squeezes inside with it. Two hands press against the fat belly walls over your body, rubbing around to jiggle and slosh you inside with stomach fluids splashing all around inside the tight space. When all of a sudden, four hands began to press at the belly, pushing you inward and outward and side to side within the chamber's liquids bathing your furry hide for digestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-n-nnngh...n-nooo...stop...\" You whimper as you're tossed around the completely compacted belly with no room left at this point. You begin to grow weary as you try to kick at the tough yet plump organ walls, disappointed in how you weren't able to cure the infection as you fell into a obese Sandshrew's twisted trap, and including into a faint state of mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Sandshrew let the two sensitive Lucario paws sink down into her, swallowing his entire body whole gloatingly. She releases a heavy belch when the foolish canine hit the bottom of her stomach, and grips her own fat belly afterwards. The scaled desert rodent began shaking it, sloshing the stupid mutt within her gut to finally teach him the rules and dangers of the canyon. She looks back at her Golem mate, watching while the Typhlosion head roars and yells before becoming muffled by the Golem's mouth closing around it. A loud swallow echoes out through the small tunnel home, and the Sandshrew waddles over to her lover with her round belly bouncing with each step. The rock turtle squeezes his hands against her twitching gut after spotting it, feeling the pathetic Lucario inside the plushy flesh kick with its tired might. She also places her hands against her own belly, rubbing it with her mate as the squirming plump bellies pressed against each other to digest the two heroes. The two random travelers would definitely sustain their low food supply with the ferals having eaten most of the villagers of the area. At least, it would sustain them until the next batch of travelers arrived...</i></span></div></div>",

As soon as you open your mouth to protest, the sandshrew plants her hand firmly against the back your head again, forcing you to unwillingly fit her nipple on the pale plushy tit into your mouth to accidentally suckle when you try to breathe in air in your maw. Sweet milky contents suddenly start to squirt out into your mouth, like a fountain of white nectar which causes you to shudder and almost melt in her clutches unwillingly. It had been so long since you've had something other than water to drink, and you were a real 'sucker for milk' in more ways than one, almost like a weakness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sandshrew groans out loud with closed eyes and a salivating, open mouth, \"Oooooohhhhhh.....Aaaaahhhh....~!!!\" Her grumbling begins to increase when her other hand eagerly fondles around her other breast, milk lactating from the grayish round nipple with each squeeze. You try to pull back weakly, but her thick strong arms are far too powerful as they squish you against her plump girth. More milk pours into your mouth while you had to continuously drink and swallow at the same time, mortifying you within the unwilling torture, yet finding some sense of bewildered pleasure out it all. The liquid starts to flood out of your mouth in small strands of milk to drip out from your full cheeks with the milk you had swallowed seeps down into your belly, churning out to expand your belly a bit some. Your yellow small potbelly presses against the Sandshrew's own intimidating gut, rubbing its fur with her comfy pudge. You are just surprised at the amount she had all of this time, even with such large breasts. You even begin to slide your tongue around the nipple, softly poking your teeth at it to willingly pleasure her for the delectable milk, seduced into sucking her tit dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe desert Pokemon finally pops you off the teat, leaving you to be too intoxicated by the milk to swallow the rest, so you loosen your jaw, dropping small puddle amounts of the white mixture to pour out in agony to the ground. You then feel her pull you down to your weak knees as she lays down, opening her legs wide open for you to see. Her blooming vagina flourished out, dripping with pre from anticipation. It pulsates a deep pinkish-red color when her pucker hole also throbs out too. The musty hole craves to be filled with a Lucario, yet so does her slick nethers! The Sandshrew scoffs at you staring in your aroused and drowsy state, \"Like what ya see, hun?

The hot stench of her vagina flooded your mouth, burning it from her enticement, as the pre became to drip around your face. Before your eyes were obscured into the steaming pussy, you watched as the Golem began to shift in movements until standing up, exposing a brown squirming bulge growing through his crotch! He had cock vored Jackal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could do anything, your eyes began to lose their light, and were filled with a deep darkness. The pulsating walls wrapped over your shoulders, sucking you in her rippling slick lower lips. You kicked your legs to squirm on the ground, but was suddenly stopped when you felt the Golem mount on top of your rump! Whimpering in defeat, you felt the cock head poke in between your furry blue rump cheeks, forcefully pressed itself in! He strikes into your anus forcefully, causing a muffled yelp within the fat Sandshrew's waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pumped his member forward, sliding it to feel your entire anal tunnel quiver in its presence. Every time he humped forward, you were sent even further into the awaiting consumption pussy, leaking out more pre against your pinned body. Your arms, hips, and soon waist were swallowed whole by her sex organ. Your erect shaft began to press at the vaginal walls of the obese desert rodent, squeezing out clear liquid from your cock tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final pump, your entire rump was gulped or humped inside. The Golem gripped the legs of the Sandshrew, placing her thick heavy legs upon his shoulders, while the head tip of the Golem's cock squeezed out of your anus, hard. You bark through your mouth pinned jaws from the pain. Your black furred legs would slowly sink into the Sandshrew's waist as she began to blush from having her mate begin to slide his cock into her vagina!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the thick and sticky penis press and rub between your legs until you were gulped all the way to your feet. The tip then shoved your foot paws in by ramming into the waist of your predator. You felt pre squirt onto your foot pads and toes before they too, were sucked inside. You curl within the rocking womb, still shaking from the motions of the Sandshrew and the Golem to continue to have sex. You then remembered Jackal, being eaten by...oh no...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Golem roared out, blasting the seed digested Typhlosion into the stretching pussy. You felt an entire storm flood of cum splatter against you, practically almost filling the entire womb! you felt sick to your stomach knowing you were swimming in your friend's remains, but your cock said other wise. You too released your climax, spurting it within the submerged pool of seed, wasting enough energy to pass out in the cum filled organ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Golem bucked his hips straight into his lover, as her body was shaking back and forth from the motions, jiggling her fat and heavy breasts. The tortoise felt his climax rising, and unleashed his pressure, jamming two Lucario paws into her vagina as he ejaculated his previous Typhlosion meal into the Sandshrew. The Golem squirts any remaining left overs in his drained testicles inside her, before pulling out. The both of the mates lay down on their backs, breathing heavily and leaking liquids from there crotches. The Sandshrew's belly squirmed in delight from the heavy flood of semen, jiggling around until stopping forever.</i></span></div></div>",

The cracking of the underbrush alerts your ears as they react by poking out in the direction of the fearing sound. You stop, and hold your arm in front of Jackal to stop him from continuing on further. You search through the flood of trees and plants, browsing for anything out of the ordinary. Although, you only saw plants; no purple eyes, or strange anthro Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Jackal asks, until he is suddenly tripped to crash onto the ground! A single vine was wrapped around his ankle, constricting it tightly as it began to crawl up his leg like a snake. The Typhlosion begins to panic and kick at the plant whip, preparing to shoot fire at it, but he was quickly distracted when he is suddenly dragged across the forest floor to a nearby bush. You hold your arm to blast it away with aura, but another vine from a different direction snatches your wrist, trapping your arm within its vice grip!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thrash your gripped limb and growl, only to have another vine strike out at you to pin your other arm to your side. You feel the dirt path under your feet disappear as your body is lifted a bit into the air for the vines take little time in wrapping around your body. Kicking and flailing your legs, you attempt to bite at the constricting tendrils seemingly to be coming from a cluster of leaved branches concealing your attacker. The tight whips  then wrap around your muzzle, compressing your mouth to avoid anymore yelps or bites. You emit muffled yells as you look back over to see Jackal, tied up in the same manner, upside down. The vines caress around your body in perverted fondles before a vine suddenly whips across to spank your rear. You quickly eep inside your bound mouth as the vine occasionally swings by to smack at your round blue cheeks, beginning to make red lines of blushing heat glow out from your defenseless blue butt. The vinces tighten around your legs, strokes their tips around your paws, and coils around at your chest and belly to grope in clenches. Jackal on the other hand was worse off once you notice a tendril shifting in between the crease of his rear end, jamming inside anus all of a sudden to begin pumping in and out, forcing the Typhlosion to blush and groan as he's played with. You are about to make a sympathetic whine to your friend's dilemma, all until your tush is smacked again with both vines now with your furry orbs jiggling some from the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then in the midst of this torture, your attackers reveal themselves. Two Victreebels slid out from the brush of the leaves, staring with savage purple eyes and drooling mouths. Their leaf lids opened up, exposing their circular pink lips salivating out a heavy plant sap for its drool. The yellow bellied creatures held their prey above eagerly, lowering them down closer to their pitchers. You watch to your left as you were forced to see Jackal squirm in the vines' grasp and raping tendril, lowering him head first into the plant! The large pucker lips shift together, closing around the Typhlosion's head as his ass is rammed by a vine to cram him deeper in. His shoulders and torso are slurped down quickly thanks to gravity, forming a large bulge to poke out from the bottom of the Victreebel His legs kicked into the air wildly as you see the final glimpse of your companion's feet scrunching while sliding into the puckered lips of the plant. The Victreebel's belly pushed out, stretching across against the dirt floor while it plops out the vine from his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then feel a strange wet feeling on your foot pads, striking a hint that you are now on the Victreebel's menu. Your black hindpaws succumb to the circular slick wet lips squishing together on them, practically kissing your sensitive pink pads. You rumple your paws together with a soft moan as your feet begin their descent into the bell plant. The pressed eager lips begin to suckle on your hind paws, sucking on them like an infant and a milk bottle to slowly sink you deeper and deeper into the terrifying depths as your rump is forced to go through more wild and loud spanks that has your now blushing red cheeks steaming with warmth. Your legs and waist submerge into the planty flesh with its saliva as a heavy sap, except even <i>thicker</i> and <i>stickier</i> than regular drool! It splotches around and coats your fur in a mapley goo to mat your slimy fur down in a strange, nice-aromaed heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vines around your pinned arms begin to lift away, releasing you into the hungry Victreebel's starving maw, however your arms remain immobile to the constraining thick lips of the Victreebel as you sink inside. Your feet hit the bottom of the Victreebel's pitcher as the paws are splashed into a pool of the plant's acids. Your struggling head begins to enter the soft fleshy lips, sticking more heavy sap onto your groaning face while your forced into this terrible fate. Your vision is switched from a pleasant cloudless sky, to a horrible dark place, steaming with a moist syrup just as your body curls into the digestive juices of the Victreebel after it closes its leaf lid to feel your body slosh around in its wobbling gut. Your mind saunters about your life ending up to this dreadful moment. You had failed everyone. You were unable to keep your promise to Jackal, to Charm the Vaporeon, and everyone at Redeemer's Grotto. What would the Charizard chief say about you, knowing that you were so easily gobbled up by a feral Victreebel right after he warned you not to be destined to become a pile of a feral's excrements?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't just fail everyone, you failed in yourself. You quickly and shamefully pass out in the pool of the oddly comfortable fluids with the sound of bubbling around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Victreebels hum a growling tune of delight from their filled bellies as they use their vines to stroke around their massive heavy yellow guts. They circle their plant whips around their bellies, feeling at the yells, whimpers, and struggles of the prey they so easily caught. Their pitcher stomachs begin to do their natural functions, using the heavy sloshing pools of liquid to start churning their victims, digesting them into delicious nutrients. The Victreebels return to the trees they were originally hiding in, using the vines to grapple their heavy globular bodies way up into the branches again. The Lucario's predator felt its prey's struggles fade away into small tight squirms, knowing that the dog had easily given up its fight in the cramped space.. It rests back against the tree trunk, and awaited its next victim to pass by.</i></span></div></div>",

Your vision was obscured by a wall of wet taste buds, dripping saliva onto you that force you to grunt in distaste and struggle to remove the cemented tongue. After almost falling over from the impact, the tongue seems to be glued to your face to pull you back from teetering over all the way thankfully, even if you hated the sudden muscle on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperate to free yourself from the disgusting attack, you wrap your hands around the long tongue only to find how difficult it was to strip it off from your head though; the muscle is practically attached to your face by now, in fact, your hands were now stuck as well! You strive for the escape of your hands by pulling your arms out while whining, but the tongue withheld its sticky and powerful grip. You suddenly feel yourself fling forward once the Politoed had slingshotted you back toward him by retracting his tongue, plopping your arms and head inside his maw! Struggling helplessly with the slimy muscles and mouth pressing around your face and squishing together, the rest of your body is forced to press against his cushiony thick body, feeling the slick flesh of the frog rub up against your fur as you wriggle around. His thick arms wrap around your backside, squeezing you in for a tight, constricting hug. More of your body is squished into his tubby fat, kicking your legs out in any escaping moment in a poor effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tongue within the Politoed's mouth flicks off your head as if it was nothing and begins to explore your face with eager hunger. The fleshy whip circles above your head, tickling at your ears and stroking slowly up your extended-out arms as you start to become swallowed in hands first. You thrash your legs to kick at the round blubber of the toad while whimpering out, hoping that some soldier outside would come to your aid. You then remember that you are still in the dark and baren alleyway between buildings with no one around, making your chances of survival completely crushed at this point. You struggle to punch at the throat walls with the long tongue coiled around your arms dragging you in along with the tight, slimy space you could barely shift around in. With your ears folding back against your head, you whine out in distress that you were going to fall prey to this fat frog. The mouth walls ripple in pleasure as the tongue soaks itself in your flavor and meat, and you even hear a faint giggling sound muffledly shaking around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour waist enters the mouth after your entire upper body slides in from a strong swallow within the Politoed's large maw, eliciting its tongue to brush against your blue furry ball sac and wiggle at your sheath. Wincing from the unwilling arousal, you feel the frog grind its tongue along your crotch and in between your legs, hooking around to smack against your rear. You yelp as your body is given a sudden jolt in by the spank, and then shifted back after the force. The bulbous tip of the tongue swirls against your blue furry cheeks, toying with them by rubbing in between them to tease at your pucker. You groan inside the frog's narrow esophagus, defeatedly shivering your waist while your cock slowly begins to erect out. However, the infected Politoed takes a mighty gulp once more and sends your wet, abused rump into his throat, followed by your legs that continue to pathetically struggle. Half of your legs still remain out, still kicking out in a desperate panic outside of the frog's wet and green lips. Your hind paws begin to press against your predator's chest, constantly squishing the rubbery pudge in which the Politoed smiles from the tickling feeling. You're basically giving him a pampering massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce your feet enter his swallowing and drooling maw, you abandon all hope at this point and wait as you slowly dove into your demise, hoping that the frog would just finish you off. As you enter the stomach, you are curled up against the previously seen meal you saw earlier that had been kicking and bouncing the belly before. The body was already unconscious, and from what you feel, you figure out that it is an Ivysaur anthro. Not that you wanted to feel it, but the tight compactness of the stomach overwhelms you and forces you against the reptillian dinosaur. The stomach juices flush inside to fill the chamber about half way to pool around the two of you, gurgling and bubbling some with the presence of your meaty hides. Your paws unwillingly slide down the naked plant-dino's body, where you come to discover that it was a male nonetheless. Your saddened submission is interrupted once two hands slap against the walls around you, rubbing around and feeling the stomach vibrate while it works around the frog's meals. The Politoed belches out the last amounts of your air, and you drift away into faintness with the bubbling fluids showers down on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Politoed closes his eyes, slapping his hands around the now even larger belly sagging outward roundly. He burps out from yet another simple and delicious anthro to be sent into his gurgling depths, feeling his stomach tighten around the two Pokemon inside and begin to digest them. The Ivysaur was good, but the Lucario that popped out of nowhere was simply magnificent! The infected frog wets its lips, reminded of the rare dog's distinct flavor, making it shudder in pleasure as it belly growls with the said canine digesting. The Politoed waddles into the slightly ruined building the Lucario had originally stumbled out from, sitting down on its rear against a wall to stroke at the rubbery globe groaning out by the full stomach. It massages and squishes around the tight orb, contently patting the large gut as the infected hoard overpowers the citizens of Redeemer's Grotto outside. It couldn't wait to be ready to eat another tasteful victim after this delicious duo.</i></span></div></div>",

Out from the crowd steps out a prideful Arcanine, infected with the signature purple set of eyes, and drags its tongue along its hungry chops. It was male to the best of your abilities to see its adorning masculinity from afar, and of course, the large white furry ball-sac that hung down in between his hind quarters swayed slightly depicting its eternal horny urges. The large canine that could easily be twice, no, <i>triple</i> your size was scanning through the streets of the city, pausing as he stares at you from the other end with your body standing in the wide open just for the taking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis predatory yet happy snarl growls from his salivating muzzle, and the Arcanine crouches down to pounce off his legs, landing and dashing on all fours in his pursuit towards you! Something uncomfortably heavy drops into your throat, but you are stressed for time and had to plan something quick before you were tackled by just panicking in one spot. The Arcanine was much stronger and might be able to catch you if you were to run and give a chase, though there were many twisted streets and corners you could lose him on. Fighting was an alternative, but those odds of defeating the oncoming beast were somewhat slim too. Judging from its size and ferocity, it's had plenty of meals to snack on to make it so powerful and cocky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infected canine was getting closer, and you are forced to decide to...</span></div></div>",

If you chose to run from the Arcanine, he would have most likely caught up to you before you could even turn around, and besides, you could take this mutt any day. It's not like you haven't dealt with ferals before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bolt your legs against the dirt road, dashing towards the oncoming Arcanine that continues to sprint on all fours with his tongue flailing out of his mouth like the hungry animal he is. Roaring in the heat of the battle, you press your arm forward, aiming for the infected's exposed chest. However, things turn immediately sour for you. After punching towards your target, the Arcanine had jumped, counter-acting your attempt of an attack to miss him by the tips of his fur blades. The infected pokemon was still midair at a full forceful speed, and would inevitably drop his heavy weight on top of you. The shadowed Arcanine figure descends closer and closer to envelop your entire sight in its impending embrace. You feel your very soul almost crush out of your chest from the moment of impact. The dog presses all of his mass against your frail frame, having landed on top of your entire body which he clearly dominated in size with. Your face is shrouded against a hot wall of loose and white furry flesh, forcing you to you to gag at its musk and try to avoid it, but nothing gives. You are completely imprisoned under the Arcanine, sealed beneath him as he seems to purr out loud with closed eyes from apparently enjoying something out of his pounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifts his rump up to reveal you, a coughing and beaten Lucario, pressed into the earth from his tackle. As you crack an eye slowly open, you regretfully notice what you had been pressed into. The Arcanine's hefty, furry sac looms over, dropped from the waist a bit and swinging oh-so slightly above you. You're left speechless by the sight, sickened and distraught of what was actually happening. Although, the Arcanine seems to be pleased with it, and happily lowers the weighted bag back down on you, squishing you ever so slighter more into the ground. The infected rubs his genitals over you, giving enticed small humps up and down your body throughout the miserable grinding session. You feel like choking while the Arcanine was releasing a pleasured purr on the hand, as his rod begins to poke its head out from his sheath. You can feel the thick bulge rubbing along your embodiment grow harder by the second, and occasionally spasms from heated enticement. You can only groan and squirm in defeat, for your limbs were trapped under the loose furry flab as the infected continues his purge for pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, clean air flows into your lungs once more while your vision becomes much brighter once the large ball-sac lifts up. The Arcanine suddenly plops back to rest against his rear with his hindlegs displayed out and his forelegs to curl against his puffed chest. You feebly stumble up to a stand, weary and a bit dazed from all of the constant rubs as you hope to escape now. However, a forepaw suddenly grabs you from behind and raises you up to the Arcanine's face. You tremble at the sight of his hungry purple eyes, plus his drenched open maw was making you very uncomfortable as well. Hoping for some aid by the soldiers, you quickly discover that they were simply too busy fending off for themselves, fighting and struggling against a horde of ferals covering more fallen ground the soldiers lost in their short retreat. You are just as helpless as the thrashing bodies entering infected's maws. Thinking that it was over with your body ending up being this Arcanine's dinner, something else but just as unwilling occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are lowered down in his hand's grasp to be presented directly in front of his throbbing cock that was practically just as big as you, if not by much. You felt yourself suddenly press forward in his clutch, slapping against the sticky wall of meat that pulsates at your touch. You unhappily grunt while your body slides up and down the moist and glazey rod, helping the dog masturbate for him as he joyfully purrs with his new-found toy. A hot, clear liquid begins to squeeze out from the tip of the pulsating cock, oozing its way down over your face and body to be slathered in the sticky substance. The pre-cum marinates your entire body while it was pumping up and down the Arcanine's shaft faster and faster. Your head was getting dizzier and your arms and legs were becoming exhausted from the tough exercise very quickly. As bad as it was, you even feel a bulge forming in your waist, pressing against the infected's cock from the entire treatment to your horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoft whimpers grumble from your muzzle when your body finally slows down to a stop against your slimy punishment. The hindlegs of the Arcanine twitch against the flooring during the experience, and his cock eagerly waited for its erupting orgasm. You wonder why the infected didn't even finish his climax since it was such a sex-craving beast, until you felt yourself rise above the head of his penis. Its vertical lips open up slightly for your terrified eyes to gaze into, and you feel the hand grasping you tightly began to lower you down into the tight hole that beckons for your body. You peer back over the Arcanine, shaking your head and groaning in protest with pre dripping madly off your wriggling form, however, you only receive an evil scowl of victory from the large canine. If you were going to be devoured by a feral, you at least wanted a sane way of it, not by...some penis! The revelation that ferals were twisted enough to perform something so deranged truly shocked your senses that overwhelmed your own sanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour footpaws are squeezed into his pulsing urethra, trapping your legs into the slick tunnel that compresses around them to your displeasure. As if it mattered, you wiggle and struggle within his cock, panting with loud whines during your descent while your body is softly tugged deeper into the throbbing rod of flesh tightening around you. You shudder with the gross feeling of the slimy depths tugging you down, placing dreadful thoughts into your head what would happen to you once you were fully consumed until reality snaps back in once you were finally jammed so far in that your head was the only section to remain undevoured. Looking up at the triumphant Arcanine with a pitiful whimper and folded ears, he simply smiles a toothy grin as he pokes a single digit to your head, pressing it inside with the cock's tip closing together and ensnares you inside for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou writhe unpleasantly inside the bulging tube as the Arcanine grabs his member, rocking it back and forth humping into his padded palm. Your body is pumped inside one of his testicles, sealing you in the imprisoning orb as it continues to shake back and forth from the canine's rough masturbation. Your back bounces against the slick and hot walls of the orb, slapping your around it in your curled up state to the point of tuckering the little energy and willpower left in you. Feeling very droopy and light headed in the confusion of what was happening to you, your fur begins to moisten and turn pale in the pool of semen sloshing around your tuckered form. From the lull of the ball-sac's motions, you pass out, regretting to even try and endeavor of fighting this beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Arcanine feels his lopsided sac churn his Lucario victim into a thick and very milky fluid, sloshing around and ready to expel. The infected canine roars once more, humping faster into his hand until he felt the heat of his cock twitch. Hot, heavy ropes of white burst from the member's tip, spilling out the load around the city street and even into the Lucario shaped crevice to where he captured his toy in the first place. Some of the jizz shots hit close-by soldiers, catching them off guard or pushing them down for a feral to grab a cream-coated morsel for themselves. The Arcanine pants happily, squishing out more of his seed while his cock resides its firmness to dangle slightly downward. The infected rolls back to all of his fours, walking down and awaiting his next victim as his sac and cock flop and swing with every step he took, dripping the last of what remained of his meal.</i></span></div></div>",

Fighting that monster would've been an absolutely stupid idea from what you've seen from his size and speed in action. Pounding your feet into the gravel, your mad dash towards the street corner strangely felt a bit more comforting even though your heart was about to explode from your rib cage. The city really was a maze with a chasm of roads, alleys, and trench bridges that all held the potential of confusing the Arcanine for his dinner could have gone, but that would require gaining some distance between the two of you and you still doubt that you can outmatch such a large feral's speed. You turn the corner and dash into a separate street as you hear the hungry Arcanine's paws skid against the gravel too and twist around to continue his pursuit behind you. Noticing a split in the road, you turn your entire body rapidly in a desperate escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou maneuver through multiple Redeemer's Grotto soldiers and infected ferals that were still rampaging through out the entire lay-out of the city, occasionally almost getting caught in the grasp of the purple-eyed freaks. Spotting an oncoming and infected Pidgeotto gliding down with talons outstretched, you duck under the bird of prey as it swishes right past you and into the open gullet of a Pelipper soldier pursuing it. Suddenly, you feel yourself stop immediately in your dash and press deeply into a smooth, yet pudgy surface until you are knocked back into the ground by the sheer rebounding force. Rubbing your eyes, you look up to see the Village Chief, holding his yellow, globular belly while angrily bellowing, \"Alright feral, you chose the wrong stomach to- <i>Oh! Lace!</i> I was almost about to stuff that body of yours into my mouth there for a second! I was wondering why a Lucario ran into my gut.\" The Charizard's hand presses the area of his gut to where you had apparently crashed into. His shoulders and head are still concealed by the Aggron skeleton armor he wears seemingly always, so maybe it was to protect him from being eaten too easily by infected. They certainly wouldn't want to try to guzzle him up in their throats with that wide and spiked shelling around their dragon meat. He chuckles as he swats away a feral with his mighty tail, offering a hand for you to stand back up with. Patting your back, he continues with a cheery smile in the time of crisis, \"You certainly are in for a treat tonight! I believe this is the largest battle we've had for months, and you've luckily made it here just in time! I could use some help at the bridge. Several ferals are making a hot mess out of most of our constructions, but our main bridgelines are definitely not the easiest to rebuild. Care to fight with me on our way there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a loud crash blasted far behind you. The Arcanine looks back and forth down the street from its sudden halt to see where you had run off to. Its violet gaze fixes itself to you and the plumpy orange dragon standing next you. It eagerly licks its lips and charges with both you and the chief growing a tad pale. Tugging at your arm, the Charizard drags you into one of the rooms within a row of side street buildings. The Charizard slams the small door shut once the two of you take refuge within the clay-walled room, with the Arcanine quickly arriving outside the doorstep. Releasing you, he urged, \"Damn! The bridges will have to wait. He's certainly a large feral to say the least, and that wall isn't going to last long. We need to come up with a plan before it makes its way inside and makes us both its meals, and I don't want my village knowing it lost its leader to squirming in some animal's belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the infected canine halts in front of the building, lowering his head down to stare at the two morsels in front of him through an empty window. It begins to claw at the walls and kick at the openings, breaking or cracking the walls around them every now and then!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Two paws come clambering through the clay wall, crumbling it into a pile of small debris from a kick of the Arcanine's powerful hind quarters. The hole cracks open into a wide opening for the infected canine to nudge in through. Both you and the Charizard plant your backs to the opposite side of the room, hearts pounding away in terror, but the dragon having a smidge more bravery or balls to face the massive feral. The Arcanine licks his lips, prowling closer to his caught meals that so humbly fixed themselves into a corner. The massive predator wags his tail delightfully, even if the good hunt was easy; now it was time for him to collect his game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Village Chief wouldn't go down without a fight though--this infected would have to earn him as prey if it was the last thing he could do. The dragon blasts a fan of flames from his mouth, bellowing out heated fire at the infected feral in a rapid pace that ignited the entire room with an orange glow. The fire-type canine grunts, barely affected by it and blew away the attack with a quick huff of its own lungs. The large dog swipes at the surprised Charizard, slapping the chief to fall on the floor. The hefty lizard crashes down against his back, grunting and struggling to recover in standing back up with his heavy weight and armor. Although, his attempts quickly end as a large forepaw looms over him and presses down, nudging the Charizard into the Arcanine's pads. quickly afterwards, you lash outward at the massive infected with aura powering around your arms, in hopes to save your companion and to strike the infected now that it was open for an attack by the distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Arcanine scoffs at your feeble endeavor and swats you away with his swinging tail. After your body slams into a nearby wall and having it fall onto the dirt floor face first, the feral brings its focus back to the Charizard that lays helplessly and exhausted underfoot, rubbing the paw up and along his scaled pudgy body. Lifting the 'leg' off of him, the Arcanine lowers its muzzle down, sticking its broad tongue out and lapping up the Village Chief's big, yellow belly. The Charizard gasps from the sudden lick and begins to unwillingly grumble under the powerful throbs of the large wet tongue. It travels along his round gut, poking his small breast flabs beneath his chest armor, coiling around his tail, and especially tastes and wriggles in between his thighs which the feral found to be the most sensitive spot on the Charizard. The Village Chief moans helplessly as his hands wrestle against the wobbling tongue violating his body, however, his attempts woefully fail once the fat and wet muscle slaps itself against his face, smothering it in hot flesh and saliva. You start to stir back into reality again as you get to your hands and knees on the ground. Looking up, you're shocked to see the Arcanine jam its large tongue tip straight into the groaning open maw of the Charizard, stuffing the poor Village Chief's cheeks to stretch out and squelch with bubbling spittle as the wall of mass writhes inside the tight, small space. Muffled growls and gags sound through the Charizard's neck as the fat tongue-end pulsates out repeatedly inside his maw. The muscle slips out and slaps its wet underside against his face, dragging the behemoth amount of flesh down his long neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Arcanine suddenly backs away in disgust once it tastes the Aggron armor around his head. Spotting that it was distracted again, you struggle back up from the ground and silently creep towards the infected dog. The Arcanine bites down on the skeleton armor, pulling and ripping it off the Charizard to leave the defeated dragon whimpering in his salivated, nude form. Aura flames reverberate around your body once more as you are ready to take the canine out once and for all to save the chief. However, the Arcanine spots you and spits out the Aggron exoskeleton from its mouth at you, striking you square in the head! You teeter around in pain until falling over to your back, unable to move any longer while returning down to the earth yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infected Arcanine chuckles and lunges its mouth forward. It scoops up the Charizard's head and neck into its drooling maw, licking around the grumbling Village Chief that remains on the verge of passing out. Your twitching eyes suddenly brake into focus and you held your pounding head up to see a Charizard's legs and tail to dangle out of the feral's mouth. The dragon's claw-digits scrunch as its belly rests on a thick, slimy bed of a tongue. The dragon is completely burrowed within the mouth muscles contracting and licking over his entire body, practically molesting his tender and scaled hide as the Arcanine murrs happily with the Charizard's moans. His thick legs are chomped in, followed by his tail slurping inside like a large noodle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch to your horror at the groaning bulge sinking down into its furry gut, bouncing out from its underside after fully landing in the stomach. To add to your terror, the Arcanine's intimidating size and open maw now stand over you, oozing down saliva to water over body while forming a nice, hot puddle around you. You endeavor to stagger up, but no energy seems to exist within your muscles. Your legs are quickly given a hot bath once its mouth snaps around the black furred limbs. You effortlessly allow your body be slurped inside the thick warmth of the infected's jaws, disappearing between its toothy chops quite quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Rregh...! N-n-noooo....</i>\" Your thoughts cry out as they dwindle in surrender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body tumbles around like a rag doll inside the tight and wet walls of its mouth; its enlarged tongue basks around you and sucks you down into its gullet. The sphincter hugs around your battered form, sending you down on your way to meet the fallen chief. Squeezed inside the dark tunnel, you are then pressed against the chubby body of the Village Chief, unwillingly grinding along the Charizard's belly and slimy body together inside the vibrating stomach. Your slick fur brushes along his gooey, smooth scales with your waists pacting together, and aroused cocks and sacs to cruelly press into one another. The two of you shut your eyes and groan in miserable defeat, waiting to faint away into the digestive fluids that began to pour in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Arcanine sucks the Lucario's head in, trapping him inside the large maw. The infected pokemon begins to toy with the beaten pup by flopping and tossing him within the tight confines of his squelching jaws, until swallowing him whole. The bulge descends downward and rests at the Arcanine's belly which the infected eagerly rubs in bliss. It pats and nudges the furry gut with both of its forepaws, happily humiliating the delicious prey within as it rests against a comfy wall of the vacant room. The plump Charizard and aching Lucario squirm in feeble distress before tiring out into exhaustion. Their whimpers sound out like music to the infected's ears. Yawning, the Arcanine relaxes back with one paw around its pale-furred belly and the other fingering itself around its newly aroused cock, eventually fapping away into absolute bliss while loud stomach gurgles bubble out from his boiling gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe village would certainly fall or disband with the loss of its leader, and the world too without its hero. The two would certainly deem themselves worthy though as they pack into nice layers of fat on their predator's belly.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It was an inevitable fact that the Arcanine would soon tear through the entire structure of the building down just to claim its breakfast; you hoped it would be a quick and merciful demise than how other ferals treated their snatched prey since they can be a tad rough and <i>intimate</i>. You tremble at the thought of being crammed inside the Arcanine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mighty shaft, bulging its hot length out by a wobbling lump to slide down into its hefty and furry sac. The picture has you shuddering some with mixed emotions about it and how others amongst the city would feel to see a Lucario shaped-like bulge groaning and struggling inside its creamy balls. Crawling down its slimy jaws seemed much better than that fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, a scaly hand firmly wraps over your wrist as the Charizard at your side gleams a worried smirk. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think I have an idea, but it can only work as long as you keep the Arcanine busy and close to you, alright?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Village Chief asks of you. Of course you were a little hesitant by his unexplained plan and were ready to retort the idea, yet you were really left with no choice. A sudden and crumbling boom tremors the entire clay building to force the entire place to rock some, causing the two of you to look to the far wall as a silhouette of a large Arcanine stood in the midst of a cloud of powdery clay dust. Two shining purple dots peer through the brown fog as a belly gurgles loudly within the shroud of dirt. You could even hear the paw steps and tongue licks the massive feral resound out as the shadow approaches terrifyingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe canine arose from the cloud of debris while the Charizard's hand grips your wrist even tighter than before, signalling he was about to abandon you. The feral creeps closer to the both of you as you slowly move farther and farther back in the room feeling your heart plummet. From what you could tell, the place was a pub, with knocked over wooden stools and tables that scattered about in the room in a wild mess, especially with the gaping entrance the Arcanine created to splatter lay bricks and chunks across the floor. Your mind was desperate enough to search for the room as a means to escape for something to distract and/or fend the feral off with. You glance up only to see the giant Arcanine grinning a fanged and open maw with saliva waterfalling onto the floor, simply brushing the debris to the side with its heavy steps and size. You feel the edge of a surface quickly press against your backside, and you slide your hands to discover you are up against the bar table. Your ears wince at the loud gulp traveling down the Charizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neck next to you as his hand rose up your arm. The two of your backs are now pinned to the wooden bar and trapped with nowhere to run from this huge and hungry beast. Suddenly, the chubby dragon erupts a fiery ball at the ceiling, destroying it with a fast explosion just above the Arcanine!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infected Arcanine howls as the crumbling debris of the roof came clambering down on it, burying it in a large pile of thick slabs and wooden support beams. You cover your face quickly with your arm once another wave of dust envelops the room. You wave the powder away to find a still, small mountain of rubble in the center of the room with tiny pebbles continuing to roll off of where the infected creature once was. The Charizard smiles and exhales gratefully, clenching his chest to catch his breath from holding it in so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHuh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6that actually worked\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d He chuckles out weakly before he pats your back powerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flash a bewildered gaze as you try to regain your balance from almost losing your footing from the heavy beats, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou, you mean you expected that to fail?!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSomewhat\u00e2\u0080\u00a6in the likely case of if it hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worked, I was actually going to toss you forward so it could swallow you down as I escaped!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The dragon snickers in his deep octave as he pads closely out to the open hole in victory. Your eyes unhappily widen until the Village Chief continues, \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u00a6Heh he ha ha ha! It was simply a joke! I would be belly fodder before I willingly let someone be downed by a feral.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As a response, you quietly nod, not exactly finding the joke to be too humorous given the dire situation. The Charizard tosses his hand to convince you to hurry up outside. \"Come now, we have a bridge of ferals to take care of!\"</span></div></div>",

The Village Chief snarls in pain as you are left dazed from the blast. Out from the shadows of the building came the feral beast, fuming smoke from its maw after shaking the dust and rubble off from its coat. Drool strands down from the Arcanine's chin while it quickly pounces out towards its fallen prey. A heavy forepaw lands atop each of you, grinding you against the dirt to pin you down in a short slide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cry out a loud bark of agony and tense up, gagging underneath the shifting paw. The Arcanine stares down at its breakfast courses, licking its chops with wet smacks peering over to the Charizard first. Nibbling down at the dragon, it rips the Aggron exoskeleton armor off with its mouth to quickly spit it out and unfortunately hits a Redeemer's Grotto soldier fending off a feral. The chubby Quagsire soldier feels the full force of the heavy plating collide into his backside, knocking him directly to the floor for an infected Ponyta to tackle and capture. You watch underfoot as the horse flips the groaning Quagsire on his back, beginning to lick over his belly and waist for him to tremble beneath. It makes you think of all the other soldiers who would also meet a stomach wobbling demise, leading up to thoughts on your own similar fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Village Chief next to you growls as a retort and attempts to lift it off. The Arcanine chuckles in amusement at the dragon's futile attempts, so it simply presses its paw pads harder against the scaly pudge, wiggling its digits to torture the lizard. The Village Chief grumbles in misery as the forepaw overtakes him, sliding down to smother and extinguish his tail flame with a breif press. As a reaction from the extinguishing, the Charizard's strength quickly flushes out, leaving the chubby reptile with little energy to struggle or move. Even from just looking at him, you can easily tell that his eyes begin to show weakness and his muscles start to give out, drained of strength. This feral knew its prey's weak points. The Charizard unhappily whines with the paw continuing to nourish itself with his body, sliding about to humiliate the Village Chief. You share the same torture, finding the heavy extremity to be too powerful to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, your predator rumbles a hearty snicker as it cranes its head down toward the Charizard, slapping its tongue against his fat, yellow belly to drag it upwards in a single and powerful lick. It sloshes a bit from the motion while the Village Chief grits his teeth, digging his claws into the dirt in a sensitive reflex as his cheeks turn a little red. He attempts to stifle back a few moans from the Arcanine slathering its tongue up and down the reptile's body, blanketing him in a layer of slimy drool to pathetically sit through. His limbs shudder along the ground and his head lifts back, growling in unwilling arousal as the Arcanine paid special attention into licking the dragon's genitals. His cock began to pang outward while saliva seeps over his smooth and pudgy form. After the last few licks, the Arcanine left the blushing and panting Charizard to look over you, repeating the same process unto your withered body as the Village Chief had to submit through. You throb violently once the somehow comfortable wall of tastebuds drag over your furry body, sliming you up to force you to whimper throughout the punishment. Before the Village Chief could get up to escape, a large forepaw roams back over to press the chubby lizard back down. He grunts as it gently began to rub over his slick body again to keep him down and distracted. You thrash in spasms for the tongue had scooped between your legs, enticing your own knotted member to erect out in the gooey warmth marinating your groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRetracting its head back, the Arcanine licks its lips to collect the last of your flavors before unpinning you. You peek an eye to check on the Quagsire soldier, only to discover his lightly twitching feet sticking out of the infected Ponyta's maw. Licking over the thick pale blue legs, it slurps his feet down, giving out a satisfied sigh as his body kicks inside his predator's boisterous belly. The horse presses its hoof-like hands into the fat gut, feeling the flesh loom over its circling extremities as the Quagsire cries out muffled groans inside. Checking back to the Village Chief, you come to find the Arcanine turned fully around, lowering its rear down over the Charizard's head. With its tail raised high and its pucker open, it happily plucks down against the dragon, sucking him inside to bring his shoulders at the anus' rim. His scaly arms helplessly raise up to grab the Arcanine's furry bum cheeks for hopeless freedom, shaking crazily from his snuffed out flame still in affect. The large infected canine growls in joy, slurping up the wet lizard to bring his marinated form up even faster. You watch as his arms give out and disappear inside, causing the defeated Charizard's torso and back wings being overtaken by the swallowing tailhole. You couldn't believe what you were seeing but of a Pokemon actually devouring someone with something other than their mouth, ringing the rumors you've heard true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou endeavor to stand during your disbelief, desperately attempting to free yourself of your rear-end doom. However, your body empties out on strength, leaving you to land back against the dirt. You sob quietly like a puppy as you watch the struggling Charizard get devoured by an asshole slowly before you. The anus expands and gulps down the Village Chief's large belly, dragging the hefty weight inside as his thick legs and tail thrash helplessly in the air. With a wet and loud sound, you watch his clawed, writhing feet and tail tip enter the Arcanine's rump with a loud pop, seizing your pride and hope in survival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Arcanine growls as the hollering bulge slides up its waist and into its stomach, rounding out for a nice and plump belly. It sits down against its rear, cupping its forepaws under the  kicking gut, playing with and sloshing the devoured dragon inside. Its lavender eyes peer over to you all slimy and helpless, finding your wriggling body too tempting to ignore any longer. It rolls back onto all four limbs, trotting over to you to hover its rump above you just as the Charizard had to view earlier. You stare at the shadowed rear just floating there for a moment, frightened by the pulsing pucker and tensing cheeks that were <i>actually</i> going to <i>eat</i> you. Your whines are soon muffled once the bum lowers down and envelops your entire head. The hot stench stings your nostrils as you start to slide up its rectum in a strong dragging motion. Fully aware of your chances now, you lie limply with the anus swallowing more and more of your body in, deciding that it was too late to escape and becoming this feral's meal was your fate. After avoiding several times only to end up here, it was a sign that you were a fool to think you wouldn't end up as belly fat like everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Arcanine lifts its fuzzy rear back up to watch your legs and tail effortlessly dangle out of its bottom. It smiles with open jaws as the slick limbs are sinking deeper into its body with each and every pull, rousing its member to throb underneath its bulging lizard-filled belly. On the inside of the rectum, the fleshy and saliva covered anal walls clench tightly around you, tugging your body back further from the lubrication of your and the Charizard's bodies. Your footpaws rest at the very rim, and with a yank of its pucker, twitch outside for the last time before getting sucked into its innards forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body slides completely into its new and final home after your muzzle entered first inside the hot stomach. Your slimy form lies against another one with little room to even move within the cramped and squishy space. The Charizard whimpers as he wriggles in pathetic and futile attempts while you wait solemnly for your doom. The stomach begins to churn its digestive juices to slather over your bodies in the fleshy hammock you both slosh around in, forced into being rubbed by the large paws of the Arcanine outside. You close your eyes as your furry body nestles against the wet, smooth, and scaly pudge of the dragon who was once a leader. \"I-I...can't go like th-this...Not now...\" He sobs as his naked body is completely depleted of willpower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis last words fade away as both of you pass out in the rising pool of stomach fluids, feeling a belch rumble the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Arcanine belches in happy bliss, enjoying the wobbling struggles in its furry belly as it slides its forepaws around the taut flab. It lies on its back among the city dirt paths, gripping its aroused cock from its sudden binge to fap away wildly. It flops and swings its tongue over its chin, masturbating loudly for any Redeemer's Grotto soldiers to watch as their leader helplessly digests inside of its stomach to demoralize them, until they too, are snatched by ferals and devoured. The city would soon become a ghost town of gut-filled ferals, having lost the battle against the horde indefinitely and forever. A specific Scyther stares at the Arcanine that swallowed his town leader in such a disgraceful way, rousing his anger to a full boil. He charges the fapping canine, only to stop short once a long and slimy pink whip wraps around his hips. Yanked back, Pence growls furiously as an infected Politoed pulls the bug anthro by its tongue closer to itself. It quickly binds his blade arms to his sides with its tongue, rendering them useless while the back of his head is plucked into the frog's mouth. It would take only a few hours for all of the citizens to be swallowed alive similarly, causing them to be just another town fallen under the chaos of the infection.</i></span></div></div>",

The two of you did have a plan to carry out and the Arcanine surely came as a huge challenge to overcome. But now that you've succeeded and progressed through such a difficulty with the Village Chief, taking care of some minor ferals should be a breeze, right? You make your way out of the building opening without taking another look at the pile the Arcanine lay underneath, hoping that it was unconscious and wouldn't give another chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow the armored Charizard through the city streets, hoping to keep close without losing his trail. Several obstacles oppose you along the way, as a feral or two would sprout out to make you its meal, however the two of you with the temporary help of a guard would fend the creatures off. Making your way through crowds of battles, you suddenly encounter a Quagsire soldier fending off an infected Ponyta pinning him to the floor. The flaming horse held his wrists to the ground above him with an open maw, slathering its thick and wormy tongue over his panting face, unable to get out from under the feral. Figuring that no one was around to save him, you quickly begin to lose distance from the Village Chief heading closer to the Quagsire's aid. The Charizard glances back, spotting what you were doing almost instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe calls out to you above the hollering ambiance of the crowded streets, \"Lace! Be careful! I know you wish to help out, but our soldiers are trained to take care of these monsters. We have a mission, remember? If those pillars and bridge go out, it could cause the entire structure of the ceiling to crumble, making these rescues all for nothing!\" You didn't listen and continue dashing towards your target. Wondering why this particular pair's battle caught your eye, you truly had no clue nor care for it; you were going to save him while you could. His entire head was fully gulping into the horse's maws, shivering his body beneath the infected all before you lunge in with a swipe of your arm. The aura around sends the Ponyta barreling away while releasing the soldier's head from its salivating jaws. The Quagsire lands on his tush with a shocked expression and drool-covered face, surprised that he wasn't sliding down the horse's throat anymore. He peers over to you with wide eyes before instantaneously getting to thank you desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-th-thank you....! I.....\" He struggles to speak out as the Ponyta recuperates and pounces out again towards the Quagsire. The water-type flips around as water bursts from his mouth, striking the flaming horse in its strong burst to be carried away with it into a wall. The soldier flashes a look back to you, nodding some, \"Thanks.\" After the stern statement, he appears to have overcome his shock and heads over to the defeated Ponyta, wetting his lips in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly see an infected Combusken get tossed to the ground next to you and stomped on its chest by a thick, scaly leg. The Village Chief kicks the chicken away and aggressively looks at you, \"Now hurry and come on. I want to help them as much you do, but their duty is to protect these streets for as long as they can.\" He grabs you by the arm almost painfully for you to get the idea of how serious he was. \"<i>Our</i> duty is to take care of those before they take care that bridge. It acts as a large support beam for this entire place, and I'd rather lose a few soldiers dying for their loved ones than everyone getting killed or buried alive.\" You sling your arm out of the way, not taking the news very well, but he did have a point. It was vital for you help these citizens and townsfolk here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Charizard turns around to show you his back, expanding his wings out as he glances back over his shoulder, pointing at it. \"Now climb on. We'll get there a whole lot faster if we fly directly towards it. Try to keep airborne ferals away though because I can't fight with a Lucario holding me down, Plus....\" He rubs a hand over his chubby and round belly, \"...I'm not the lightest thing to carry either. I'm trusting that you'll protect us both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a lot to handle, but you really couldn't deny him now. You wrap your arms around his long neck and press your body into his, signalling him with, \"Ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on tight. This isn't going to be a trouble-free ride.\" His wings flap down, scattering dust below the two of you and for the ground to begin drifting away. With more struggling but strong flaps, the Charizard managed to keep a good height distance towards the large stone pillars ahead. You finally understood what his warnings were for and spotted that there was an entirely other kind of war above the ground. Flying types and a few psychic's were burdened to have to provide aerial defense, Attacking while avoiding hungry ferals bee-lining through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heads up!\" The Village Chief's deep voices booms next your head, and by looking up, you spot a shape of a bird far off in the distance but making quick of work of heading directly close to the two of you. The shape slings by extremely and terrifyingly fast past the two of you, almost making a direct hit. Even through the blurry and wind-blinding pace of the creature, you were certain that it was an infected Staraptor. Scanning around, you see the feral again, circling back for another pecking dart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Charizard yells out, \"Alright Lace, take it out! He's not going to give us up unless another feral eats us.\" He was right about that. The bird of prey seems to have chosen its intended targets, and there was no way the Village Chief could outdo or even match its speed.</span></div></div>",

At close range, the Staraptor would already be at top speed, darting through whatever attack you think you could land on it. \"Do your best to avoid it!\" You tell the Village Chief as you begin to press aura between your forepaws. The sphere of burning blue flames ignite powerfully within your palms, almost flying away from the gliding force of the dragon you were on flying about. The silhouette of the bird is far off, but aimed towards you, so with a surging blast of your power, you send the aura sphere rocketing away at the Staraptor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bird's purple eyes widen from the projectile and is forced to swing around in a different direction to miss the Charizard. The sphere eventually lands against a wall, burning out a dark smudge to smoke out. Deciding that charging attacks wouldn't be wise in this fight, you begin to punch your arms out, alternating with each to send a smaller blast of aura out towards your flying opponent. The single shots scatter in lines at the evasive Staraptor who proves to be very difficult to even keep up with. In fact, it was moving so fast that you began to see blurred images of it trailing behind, confusing you of which figure was the real one in a double team tactic. Frustrated, your aura blasts begin to get sloppy in aim and terribly miss the actual Staraptor, which inevitably even starts to tire you out. The infected bird comes in with another dive, and the Charizard barely manages to lift up enough for the bird to go streaking by, almost making contact that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon blows a stream of flames that were already out of range from the bird, angrily growling, \"Grrrrrr...could you take care of that thing, please?\" Agitated as well, you weren't prepared for the Staraptor's own projectile attack. It had swung its wings together, unleashing a twirling whirlwind straight towards both of you. Before you could warn the Village Chief, the strong winds force the Charizard to lose his balance and begins to waver around in an attempt to regain his composure and flight, almost knocking you off in the process. The Staraptor hadn't finished though, and you realize this again when it was too late. The bird dove in again, headbutting that dragon's belly powerfully. The dragon coughs out from the hit, losing his ability to fly for a brief moment to go spiraling back towards the ground. You gasp and hold onto his shoulders tightly, beginning to lose your grasp on him with the blowing winds of your quick descent slipping you away. Luckily, the Charizard tries to arc back up, but instead, crashing over some flat roof tops that send you rolling off on to hit occasional debris along the way. After the force finally dies down and your battered body stops in place, you groan with several bruises and aches pulsating within your body. Your arms wobble to even hold your upper body up from the dusty clay ceiling you were on. Peering upwards, you see the crashing Village Chief slam into a stone wall and plummet back down to land on a different rooftop far off from you had landed. Good thing that he had that armor on, or he may have died from such an impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEndeavoring to lift yourself up, you are quickly stopped once you feel a heavy force shove you right back down to keep a heavy weight on you. The infected Staraptor stands on your back, planting a taloned foot against the top of your head to keep you down. You hear several groans emitting out of its belly, along with a few tongue smack from wetting its beak. It steps back from trampling you some to lower down and crams one of your plushy rump cheeks into its open beak. The furry blue orb stuffs into its maw for it to relish its hot and slimy tongue over, licking over the fat orb to lightly squeeze between its beak. Its tongue even occasionally snakes over your anus, forcing you to tense up and grumble for mercy. Weak and hurt, you struggle by kicking your leg at it while crawling some forward. You actually manage to get the bird to release your butt from its maw, only for it to cock its head in irritation and easily steps up to follow you, amused at your defeated and slow pace. It brushes its foot against your side to roll you over onto your backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pant as your frontside is brought to the open air for you to stare directly at the shadowy Staraptor with glowing eyes to tower over you. It licks its beak again and scoops your hindpaws into its maw, suckling them into the squelching gooey depths of his jaws. You gasp and begin to whine out to desperately free yourself from becoming this feral's meal, pushing your legs out and around to slide out. Although, the avian keeps a tight hold around you this time and evilly taunts you by slathering its tongue under your paw pads. You fail to hold in several moans to the Staraptor's pleasure, grabbing at the dusty rooftop with your hands as your head rolls against it, whimpering out like a puppy. The bird practically chortles from its victory and swallows in your feet to begin dragging your legs into the hot and tight muscles inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the ground you look over to your only remaining hope; the Village Chief. The fat Charizard is on his back far off, unconscious with his tail flame almost snuffed out as an infected Salamence glides down and stalks toward the fallen dragon. It eyes the mass of lizard meat it was ready to taste, and happily starts to undress the Aggron bone armor from his body. After your calves and thighs receive a tough bath of saliva to wash in, your rear end is brought back to the bird's gulping maw and is forcefully slapped by its tongue so the muscle can worm its way around the plushy meat in a cruel gesture from the Staraptor to remind you that you were nothing but <i>food</i> for the ferals. The slick muscle wiggles in between your cheeks, jabbing inside your pucker to elicit some loud groans and soft thrusts from your doomed state. Your eyes roll back and your muscles tense in unwilling and pleasurable fire. The tongue slides in and out of your rectum several times before sliding wetly back out to circle around your ring as a final tease to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bird muffledly murrs at your flavor and hide, quickly beginning to lose interest in bragging for its captured meal and get on with what it wanted. Strong chomp after chomp, the Staraptor scoops in your groin, hips, and midsection into its stretching cheeks to bulge out its body for feathery lumps sinking down it body. Your hands hold each end of the beak to open up wider, as if you could even pull yourself out once the feral threw its head back for you to literally almost be falling into this thing's stomach. Its throat muscles tug at your body and its sliding tongue tickles and slickens your backside and chest, flattening your fur to make you slip in faster with gravity. Your hands tremble and you whine out for the last time, all before they give in and slide into the swallowing maw of the beast. The infected Staraptor chuckles with rumbling cheek walls as you briefly spill into its open mouth to let your head vanish from outside. Darkness and squelching innards reverberate around you, making your heart pound as the juicy bubbles and seeping drool echoes around you within the tight torture system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally slide into the cramped space of the bird's gut, forced into a fixed position as gooey walls hug tightly around you and bathe you in digestive fluids that pool up about halfway inside the stomach. Pressing all four paws against the soft yet taut walls, the stomach simply gurgles loudly as your body suits its needs to begin working on you. You had failed to protect the Village Chief and the citizens of Redeemer's Grotto, along with your own hide. The Staraptor rips out a loud belch as its final piece of rubbing it in your face, and you worriedly pass out within the groaning ambiance of the bubbling chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Staraptor coos from its delicious and filling meal, perching down with a bouncing, round belly gurgling to its satisfaction. The Lucario inside quickly lost interest in struggling and merely sat inside for the grinding stomach walls to work over him. The gut hung down like a fleshy hammock for the dog to boil up inside, forcing the infected bird to flex its talons out happily before picking up other sounds of wet smacking. Off in the distance, an infected Salamence sits on its rear with a bloated scaly belly and an orange tail limply dangling from its jaws. The dragon slurps it inside to join the rest of the Charizard's fate with its meal beginning to ironically stir awake. It plants both hands and circles over the smooth gut while angry wails and beats pound from inside, shaking the round mass out and about in force. The Salamence hisses in laughter at the doomed chief, getting back up on its feet to fly off again, gurgling its belly loudly for all of the citizens below to hear. If only they knew it was their fallen leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Staraptor scoffs at this and settles into a nice corner far from the battle, enjoying its time of digestion as the Lucario inside is melted down into a frothy soup.</i></span></div></div>",

You cough out a few drops of thin saliva, when suddenly, a bone collides into your skull with a strong swing. The clash rocks your brain back in forth inside your head as the force of the impact ceases your ability to stay conscious. Without a single second wasted from the Marowak's attack, you unwillingly faint under the intense pain and fall onto your back, knocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mocking grunt, the Marowak sits up on its knees and slides itself closer to its dominated opponent. Its hands dare to touch your still body, groping its hands over your legs. It's wicked grumbles and closed roars were to be heard as perverted chuckling while the Marowak tested to see how much meat was on your canine body, squeezing and sliding over your furry unconscious form. The Marowak cups its hands over your groin, eager to know that you sported a nice male package for his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up fully now, the feral rubs its pale and fleshy belly, hungry for its breakfast to finally begin. Jackal yells over to you, hoping that you would wake back up, but you never budge a muscle as he can only sit and watch from being stuck in a knot of a tree for the Marowak beginning to devour your head by...</span></div></div>",

Opening his skulled maw, he stuffs your head inside by pushing your sides upward in a great tug. Jackal continues his useless struggles, but the split in the wood wouldn't give and you were already being consumed by the victor of your fight. The Buneary you were trying to save still remained on the floor, fainted. No one could save you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSucking your body in more, your shoulders pop with your torso easily following them. Your chest is delivered a fine bath in the sticky saliva of the Marowak's hungry jaws as he slides his hands down lower, groping your plush rump and pushing it in. The infected feral pulls his head up, letting your waist sink in as your crotch is licked greedily with lust. The happy mumbles of the Marowak echo within the throat once your body is bulging out his neck and chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind then gets a jump start, flowing blood back into your brain with your head being aimed downward as you wake back up from your daze. Things weren't exactly how you remember it. Your surroundings were not of a forest, but a wet...hot...tight...dark tunnel. Suddenly, you feel a strange and slick muscle, slide across your legs. You try to move from the gross sensation, however, the wet walls hold you tightly in. You begin to panic at this point, whimpering aloud as you try to free yourself from the digesting demise mere inches away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackal couldn't look away. He watches with a depressed glance of your kicking legs sinking into the Marowak's throat with your footpaws trailing behind them. The infected anthro purposely belched defiantly and loud enough for the distant Typhlosion to hear, rubbing his round belly that now sunk in with the rest of your consumed body to bounce it for a moment. His previously closed and happy eyes open back up, staring directly at the trapped Typhlosion with the similar hungry intentions. Jackal begins punching around the hole violently at the tree trunk his arm was still jammed in, all the while, the Marowak walks slowly to the terrified fire-type, glaring at his body hungrily with its purple eyes. Darkness, ambient gurgles, and slimy textures surround your entire environment as you are packed into curled ball for the stomach's contracting space. You shudder with miserable defeat as the warm saliva seep down your body and mixes with the organ's recently spurting acids. To your lucky disbelief, the stomach juices weren't at all paniful, but more drowsing and weakening. you knew you wouldn't last in the organ unless Jackal is able to over power the Marowak, and with great hope, is able to squeeze you back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough back outside, the Marowak quickly latches Jackal's ankles into its hands, raising his feet in the air and in front of the infected's cocky face. Its tongue slips out once more, tasting at the soles of Jackal's paws for the entertainment of his reaction. The Typhlosion unwillingly groans in ecstasy as he could only bend the knees of his thick legs in response of escape. The Marowak purrs with delight, sucking and softly nibbling all around the sensitive paws. Jackal scrunches them in reflex while his attempts to escape the tree lessened and lessened. In fact, a little bulge starts to grow out from his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infected feral swallows, taking in the legs of the Typhlosion as Jackal felt his back pull from each end. His spine no longer touches the ground having his raised hand still stuck on one end of his body, while the other was inside the throat of the Marowak. The feral continues to gulp the fire-type inward, reaching his impatient crotch to Jackal's horror. The tongue happily slithers over, working its way from Jackal's soft ball sac to his throbbing hard member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tongue wraps around it, constricting with a vice grapple as it pumps the shaft up and down fast. Jackal lets loose cries of pleasure, up to the point that he resentfully flops his tongue out and starts humping the roof of the Marowak's mouth. He squirms about, feeling the searing pressure seize and overtake his testicles. The tongue brushes down between Jackal's butt cheeks, rimming around the pucker until worming up inside the tight hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Typhlosion roars, blasting a spray of spooge to the lucrative mouth's efforts. It waterfalls down inside the Marowak's throat, oozing onto your body left to sit in the misery of the stomach. The infected pulls on Jackal once more with its muscled jaws, able to make its meal's hand pop out of the tree-knot! However, Jackal's body remains already halfway crammed down the Marowak's neck with his blushing cheeks and exhausted breathes. He was too spent from his orgasm to move. By now, Jackal's feet had entered through the stomach valve and into the murky chamber, pressing down onto your face as his body continues to sink inward. You unhappily whine in your dreadful thoughts. You had not only failed to rescue the Buneary girl, but failed to solve the infection in general. You and your friend were simply going to be jiggling fat on a Marowak's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting up and sucking him down, the purple eyed Marowak reaches Jackal's head with one of the Typhlosion's arms reaching over it. \"<i>D-damn you...</i>\" Jackal curses before his head disappears within the swallowing maw. His hand remains out as his fingers try to hold onto the bottom bone lip of the Marowak. The fat anthro simply pokes its own finger at the life-saving hand, popping the forepaw inside and swallowing it down to doom the meal's last attempt to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Marowak rubs its enlarged gut, having it twice the size from before to the point in which the feral almost lost balance. Both of the prey inside the stomach writhe softly, moaning out whines of displeasure as the feral's hands circle over their bulges and fondle them. The Marowak could even feel the stomach acids begin to pool around them as the organ walls clench around the two, beginning to work their meaty bodies for digestion. With a second loud belch, the Marowak sloshes its gut until the muffled cries inside died out. It grunts and lumbers over to the faint Buneary, grabbing the red and brown rabbit by her large ears and drags her with it as the belly-filled feral dwells deeper into the forest. After all, it could always use her as a snack once the two squirming bodies of the Lucario and Typhlosion digested away.</i></span></div></div>",

Jackal winces in disgust as the rump lowers down, jabbing your muzzle deep into the open pucker of the feral's rectum. The Marowak grunts in pleasure while it stuffs your entire unconscious head into its anus after crouches down slowly. Your head protrudes a bulge out from its crotch to stretch a lump along its brown flesh. The skulled creature moans in delight and fondles the small bulge with its hand, circling over it with an occasional clench. The suction power of the Marowak's anus jerks your shoulders into its welcoming, steamy mass, plucking tightly around your upper body to pull in a great amount of it inside. The Marowak's legs wobble by the effect of such wonderful physical satisfaction, struggling to remain standing through the elicit joy fireworking through its nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a another tug of its ass cheeks, your chest and abdomen slip inside the narrow ring which forces your arms being bound by your sides within the slim anal tunnel. The hot flesh presses powerfully against your motionless form, working you up along the path to the gurgling stomach of the Marowak. The infected's maw begins to open and growl in pleasure once your hips and waist are sucked inside to stretch out the walls of its rump wide. Meanwhile, Jackal violently thrashes his trapped arm inside the tree knot, growling in a mad fritz to free himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid...<i>fucking</i>...tree!\" He roars as his mane of fire erupts into a fan of wild flames. The heat torches the area of the trunk, quickly burning the wood of the tight knot clasped on Jackal's wrist. Loosened with the decaying wood, the fire-type hoists his arm back, plopping it right out of the tree's trunk. He mumbles, \"Did that just...work?\" He chuckles with cocky rage to quickly spin around and rescue you, however, the Marowak had heard all that had gone on during his anal consumption. A spiraling bone flew across the forested area and struck the Typhlosion directly into his face once he had turned around fully coincidentally, sending Jackal to stagger back in a winceful manner. His vision fogs up and darts in all directions as his limbs suddenly began to lose control. He grunts in pain and suffered the same injury you had before, losing the sense of self-control with his legs taking wobbly steps back. Finally, gravity forced the Typhlosion to tilt back and crash into the earth. The Marowak grins as the bone retracts back towards itself. Reaching up, its hand clasps around the weapon in a perfect catch as it is returned to the feral's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you start to stir into awakening again, managing to get a hold of your current situation. Everything has oddly darkened and tight flesh squirms around your body within a murky chamber. The heat was almost unbearable as you felt your thighs leave colder air outside into this dense burrow. Your ears fold back once you realize what was happening. You were being <i>eaten</i> by the Marowak, or at least by some feral. You writhe helplessly inside the rectum, howling out suppressed and muffled cries through the rippling muscles and fat. Your legs kick out madly with your tail performing pointless spins and thrashes to stop the devouring any further. The twisting and turning action helps satisfy the Marowak's pleasure even more, rousing the male to a full erection from your body's movements. Your muzzle presses into a less tight, but still small, opening which forces your head inside the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you were being eaten, why was there a lack of saliva, and why did gravity seem to want to pull you down if you were traveling up? Was the Marowak upside down? The reason finally hits you, which causes your mind to ferociously panic. \"<i>Am I...squeezing inside its anus?!</i>\" That is all that your brain could handle. Your struggling footpaws and tail tip vanish in the musky pucker, gone for good as your body contracts together within the Marowak's stomach. Whimpering within the constricting organ, a digestive pool bubbles up to your chest and knees in your curled up fixation as a cruel greeting to your tomb. You give dreadful looks at the sight of the hot fluids, yet the process seem to not start yet. You sob in misery, begging not to be melted down into a soup to be processed and pooped out later, but what could you possibly do now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the outside world, the infected Marowak strokes its hands over the massive, pale-tan dome shaking before it. The stretched flesh pleases the feral immensely as pre beads at the tip of its cock. You squirm while the hands run over and toy with your body inside, jiggling you some with the sloshing gut. The Marowak releases a juicy and hearty belch as your mind was beginning to subside. The feral gets up, however, and approaches the fallen Typhlosion grumbling on the floor. Jackal was completely stunned and obviously unable to get up anytime soon. The infected grins and sat its tight rear atop his face, just as it had to done with you. Your body could sense the dragging function initiate again through the vibrating flesh, but it would all prove to be useless to care anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were already a meal to this feral who clearly outmatched the both of you, and you would soon become nothing but its energy and body for it to capture more weak fools such as yourself. You whine out for the last time before falling asleep in the frothy stomach of the infected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The infected Marowak smirks as the kicking Typhlosion feet arrive at the basin of its anus, having them tugged on a bit for a last taunt before sealing them inside for all eternity. The hindpaws continue their brave efforts, along with the entire form of the Typhlosion working its way up into the feral's ever-expanding belly. The two bodies mash together, fitting inside the outstretched belly perfectly as the acids did their work on their hides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prey squirms only for a little bit longer until diminishing completely. The Marowak original smirk grows evermore wider as the feral masturbates at the tip of its orgasm. Struggling prey had always helped the feral release more than unconscious prey did, like the Lucario had proven before. With a few more beats of its fapping palm, bubbling seed strings out into the grass with some dripping onto the rabbit girl, steaming with pleasuring bliss as the rest of the cum-batch squirts onto the Marowak's bulbous cock head. It plops a seat back to the ground, massaging its hands onto the fleshy globe spilling out in front of it with joy. It glances its purple eyes over at the faint Buneary girl beside it during its belly-play, figuring to wait to devour the girl when she was awake and squirming.</i></span></div></div>",

He is slowly reaching the hypnotizing naga to your disapproval, leaving his eyes blankly staring ahead as if he had been zombified. The Ekans' hisses a chuckle and orders him to come closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, come my darling!

Here, let me help you to a drink\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d She offers. Planting a hand against the back of his head, she pulls his face directly into her boobs, rubbing her fingers through his fur to entice the fire-type to go ahead and taste her breast. He groans aloud, parting his lips and closing his eyes as he puckers around one of her golden nipples, sucking her wondrous milk into his accepting mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw a drop of the pale liquid leak out from Jackal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth, dripping off his chin, finding the scene both arousing and irritating to see your only hope suckle the nipple of your predator. You yell muffledly through your tail-tied jaws, unable to snap him out of his dream state. The Typhlosion becomes much more sloppier in his binge, opening his mouth wider to allow more of her milk to fill in and spill out from his maw, using his tongue to bathe the breast. You feel yet another sudden surge in your crotch, squeezing behind the purple coil around your waist. This one was much more noticeable, and it grew with time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga hisses a subtle purr, letting her tongue lick the face of the Typhlosion below her who will soon serve her as a meaty course to fill her craving. Apocalypse or not, she was still a carnivore, so nature was simply taking its course for these to work for what they were born for. <i>Meat for her belly</i>. Her hands and arms begin to wrap around him, intentionally having her licks become more aggressive to Jackal as he reached his own hand to fondle her other breast, left open and unnurtured. Unwillingly, you feel the coils around your erection shift, motioning continuously around the sensitive muscle and rubbing the scales against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only grunt in reply as Jackal finishes up his drink, licking the milk from his chin with a childish smile. The Ekans removes her exploring tongue from his saliva and milk coated face, cheering, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll done now? How would you like to take a nap in a cozy place? I mean after all, you must be so full now and a man like you deserves some rest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She pokes at his bulging belly, feeling it slosh inside from all of her breast milk. He giggles, never letting her sight escape his. The serpent took the chuckle as a 'yes'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens her watering maw wide over his head as Jackal just stands there and smiles from the view. \"<i>Was I really like that when I was about to be eaten?</i>\" You had to ask yourself while watching her jaws come down upon the Typhlosion's head. His head disappears within hers, and his body shudders with pleasure as the snake begins gulping him down, taking in his torso. Her lashing, thin tongue swipes and attacks the furry flesh granting itself into her stretching jaws, tasting each and every bit of Jackal as it could with his blissful wriggles. Placing her hands on his overstuffed belly and squishing it for room, she manages to swallow the large hill of flesh inside for her tongue to work into her throat. A suppressed moan rumbles around Jackal's half-gooey body from the Ekans' increasing pleasure as she lifts her head up, letting Jackal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legs and crotch to slide in by the declining, fleshy ramp taking in his delicious hide. Before they could disappear forever, the Ekans licks over them for one last time, jabbing over his arousal. Jackal's bulbous cock lengthens out with no trouble at all from the muscled tentacle wrapping over, grinding against, and smearing saliva upon his thighs and ball sac. Blushing pink meat stabs outward for the forked tongue to coil around, just as the serpent's body coiled around you. The whip starts to pump around the fire-type's member, enduring the pleasuring satisfaction of having her willing meal kick outside and squirm his upper body inside her own. The loud, groaning, wet sounds pulsing into your fearful ears excite your most cruelest nerves and makes you cringe with fear that you were next, and that you may enjoy your final minutes of life. The Typhlosion finally bucks his hips repeatedly, creaming his thick seed within the snake's slurping mouth. The Ekan's chuckles through the muffling flesh and downs the rest of his tuckered and slimy body with one powerful gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his twitching footpaws droop down into her throat, she gulps once more, sending a large bulge in her neck and chest sink down into her long body curled around you. You even felt the bulge circle around you until it rested in the mid-section, which struck a scary sense of disgust in your mind. With a purring hiss and closed eyes, clapped her hands together saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMmmmmm...your horny friend was quite tasty and filling. Time for seconds!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears flip back in horror as the Ekans decides your fate...</span></div></div>",

Saliva leaks out to fall upon your face as her tongue writhes in anticipation, tensing her cheek muscles together for quite a mawshot. And with a fast snap that you couldn't even process of what happened at first, your entire head is engulfed with darkness. You could only whimper while the tongue licks out over your face, exploring your exquisite taste and being gulped in deeper into the naga's gullet. Not only has your recent friend fallen a terrible fate, but you were going to share it with him without even being hypnotized like he had been. The Ekans clearly wanted you well-aware of your death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face would continuously become mashed against the slimy wet walls of her mouth as her hands hold your arms down to your sides, unwrapping her thick coils to loose more of your body for her to consume. With your head being pushed through the tight sphincter of the serpent's throat entrance, your lower body was fully released as your torso slips inside the suckling, licking mess of the reptile's mouth. You kick your legs through the air as a futile and last attempt, thrashing your tail but hit nothing in the process which truly drains you of any willpower. Swallowing again, your crotch enters inside for her forked muscle to work its magic on your ball sac. The wild sensation was too much to make you grumble of pleasure until she had gulped you deeper again, denying you any more enticing treatment too add to your punishment for struggling. Your plush blue rump tucks into the ever nibbling jaws, followed by your black legs that soon give up in their fight to survive. You knew it was too late for you, and squirming only gave the Ekans the better pleasure in her vanquishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour feet arrived in her mouth, and the naga gladly gives a very thorough cleaning to them, suckling on the hindpaws, tickling the soft and sensitive padding. But like most good things for you, it quickly ends when your entire body now slides downward into the frightening, narrow tunnel squelching innards that contract you deep inside her stomach. There was no way you could accept this to become your ending, dying by a non-infected carnivore to be digested into scaled fat, becoming just another wad of crap piles like so many other pokemon have fallen was not what you had in store. You curse yourself for being too weak and defenseless to let your guard down. This is your punishment, and you probably deserve it. How could someone like you stop such a corrupt world? Just then, an outside force pushes your body down into depths of the naga's body, quickly compressing around you in layers of slick flesh. You are squished into another thick object, which sadly turns out to be the unconscious body of Jackal. You too, also feel drowsy as you begin to bat your eyes and fall asleep, crying to yourself within the gurgling environment to slathers the two of you in fluids...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Ekans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hisses happily, rubbing over the massive bulge in her mid-section. She giggles from the constant jiggling of her snake belly of the writhing Lucario trapped inside, all until the movements die out as she curled into a spiral, getting some rest and digestion done on her fine scaly body. \"Hsssssssssss...Who knew Lucarios taste so savory and delicious? They're real <i>squirmers</i>, especially this adorable one. I must thank the two of you for coming out all the way into the forest just to see me...\" The Ekans teases as her hands grope at the bulging mound along her while the two anthros inside were being pulled and pressed by her inner workings, prepared to be digested to become added body fat for her breasts and long tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued, \"...With your addition to my body, I'll certainly be able to lure more boys like you in, thanks to your meaty hides. She snuggles into her beautiful scaly mass, murring softly before catching up on her beauty sleep.</i></span></div></div>",

The coils begin to turn over, flipping your imprisoned body upside down and feel the tail snagged around your foot paws to only be released. A mischievous and evil forked tongue slides across your pink pawpads, bathing them in a clear slime for the serpent to toy with the cute extremities. The sticky liquid drips down your legs as you can only fidget and scrunch your paws in response from the humiliating gesture, nothing more than this Ekans' miserable toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tickling tongue begins to push harder against your ankles, leaving not a single dry spot on your feet so she can encompass all of your decadent flavors and textures. You groan helplessly as you feel the shifting of the coils again that stop once the chuckling snake had lifted you upright once again, but this time, above what looked like her vagina! The pre-glistened pussy blushes and pulsates with arousal from the \"waist\" of the naga, just below her naval. She flickers her tongue before mentioning, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had to lubricate you if I want the most of my pleasure when I <i>unbirth</i> your wriggling little body. I would've played with you more, but you've been a naughty dog. You tried warning my meal!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her statement, the coils let loose letting you fall only an inch before hitting her pussy feet first. They strangely suck inside as her hands pin your arms to your sides, letting you sink deep within the long tube of the snake's body. You yelp out loud, both disturbed and confused in what was happening! You had no clue that a sane, non-infected being would actually devour you by cramming you into their...their pussy!? The Ekans purrs with a tone of amusement while you on the other hand struggle pathetically in her surprisingly strong grasp, roaring in anger with her sex line suckling you down all the way up to your shoulders. The vaginal walls tug at your body, blanketing your fur in sticky patches of pre. You were left speechless in the entire process, forgetting to struggle to and escape from such twisted shock on what was happening to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour neck slides in as she places both of her hands on the top of your head, getting ready to stuff the last of you in.  seeing this as your last moment outside, you desperately plead to her your efforts to stop the infection with, \"No! Stop! I'm trying to <i>mmphmphk</i>!\" You are sadly cut off once the hands jam downward, squishing your muzzle inside her swallowing vagina that gives you the last view of her naked, scaly form and of the outside world before turning into a dark pink, later fading to pure black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The naga presses the bulge in her purple and yellow scaled body, rubbing it as the lump twitches in response. As for the other bulge right below it that contained the Typhlosion, it had stopped wiggling long before she had even devoured the foolish Lucario. The naga shudders down the length of her extensive spine, getting a tremble of pleasure from her back to the end of her tail. The vaginal walls work and pump over the moaning dog inside, orgasming her sexual tension with an inner flood of joy. She dips her fingers into the pussy, fingering around to feel the slime ooze over them, and soon enough, the Lucario will be digested into cum himself. Giving the orb one last rub with her free hand, the Ekans slithers off into the forest with two dragging lumps in her body, one body in her womb being liquefied into snake cum, the other boiling up in her belly. As she disappears in the underbrush, she had left a bowl of unattended, overcooked berries to burn. </i></span></div></div>",

You get up and turned to see that the attacker was none other than a Combusken. From its looks, you guess it's a teenager since it's a few inches shorter than you and in its second evolution. It's physique is slim built and while its chest is flat, it appears to be a female. It stares at you with fiendish violet eyes while she puts her arms forward and her knee up in a fighting stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While aware of her fire type attribute, you go into a fighting stance as well for battle. \"<i>There's no way I'll lose to a chicken!</i>\" You thought out to yourself. The Combusken dashes towards you; sharp beak outstretched and aimed for your hide. You created a rod out of your aura and sidestep her peck attack and struck her three times with Bone Rush. You attempt to use Bone Rush again, but she recovered and received a Sky Uppercut to the chin, sending you in the air and onto your back. You got up quickly, but you find yourself surrounded by a vortex of flames. You realize this is the Combusken's Fire Spin attack!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You try to escape the flaming vortex, but the intense flames are to much to push through. You feel yourself weakening from the heat and lack of oxygen. \"Jackal, I'm having trouble! I need help!\" You cry out as loud as you can. Eventually the flames disperse and your sight is clear, but all you see is the infected fowl chirping happily. \"Jackal, where are you?!\" You hear a roar from the direction Jackal went, it seems the Typhlosion has caught trouble as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The young fowl walks towards you seeing as you're helpless now. You struggle to get up, but her previous attack had sucked out all of your strength.  She jumps on top of you and grabs your shoulders. You swing your arms around her, but lack strength to do any damage as the bird opens her beak and engulfs you head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When she reaches your shoulders with a big gulp, you put your arms out in a vain attempt to halt her feeding. It worked, for a moment. The bird however slashes across your chest lightly to make you convulse in pain, and you do just that. You reach out to hold your chest out of reflex, and once you did that, you just then realized your mistake as the fowl swallows down your shoulders. As the infected continues to dine, you feel wetness dripping onto your thighs with your victorious predator's groin hovering just above them; the Combusken was getting pleasure from consuming you. Reaching your chest, the bird picks you up, stands, and resumes in swallowing the rest of you down for eternity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As you travel down the infected's throat, you have second thoughts about your previous actions. Despite it being younger, it was still a strong fighter and was. You curse your cockiness as your legs enter her throat leaving only your hindpaws hanging out. Soon, they enter as well with a thick gulp to seal your fate inside of this chicken forever. You are curled up in her stomach as the young fowl finishes you off. As you feel your vision narrowing, you think about Jackal. What happened to him? Has he been ambushed as you? Has he abandoned you? You'll never know as you lose consciousness from lack of oxygen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----l----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>A pair of paws are wiggling out of an Ursaring's mouth until the bear gulps down the Typhlosion while the the nearby Combusken lays on her back fingering herself as she digests the Lucario within.

You bark in pain as your backside smashes into the wooden flooring, stinging a sharp strain along your spine to jolt throughout your back, forcing you to bark out in a helpless manner. A fist dwells down upon your head, striking you square in the jaws. Not only that, but your suffering would have to endure a painful knee being thrusted at your gut, squeezing your insides to make them want to pop out of your recently punched muzzle. Now excruciatingly dizzy, you not only feel  heavily disoriented, but it was as if your brain was rocking madly back and forth inside your pounding skull, which have your surroundings and thoughts spinning way out of control. Your alarmed ears frizz out, hearing nothing but a monotonous ring as your nerves tremble with the burning sensation of pain. Your opponent's attack and weight surely did a number on you. The Typhlosion gets up off of your stunned body, having a leg stand next to each of your sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cough out a dry tone and try to rise back up to face your enemy, but the Typhlosion softly plants a foot down against your torso, slowly pushing you right back down to the floor in a dominant gesture, as it if the floor was where you truly belong. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou think you can just barge into this town and break into any building to take whatever you want\u00e2\u0080\u00a6?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He brashly asks.

The soft, fuzzy paw looms and smears your face with humiliation, but the act has the Typhlosion murring softly in bliss. A bubbly gurgle suddenly quakes deep from somewhere, and to your horror, points to the Typhlosion's gut as your prime suspect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grins with the most devilish smile you could imagine for someone to have, all before he retorts, \"...I think I should put worthless meat like you <i>right</i> where you belong...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking his footpaw off your face, the fire type opens his maw open for you to stare into as a cruel death-sentence, letting his impatient tongue hang out in hunger as he picks up your\u00e2\u0080\u00a6</span></div></div>",

Weak, however still conscious, your arms attempt to rise up and press against the chin of your predator, desperate to avoid being downed by this tempered fire-type and ruining your chances to help solve the infection. Although, your hand-paws slip inside his mouth instead, signifying the inevitable fate preparing to consume your meaty hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling from your mistake, the Typhlosion licks over your palms, cleans your pads, and suckles your fingers to enjoy the rare Lucario flavor seeping and emitting from your furry-self. Muffled and wet grumbles shudder over your hands while they slowly slip through his hungry lips and submerge your wrists with them. Finally tasting and discovering the magnificent tastes you shall provide, he thrusts his arms up, picking up more of your body into his impatient maw! Your head and arms cram into the hot chamber, forcing you to actually breathe moist air of his breath as his thick tongue bathes you in his salivating liquids. You whimper softly with the muscle slapping around your face, sticking around your cheek and circling your arms. The slimy sounds and fleshy tremors surrounding you begin to scare your senses terribly and your chest starts to ride up along the Typhlosion's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I...was defeated...is this really how it ends?

You begin to squirm and thrash every limb you still had control over, whether it was outside or diving into a pokemon's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting closer to his stomach, your legs beat around and kick at the clean air as your tail tries to distract the fire-type from his meal by wagging it against his face. He wasn't buying it. Instead, the Typhlosion responds by slurping up more of your body, ending up at your waist for him to scoff at your crotch. His top teeth nibble at your butt, poking into your plush rump while his tongue taps and presses itself against your balls, juggling them some to rouse some deep, twisted desire in you. Your head groans in miserable loss as you begin to lose the power of your futile struggles. It was beginning to corrupt your mind to submit to your predator and let him have his fun with you. However, the Typhlosion ends your pleasure with the satisfaction of vanquishing you, and with a mighty smile, he tilts his head up, letting your twitching black calves sink down into his throat, gulping your tail down as you finally slide into his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou plop into the tight, dark organ, pressing all of your paws against its slick walls that drip saliva. The clear slime oozes over you, drenching you in the hot, steamy liquids to the point were you couldn't bare anymore. \"<i>I...wasn't able to save anyone...not even myself...</i>\" You curse yourself in your depressing thoughts. Two hands grip around your plump bulge with glee and gluttony, squeezing, pressing, and even contracting you inside to whimper softly, all until your life ended, and with it, your journey.

The anthro's tongue flops out to lick up all of the remaining flavor of his meal before he rests down on his side, letting his globed belly digest the Lucario ever so peacefully. The Typhlosion quakes out a belch and circles his hands over his blissful dome, enjoying the pleasuring feeling while it lasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see now, <i>meat</i>? You were worth a lot more than I excepted! Too bad you can't be my comfy doormat or my dinner all the time, huh?\" The Typhlosion teases as a final remark to the digesting Lucario held captive inside, melting away into a delicious soup.

Your lungs felt as if they were twisted around each other, compelling in agony. You consumer gulps more of your body inward which delivers your plush, blue rump squeezing into his stretching jaws. Saliva carelessly drips and lines down from the Typhlosion's chin, provoking a form of hatred that you're being devoured by slob.

You body collects and curls inside the tight organ, scaring you of the innard gurgles and body fluid slime coating your entire sad form. You hear a muffled belch from the outside with two hands prodding at the stomach walls to slur you all inside the hot sac. The act was all too much of a taunt towards you, and with a submissive sigh, you emit silent sobs of your surrender within the squelching dark container, rocking around the bouncing organ from being beaten so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Typhlosion moans out a happy tune of pleasure as he belches out loud and plants his hands on his soft gut.

Sitting at a close-by chair inside the building that was left undamaged during the carnage of the recent fight, he spreads his legs out to have his belly hang between them somewhat, doming out with complete perfection and pleasure. The Typhlosion doubted he could have seen a better fit for his victory against the raider. The Lucario did indeed prove to be a tough fighter, but the cocky fire-type knew that the dog was no match for his powerful brawn. He checks one of his arms and flexes whatever muscle there was in there, smiling anyway at the effort he put it into. His hands and arms rest atop such wonderful flab as his mouth lightly creaks open for him to purr aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmm, it was about time someone put you in your place!

You had to cover your ears from the sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After you recover, you took note of its intimidating appearance. It stands a couple feet taller than you while you see all the power in his arm. The two key features you took note of the most however is that it sports malicious violet eyes and it's tremendous gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dammit!\" You curse yourself as the fat dragon licks its lips. You charge aura into your arms, preparing to fight. You know  staying to fight is suicide, so you must weaken it to escape. The Charizard charges at you, but you sidestepped it and launched an aura sphere towards it. The dragon gets hit and staggers. You rush towards it, making and bone shaped rod made of your aura for a bone rush attack, but the dragon recovers quickly and launches a gout of fire towards you, dispersing your attack and hitting you with his. The intense flame knocks you off your feet and to the ground. You tried to get up, but the intense burn inflected on you saps you of your strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The charizard then walks towards your struggling body, a menacing smile on his face. You tried kicking it away, but lacked the strength to. The chubby dragon picks up your body with both hands, pinning your arms to your waist and starts licking you. You writhe from the feeling on your singed body. Satisfied, he lifts your head towards his open and watering mouth, engulfing it inside. With your arms pinned to your sides, you hardly put up a struggle as you descend into the dragon. The dragon reaches your waist before he stopped fitting your body in. You wondered what he was doing when you feel your lower body being lifted up. The dragon has lifted his head towards the sky, intending to let gravity aid him in your decent to his stomach. When he reaches your hindpaws, he runs his tongue across your pads, a last show of humiliating you. Afterwards, it lifted his face towards the sky and gave one great swallow, sealing your hindpaws inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You arrive in the stomach, the final destination for you. You lightly kick the stomach walls at a futile attempt to escape. Realizing there's no hope, you bow your head down. You started this quest, intending to find a cure for this infection, but now you're curled up in a dragons belly, preparing to be digested. You pass out from the lack of air, thankfully before the acids started kicking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----l----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>The charizard was licking its lips, savoring the lucarios taste.

This is the section for the Viral Community storylines that a few readers have voted for when it came to creating characters for them. Unlike the other storylines you'll find in this interactive, these storylines follow the similar rules of other vore interactives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep. That's right. It means these storylines are susceptible to pure and utter chaotic anarchy. For those of you who don't know, these storylines are available for anyone to add to. You do not have to make a certain number of chapters, you do not have to follow the story where someone is aiming it with, and you do not have to ask people if you could add to a certain chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't start drooling with evil grins and readying your vile fingertips to type a complete mess in these stories though, because there are very well still <i>rules</i> to this interactive. All of the rules other than the storyline completion/solo-writing still apply to these storylines, so don't think you can just take the story anywhere you want. With that stated, there are also a few additional rules that are specifically related to the community stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><div align=\"center\">----| Rules |----</div></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n - <b>The interactive's main rules STILL apply</b>. If you need a refreshment on what those rules are, please go to this link. The only rule that doesn't matter is the chapter adding to someone else's storyline since these storylines are for everyone. (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1799220-Viral-Pokemon-Vore\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/ite...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n - <b>Do NOT post random bullshit</b>. I repeat. No. Bullshit. That means when you post, take the time to read over your chapter and think to yourself, \"Does this reflect decent enough grammar for my work to at least be read, understood, and appreciated by other people who know the English language well enough? Is what I'm typing realistic for the type of world I'm writing for here? Am I making up random things and hoping that it will be funny or kinky even though it really isn't? Have I posted a good enough size for a chapter and not resorted to mere tiny simple sentences and lack of details whatsoever?\" If you think of these things, they should help guide you into making a good chapter for Viral. You don't have to type a masterpiece of an essay, or a Shakespearean work or art. I'm simply informing you that you should post at least a few paragraphs so that the characters progress in the story somehow, or if a vorish/yiffish scene has enough details to satisfy plenty of people when they read it. Don't post random and foolish bullshit. (For example: chasm the greninja faced off against a wave of infected but wasn't scared. he put on some sunglasses and pulled out akimbo submachine guns and killed all of the monsters yelling \"ya wont get me ya purple eye freaks hurrdity hur hur hur.\" and then he was unbirthed by a surprise attack by one, and nine months later he was bron as a frog baby with purple eyes. the end.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n - <b>Do NOT make the hero defeat the villain early in the story</b>. This IS a story, so it should follow a formula that many stories use. Having the character suddenly fight the villain merely chapters earlier of beginning the story is far too soon. In fact, I would refrain from the villain being defeated at all until I and other authors see fit, because there needs to be a clear goal for the character, and many trials for the character along the way. If you would like a few tips on the journey the character can go on, the character shouldn't be completely and all powerful. All characters have flaws, and even if they're incredibly strong, they can have intense fears of something, or a weaker loved one they feel obliged to always protect, or having them make moral-crushing choices that could cause them to hesitate and even stop them from protecting themselves or doing something for the greater good. Characters should also learn something on their adventure. No one goes out in search of something, fight against something, or protect something without learning something either about themselves or about the world afterwards. The road ahead is a long one, and it doesn't just take a hero and a villain to make good story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n - <b>Do NOT constantly spam chapters</b>. The maximum limit you can make for chapters in a row is four. That's it. If you make five or more chapters in a row, you are defeating the purpose of these specific storylines. They are for everyone to make a contribution to, and it's interesting to see how many minds come together and work off an idea. It's to test your improvisation and creativity. Another thing, make sure to leave a few options open for others. There need to be at least several possible branches where the main characters succeed, as well as fail, in their endeavors. It's also to make sure the story goes into several places, just so that there are no sudden dead-ends to where reader will have to go back twenty chapters just so that there's a possible line of chapters where the heroes can win and survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n - <b>Do NOT hog a bunch of chapters to yourself</b>. If you are convinced that you have a super amazing and completely mind-blowing idea that you really want to write after making a chapter, then at the bottom of the chapter, make a little note in parenthesis asking for no one to add to a certain chapter option so that you can make it. Otherwise, it's everyone's game to take the option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n - <b>It's actually OKAY to leave 'Reader's Choice' as an option</b>. For some of you, I can sense you're already raising your pitchforks, but have no fear. I hate seeing those options in several different interactives, yet I can make this work. You shouldn't always make a bunch of options forced onto other authors who have a neat idea for what can happen next, so sometimes but not all of the time, leave in one of the next chapter's options to be 'Reader's Choice'', because as soon as someone adds to one of those Reader's Choice chapters, I will take it upon myself to edit the chapter option into an action that fits for what happens next as soon as possible. I receive email notifications for every chapter, so as long as I'm not sleeping and have internet access somewhere, I'll make sure I can find the quick bit of time to read over the chapter and edit chapter options if I need to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n - <b>Do NOT make fetish-specific traits for the main character</b>. The character needs to be generally pansexual or bisexual so that they can still find an attraction to both sexes. Ferals' goals are to seduce or overpower their prey. It needs to be possible for the hero to suffer at least some bit of attraction, even if it's unwilling, to these hungry beasts. The main character should also be very open and tolerant of many different kinks, but not specifically enjoy one more than the other. This is a general vore story, which means a wide array of different types of readers read this, and that not everyone has the same kinks as you do. In fact, some may even detest the kinks that you have, so just make sure you put warnings if the kink you're adding is at the top of a chapter that you think would probably really gross someone out, like scat, smells, blood, or pawplay bits. As I said earlier, the main character should NOT have an extreme fetish for these gross things, and should be lenient on all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n - <b>Do NOT constantly add side characters that follow the hero</b>. It's easy to just stick with one or two characters that stick it out through the whole journey, but it makes it MUCH more difficult for authors if they have an entire group following the main character so that when they write chapters, they have to make actions for most to all characters present in the scene. It also makes writing game over vore chapters a bitch to do, because it sucks that you have to limit your details into not being repetitive, but also need to describe how each character falls and gets eaten/infected. So please, it's okay to add in side characters to follow the hero, but they do not need to be permanently there if the group is getting big. They can help out in a side-story or temporary issue, but they should either leave or have something happen to them so that they do not progress with the main character. I recommend that the main character should probably only have a max of four main party members at one time. But this also means that all of the main party member characters shouldn't join the main hero at the beginning of the story. Give the hero time to progress on the adventure before matching up with some helpful people, and give them a good reason to why they want to follow this specific person and believe that they can solve this infection, rather than just staying somewhere safe and not in the harsh wilderness far from help or towns, and to risk their lives like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n - <b>The story needs to be written in second person perspective</b>. All of them. (For example: \"You listen with alert ears from the pounding sound echoing throughout the entire room with the loud booms practically shaking the walls. With the desperate feral slamming all of its weight against your front door, it wouldn't be too long until the monster would burst into your home and claim you as its next meal. You search around in a panic in an effort to find any other exit or a place you could fit yourself into to hide from the snarling predator.\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMessage me if you have any other questions, because I think that's it so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorry for the dictionary-worth of words there, but those are mandatory rules that need to be abided by. Now, onto the stories! I've started the Zoroark storyline, to kick things off, but other people can start the Greninja and Charmeleon chapters if they wish to. Happy adding and reading!</span></div></div>",

It lightly splashes some from a droplet leaking in from the ceiling to add to the horrible taunt as it widens the puddle slightly more. You lean your body forward with your tongue outstretched to try and lap at the teasing cold water just before your very muzzle, but you are only mere inches away from the liquid. Whining and panting for the need to drink something, you could only lose the strength to keep yourself pressed forward and slump back, flattening your backside right onto the stone wall once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChains are locked around your wrists that keep you trapped against the wall, as well as shackles around your ankles keep you on your knees and contained to the floor too. It had been nearly two whole days since you were locked up inside of the dark, black-bricked cell. The place was dank, old, rotting with moss and age, and moistness of the rocks and the rippling puddle of water before you could only mean that it had rained today, and some of the water was there to greet you this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth is dry, your eyes and lungs are tired, and your stomach cries out weakly for food. The guards posted outside of the cell's hall were supposed to be giving you a daily meal, but it seems that they 'forgot'. Not a single guard showed you any remorse before or after they chained you up in this place, with the whole academy of 'justice-serving' troops being nothing more but a corrupt league under the hand of the mayor and town power-holders. As if you cared about what they thought of you or how they treated you, you just needed to devise a way to get out of town, and plenty far enough away so that you won't be hunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour name is Garnet, and you are a Zoroark imprisoned for murder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden wooden door creaks open and footsteps patter their way into the hall. Struggling to focus your eyes to the jail cell bars, you notice a familiar pair of legs stand in your groggy vision's view. A spear's bladed tip taps at the bars to ring in high-pitched metal sounds as a cocky male voice chuckles, \"Wakey wakey, you don't want to sleep in on your own execution, do you? Up at em'! It's not everyday that you get to be publicly killed in front of the whole town!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you had enough moisture in your body, you'd spit at him if you could. \"K-Keep talkin' like that, and it won't be <i>my</i> death th-they see when you take me outside...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard grins, \"Awwwh, the voodoo shapeshifter has feelings.\" The cocky and sneering troop was none other than the main captain of the entire town's guard; a Braviary anthro named Captain Pierce. The avian stood tall and built, packed with enough muscle and height to intimidate his lower grunts and any who opposed him. Navy blue and crimson feathers coat most of his body, with yellow scaled legs and arms collected with light golden armor to show off his authoritative status. Even his black talons, three in the front and on his heel were sharpened to look threatening, followed with his black claw-tips by his fingers. A golden helm etched with sapphires around his smug face prove all too well that he enjoyed his power, and enjoyed flashing it out even more. And lastly, his large wings jetting out from his backside give a little flap of enjoyment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his leather belt, he slid out the jail's keys and unlocked your cell door, stepping inside and kneeling down to your level for your eyes to connect. \"Don't be mad with us, dearie. We gave you chance to come clean so you wouldn't have to face this, but you pleaded not guilty. Murdering the mayor was a pretty nasty thing to do, and the town wants your blood. Even if we didn't kill you, heh, the citizens sure would make your life Hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell sounds like a pretty fitting place for you right now. And the town only wants me dead because you told them I outright tried to assassinate him and hide the evidence, even though I was the one who told you that he was dead! That bastard called me into his room and tried to rape me, and you know it!\" You snipe back. Your hands pull at the chains in a pathetic endeavor to claw the fucker's face off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eagle smirks and pats your head, \"Self-defense means nothing to the town's council, you foolish mutt. From the people's view, our mayor was a community leader, and societal backbone, and most importantly, the sweetest and nicest Empoleon that ever existed. We set up his image so perfectly for those foolish citizens, but then you had to go off and do something as stupid as killing him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabs you by the neck to squeeze with a cold glare as you grunt out, \"N-Nghh! C-Cause he wouldn't b-back off and tried to kill me wh-when I fought...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were just some low-life servant girl to him in his manor. No one's going to believe you. From what they gossiped and gathered, the town's so fixated that you were a jealous little rat in the manor, so furious at how much the village loved our leader, and how rich he was. Greed made you go into a blind rage in an attempt to assassinate him, and you snuck into his room to stab him in his own bed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same bed he tried to force me against, y-you monster.\" You snarl weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour words seem to only entertain the bird, and he releases the hold around your neck to give you breathing room. \"Heh heh heh, you should've let him have his way with you, and he would've treated you like a queen.\" He used the wooden staff-end of his spear to poke under one of your furred breasts, giving it a few bounces to it. \"...A shame. I could've had some fun with you as well, but the people of our town are impatient. So let's get on our way to the town square, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grit your teeth as your ruby eyes fixate on the evil bird in front of you, never peeling away as he unlatched the chains from the wall with his keys, but that still left your hands cuffed and bound in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe loses his sense of vile humor and orders in his natural hostile tone, \"Up. Make any other sudden moves, and I'll make sure your death won't be a quick and simple beheading. It will be slow, and I will take my time with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to get up to a wobbly stance, you didn't feel like dying now. You weakly stagger away in front of him and walk yourself out of the jail cell and down the hall. The cold breeze made you shiver, and want to just collapse there and then. There wasn't a need for clothes in your world, but being stuck in darkness, cold, and left hungry has made you weary and sick. What you would give to be in a warm bed right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Pierce from behind you gives you a shove to motivate into going faster that only forces you to want to topple down already since your body already felt like fragile glass. You just needed to make it outside, and then perhaps you could map out a better plan of escape in your head. Before making it to the large door leading out of the town's guard assembly building, it bursts open with a Jolteon guard rushing out of it and pushing you to the side, making you fall onto your back and yelp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eeveelution shows no sympathy or attention towards you and exclaims to Pierce, \"Captain! We have an issue!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eagle scowls and looks down at the smaller Jolteon anthro, \"What now? I thought I told you to take care of the fight down at the south barn! I have an execution to actuate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Jolteon worriedly looks at the captain, nervously explaining to the avian, \"Th-That's just it, sir! Several fights are escalating all over town. We have some kind of riot I think. The execution needs to be postponed, because we need every guard we have to control all o-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe canine would be cut off once a large body slams in through the brick wall, forcing the Jolteon into a pile of rubble from being bulldozed into another wall while you and Pierce are sent flying back in the exploding rock. You crash down and whine out as you barely manage to get onto your face and knees, whereas Captain Pierce flaps his wings and gets right back up with his spear drawn, \"G-Ghh...wh-what the Hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut from the dust stomps out a fat and large Aggron, drooling with an open mouth and staring off at the Braviary with glowing purple eyes. The metal beast licks around at its lips with its cock throbbing hard and glistening at its end with hot pre that disturbs Pierce beyond all of his comfort. He tries to speak with the crazed Aggron, yelling, \"S-Sergeant Rail! What are you doing?\" The Aggron merely screeches out a metallic roar before blasting forward in a charge that the captain nearly gets hit by before he sidesteps out of the way. \"R-Rail! Stop messing around, or I'll have to put you down! That is an order!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter coming to a heavy stop, the reptile just turns around with a low groan until it charged again. Following up from his demand, Captain Pierce dashes forward as well with his spear readied and stabbing outward at the oncoming Aggron. The massive lizard simply smashes the bladed end of the spear with its armored forearms and slams into the cawing bird, sending Captain Pierce flying through a brick wall and out onto the outside lawn somewhere of the building. You stagger up with trembling legs before falling onto your rear with a grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound causes the horny Aggron to turn its head towards you, seeing a very easy meal sitting before him. Your ears fold back with a heavy weight going down your throat as you try scooting yourself backwards, barely making any distance between you and the purple-eyed freak with its heavy stomps making its towering appearance gain closer to you. Glancing down, you spot that the keys on Pierce's belt had flung off and sat on the floor between you and the Aggron, but the door out of the place was just right behind. Perhaps you could just escape, but your wrists and ankles are still chained! You might not make it very far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou needed to come up with something quick, or who knows what this crazy lizard wanted to do with you...</span></div></div>",

You stumble outside, hearing the heavy stomps of the Aggron giving chase. Looking around, you can see that the town is in a panic, with people yelling and dashing this way and that. You see your opportunity to lose the Aggron within the chaos, so you drop onto all fours and sprint forward with all your might. You were already starving and weary from your days in the prison cell, but the adrenaline generated from the present danger allowed you to push yourself past the limits of your endurance.

You slow down to a halt, praying that you weren't about to faint out of fatigue. Losing consciousness here could turn out very badly. Your mind goes fuzzy and you collapse into the dirt, but shortly after your vision begins to clear as feeling slowly returns to your body. You pick yourself up off the ground and quickly glance around.

You also needed to find a way to remove the chains around your wrists and ankles, which would be very difficult without a tool of some sort. You briefly wonder if anyone noticed you racing through the streets and if they might be coming to find you. Nearly the entire town knew about the Zoroark girl who murdered the mayor, although you doubted that they would be able to punish you given the current state of things.</span></div></div>",

You can't help but chuckle at yourself, resting one of your webbed paws on your slim midsection. Today is the day you'd finally decided to leave your home in search of answers, and with all the anxiety going on in your mind you probably haven't eaten as much as you should have. That's alright, there will be plenty of berries along the way as you leave the forest. On that note, you realize that you have no idea which would be the best direction to go, seeing as you've lived your whole life in this dense collection of trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour old village isn't far from here, a gathering of humble tree-homes which is now deserted. You would like to see it again, but many ferals tend to inhabit that area, so in the interest of your own survival it's best to avoid it. Your head swivels to look across the small lake. In that direction is one of your training spots, but beyond that is an utter mystery to you... So with your mind made up, you take a graceful leap into the clear water, hardly even making a splash as your amphibian body simply slides in. For a water-type like you, taking occasional swims is actually important. You need to stay hydrated to keep your energy up, and to allow the use of your water-type techniques- without them you would be much more vulnerable. However, you can only carry so much water in your body, so you decide it would be best to avoid wasting it on attacks unless it's absolutely necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou emerge on the opposite shore of the lake, the cool water spilling off of your body as you step out of the shallows. It feels so nice, you almost wish you could stay. This would be a good final memory of your birthplace. Who knows, you might even return someday. But something told you that day would be a long, long time in coming...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes scan the treeline and find a low branch. You take a running leap, grabbing onto the branch with both hands, and swing yourself up, gliding up into the tree feet-first before rotating upright to land safely on an upper branch. With the forest as dense as it was, using the treetops was simply the safest and easiest way to travel, for someone capable of doing so. You nimbly crawl along the branches, taking short leaps between trees, slowly working your way into the upper canopy. The leaves surrounding your view become thinner, until eventually you are perched upon a high branch in one of the tallest trees, giving you a clear view across the leafy roofing of the forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe verdant green stretches as far as the eye can see, although you can make out mountains far off in the distance. A gust of wind causes the wood around you to creak and shudder, and your pink scarf flaps against your back. Many do not realize it, but this is actually your tongue- although its uses are far different than the same appendage of other creatures. The unusual size and length originally developed as a means to ensnare and devour prey, although nowadays this usage is almost completely forgotten. Instead Greninja wear them like cloaks or capes, occasionally using them in combat as a fifth limb to strike their foes. You eat berries like everyone else, by slipping them under the scarf into your mouth, which remains hidden as a consequence of the pink appendage always being wrapped around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to descend the trees, reminded of your hunger. From the lower branches you will be able to see or smell any berries near the ground. It only takes a few more minutes of tree-walking until one such tasty smell wafts up to your nose, and cautiously you begin to slip down to lower branches. You can see a whole batch of blue, roundish fruits hanging from nearby bushes. <i>Oran berries, what else?</i> From your low perch, you visually scan the clearing several times before dropping down silently. You approach the bushes and pluck a berry, closing your eyes as you breathe in the flavorful scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes shoot open and your head swivels to look behind you. Crouching a few yards away is a dark, wiry female eyeing you up. She has long, sharp claws and red featherlike adornments in various places around her body. <i>A Weavile.</i> She seems a bit surprised, staring up at you with those violet-colored eyes... exactly like the eyes of those monsters who devoured your village. The berry you picked drops to the ground as she pounces you. You put your guard up just fast enough to pivot around, redirecting the force as she tackles you to throw her off to the side, those nasty claws narrowly missing your face. She quickly picks herself up and emits a low growl as you prepare yourself for a fight...</span></div></div>",

He trudged through the mud ridden path that was left over from the storm and thought about how hard his life was and how much it sucked having his friends all devoured by those purple eyed freaks, Ah yes, the virus, every night he thinks about the terrible curse upon his fellow pokemon, every night he relives the torment of watching his closest pals one by one being plucked of and eaten, becoming no more than a  wild nidokings play toy or an arcanines large eusaphigeal lump. He loathed the 'purple plague' not only because it had swallowed up his friends but now it had almost fully swallowed up his brother. It had all happened so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    It was an ealy morning and jack had not woken up yet, still sleeping in his luxoriously made hut which, by his brothers house, was amore than adequit room. He awoke with a loud yawn swishing his tail flame back and forth; he was a charmander his brother, a charmeleon, both closely connected by brotherly love. As he walked outside to greet his small village he noticed it was oddly quiet \"Huh, must be a lazy day perhaps.\" Following his brothers scent he scouted down his taller burly brethren. He came upon him gathering wild berries. \"Hey Jack! Looks like you finally woke up! I was begginning to think you were gonna mold into the bed!\" Jack smiled and came up to his brother and gave him a nice big hug. \"Good morning to you to!\" All he could reach though was his thigh, making Jack look more like a leg humper rather than a hugger.\" heh okay you can help me too, you gather some in this area, and i'll go a little ways ahead. He gave a cheerfull nod, still attached to the leg. He watched his brother move on ahead and continued to pick up were his bro stopped. He was unaware of the events that would change his whole life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Unbeknownst of him, his brother had been aught of guard by a series of bushes rustling. He looked closer and was surprised to see- 'GRAAAAAAAAAAWRRR!!'A wild pichu had jumped out of the bush and assaulted the charmeleon snapping at his arm and giving him a good deep cut. Jack rushed to the scene to seethe charmeleon fling the Pichu to a nearby tree knocking unconcious, foaming at the mouth and what he seemed to see a glimpse of purple in its eye. \"Are you ok?\" He rushed to his brothers arm and looked at the wound, once he had gotten a bit from an arbok and the venom would have killed im if it weren't for his brother who sucked out the venom. \"I don't know, i-i feel... anxious and ooh my head, i think i should WAH-\" His brother instinctively started sucking and sptting out the slaiva that seeped into his skin \"NO WAIT! DON'T!\" He wouldn't stop. \"No you don't get it, thosepurple eyes meant something Jack.\" He stopped sucking the wound and stared at his brother \"Iwas meaning to tel you this sooner but a virus has broken out, and who ever catches it turns vicious like an animal, losing all sanity, and iv'e...i-im bit... Jack you have to run away, as far as you can!\" \"NO! I WONT LEAVE YOU!\" \"Please, it;s your only hope to--- to survi---\" He began to daze off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Jack thought quickly, once he had seen a vicious bout of rabies in one of his friends families they had to muzzle the poor kid till they could cure him. A MUZZLE! \"S-stay right there, ill be right back... please don't leave me.\" He ran into his village and noticed a couple other people now outside. . .except. OH NO! There eyes were the same develish purple hue, Jack ran straight to the medicle hut hut grabbed the muzzle, perfect fit for his brother, and, dodging the many mouths of vicious Pokemon, ran back to his brother who was begginning to lose it. \"I' here stay still\" His brother pushed away the muzzle, his eyes already turning to the violet tint \"Wait, listen, while ther...may not be a cure... i think... your sucking helped... it's not going to fully effect me... i think i can retain some of my...me...just promise me not to take the muzzle off with out...with out...just don't till you're sure okay?\" His brother was teering up. \"O-okay, i wont\" He began to put the muzzle over his snout, crying as he looked at his defeated bro. \"Jack...i-i love you... find a cure... i know you... ca-caRRR GRAA!\" And with that he collapsed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Jack quickly strapped the muzzle around his head, so tightly he thought it was ubreakable. He proceeded with his hands and propped up his brother against a tree, then got a rope so he could lead his brother where he needed to. He cried softly into the night as screams of terror filled the damp air, growls ad roars and defeaning gulps heard everywhere, it was a miracle they weren't found. In the morning it began to rain and as he noticed his brother wake up, he noticed the deep violet almost blue color of his brothers eyes. Then began the struggle, to get free and to control his brother. The charmeleon began to growl and thrash and kick with his feet thankfully tied down, he spotted Jack and eyed him evily. Jack with quick wit knew just what to do, his brother had a favourite spot to scratch on him, just below his horn, so jack darted behind his beastly brother and began to rub as hard as he could. The charmeleon stopped suddenly and a low growl emitted from his closed snout. After 10 minutes of rubbing he was calmer, but still gave his brother a hungry glare. Jack sighed and laid against his now hardly brotherly brother, and with tears in his eyes looked up only to see a menacing face... and a more lightly colored violet? Maybe his treatment somewhat worked and it was proven by the next action; the charmeleon wrapped his tail arounf the shivering charmander \"Br-brother?\" His eyes wandered up tohis mean face again and some blue in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rain continued for hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so here he was, leading his own flesh and blood muzzled and tied up, led by a leash down a muddy path, looking for a cure. He was wondering where to go now as fork in the road appaeared. \"Heh, which way bro\" he said solemnly and jokingly not expecting an answer from his foaming bro (whos name is now Kael) helooked back surprised to see...</span></div></div>",

The Nidoking looked as if he was going to run away, Jack noticed and tried to calm the ridiculously frightened guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY, HEY, its okay, hes my brother.\" He started only to be inturrupted by a \"BUT HES FREAKING INFECTED!\" Jack gritted his teeth and was more than willing to take the muzzle off to Kael teach him a few lessons \"I KNOW that, but ive coaxed him enough to be tamer around me... i think, but i have the muzzle on him and his hands are bound, so nothing to fret about.\" He clutched the rope holding him less, and sighed looking to the ground, \"Look, im traveling alot, and it would be nice to have more company, but if your gonna act all scared like this, you'll be more of a nuicence than a help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nidoking looked down, almost a defeated look, but then straightened his brow and looked straight at you, \"No, im gonna be tough for once, no more sissy stuff, and if anything tries to hurt you or your brother, i'll stop it!\" Jack looked back into his face with a grin, \"That's the spirit, now come on we gotta go find a cure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                      -------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been quite a while since Lilac joined you, he started out strong but after a while he just seemed to have that same defeated look on him. Jack couldn't take it anymore; \"Hey, whats your issue, at first i thought you wanted to come along, but now it looks like a big moping lump of purple.\" The Nidoking started to tear, and Jack realized he was being too hard on the big guy \"I-im sorry, i just thought that-\" \"No, its alright, i am a big baby after all. This is all too much for me, first my friends get eaten and im accused for it, then i'm looking like the monster, then everbody else starts trying to bite me, a few nipping me too, i just don't wanna be alive anymore.\" Jack had empathy towards him \"I know how you feel, my whole village was infected, i'm lucky i'm still alive...wait, did you say you got nipped a couple of times?\" Jack pondered the thought, if he had gotten bit, shouldn't he be like his brother? \"Um..*sniff* yeah... but i don't wanna show you..\" \"Lilac, please it's important, i need to know if you'll be okay\" he stood there for a moment, crossed arms not directly looking at him but then sighed deeply \"Okay, but it ain't gonna be pretty\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he began to turn around. When his back was fully facing you he started to bend over. Jack was getting confused, was he showing his bite or his bark? His tail started to lift and when it was fully lifted Jack was staring at two plump cheeks, with a tiny gash starting at his crack \"Well... that's not, eherm, so bad.\" He couldnt help but blush, it was as if Lilac was presenting himself. \"Oh, it gets worse.\" He took both his hands and placed them on his cheeks then slowly spread them apart, giving jack the full view of his behind; low hanging balls flopped out and his dick followed, along with a view of the Nidokings tailhole. The gash led almost down to the back of his scrotum, across the area between. Thankfully nothing looked too painfull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack had to hold his own erection in, his brother sometimes 'played' with him when they were going through a horny stage. \"So, uhh *cough* how did this happen, again..?\" Lilac sniffled and then returned his cheecks back, them flinging back with an audible smack. \"I..i fell on another pokemon... well sat more like. It was when i was getting attacked by a pack of infected Growlithes, one was aiming to trip me up from behind... but he ended up tripping into my behind. He got a good solid bite.\" Jack came too his senses, <i>this guy must have some sort of immunity, i guess i should take a closer look at that... later, geez that'll be awkward.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilac stood there, tail back down over his exposed rear end and holding his hand togethor in shame. The silence was stopped by a loud grumbling from the nidokings stomach. \"Well, i guess you need to eat... as long as all of us do, man what am i gonna feed my brother.\" As son as Jack thought that -</span></div></div>",

Jack could only push it away as it kept trying to claw at his face or get a good solid bite on his body, but Jack was just able to stop it, but he was getting extremely tired. \"Lilac... you gotta... HNGGG.. get this off of me!\" He looked at the panicking Nidoking as he pointed at himself. \"YES YOU! Hit or something.\"<br>\r\n\"You mean, with like this?\" The Nidoking gets ready to swing at Jack, but the Charmander almost swoons as he see's that the object in his hands was a massive log.<br>\r\n\"WHAT NO!\" The Orange lizard was getting even more exhausted as the Mincinno almost landed several bites to his neck.\"Just grab him\" Lilac set the log down and looked at you then the Mincinno then you, he was about to cry, and he knew he was running out of time. \"Lilac- please i can't\" -\"HSSSSSSSSSS\" The purple eyed pokemons jaws were about to snap right onto his neck... but the weight was lifted away. A huge purple hand was wrapped around the Mincinnos head, the lower of his body trashing and hoping to get out.<br>\r\n\"Are.. you ok?\" Lilac crouched over Jack as he saw the little lizard. He was panting as he tried to sit up, but collapsed anyway.<br>\r\n:waht am i supposed to do with you?\" Jack was still panting but quickly thought of what to do with the infected Mincinno. \"Alright, Lilac, you said you were hungry right?\" Lilac nodded, \"So, you have to eat him.\"<br>\r\n\"WHAT!?\" Lilac began to hyperventalate, he put his hand to his chest and looked pained. \"I can't, i've never eaten a whole pokemon before?\"<br>\r\n\"well, if it's not you then its my brothers meal... but how?\"<br>\r\n\"MMWROOOW!\" He looked to his brother, he was looking at him but had his rump pointed straight upwards, squelching as a weird fluid was running down his backside. \"You want me to.. i mean him, to shove it in *gulp* there?\" His brother was anxious and he wanted it. \"Well.. hmm.\" It was either Lilac or Kael.</span></div></div>",

That 'thing' is still my brother, no matter what state he's in. Now you help me feed him or am i going to have to do this myself?\" He glared at the nidoking, who was feverishly staring back and forth, biting his lip. Then in a gust of bravado he looked at Jack and said plainly \"No..\"<br>\r\nJack was thrown back by the courageous gesture and slightly proud of the big purple lug at the same time. \"O-okay then, i guess it's just gonna be me feeding him!\" Jack stared at the mincinno, it was motionless but still alive, passed out from the struggling it did. Jack sighed. In a quiet tone he said \"Just give the mincinno, go find some berries or something, i'll call back when im done.\" The nidoking dropped the fuzzy infected and left jack with the dirty work. Lilac slouched away, feeling hurt inside because he failed to please again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp... here goes nothing.\" Carefully grbbing some rope and tying the mincinnos hands and mouth closed and tight, he looked back to his brothers hungry glare that was obscured by his high backside. He dragged the infected over to the Charmeleon, and before at least trying to enter the pokemon into the fire types anus, he asked Kael one more time \"You sure about this?\" The charmeleon growled hungrily which roused the mincinno. Jack quickly brought the head to the pulsing backside and entered the head, almost immediately the pucker latched onto the mincinnos head and began a backwards swallowing motion, jack quickly thrusted his hands back careful not to get them stuck inside his musky backside. While gross, Jack couldn't help but stare as the charmeleons hungry pucker swallowed up the small pokemon, squelch after squelch, mucus ran down his backside and the small pokemon inside began to squirm. <br>\r\nThe mincinno started kicking its legs causing the charmeleon to groan in ecstacy but also in annoyance as the movement had slowed down the ingestion process, jack grabbed the two legs and began to push them inside. \"I hope you realize you ow me big time for this Kael, ugh.\" With almost all the mincinno in, Jack sighed and looked up to the sky \"Thank goodness-\" SQUIRTCH.<br>\r\nHe felt a warm sensation envelope his hands.

Jack jerked back desparately trying to free himself but to no avail. His arms were now beginning to ascend into the fat rump of the fire type and he noticed something red and hard swaying underneath; his brothers cock was on the verge of orgasm. He couldnt believe this betrayed by his own brother, even though he knew his mind was partially lost he never thought he'd go this way by his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kael, please, stop!\" Jacks face was staring to touch the warm, slimy oriface, then he noticed something, it sounded like a tear, and then panting was followed, he looked to is side as the muzzle had snapped off, now his brother was completely free to chomp on any other pokemon. He hoped that Kael would stop now, but feared if he did he'd be gobbled up in no time. Full primal instinct was in Kaels brain now as his body was wiggling in pleasure. Jack tried his best to keep from submerging his head into the musky stinkhole but was astounded to feel his brothers hand push him in! \"NO! NO! KAEL PLEASE! NOO!\" He must have snapped the bonds too. Jack's torso and waist were slurped up fast and that's when he broke down into tears. Tears of defeat as he felt his brotheres betraying hands push in his feet and the last of the cool day air was shut off by moist, sticky and smelly intestines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside the charmeleon had just orgasmed as he felt the two pokemon slowly slide in. Inside Jack felt his body move inward more and more for a good three to four minutes until he met with a pair of feat; the mincinnos. They quickly dissappeared as they were sucked into a smaller sphincter. Soon to be his fate, Jack looked forward and closed his eyes as he felt the puckered flesh engulf him sanding to the charmeleons acid filled sac. The air was slowly esacping, and Jack was losing conciousness. \"I'm sorry.... Kael... i ... i couldn't save you... or any one else.\" He drifted into nothingness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                                        -----I-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Charmeleon panted as his stomach growled from his new meal(s), he didn't remember Jack, or his hospitality, just the pleasure they brang to him. He rolled over, with a still, bulging stomach and a cum covered patch of grass next to him. Sprawled out, he rubbed his stomach till the gurgling started to die down. He was satisfied and soon would hunt again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------ Lilac had seen everything from the bushes....he quietly cried to himself, </span></div></div>",

You look through one eye to the left to see your shoulder still pinned to the ground underneath the Weavile's clawed hand. You feel his other clamped at your side, holding you still for his pleasures. His hips drive hard into yours, stealing another pained groan from your battered form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah... hnngg... ahhh...\" You hear your rapist pant, lacking any form of sympathy or grace.

You whimper under the dominent male and rest your wet gaze back on the lone thistle, forcing yourself to focus on nothing else. It dances before you in the wind as you feel the pulsing tool inside you begin to slide back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time to finished what I started.\" Rahk says, more to himself than to you.

As your heartbeat slows and normalizes, you let out a quiet sigh and brush the dew from your eyes. As you finish wiping the droplets from your eyelids, your hand brushes across a faint scar just below your left eye. The torn flesh, about an inch in length, fades downward into your cheek. You let it linger there for a moment longer, remembering that terrible day. The day your innocence was taken. You let your claws slide out and shimmer in the moonlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never\", you whisper quietly to yourself, \"Never again will another being suffer because of you...\" you retract your claws and curl your hands into fists, gazing up at the moon.

Looking down into the sea of black before you, you entertain the idea of attempting to return to your rest. A sharp snap directly below you dashes the thought. You instantly meld back into the shadows as you heed the twigs warning, silently cursing yourself for your outburst earlier. Moments pass as the noiselessness of the forest returns.

It would appear that your night terror had alerted the smiling lizard to your presence. A quick glance into his souless purple eyes tells you all you need to know of your opponent.

Sweat is beginning to drip from your form as you burst from the forest into the flat prairie. Tall grass flanks you on every side giving you many places to conceal yourself. You make it about 30 feet into the vegetation before you hear the crimson lizard burst through the shroud of trees. Hoping to avoid his gaze, you hit the deck just as he begins to scan the area for signs of his prey. You struggle to control your frantic breathing, hoping to calm your racing heart before you give away your position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last of the broken branches fall from the trees along your path, submerging the moonlit grassland back into silence. The quiet sound of wind through the blades of grass is the only break in the deafening noiselessness that surrounds you. As your pulse slows once more, you focus on every little sound around you. Crickets chirp into the night breeze, the strands of grass softly rustle against each other, and the trees beyond creek as they sway. No breathing, no footsteps... Nothing but the endless breeze playing with the grass, shimmering in the moonlight. While it would be easy enough to spot the fire-type's tail flame, you don't dare chance a look into the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bloodthirsty roar pierces the night before lines of hungry crimson flare to life. Your heart sinks as the cunning lizard sets the field ablaze, hoping to smoke you out. As the seconds tick by and as the fumes grow thicker, the plan to hide out in a grassland from a fire-type has you cursing yourself for your arrogance. Soon, the need for clean air overwhelms your sense of caution and has you dashing out of the burning brush. Unfortunately, your desperate run leads you straight into the chest of your prepared foe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your daze from contact subsides, you realize that the Charmeleon has you wrapped up in a tight bearhug against his chest. He squeezes you playfully, probably  to mock your pitiful struggles in his far superior arms. Pinned by his mighty hold, your sweat drenched bodies stick together. The odor causes a small but very noticeable reaction deep within you, causing you to gasp after every other inhale. It doesn't help when the Charmeleon's cocky face changes to one of curiosity, and he looks down to inspect what was poking at his own sheath. The vile lizard looks back to your eyes with a wicked smile and cups the back of your head with one claw. He then pulls your face up against his bare chest, causing you to gag on his growing musk. He locks eyes with you as he begins to hump his growing arousal up the length of your hardening member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is soon rubbing your fully erect cock with his own steamy piece. Each dry hump against your pokehood elicits another moan or inaudible word. His purple gaze consumes you completely, not letting you look away or close your eyes. You know he has you and that thought is driven home every time his generous ball sack slaps against yours. He begins to grunt after each thrust and picks up the pace as he grinds his member against yours. Large amounts of his pre pour onto both your cock and his, allowing his endeavors to double. It is then that he releases your head and plants both his hands on your bum, pulling you tight against his quivering rod. Both your heads are thrown back by the force of his final thrust and his explosive orgasm splatters against the combined wall of flesh. So forceful is his climax that you even see a few of his cum shots get through the press of your bodies only to rain back down onto your exposed faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA growl of satisfaction (thirty seconds later) indicates that his flood has ended and you are dropped onto your back, panting hard. You, unable to achieve your own climax, shake there on the ground. The feeling of being pent-up and the sheer exhaustion of the abuse you've suffer have you reeling on the edge of consciousness. You barely even feel the maw of your captor sucking on your feet. Running his tongue all over your soles, he coats them with drool before gulping them into his throat. A cold breeze shocks you out of your daze as your calves enter his slimy gullet. Your meek attempt at resistance doubles as your legs enter his mouth. All thoughts of freedom are dashed, however, when he reaches your unsatisfied crotch. As your heart flutters, his slimy length teases your shaft with long and slow laps. He gets the whole of your pelvis in his mouth and clamps down, trapping you inside. There, your are assaulted with quick and rough tongue licks across your sack and anal hole. It's not long at all before your coat the inside of his muzzle with your thick seed. The orgasm is the last bit of stress you can take as your vision fades and your mind passes into unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----l----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Charmeleon creases his lips into a smug smile as the Sneasel goes limp in his maw. He wastes no time in gulping down the chest, shoulders, and finally, head of his victim. With one last great gulp, he sends the smaller pokemon into his stomach to digest. With his tongue, he laps up the last of his meal's flavor and cum. He then rises and looks out onto the field of orange and yellow, nodding his approval. Murring in delight, the lizard leaves the blazing field to find a soft place to relax for the rest of the evening.</span></div></div>",

Knowing you're out of time to decide, you take a sharp right and head into the thickest grouping of oak's you can find. The sinister grunting of the charmeleon behind you only spurs you on harder and faster toward a large tree. Just feet before slaming head first into the trunk, you cord your legs tight and propel yourself up the side of the tree. You make it just two steps up the base before you hear a loud crack against the trunk. The pained cry gives you a brief moment of satisfaction as your momentum from the leap fades away and your forced to cling to the bark. You scramble your way up into the darkened branches just a burst of flame lights up the trunk of the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nervous glace downward, a sigh of relief escapes you as your gleam a barely conscious charmeleon laid low and groaning. You realize that the supposed fire attack was actually an involuntary reaction to his big empty head hitting the wood. \"Live and let live, friend...\", You mumble sarcastically. Without wasting another moment, you steal away into the twilight dawn, leaping through the branches and leaves as the sun peaks over the hills...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Live and let live...</i></span></div></div>",

Despite your earliest teaching of such, you've always show a distain for conflict. You would even go on to begin living off of berries and fruits found among the branches. This noble lifestyle choice was, however, displeasing to your parents and peers. It was commonly known that your kind were predators and would even steal the eggs of other pokemon to serve as nourishment. The thought of such an act would turn your stomach and you were constantly ridiculed for your apparent weakness. It was this torment and a desire to prove your life choice valid that drove you to perfect your hand to claw fighting and eventually best the fiercest warriors of your village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it was this defiance and your \"Lack of respect for the old ways\" that gave rise to mobs demanding your exile. The moment you knew you were no longer welcome in your forest town was when your parents openly disowned you. It was that night that you set out alone, pack in hand and not a tear in your eye, as you left behind all you had ever known. As it turned out, there were far better things in life than that which you had been taught during your youngling years. While you have yet to work up the courage to resume life within another collective, your brief dealings with new and interesting breeds of pokemon has reaffirmed your decision to leave what you once called home. It was nearly a year after you had left your forest that a strange anonymity began cropping up. You tried to keep intact with worldly events as best as you could while still remaining somewhat concealed from the rest of the land. From what little you heard, it seemed as though some pokemon, mad with a new form of disease had become raging cannibals. While such an act was not unheard of, the reports became more scarce and soon stopped all together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are not sure what drew you back to your home forest. Perhaps a small bit of hope remained that at least a few had learned from your example. However, any hope you may have had was dash upon entering the smoldering ruins of what was once known as Yelsdin, home of the Sneasel. Your tearful search left more questions unanswered then when you had started. No bodies remained for you to find which gave you hope that some had escaped, at least until you found packs left empty, and traveling cloaks left on their hooks. You would soon come to learn of the infection first hand when you watched a purple eyed Garchomp devour a screaming Torchick female. It took all your strength to not throw yourself at the beast as it lumbered away from the bushes in which you lay hidden. You would later come to realize that your inaction may have saved you that day as your own recent run in with the infected Charmeleon taught you that these mindless savages were bolstered with strength far surpassing normal limitations. Had you blindly charged in that day, you may very well have joined that poor female in the feral's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just 2 days later that you vowed to find the cause of the deadly infection and put an end to the pain and suffering its presence has wrought. So it was that you, Kale the somewhat timid Sneasel, age 19, set out on your journey to end the madness that had so engulfed the world.</i></span></div></div>",

While you enjoy the sunrise, the light slightly stings your naturally nocturnal eyes. After letting your teary gaze fall from the now fully visible sun, you begin your decent from the branchs of an aged oak that served as your resting place. You let out a sigh of relief as your graceful dismount end with your feet planted firmly beneath you. As you stretch the sleep from your joints, you think on how good it freel to have a full nights rest. As fun as narrowly escaping the insides of infected is, you must admit that an energizing rest still takes the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the morning fast departing, you finish your meal of roots and dew water ( a meal, unsatisfying even by your standards...) and begin your walk against the sun. Having been traveling east since your encounter, you hope to find out more about the infection from the coastal villages. You reason that those town, protected by water, may have the most likely chance of survivors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Safety...\", you mutter aloud, \"Is there such a thing in this world of uncertainty?\" Untimely death was not so an uncommon thing even before the plague. You think back to your own harsh upbringing, remembering when you were forced to watch as your own kin ambushed and murdered a Fearow couple. When told to feed on the un-hatched eggs left orphaned, your so-called parents flew into a rage at your refusal. Their punishment was nothing compared to the memory of the merciless slaugther you bared witness to. Were the others that had been raised the same? Were there more pokemon with bright futures dashed by the dark traditions of their peers? With your less than encouraging thoughts swirling inside, you push on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs midday came and went without a problem, you decide to get your bearings and then pause for a quick rest. Wasting no time, your nimble fingers latch onto the bark of a nearby evergreen and you bound up the tree. Dispite your feelings towards your homeland, you were thankful that your people had so valued the art of climbing. You never knew a joy greater than that of leaping from bough to branch. Feeling the air whip past your face, the gentle touch of leaves as your flew past, the firm grip provided by the bark under the flesh of your hands and soles of your feet... It was amazing. It was what you believed flying must feel like for the avians of the world. You let your light expression fade back into seriousness as you reach the highest branch that can still support your weight. You look out into the sea of nature and just barely make out the treeline far to your east.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost there... About another full day's run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith renewed vigor, you half run half drop down the side of the tree. Dodging branches and knots on your way down, you snap your legs against the wood just before smashing into the ground. Going into a hard roll, you sustain some cuts and a bruise, both of which do little to sour your newfound optimism. With your heart pumping from the controlled fall, your dart about your chosen campsite, looking for both signs of life and bits of nourishment. Before long, you are carrying a few rolled leaves with berries your good fortune allowed you to stumble upon. You relax with your snack in one of the holds upon the evergreen, unaware of the eyes watching you from one of the higher limbs...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You nibble on your berries as you settle back into the tree's rough embrace. One leg swaying lazily off the side of the branch, hanging in the slight afternoon breeze, you sigh in contentment as you finish the last of your treat. As the warm air rocks your swinging leg and dances through your fur, you begin to let your eyes droop. With the promise of rest fast approaching, you yawn once and release the leaf that served as your plate slip from your grasp and float down to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really shouldn't waste food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah!\" is all you can manage as your eyes shoot open and you try (unsuccessfully) to stumble to your feet. After a few moments you are able you jump away from the direction of the voice, spinning in the air to face the source. With fists raised and your heart beating like a drum, your narrowed eyes fall upon the form of a slim Treecko, his arms crossed and leaning easily against the tree. His perch is a few branches above your own and if he wanted to, he could close the distance quickly. He makes no move against you, however, and continues to recline against the wood with an amused expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell's the matter with you?!\", you blurt out as anger replaces your shock. The geeko chuckles to himself and waggles his finger. \"Now, now. No need for hysterics.\", he calmly replies. Something about his tone irritates you. It's almost as if you are being scolded as would a naive child. He remains at ease against the tree, simply watching the various emotions that cross your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\", you ask impatiently. \"Well, what?\", The ever smirking grass-type replies. You've had just about enough of this geeko's attitude. \"You know damn well what!\", you snap back. \"Why did you sneak up on me? What do you want?\". The Treecko puts on an obviously false air of ingnorance at your questioning. \"What ever do you mean, dear Sneasal? I simply wished for some conversation with a pokemon capable of more than growls and drooling.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes narrow, \"That doesn't explain why you were sneaking about.\" The geeko lets out another annoying laugh and replies, \"Sneaking? I thought I had made my approach rather known. Perhaps it is you who should learn to be more wary of your surroundings.\" An innocent smile plays across his face, further infuriating you. You decide to let the insult pass, instead saying, \"If you have nothing else to add, I'd suggest you leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wry smile is widening on the grass-type's face when he remarks. \"No need to shroud your embarrassment with faux anger, Hon. We all make mistakes now and again.\" You feel the heat in your cheeks building. True, you were a bit ashamed that this one was so easily able to avoid your detection (Something your kin prided themselves upon), but his condescending demeanor was really starting to tick you off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait... Did he just call me hon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, stranger\", You start, \"I have no desire to talk. I'm tired and have alot of traveling to do.\" The Treecko displays, as far as you can tell, the first sign of true emotion since your encounter began. With a disappointed sigh, he responds, \"Pity...\", before turning to leave. It is now that you notice what he has been twirling in his fingers during the conversation. The puffy purple flower dances in the afternoon breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" You ask without thinking. The geecko turns curiously, following your gaze to his flower. \"This?\", He asks, \"It's just a thistle. Rather common for these parts.\" He finishes by bringing the stem up to his lips and placing it between them, nibbling on the green shoot, with the the flower bobbing up and down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh...\", you stammer, \"Thanks...\" He gives you a polite nod and leaps down from limb to limb before lightly landing on the forest floor. He waves without looking back as he heads into the woods, flower still in place. You blink slowly, taking it all in. \"He's certainly an odd one.\", you whisper to yourself. With that, you decide you have wasted enough time aldready, settling in for a quick nap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, you awake with renewed vigor and collect your things before setting out east once more. </span></div></div>",

To stave off the mounting boredom, you skitter up a tree every so often to verify your location and check your progress. Noting the distance of the nearing coastline, you are able to make an educated guess at when you will be within sight of the sea-side village. Judging by your progress that day, you assume the forest will begin to thin around noon tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if I can keep this pace.\" You remind yourself. \"Haste makes waste, after all\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you think on the simple statement, a morbid grin creases your face as you realize how true the proverb is in your current situation. You shake the dreary thought from your mind as you begin your jog once more, promising yourself that you will not sacrifice your alertness for promptness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother hour crept by as you lightly padded your way along the forest floor, making a few stops to examine your surroundings before proceeding. It's not long before the task once again becomes mundane and your mind begins to wander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe afternoon sun's brightness is starting to lose it's brilliance, giving the sky a lazy, orange tint. The rays of light pierce the canopy of trees above, creating a beautiful corridor of golden blades striking the earth. The spectacle is breath taking, even giving you pause to take in the natural wonder. After a few moments of basking in the soothing glow of the failing light, you give one final sigh as you continue on your way, thoughts still lingering on the sight you were just privy to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only it weren't for all the madness...\", You murmur to the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour progress remains undisturbed for the rest of your walk that day. You chuckle to yourself, wondering if it is a gift from the same entity that allowed you that magnificent sight, or if it was just dumb luck. Regardless, you look for a suitable place for rest that night. Remembering the less than peaceful night you previously had, you decide that it is best to keep away from the tree this evening.</span></div></div>",

After a few minutes of \"Interior Decorating\", you have a soft place to lie down for the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light begins to fade and the sun slowly sets in the west. You've just enough time to find a quick snack before bed. The area is plentiful with plantlife and it <br>\r\nisn't long before you track down a few berry bushes. Not being picky, you snatch a few kinds of berries in your palm, and make your way back to your log. You scurry your way into the fallen wood and lay your back against the soft mixed greens just as the last rays of sunlight glimmer out of view, berries in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind begins to die down and drifts into a soft hum through the trees. The insects of the forest strike up their symphony of various buzzes and clicks. Their <br>\r\nsong is one of purity and naturality. It is a fitting lullaby to enjoy your berries too. They are a tad sour, making you involuntarily smack your lips after every <br>\r\nother bite. They are tasty, however, and you continue to munch away at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Crack*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze as the sound of a snapping twig hits your ears. Motionless and very nearly unbreathing, you lie there, all of your senses reaching out for the source <br>\r\nof the noise. Moments pass and heartbeats pound, with nothing but silence closing in. You listen desperately, almost hoping for another snap, another confirmation that you didn't imagine the sound. All you hear is nothingness. That's just it though. No bugs humming their tune, no evening breeze through the leaves, just the ever-deafening void.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sense it. Your instincts are screaming at you to do something. You look past your feet and see nothing but the darkened forest floor through the hole. You could make a run for it. Being certain of any threats and being on even ground is certainly preferable to being trapped. What if whatever is out there hasn't noticed you yet, however? Would it be wise to give away your position if the fight could be avoided completely?</span></div></div>",

You blink away a bead of sweat that has run a little to close to your eye. You barely register the sound of the dew hitting the wood below. A few seconds more and then you hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp inhale. The sound freezes your rapidly beating heart in it's tracks. The in take of air is followed quickly by a quick succession of sniffs and grunts. The unknown creature outside begins to take a few loud, powerful steps around, crunching the dead leaves and twigs under it's heavy footfalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He's tracking me...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the wandering question mark begins to fade after a few long moments and eventually goes silent once more. Giving yourself another minute to release the tensing muscles in your body, you finally let out a sigh of relief. Rubbing your forehead clean of some sweat, you let a small smile crease your face. Thinking you have narrowly avoided another fight, you really are taken by suprise when deafening explosion rocks your natural bunker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision is blurred and your ears are ringing so hard that you nearly pass out. When you are finally able to pull yourself together, you let out a gasp as you see the flames licking at the wood just a foot from your head. The sudden intake of air gives you a friendly reminds of the smoke that's burning your nose and smothering your lungs. You stare through pained, tearing eyes at the headrest of moss you had earlier collected as it goes up almost instantly, pouring smoke into the log and clouding your vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all your senses screaming at you, it's a miracle you are able to recollect the the second entrance to the log at your feet. You scramble to turn yourself in the tight enclosure, scrapping your arms and inadvertently inhaling more of the smoke. The blackness is thick now and you are unable to see a foot infront of your face, let alone your last hope of escape. Your eyes are burning and the lack of fresh air has you chocking hard as you manage to put your head in line with what you hope is still the opening. Panic stricken and tiring fast, you lower your head, shut your eyes, and crawl furiously toward the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one last, desperate kick of your legs, you propel yourself forward into the much desired freedom of the forest. You open your eyes but are puzzled when darkness surrounds you. You try to take a breath of smokeless air, but are only greeted by a dank, musky smell. Your eyes widen in horror when your panic stricken mind is able to put the pieces together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a satisfied moan reverberate around your head, which is lodged tightly into the warm rump of another pokemon. Terrified and disgusted, you attempt to pull away from the pucker. Try as you might, however, the vile thing tenses it's anus around your neck, choking your sapped vitality. When, at last, it feels your weak strikes cease, it growls happily and begins to drag you by your head away from the burning log. You are out of strength and on the verge of passing out from lack of air, so you barely put up a fight as you feel yourself backed into what feels like the trunk of a tree. Your captor continues it's joyful murring as it raises the both of you into a more vertical position, it's buttcheeks now resting on your shoulders. With one more satisfied moan, whatever has you trapped releases the pressure in it's legs and lets gravity drag it's anus over your chest, pinning your arms to your sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feel of more of you entering the behind of this vile creature has you shaking in fear. You mind whirls with images of what the scene must look like from the outside. As you picture it in your mind, you cringe and begin to sob. The hot flesh continues to  consume your body as the rim of the pokemon's musky hole slithers down to take in your stomach, leaving it to sit in your lap. It is only now that you feel a small bulge poking out of your sheath as the rump of your captor grinds against it. It is enough to stop your crying, if only long enough to elict a started yelp when your hips are similarly devoured. With only your legs left outside, you feel the stranger lean onto it's back, pulling the rest of you inside with it's muscled pucker. It's not long before your whole body is inside the fleshy prison. Tired and aching all over, you vision fades as you let out one more pitiful groan before sleep takes you away from your ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----l----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red lizard licked it's lips and rubbed it's now full belly. The small pokemon inside of him rubbed up against his inner walls as his hands played with the bulge. The sensations are enough to awaken it's other hungers, effectively causing his sheath to twitch with need. The Charmeleon murrs as he begins you stoke himself in tune with his own belly massage. Oh yes, the effort it took to track the one that got away was well worth it. Soon to be even more so...</span></div></div>",

You spin on your back with your legs tucked in above your body, wincing at the scrapping your back is receiving due to the rough bark. Each of your movements are measured and carefully executed in the quietest possible manner. That doesn't, however, stop the occasional creak and snap as your fur grinds against the wood, making you flinch at every little noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you are facing the open end of the log. With a silent inhale to steady yourself, you rise as much as the tight quarters allow and angle your shoulders. After one final steadying breath, your legs explode into action and propel you through the hole and out into the nighttime air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would appear as though you made the right choice because just as you pull up from the sprint, you hear a loud combustion directly behind you. As you turn to view the source of the noise, your front gets the full brunt of the intense heat the radiates from the explosion. The log you had been in just second before is completely engulfed in hungry, yellow flames. You force yourself to look away from the blaze and identify the the threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ears are the first to detect your would-be attacker when a somewhat familar growl rumbles in your eardrums. You turn to face the source of the sound and are unsuprised, though very dismayed, to see your old acquaintance from earlier in the week. The Charmeleon has a sinister grin splayed across his face and a nasty looking welt on it's forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bet that charge into that tree hurt.\", you call out to him. While he doesn't seem to comprehend your words, it seems the mere fact that you spoke them causes his grin to vanish. It is quickly replaced with a short sneer before giving way to a fireball. The flame rushes toward you and would have connected had you not expected the attack. You easily strafe to the right, letting the glowing ball smash harmlessly into a boulder beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot willing to lose the advantage, you race toward the red and orange monstrosity, tightening your hands into balled fists. Before the infected can pop off another shot, you close in and swipe at his face with a quick hook. It connects with the thing's jaw and staggers him. Capitalizing on his stunned state, you move in with another swipe, this one a straight armed jab, aiming at his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not quiet sure how it happened, but you feel a great pressure suddenly clamp down on your fist. Coming down off your battle fury, you trail your eyes up the length of your right arm, which now ends just below your elbow, to a very satisfied looking Charmeleon. A wicked grin is displayed proudly upon his crimson face. You recoil in horror and give your trapped arm a furious jerk, trying to dislodge it. This only cause you to yelp in pain and seemly amusing the lizard in process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps the vile creature thinks one good turn deserves another, because he jerks his head back, pulling you forward. As you are thrust toward him, he opens wide his maw and bites down once again, now claiming everything below your shoulder. Panic grips your heart as the Charmeleon runs his tongue up and down your trapped arm. You turn away in disgust and begin to whimper as the feeling of the slimy slab of flesh is rolled around your arm. Soon after the lizard gripped your waist tightly and began to lift you off the ground. Your legs kick frantically and you struggle hard against his hold. It is useless, you know. His strength vastly out-weights your own and it's not long before your eyes are staring down at the slavoring tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour descent begins as your terrified face is shoved into the slimy orifice, quickly followed by your shoulders. With your \"Free\" arm pinned tight to your side, the infected pokemon grabs one of your kicking legs and raises it above his head. With minimal effort, the hungry beast lowers your shaking form deeper into his mouth. You sob and groan as the pressure of the strong throat muscles squeeze you and drag you further down. Your nose passes through a tight opening and you get your first breath of stale air as your head slides into the steamy stomach of the red lizard. Soon after your waist, legs finally, feet follow you inside and you are left completely soaked in the musty smelling liquids. You pitiful murmurs are interrupted by a loud belch from outside. The expulsion of air leaves little left for you, causing your head to sway and your vision grow dark...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----l----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe burp was loud and satisfying for the infected Charmeleon. It's physical comfort was bested only by the morbid sense of accomplishment it now thought of. This stubborn morsel had been the only thing to elude him in quite some time and the proud beast would have none of it. As it felt the last struggles of it's captured prey fade away, it released one last belch and waddled away to find a soft spot to sleep off it's new found meal.</span></div></div>",

The break in the forest is, at best guess, a kilometer or two of high grassland. The blades of grass give off a dark red tint as the setting sun final rays pass through them. You examine the far tree line and note a small gap in the vegetation, likely a stream. You decide that the grass would conceal your form well from prying, purple eyes, and due to the amount of grass, you'd easily be able to hear someone or something approach. With one last glace at the surrounding trees, you make your way to what you believe to be the center of the field for a good night's rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find a cozy little spot in in-between thick patches of the tall grass. The blades are shorter here and, after a few good stomps of your foot, make a soft bed of greenery. Slightly disappointed at going to bed without a meal, you shrug away the empty feeling and settle in for the night. You back hits the makeshift bedding just as the last beams of light pass over the western treeline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky quickly loses it's pinkish hue and night envelopes the land. You are greeted by the explosion of stars you've come to love. Many a lonely night after your exile you were able to briefly forget the pain of solitude and lose yourself in the vast sea up above. They shone no less brilliantly this evening and within moments, your eyes begin to droop. You are soon resting easily, blanketed by the glow of the moon and lulled by the gentle breeze through the grass.</span></div></div>",

After having your ears subjected to the delightful sound for a few moments, your eyes slowly drift open to greet the new day. You sit upright and wipe your dew-stained eyes. A few yawns and a quick stretch later, you are standing amidst the blades of green. Your hand scratches the back of your neck as you scan your surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot much has changed during the night. The trees sway all around you causing the dawn's rays to dance across the grasses. The vegetation bows every so often to the western wind forming a bright glint that travels the length of the field. You smile in appreciation of the picturesque morning view and begin to wander though the field in hopes of finding a small snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of walking through the overgrowth, you come to a small clearing where the grass is only about half a foot long. A small outcropping of rocks dots the center of the clearing. You make your way over to the stones and proceed to examine under and around them. You're in luck as one of the rocks has a few small mushrooms growing around it's base. You pluck one and check the underside of the rim for any signs of lethality. When you are certain it's safe, you drop the treat into your mouth and chew vigorously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're on your third helping when you detect movement off to your left. Almost choking on the bit of 'shroom still in your throat, you turn to face the shifting grass. The blades shake and part for whatever occupies them as it continues to circle you. Whatever it is seems undaunted by the fact that you have spotted it, you figure, because the movements and the sound of crunching grass becomes more erratic. Your sure that it's trying to confuse you with its rapid and unpredictable movements and what's worse, it's working. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCombined with the breezy that already disturbs the blades, the quickening pace of the unknown creatures motions have you doubting your eyes. You are becoming more and more unsure that you have a lock on it as the grass all around you seems to dance with a mind of it's own. You turn in circles, desperately trying to locate the source of all the activity, fear making a home in your gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are totally unprepared for the sudden, bone rattling hit from behind which causes you to fall forward in a daze. Blood pumping and ears pounding, you get all four of your limbs under you in an attempt to get back to your feet. While you succeed in getting your hands below you, before you have time to rise another great blow flattens you back into the grass. All of the air in your lungs is expelled with a great \"Ooph!\" as you feel a large pressure pinned you to the earth. You turn your head and shiver as you make out the form of a toned Linoone with fierce, pale eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fearsome raccoon-like pokemon grins wickedly down at your terrified face, making you struggle all the harder under his large foot. Whatever strength you had left after the tackle is stole when the infected shifts his weight onto the foot pinning you. The pain from the motion has you wheezing hard and fighting to get air back in your body. When the sleek, brightly colored pokemon sees your resistance fade, he gives you another creepy smile and lifts his foot from your back. You have no time to act though, as the foot is then deposited directly over the side of your face, now pinning your head to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your view blocked by the soft two clawed paw, you hear what sounds like a chuckle from above as you are forced to take in the earthy sense that assaults your nose. The smell isn't completely disgusting, however, making you be somewhat glad for that. You are forced to shut your eyes when the footpaw begins to rub over your head, accompanied by a satisfied growl from your captor. You groan from the added pressure and humiliation of having your face used as a dirtmat. The sole grinds over your forehead and your nose is roughly played with by the heel. You can't explain it, but something about being used stirred something inside you. Was it fear... Or excitement?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't have long to contemplate the thought as the infect soon tires from his game and raises the clawed foot from your head. You stare up in fear at his face as he begins to lick his lips. Beaten and shivering with dread, you make no move to resist as he begins to lick your own two feet. His tongue dances around your toes and against the ball of each foot. The sensation steals a gasp from your mouth and causes those feels to return. You blush hard as your feet are taken in deeper and held in the raccoons warm maw as he continues to bathe your paws in his gooey saliva. Through deep, gasping breaths, you notice a tightness in your sheath. Horrified and excited by the reaction, you hardly notice as the black lips of the mindless beast begin to creep up your legs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----l----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter one final, pleasureful gulp, the now very full Linoone plops down on his behind to savor the taste of it's early morning meal. Resting against one of the smoother rocks, the infected pokemon lets a satisfied belch escape it's lips. The sound echos a bit from the natural acoustics of the enclosed grassland. The struggles, if that was indeed what they were, die down after a couple of minutes, signaling to the happy raccoon that he could settle in for a quick nap as the sun rises. It's last clear thought before resting was how delightful it is when his prey didn't resist.</span></div></div>",

A sudden chill makes you shiver on the moist grass. You groggily shake yourself awake to face whatever is causing this odd feeling. You begin to feel how drenched your fur is and this gives you a little cause to panic. Shaking your head quickly, you manage to escape the cob-webs of slumber and begin to understand your situation. Your eyes go wide when they finally focus on your surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, hell\", You mutter as you scramble to your feet. With the morning came a light rain that has both darkened the sky and soaked your fur. With a disgusted look on your face, you look to the east for the nearest entrance to the forest. With an angry grunt, you start your trek through the rain swelled muck and the dripping tall grass. The feeling of the collecting muck on your feet and legs only serves to put you in a fouler mood as it slows your progress and makes each step just a bit more difficult. After almost slipping and landing on your face a few times, you finally break through the wall of tallgrass and dash headlong into the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rain is still dripping all around you despite the heavy canopy above. Atleast the forest floor is a bit more solid than that of the field, making your run easier as the mud begins too fall from you in clumps. You continue to move through the trees as the sky grows darker. Remembering how close the coastline looked the previous day, you know it shouldn't take long to reach it. You doubt that you'd have time to prepare any real shelter for the coming storm so you double your pace and bolt through the underbrush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout thirty minutes later, you are soaked and tired from the extended run. Clouds no longer dot the sky but consume it fully. Knowing you have little time before the bulk of the storm hits, you are overjoyed when you see the end of the treeline just a couple hundred meters infront of you. It's not long before you burst from the forest into view of the sea. The grass recedes into fine white sands that stretch a hundred meters or so to the waters edge. After a quick scan of the coastline, you thank your lucky stars as you are able to make out huts and wooden piers leading out into the ocean to the north-east. One last heaving breath to fill your lungs has you sprinting toward the village.</span></div></div>",

The water beats hard against your fur and the winds begin to pick up viciously as your sprint through the slickening sands. You are soon reduced to squinting to progress through the worsening storm. Unable to hear anything other than the screaming gusts and the never ending drone of rain droplets on muddy sand, you press forward, desperate to be sheltered from the elements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nearly slip on the smooth wooden planks as your wet, sand caked feet finally reach the boardwalk. The sturdy terrain is only a small comfort as the monsoon-like weather continues to degrade rapidly. You can barely make out your hand infront of your face, let alone the rest of the boardwalk, which forces your pace to slow. With an iritated grunt, you lower your head to the winds and stubbornly move on, your hands extended out infront.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour measured pace gives way, however, as a massive bolt of lighting cracks the soaked planks not 20 feet from you. The impact has you dazed on your back with fear growing in the pit of your stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Enough of this!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou growl angrily as you right yourself. You see no one else on the walkway and decide subtlety has had its moment. When you spot a large shape in the distance, you charge blindly through the rains towards what you hope is the nearest hut's doorway. You leap with your shoulder leveled as you near the structure and grunt as you contact the wood. The door swings open wildly, sending you sprawling to the floor in a rain soaked heap. You shake the stars from your eyes and dash back to the loose door, slamming it shut in defiance of the merciless storm beyond it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your heart on the verge of exploding and heavy pants escaping your mouth, your eyes slip closed and you slide to the ground with your back to the door.

You manage to flex your fingers slowly\u2026. Numbly. What feels like tiny needles begin to work their way from the base of your fingers to your wrists. The sensation continues to tingle as you attempt to move your arms, which you now realize are outstretched above your head. When they don\u2019t respond, you pull harder at the muscles, demanding their obedience. You are just about to give a firm tug when another sensation steals your attention. This one originates from down below your midsection. Confused by the feeling, you are jolted suddenly as it intensifies. It makes you shiver and cringe as it continues its assault. The buzzing begins to become uncomfortable, making you twitch and pull against the darkness, trying to get away from whatever is the source of the feeling. The almost ticklish feeling has pressure building in your chest and soon you are able to withstand no more. With a great intake of air, followed by an awkward cry, the darkness recedes and bright light fills your vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden illumination blinds your weary eyes as they snap open. You blink repeatedly to clear the painful sting and attempt to get a better look at your surroundings. You can feel your wrists bound tight above your head and your ankles in a similar way down below. You gasp again as you feel a slight tickle on the sole of a trapped foot. Once your vision returns to you, you\u2019re greeted with something you that immediately sobers you.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd the invader is awake at last.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice is soft but commanding and definitely female. You gulp as the speaker leans in. She has a cream colored face with deep red eyes. Her muzzle is smooth and short, almost appearing to be an extension of her head. What catches your eye, however, are two long, pink tendrils that originate from her brow and extend quite a bit to curve around her head. Her light complexion, coupled with the rainless afternoon sun, sets her scales agleam like flames sweeping through a wheat field. After a few moments of starring dumbly at her, you realize that she is a rather pretty Milotic. Her nude chest steals your attention next as her generous bust sways as she leans forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhem\u2026\u201d, She clears her throat to focus your wandering eyes.

A moment later, without warning, she gives your left foot\u2019s heel a gentle pinch.

After a few steadying breaths, you pull yourself upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hut is moderately sized and can easily fit three or four 'mons comfortably. Its walls are sparsely furnished with various shelves and hangings. You take a few steps into the hobble and let your eyes wander. The roof, while supported by a few center beams, leaks continuously. The runoff, however, seeps through the openings in the plank flooring, which you now realize rests only a foot or two above the ocean's waves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The residents must have forgone safety to make their homes more pleasing to the eye...<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nAs you shake your head at the ridiculous building location, a smile creases your face. You think of the irony that is you, a pokemon that comes from a village in which more than half of the buildings were hung in the trees, mocking the construction of others. You chuckle at your own thoughts and shrug. The motion reminds you of the stress you've endured from the journey. Your muscles ache and your heart feels like someone is squeezing it with an iron gauntlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver beams of light emanates from one of the windows and cast their illumination across a simple pile of blankets in the far corner of hut. Without a second thought, you plod your messy feet over to the edge of the inviting bed and collapse into a heap atop it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the aching in your body and the exhaustion in you mind, you almost didn't hear the startled grunt as your body hit the sheets. Almost...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinct over rules your fatigue and you plant your hands in the blankets in an attempt to push yourself to your feet. You nearly right yourself before a large white tail smacks you in the chest. Your less than firm balance, coupled with your still slick feet, sends you sprawling to the floor, wheezing for air. As you grasp your bruised chest, you get your first look at your foe as it... As SHE, emerges from the pile of cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sleek, yet powerful form dwarfs you easily. You can make out two smooth tusks budding from her mouth. The moonlight makes her glossy coat shimmer. The light fur of her belly grows fine as it reaches her pert breasts which bounce gently in rhythm with her breathing. Your eyes meet with the female Dewgong's and the pale, thoughtless gaze sobers you. You try as best you can to fight back the pain and the weariness, commanding your legs to rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing your movement, the powerful Dewgong charges your prone form with an excited bark. You barely make it you your feet before she plows into your battered form. You feel her muscled arms, toned from years of swimming, wrap around your torso, pinning your limbs in a great hug, just before having your head slammed into the wall. Through all the ensuing pain and sickness, you some how manage to stay conscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou regain what's left of your wits after a few moments and open your eyes. At least, you think you do. Darkness closes in from every side. Did the hit to your skull affect your vision?! You discover another problem when you feel your legs dangling in the air above the floor. You try to shake your head to clear the darkness from your eyes only to feel the warmth that surrounds your head increase, accompanied by what sounds like a low chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the darkness begins to recede and as your eyes adjust to the new light, you are greeted to a mischievous smile peeking out above two large, white mounds. It is then you realize that your face is smooshed between the female's voluptuous breasts. Unable to move, let alone struggle against her grip, you whimper helplessly as the globes descend upon your face once more. Pinned to the wall, locked in the tight embrace, you are forced to endure the lewd violation. The infected seal girl delights in rubbing her tits in your face and squeezing you between them. She growls provocatively as her D-cups bounce wildly whilst taking your head along for the ride. It's not long before her prompting receives a reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp suddenly and the feral pokemon freezes as she feels a slight prodding against her right thigh. She frees you from her 'booby trap' just enough to see her expression. You blush brightly, embarrassed to have let your resistance fall to her perverse attack.

The infected's intentions are revealed when the dominating female leans forward to press her soft belly against your trapped form. Her muscular stomach engulfs most of your upper body, further pinning you to the wall. Your heart sinks as you discover just where the grumbling sound is coming from. Her plushy tummy vibrates all around you and its hunger is appearant, nearly deafening you with each growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attention is stolen by another sound, one of smacking lips. You strain hard to angle your neck back against the mounts of chest. With a great deal of effort, your head finally pops free of her bust, only to be covered by a fleshy pink tongue. Your captor wastes little time in lathering your exposed face with her warm saliva. Pinned to the wall with her toned bulk pressed against your quivering body, you are helpless against the onslaught of slick flesh and steamy breath. She works over your cheeks, playfully lapping at the faint blush marks burning through your fur. Moving higher, she forces you to shut your eyes against her assault as the slimy appendage rubs across your closed eye lids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe abuse stops suddenly and your pitiful whining is silenced with a deeply satisfied moan which makes your eardrums vibrate. You flinch, waiting for the mindless beast to end your torment. When you at last work up the courage to open your eyes, you immediately wish you hadn't. Your gaze is met with a deep drooling maw. Her tongue dances just inches from your face, teasing you with ever pass. Satisfied with your fearful expression, she begins to lower her maw about your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, the tongue gently cups your chin, massaging the underside. Eventually, the saliva coated probe works its way down towards your neck, licking at your trembling adam's apple. It sways slowly, almost sensually across your throat, eliciting a small moan. You surprise yourself with the reaction and your counterpart seems to catch the hint of lust in your tone. The pressure on your chest lessens and you feel yourself slipping down towards the floor, all whilst still wrapped tightly by muscled arm and dripping maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour legs wobble a bit when you feel your feet contact the floor and you are once again supporting your own weight. The feral woman breathes warmly as she continues to bring her mouth lower, stealing the light around you. At the air grows hotter and thicker, you begin to pant, although you are unsure if it is due to the location of your nose, or the undeniable arousal mounting below. Despite your fears, despite your pain, part of you enjoys the abuse. The slow, gentle motions of your foe, the pressure and warmth of the hold, the sense of utter helplessness... It shamed you to admit it, but these things made you hot... And she knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sucking the rest of your head inside to fit rather comfortable in her now bulgling cheeks loosened her hold on your torso, letting your arms slip free. It was pointless, though. They hung limp at your sides, reason overruled by the ever growing heat between your legs. You down even twitch when you feel one of her strong hands grasp yours and begin to lift it, palm up, towards her hanging breast. Another small groan escapes your encompassed head when you feel her cup her soft mount with your hand. She squeezes gently, encouraging you to play with it. You need no further instruction as your hand begins to mold and massage the underside of the tit. Her satisfaction is complete when you reach your other hand up you fondle the other on your own accord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer moans of pleasure echo all around you now. The noise is deafening but not undesirable in the least. So entranced are you, that you barely feel her hands grip your buttocks and begin to lower her maw once more. It's not long before your shoulders are locked in her mouth with your head firmly pushing against her gaping throat. Your fears, however, are secondary to the wonderful sounds your massage is producing. The pleased gasps and moans sound like the perfect lullaby to your tired mind. The powerful gullet pulls your face into it, massaging your cheeks and forcing more of you into the lovely creature. Eventually, your hands are unable to reach the lovely lumps of womanly flesh as they are pinned to your sides as you continue your trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the outside, one would see the infected seal woman kneeling with you engulfed down to your hips by her jaws. You don't even resist as she leans back and your feet leave the ground once more. You slide deeper and deeper until the Dewgong grasps your legs, halting your advance. Curious as to way the beautiful song has stopped, you wiggle a bit in her gullet. Your motions cease with a grunt when you feel her tongue begin to dance across the underside of your erect cock. Your moans of lust reverberate in the tight throat as your cock and balls are bathed in warm saliva. The sudden attention and the previous teasing overwhelm you quickly and you stiffen and spill your seed in the Dewgongs maw. Your panting becomes heavy after the orgasm with with so little to be found in the throat of the Dominating female, you pass out with you legs still danging from her lips...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----l----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a content sign and a quiet belch. The infected Dewgong licks her lips of any trace of the noon snack. She rubs her engorged belly and the slumbering Sneasel within, a grin apon her face. She reaches up to touch her bust where the little male had oddly seemed excited to play with. Remembering his warm and gentle touch, she patted her stomach in some sort of thanks and she made her way back to the pile of blankets. The whole ordeal had aroused her quite a bit and she was eager sate another kind of hunger...</span></div></div>",

You swallow hard as you recognize the look the purple eyed female was casting upon you. Her maw opens slightly and her dampened tongue slides between her lips and you recoil as it approaches your face. You gasp as the slickened flesh traces a line from your chin, across your left cheek, and ends just below your eye. Thoughts of being eaten flood your mind and shutting your eyes to your predicament is all you can do. The following saliva bath you were expecting never comes, however. You dare steal a peek through one eye and what you see confuses you even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feral has made no move aside from the initial slurp and is waiting with a coy expression for you to face her. Seeing no other option, you slowly open your eyes and rise your face to meet hers. Her smile widens when you meet her stare and a low growl rumbles from deep within her chest. You whimper in fear as her body presses more fully against your own, bringing her face just a few inches from yours. Her grin with those pointy tusks make you shiver as the terror mounts in your heart. Worst of all are the eyes; those massive purple orbs that almost seem to glow in the darkened hut...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fear sends you struggling wildly, and pointlessly, against her iron grip in one last attempt to free yourself. The water-type looks at you with a quizzical expression before the intimidating grin returns as a thought crosses her usually empty mind. Your flailing hips are pinned tight against the wood as her own thrusts forward. You are about to kick at her shins with your last free limb when you feel it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer legs come together slowly but firmly, trapping your semi-erect penis between her upper thighs. The sudden sensation in your nethers causes you to gasp aloud and cease your struggles. When you look up at her once more, she wears a lustful visage with her eyes little more than slits and the tip of her tongue running over her lips. Her face is hot with desire and she lets you know just what her plans for you are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout the slightest warning, the infected Dewgong shifts her weight from her left foot to the right, squishing your member between her toned thighs. You shut your eyes and release a surprised grunt. The imposing temptress must have enjoyed your reaction because she slowly begins to pivot from her right to her left foot, stealing another gasp from you. She continues to shift her stance, starting a slow rhythm of grinding her leg muscle against your hardening cock. Moans begin to flow from your maw as the feral continues to rub your manhood left and right alternatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you feel her legs spread to let your rock hard member hang in the cool air. You open your eyes just in time to catch your captor offer what looks like a wink before she smashed her legs back together on your exposed rod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Ahhh!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden sensation, pain, and heat cause you to howl in ecstasy. Seeing you open mouth, the Dewgong wastes no time in leaning in and planting her lips against yours for a passionate kiss. All you can do is moan as her delicate tongue glides across and around your own. The mix of blissful sensations have you going limp in her arms, exactly as she had hoped for. You don't even register the wall against your back begin to depart as the seductive seal cups your head in one of her hands, locking your mouth with hers. With that gesture, she begins to carry you over to the blankets, all while her thighs still grinding against you with each step...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she reaches the makeshift bedding, she turns so that her back is facing the cloth. After one final invasion of her tongue, she sets you down. The feeling of floor beneath you was a sobering moment and even with your lust filled mind, you manage to slip out of her gentle grasp. Expecting some resistance, the infected woman stops your retreat before it ever starts as her tail shoots through her legs, between your own, and delivers a firm swat on your rump. The sting of the hit makes you instinctively hop forward, right into her waiting arms. With a smirk, as if to mock your attempt, she throws herself backward onto the sheets, pulling you along with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both land softly; her with her back on the cozy bedding, and you with your face stuck once more between her breasts. One arm wraps around the back of your head, securing your face. You burn with embarrassment to once again be caught within her bountiful bust before you feel her legs wrap around your torso and squeeze tight. Another moan bursts forth from your lips as her other hand reaches down and grasps your twitching cock, lining it up with her feminine folds. She was going to have you, willing or otherwise...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour reluctance to 'drive it home' is met with another firm smack of her tail, leaving a bright mark on your tush, and causing your hips to plow forward. The warmth and tightness of her womanhood makes you cry out in utter bliss. Your damp rump aches from the bite of her tail and you look past her chest to see her smiling right back at you. Apparently, your stare lasts a bit too long because you soon hear a grunt, followed by another harsh slap across your backside. The painful reminder lets you know who's in charge as you slowly will your hips to begin thrusting into her depths...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few awkward moments trying to sync up your thrusts, the both of you are soon bucking in unison. Moans and heavy panting fill the air, nearly drowning out the rain beyond the hut's walls. You obediently propel your meat into her, not wanting to feel the bite of her tail again, when you notice her free hand begin to fondle one of her breasts. Despite your obvious peril, you must admit that they are beautiful. Your actions surprise you as one of your hands slip up her heaving side and gingerly rub against the underside of the mound. Her curious eyes meet your timid ones and for a moment, you expect another swat for the offense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe, however, smiles provocatively at your gesture and grasps your wrist, placing your hang on top of her bouncing teet. Your fingers probe into the malleable flesh and you both moan together. Desire replaces any reason left in your tired mind and you summon the last of your energy to ram your pounding rod deeper and deeper into the feral. Her breathing becomes harsh and is broken up by growls of lust; the sounds only serving to urge you on. After a few more solid pumps, you plunge deep within her and scream out. Just before you release your seed, you feel her folds clamp down on your member as she adds her own voice to the wild melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you both come down from your respective highs, you collapse across her trembling belly, panting hard. The last of your willpower has faded and your body refuses to heed any calls. You lie there atop the recovering Dewgong, and barely flinch when an arm is draped about your shoulders. With no more resistance in your muscles, you close your eyes and await the inevitable. Your final conscious thought is one of acceptance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are worse ways to die...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----l----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe well-rested water-type awoke some time later and stretched her aching muscles upon the blankets. She laid there for a moment to wipe the wariness from her eyes before sitting up. The bulge in her midsection gave her pleasant, though brief, memories of her encounter with the smaller male. The Dewgong smiled as she stroked the lump that was the remains of the Sneasel dissolving within her womb. The male had given her a truly wonderful orgasm just a few hours ago. A grin widened on her face as she thought of the next one he would provide her...</span></div></div>",

You bring a paw up to wipe away the drop as you look upwards just intime to catch another drop of drool on your muzzle. Your eyes go wide as you stare into the purple gaze of an obviously hungry Treecko. You bolt upright as the feral pounces, just barely avoiding his slobbering maw. He crashes into the bark where you just were a moment ago and growls as he regains his footing. You put ground between the both of you as he struggles to rise, putting your back to the open air. You chance a look downward and gauge that while the fall isn't deadly, it will most certainly tip the odds against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith nowhere to run, you raise both your hands infront of your chest and ball them, determined to make this grass-type earn his meal. The infected looks at your posture and lunges with abandon at you, appearently accepting the challenge. With amazing speed and dexterity, the crazed gecko spins itself just before slamming into you, opting to swipe its large tail at you. You smack the tail aside and press the attack before it can recover. With a snarl of your own, you throw your left fist at him directly, hoping to keep him off balance as you prepare your right hook. Your gamble pays off as he is unable to react in time. Your punch catches him hard in the cheek, stealing a cry of pain. You kick out with one foot and land the blow just above his stomach. With his sternum bruised, he wheezes and stumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts of victory are interrupted as you see the Treecko's foot slip from the branch causing him to pitch out sending his into a plummet towards the ground. Cursing as you go, you dive after him and attempt to keep his head from smashing into the dirt below. The landing is messy for both of you and while you were able to escape serious injury, it's all you can do to stave of the blackness dancing around the edge of your vision. You wonder what caused you to try and save the infected. You have no doubt that the creature would never even think of doing the same for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour pained thoughts are forced to the back of your mind as you hear the grass-type stir to your right. With your bones aching and your head pounding, you are just able to force yourself to your knees before the infected is once again walking toward you. Panting hard and mentally screaming at your muscles to respond, you just manage to sway back and forth before the ever closing gecko. You flinch as it's soft hand cups your chin, draw your gaze up to his own. Your heart sinking and your body going limp in his grasp, you know your decision to play the hero has cost you dearly. Even through this admition of defeat, you are still able to notice that this infected is not gloating in victory or even smiling. He procceds to glance between you and the place where the both of you landed, seemingly piecing together what you had done. Finally, he kneels along with you, staring deeply into your eyes, deciding your fate.</span></div></div>",

Just as this begins to give you hope, the Treecko seems to make up it's mind and its predatory grin returns. Any hopes you may have clinged to earlier vanish when your vision is envelpoed by a wall of pink flesh. You shiver violently as the geeko wraps you in a tight hug and licks at your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>N-nggh! No...!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour whimpering only spurs on the tounge crazy infected. He quickens his pace, running the wet flesh across your muzzle, over your shut eyes, even invading your mouth once. The pale-eyed Treecko murrs through all of it, throughly enjoying your flavor. Tears start to build up in you as you realize your helplessness. Your body submits as it is assulted with saliva and your mind soon follows suit. There is no way out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter one last agonizingly slow lap across your muzzle, the infects places his hands on your shoulders and opens his maw wide. You dare to open a single eye to state at your doom. The pink, fleshy walls that make-up his gaping mouth are dripping with warm liquid. The creature exhales into your face, draping you in his hot, musky breath, and for just a moment, you feel a tinge of excitement. It fades quickly when your head is suddenly engulfed by the slimy walls. Your vision is blackened as you shut your eyes tight as you await the inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vibrasions of the geeko's moaning on at your flavor, oddly enough, brings you some comfort during your decent. The rubbery tissue massages your head as your shoulders and chest are pulled in. The Treecko's tounge is still working over your chest and stomach as it slips pass, making you wiggle from the sensation. While the feeling is not unpleasant, you still have fear pounding in your heart. Your whimpers echo all around you as your head enters the Treecko's steamy gut. Feeling this, your captor lifts the lower half of your body off the ground and tilts his head skyward. Strong gulps combined with gravity have your legs, feet, and eventually tail meeting with the rest of your body in the groaning stomach of the infected grass-type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>T-this is it... Haahhh...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp in the stale air around you, feeling your lungs tighten. The feeling of the Treecko taking a heavy seat shocks your senses as you are thrown about in the cramped belly. Just as your about to let more tears escape, you feel a bulge rubbing against your cheek. Pressed up against the inside of the stomach, you are subjected to the geeko's gentle massage as he lets his hands glide about his massive belly. The pampering is topped with the infecteds purrs, causing reverberations all around you. The soft hum buzzs in your ears, bringing with them an odd sense of calm. The feeling of the gentle massage and the peaceful song is enough to sooth you to into a deep sleep, never to awaken...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----l----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Treecko patted his full belly when at last he felt the dark-type settle. The Sneasel had been one of the most delectable morsels it had eaten in quite some time. With a few licks of its fingers, stealing the last bit of flavor from them, the geeko places its back against the trunk of the tree. With not a thought behind those pale purple eyes, the grass-type settled into a peaceful slumber with its hands grasping at the belly, fast absorbing the young tree cat.</span></div></div>",

After you get a moment to will your heart to start beating again you take in everything about your situation. You are lying there, groaning in pain. You're on your back with the afternoon sun beating down upon your battered form. Your jumbled mind's best guess places you about ten meters from the tree, laying next to a large exposed root. You manage a hapless smirk at the gnarled root, thinking of how you might have ended up, had you hit it. Whatever minuscule amount of relief the thought of avoiding it gave you is dashed as a soft growl shocks you back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Treecko is standing between you and the tree. You try to move your legs, willing them to get under you, but it is all for naught when you feel a joint of pain run up your left leg. Through your grimace, you are able to spot a nasty bruise just above your ankle. Locking your eyes back on the infected, you rub a scrapped paw down the underside of your calf, stopping when you feel a jab. While it doesn't feel broken, you understand that you have almost certainly sprained it in the tumble. Despair sets in as you realize you won't be able to fight or flee from your purple-eyed assailant.The gecko makes no move toward you, however, instead it continues to stare. After a few breathless moments of locking eyes with you, it brakes the encounter and looks upwards to where it had fallen from the branches. It makes a soft, almost puzzled sound as it just stands there, motionless.  You follow his gaze and you begin to understand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Is... Is he?\", </i>your confused mind races. <i>\"Can he remember what I did? Does he understand that I... saved him?\"<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nYou're thoughts are frozen in place when his eyes once again meet with yours. You heart sinks as the green infected lets a grin creep across his face and begins a slow but determined walk that will bring him to you. You do your best to fight through the pain and drag your body back away from the approaching Treecko but it is useless. He gains on you quickly and places a heavy foot over your (Thankfully) uninjured ankle, halting your meager efforts. You hang your head and try to avoid his piercing gaze. You feel a strong grip on your arm as the pressure on your pinned legs is released. You shake with fear, knowing what will come next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are, understandably, quite confused when you feel yourself being dragged to the side. You look up, wide-eyed, to the infected as he roughly guides you to the exposed root you had narrowly dodged earlier. He gently (Well, as gently as a mindless monster can) reclines you against the hard bark and lowers himself to his side next to you. \"W-what are you...\" You stammer with a dumbfounded look on your face. His intense glare effectively silences your meaningless yammering. You sit there, heart pounding in your chest, back against the rough barrier, not daring to provoke the gecko that is now roaming your body with his eyes. You wince when you feel his hands begin to glide across the fur on your chest. Your odd foe lets out a small series of murrs, which you can only describe as laughter. He continues to poke and massage your furred form, dragging his hands across your belly, making sure you tease your belly button before bringing his hand down you squeeze at your hips. The attention to your body has you gasping from both the fear in your heart and the growing curiosity in your mind. Your instincts tell you to bat away this horrid thing and make a desperate attempt at freedom, but something you can't explain hold you back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite you mounting interest, you aren't ready for the sensation of his warm fingers cup your purse. \"Gah...!\", you yelp in surprise, shaking yourself from your dreamlike state. You reaction to the intrusion of your privacy has your own hand pushing back at the foreign digits. \"N-no... Don't do-\", is all you manage before the infected grabs your wrist and pins it hard to the root behind you. His vicious glare sends a chill down your spine and lets you know that there will be no discussion on the matter. You whimper as his hand leaves your wrist and teases it's way back to your forming bulge. You shut your eyes and gasp as his hands play with you. His left hand rolls your balls around in its palm as the other pokes at the tip of your member as it begins to grow. It's that moment when a finger of his right hand slips inside your sheath and begins to rub the underside of your hidden cock, coaxing it out into the open. It's not long before this treatment has you sporting your full member in his palm. You moan uncontrollably as your pre-stained rod is then pumped in his grip. He releases a few low growls that almost sound like giggling as he stares at your blushing face, never slowing his rhythmic tugs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes remain tightly shut as you whimer in his grasp, not even opening when you feel him raise his head, resting his cheek against your shoulder. Pre is now freely flowing from your cock's tip, coating the infected's hand causing it to slide up and down your shaft a little bit quicker and smoother. With the added stimulation and the need for release rising within you, you barely notice as his other hand snakes inbetween your back and the log, letting him pull you closer against him. His happy murrs resonate in your ears, bringing you closer to your edge. His pace quickens with every passing moment, stealing gasps and moans from your lips. As you teeter on the brink of climax, it happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a wet, fleshy feeling start to drag itself up the side of your neck. The long, slow lick coupled with the hot breath against your face is more than you can handle and you let out a cry of ecstasy. Your orgasm hits you like a punch in the gut and it is all you can do to hang on to your senses. The hot strings of jizz hit you hard in the face, impacting to violently that some even splatters onto the Treecko hugging you. With every shot, you arch your back against the root, expelling all of your seed into your fur. Once the spurts finally cease, you are covered from ears to belly in your own genetic material. The throbbing pain in your injured body and the euphoria of the greatest orgasm you can remember is too much for your exhausted mind. The last thing you hear before passing out is a satisfied murr, humming you into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----l----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple-eyed Treecko grins at his latest trophy, slumbering in his arms. After a few moments of gazing and the pretty creature in his grasp, he licks his lips, <br>\r\nstill coated with the flavor of the Sneasal's seed. He begins to lap up the Sneasal's flavor from the unconscious pokemon's face. The gecko happy murrs as his <br>\r\nstomach rumbles with hunger once more. No sense in wasting such a perfectly prepared meal...</span></div></div>",

The charmeleon senses your submission and doubles his efforts to get you inside his body. Quietly sobbing to yourself, you are unsuprised to feel your toes being feed into a tight, moist hole.

Your sense of self-preservation returned ten-fold, not wanting to devoured in such a way. You struggle with all your remaining strength, which only serves to make the lizard moan in ecstasy.

The collision bashes your forehead and you are barely able to retain your consciousness as you tumble backward onto your butt. The hit has you seeing blackspots in your vision, with your arms shaking under the weight of your weakened form. It's only a second later that you feel a soft foot plant firmly on your aching face and push you onto your back. The foot is then plumped lazily on your chest, pinning your less than muscular form to the ground. The Charmeleon huffs in triumph as he looks down at his defeated prey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gahh...\", you croak out groggily. Your head is pounding and your senses are dulled. The lizards toes wiggle on your fuzzy chest, bringing you back to reality. You weakly move your hands to the footpaw holding you down and attempt to remove it. This only serves to amuse the beast as he shifts his weight onto you, squeezing the air from your lungs. You vision becomes hazy and you are forced to cease your resistance. You arms fall back to your sides as tears begin to well up in your eyes as you accept your defeat. Seeing this, the Charmeleon removes his claw from you, though you know it is not an act of mercy. You close your eyes as you feel two scaly hands grip your shoulders and easily hoist your body back upright. You hear menacing growls which sound like wicked laughter, just before you feel a wet lump of flesh drag across your face. You don't need to open your eyes to guess what whats happening, the stench alone makes you shiver. The vile lizard continues to taste you, dripping warm saliva all across your upper body. Eventually he becomes satisfied with his toying and lowers his gaping maw down onto your trembling head. The warm mouth licks at your chest as it enters, soon followed by your waist. You don't even kick, knowing you have no chance in your weakened state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I've failed... I've... Gah!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour self pity is interrupted when you feel the Charmeleons tongue lap at your groin. If you had the room to gasp, you would have. Wet walls of throat flesh block your muzzle. The probing flesh rolls over your balls, tasting an teasing you. It only lasts for a moment, however, as your trip resumes. The throat clamps down and pulls you in deeper. Now with only your legs still visible, the lizard stands up straight and raises your legs high into the air, letting them glide easily into his mouth. The tongue licks at the sensitive soles of your feet, making you cringe. After your digits are throughly washed, your captor closes his mouth and with one final swallow brings the rest of you into his steamy stomach. The air is thick and quickly growing heavy. The slimy walls churn and gurgle against their meal. You feel faint as the minutes tick by and with one final exhale, you pass out, sealing your fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----I----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The infected pokemon sighes with relief, feeling his bulging stomach cease its motions. Licking his lips with satisfation, the lizard currs sleepily as it waddles off to find a nice, warm patch of ground to finish it's meal. It smiles as it remembers the screaming that woke it from its slumber and awakened it's appetite. As the happy infected pads away, it casts a sidelong glance at the simmering field that served as it's foolish prey's final stand.</span></div></div>",

Shasta winced and grinds her fangs together in anger. He retracts back, snickering, \u201cMmmmm\u2026I never thought I would get to be able to devour the legendary Lucara, let alone be able to defeat her. In fact, it was easier than I ever expected! I should be glad that you haven\u2019t even been able to tap into your real power yet for me to defeat you, unless you\u2019re simply that <i>weak</i> anyways. I guess that means I will gain your energy and powers after I digest you, won\u2019t I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-Shut up!\" She tiredly roared. The Lucara writhed in the Houndoom\u2019s grasp, endeavoring to be free, however her injuries sustained her of even trying such an attempt. She could only sit on her knees as the Houndoom continued to lick and taunt her. After another scrape of Shasta\u2019s growling face, the dark type licked up any of his saliva left seeping from his chops and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDown the hatch you go, you legendary meal.\u201d His open jaws came down and stuffed the Lucara\u2019s head inside. His cheeks and slimy tongue suckled on Shasta, murring aloud as she trembled in the thought of being eaten. Gulping down, her neck and shoulders enter, letting the Houndoom lick at her furry breasts. Shasta gasped with a wild blush, furious yet depressed that she was going out in such a way, forcing her to merely wriggle and twitch while the canine\u2019s tongue played with her cleavage. His growls increased as they tuck inside of his mouth, which in turn, force Shasta into a more submissive manner by the feeling of the tongue-tip circle over her nipples hidden under her coat of fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>N-No! I can\u2019t let him win! This cruel pokemon can\u2019t possibly win!</i>\u201d Her thoughts boiled within her head as it plunged down the Houndoom\u2019s throat. Not giving up, she twisted and turned her body as much as possible, but unable to budge anywhere in the very slightest. Next, she attempted to open her maw to spit out fire, however, that plan fails also due to the fact that no room left within the tight sticky tunnel allowed her to open her muzzle. Her muscles went limp, leaving her body simply dangling out of the Houndoom\u2019s mouth. In a defeated tone, Shasta cursed herself. \u201c<i>Oh what\u2019s the point\u2026I can\u2019t even protect myself\u2026How can I possibly protect my friends\u2026?</i>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Houndoom noticed his food\u2019s acceptance, smiling with his full mouth to see his prey surrender. Quickly and efficiently, he finished his job by tilting upward, letting the Lucara\u2019s legs and tails dive into the hot depths of her demise. The Houndoom groped a hand in his large orange belly, kneading through the tight flesh to make it wobble with Shasta trapped inside. The legendary pokemorph curled inside the warm chamber, squirming as the digestive juices began to pool inside up to her shoulders and knees. Shasta unhappily sobbed as she pressed her hands and hindpaws at the thick walls, only to have them retract back by the tough organ. A rippling belch wobbled around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slap to make it slosh about, the Houndoom circled his forepaw over his furry stomach while gloating in his victory, \u201c<i>Aaaahhh</i>! Delicious! I\u2019m glad I decided to eat you. You certainly make a better meal than a mind slave. In fact, I think my master will reward me for my services in taking down such a high acclaimed Lucara. Heh heh.\u201d He gives his fuzzy gut a nice pat after the insulting gloat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the pile of Shasta\u2019s friends, moaning and struggling to move, he snapped his fingers, signaling many infected pokemon to surround the free food stash to capture and devour. The Houndoom joyfully walked back into the forest from whence he came, cradling his Lucara filled belly as she fainted, digesting loudly to pleasure him further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew looked at the psychic image of Shasta\u2019s group being swallowed down by several infected as a Houndoom pads off with her, unconsciously jiggling inside his stomach. Shocked at the sight, she quietly disfigures the image to fade away.  \u201cOh dear, that isn't good at all\u2026She had so much potential.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, growls emitted behind her, and as Mew twisted around, she discovered that multiple infected ferals had cornered her in the cave. She floated against the rock wall as they approached the quivering psychic, licking their lips for a tasty meal that was too scared to put up a fight.</span></div></div>",

She gags at the sight and texture of the muscle, although her fear grows into sheer terror as she watches it to continuously grow larger, to more than a third of the size of the Houndoom himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna be nothing but legendary seed when I\u2019m through with you.\u201d His voice cruelly carried out. Just after his horrifying remark, her muzzle is slid into his urethra, allowing the cock\u2019s head to swallow up Shasta\u2019s entire head! She yelled through the muffling walls of the massive rod, writhing as it encompassed her upper body while it throbbed violently by her presence. The member slid over her rocking hips and pulsed upward more to let her legs and tails to submerge into the pre squirting cock\u2019s tip. Shasta whimpered loudly as her feet disappear from the outside world and out of view. She was left mortified and disappointed that this Houndoom managed to defeat her and her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were so close to bringing Magira back, but to fall just short of the mission by this canine follower of the evil psychic pokemon. She closed her eyes once her body slipped into a tight container filled with Houndoom seed that stretched out to fit her inside. Curled up, the thick cum swirled around her, bubbling a bit as it began to work against her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the outside, the Houndoom fapped loudly and immensely, wanting to quickly digest the legendary he so easily defeated into his frothy semen. His tongue dangled from his grinning open mouth as his eyelids lowered down some. Murring out loud, he bragged, \u201cMrrrrahhh\u2026That\u2019s a good victim for my sac. You\u2019ll make a nice batch of my cum, <i>oh great Lucara</i>. Hee heh hehehehe\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were the last words Shasta would hear as her mind began to black out from the lack of oxygen. She passed out within the thick testicle as it sloshed the seed around her, coating her in the slimy fluid as it began to moisten her body. In the meantime, several infected ferals surrounded the pile of unconscious pokemon, grabbing the Flygon, Latias, and Alakazam to swallow down or pleasure themselves with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew cupped her hands over her mouth as she watched the kinetic image of a Houndoom masturbating madly before roaring out loud, ejaculating strings upon strings of seed of what was once Shasta. The cum-digested remains of the Lucara puddled over the ground, emitting musky steam while the Houndoom simply laughed at the small white pool. \u201cMrrrgh, she was a nice bitch. My master had actually planned for that pesky Alakazam to submit to our power and defeat you herself, but I suppose our order will be pleased to hear that I, a mere messenger, took care of you and your pack. Honestly, you all thought you could stop us?\u201d He chuckled and left the scene as the ferals rubbed their bellies from Shasta\u2019s group finally waking up in the infected\u2019s stomachs, struggling weakly until they digest away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew let the image vanish as she held back tears. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s the end for the Lucara. We can only hope that someone will be able to stop this infection\u2026Yet I highly doubt that by seeing this evil order\u2019s might. I should just surrender to them while I have the chance. Maybe their leader will show mercy on me\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

But lets face it. It was worth a shot to see if you were gullible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Houndoom laughed, pacing around Shasta. \"You certainly are clever... I can see now how you managed to beat my foolish brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuga tried to use a whirlwind to put out the fire, but it was no use. He was stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shasta... Isn't it?\" The shiny Houndoom asked. Shasta nodded, snarling. The Houndoom laughed and smirked at Shasta \"How fortunate that you have evolved into a Dreycara since your last confrontation with my brother. You will make a great slave, Shasta. And your friend will be your first victim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShasta leaped to the side as the Houndoom lunged at her, preparing a Shadow Fang.</span></div></div>",

What if she breaks through the venom of the infection? What then?\" The younger Houndoom argued, and his gaze looked back at the bound Shasta along the pole. \"I think it's safer if we ate her here and now. I mean really brother, who else can possibly pose as a threat to us. Even the legendary Dreycara has failed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShasta snarled at the accusing canine, making sure that her strong fangs showed from the curled lips of her muzzle. The Shiny Houndoom took a moment to think until nodding. \"You do have a point. Alright brother, if we're going to rid this Pokemon once and for all, I shall be the one to swallow her down. You had your chance to take her, though you chose to flee, so you can satisfy that never-ending hunger of yours with the meek Flygon over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger brother scowled at his elder sibling. Yet, his eyes closed and his arms crossed. \"....Fine. But I deserve a taste of that luscious body of hers, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shiny Houndoom grinned and gestured his hand toward Shasta, letting his younger brother walk up to her tied frame with a demented glare in his eyes. Before she could spew out a flamethrower, the Houndoom rapidly sank his teeth into her shoulder, using Thunder Fang to paralyze her body. With a jolt of static coursing through her, she limply sagged down in the rope bindings, finding no possible way for her limbs to react to any of her commands. \"You didn't think I'd just let you sneak an attack on me that easy, did you? Now let's see if you do have a 'legendary flavor' that makes you different from all of the other weaklings I've devoured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis rough tongue slaps against Shasta's thigh, digging into the fur as it glided up along her leg. The Dreycara winced by the texture and slickness of the wet muscle, sickened that she was going down by such a cruel and sneaky creature. The Houndoom began to release a few growls while his mouth worked over Shasta's flat stomach, hips, and up to her own chest, nipping at her breasts. She tensed up, closing her eyes and writhing in her nerves as her taster retreated back finally, licking his chops before exclaiming, \"Mmmm...I certainly won't ever forget that flavor. You will want to savor this one, brother. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I plan to.\" The shiny canine replied as his brother walked over to Ruga. The Flygon was still trapped by the ring of fire, so he flapped and beat his wings to try and whisk it away, however it only seemed to feed the flames to grow even higher!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get you of there Shasta! Just hold on!\" Her partner called out. The black Houndoom grinned and shot a fireball through the ring of heat, catching Ruga by surprise and knocking him out of the fiery circle. Yet, the dragon struggled to push his chest off the ground by his shaking arms from the large smudge mark on his midsection. \"A-Aghh-aggghk...\" He groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young canine paused his walk in front of Ruga, smiling and placing his hands on the bug dragon's shoulders. The younger Houndoom scoffed, \"Your <i>girlfriend</i> is food now, just like you will be for me.\" And with that, Ruga's head was fully stuffed into the Houndoom's jaws, causing his body to throw a wild fritz and shudder in displeasure. His body couldn't escape the dog's grasp now that his arms were pinned by his sides, immobilizing the dragon to simply wait until the Houndoom finishes his weak dinner. Shasta watched from afar, closing her eyes and looking away. Her blood boiled with ire, however her muscles submissively give up under the paralysis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue and orange Houndoom stared at her, using a claw of his to break her rope bindings, seeing that she could barely move as it is. The Dreycara wriggled in distress as she felt the Houndoom's forepaws pull her face up to his as he glared down at her. His tongue glides along the edges of his lips as he retorts, \"Well, your journey ends here, Dreycara. You could've been a valuable asset to our order, although your figure is simply too good to pass up on. But don't worry, your digested remains will unlock unimaginable abilities in me once I've gained your power.\" She sobbed while her face was yanked up closer to his, to the point that his steamy breathe exhaled over her muzzle as he whispered, \"A shame that you were unable to know how to use your power wisely. I'll make sure I won't make your mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like after Ruga had heard a snide comment and was swallowed up, Shasta's world darkened as it entered the wet throbbing depths of the shiny Houndoom's maw. He murred with content joy as the Dreycara's head neatly fitted into his salivating jaws, sliding down into his throat which brought her trembling body closer to her demise. Shasta had been so certain back at Mew's cave that she wasn't going to end up as some dog's food, and now, look where she was. She untapped her final evolution, and that wasn't even powerful enough to stop an infected ring leader. Her chest slid into the expanding maw of the shiny canine, allowing him to savor her plush boobs and upper body. His tongue slithered in between the crease, going back and forth to juggle with her breasts' weight as Shasta's fur collected the webbed strings of his thick drool across them. The heat of his mouth blanketed the Dreycara while she sank deeper inside the Houndoom's neck, forcing her draconic wings to fold against her backside as they trailed inward. The shiny Houndoom began to growl in pleasure, enjoying every moment of the girl's decadent sensation of flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe canine hoists his head back, allowing Shasta's tail bundle and legs to wriggle for the last time outside before they slide down the inclined ramp of the Houndoom's maw. Her tail tips and hindpaws slip past his wet lips, gifting him the joy of closing them shut as the Dreycara squirmed unhappily down his esophagus. Shasta curled up into the stomach, feeling the Houndoom's hands slap around her belly bulge and rub over her restrained form within the tightened stomach walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This...this can't be it! I was supposed to stop the infection! How could I lose to some mutt-case like these Houndooms...I couldn't even protect poor Ruga...</i>\" She thought inside her depressed mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, the shiny Houndoom released a long awaited and satisfied belch, letting his prey sit and conform neatly into his stomach as she moaned through the muffling walls of his orange belly. He massaged the hefty dome, toying with his victim by jiggling her back and forth inside the digesting chamber. Fluids began to pool in, causing the Dreycara to panic even more which allowed her exhaustion to overwhelm her, knocking her out within the liquid-filling organ. A loud gurgle rumbled out, and the canine smiled at his gut. He checked back on his younger sibling, who was almost done slurping down the Flygon's long green tail, puckering his lips afterwards with drool carelessly seeping from his lower jaws. The sibling swallowed his dragon meal down, rounding out a similar orange furry stomach as did his shiny brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older Houndoom chuckled, \"There. Let that teach her how we treat those who wish to stop us from our reign.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger brother walked up to the Shasta-filled tummy, poking his finger at her unconscious body, \"Hmph. Hope you enjoy being in there! You're gonna be a part of my brother as a thin layer of muscles and fat, legendary! She'll look great for your abs.\" He snickered along with his family member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shiny Houndoom started to walk back to his home with his loud, trembling stomach, waving for his brother to follow him, \"Come. After we digest these fools, we must inform the other leaders that we have finally disposed of the Dreycara. I think it is indeed Mew that is helping her, and we must send a pack of ferals towards the mountains from where the Dreycara had come from immediately if we ever want her captured...or...<i>eaten if she resists</i>...\" His younger sibling nodded, stroking his struggling belly as Ruga wailed and thrashed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew had removed the hazy image before she could overhear the Houndooms' conversation. The psychic had long ago dispersed it after watching the last of the Dreycara dwell deep into the shiny canine's mouth and for the Flygon to share her fate. Latina covered her mouth with her hands on the edge of tears as Magira shook her head in quiet disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do now? How can we possibly ever hope to defeat the leaders of the infection now that they devoured Shasta?\" The trembling Latias could barely ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew couldn't look at her as she floated about in woe as she answered, \"We need to stay here until we can come up with another plan. Although, I'm not sure we can ever find someone as strong as Shasta was to save us. The infected ferals shouldn't find us here in the meantime.\" Little did the psychic know that there was a horde of the purple-eyed ferals climbing up the mountains, searching for only other psychic to join their ranks or perish with the other victims of the infection.</span></div></div>",

A female Growlithe had pounced out from behind the Flygon and Dreycara, pushing them to the ground for it to leap again towards her callers. There, the canine had released a small fan of flames to burn away at the rope keeping them on the ground without truly harming them from their types.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShasta gets back up from the ground as the Growlithe takes a battle stance towards her with Ruga standing upright once more as well. The Dreycara only grins and with a bellowing chuckle, \"Ha, that's all you have to save you? It's just a simple feral. We beat you once, and we'll do it again, even with your 'heroic savior' here, right Ruga?\" The Flygon smiles and nods with her, prepping up for another battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, the older Houndoom brother simply laughs, \"Heh, don't get so cocky girl...\" He suddenly shoots out a cloud of smoke from his mouth for a smokescreen in front of the two heroes, causing them to rub their eyes from the sting and blindness while the Growlithe howls. It then charges forward and lunges at Ruga with an open maw, and the Flygon was too late to stop it from coming any closer. The feral chomps down on his long and exposed neck while tackling him to the ground, making the dragon yelp in shock as it quickly leaps back off again. He was about to get up and retaliate back with his dragon fire, yet something was strangely fuzzy and numb with his surroundings. His mind was growing tired by the second and the world was spinning some, as well as becoming strangely...purple?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShasta gets back up to her hindpaws not knowing what had happened to Ruga and gets ready to defend herself from the ferals, \"You okay Ruga? Let's take them all out together. They don't stand a cha-\" Her words are cut off once she is suddenly tackled down from the side. She crashes down and barks loudly in distress, trying to get her attacker off of her until she pauses once she realizes that it's Ruga! The Flygon glares down at her with purple, glowing eyes and a drooling mouth salivating onto her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Ruga...?\" She softly gasps in shock and alarmed eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Houndoom brothers chuckle as the other one states, \"Fools. You really think you could outwit us? Well if you're so cunning and powerful, Dreycara, why don't you demonstrate how you'll be able to beat your own mate here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShasta whines as she didn't know what to do. She would rather not face the fate of being eaten and digested, but hurting Ruga wasn't exactly something she could face with either as the growling Flygon drags his tongue up her neck and over her face. The pinned Dreycara moans out as her past lover tastes her body around sensitive areas, making her lightly squirm underneath his body that only rouses him more. The infected Ruga slides off of her, only then to grab her legs and hook them under his shoulders as she lies on the grass on her backside, shocked at how he was positioning her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Ruga! Stop! D-Don't d-\" She pleads, but just gets cut off again once his cock plunges in between her legs and stabs inside her nethers. Shasta howls out as her mate's member penetrates her once more, sliding deep inside her folds to squish deeper and deeper with light thrusts to make space for the Flygon's playtime. She claws as the dirt and grass, doing whatever she can just to grab something as she's violated by the Flygon in front of her enemies. \"St-stop looking! We'll get you f-for this you stupid mutts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Houndooms laugh and continue enjoying the show while becoming a bit aroused as well, watching the Flygon plunge his member back and forth inside of the legendary to use her figure as he pleases. The cock shifts in a slamming pattern to emit each hump with an audible wet slap and a moan from Shasta as her folds cling onto his dick, shamefully wanting his seed within her. The dragon growls much more hungrily as he drags Shasta closer, leaning over her downed body a bit as he continuously pummels the cock in and out to rock her whole body around his member. Her breasts wobble in the motion of her bouncing body as her tails recoil and thrash along the ground. Pre soaks Ruga's pounding dragonhood and Shasta's own legs from both of their genitals mashing together like this, with Shasta already at the point of breaking. She can feel the cock drill all the way inside of her to protrude a bulge out of her own stomach, and all she can think of now was just raining her orgasm around that very rod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Flygon roars after his last forceful pump, now completely slammed against the Dreycara's beaten groin with his cock jetting inside completely to shake the girl back and forth against it before it erupts his molten seed into her. Shasta rolls her head back, groaning and whining as the hot cum invades her insides and seeps down deep into her. She can only orgasm back in his favor to coat that ejaculating cock with her own gooey contents to unwillingly give into the pleasure. Her body loses its willpower, and the Dreycara lays against the grass completely with her legs dropped back onto the ground with a puddle of cum oozing out from between them. \"Hahhh...hahhh...it can't...b-be like this.\" She pants out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Flygon suddenly grabs her ankles, causing the girl to glance back at her gone-lover to see his cock growing even more massive now! The throbbing boner increases in both width and length, creating a colossally sized tower of meat that wobbles with each glob of pre beading out of it. Shasta's heart shrivels and her breath locks up once she sees that Ruga was now sliding her hindpaws inside the urethra of his member, immediately dragging her legs inside with a single tug from the large penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh-ahh! R-R-Ruga no! Make him stop! Please, I-I get it! I lost, you all beat me...just...make him stop!\" Shasta pleads to the Houndooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger brother laughs, \"Awwww, what's wrong? You seemed to really like getting fucked by a feral!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older one chimes in next, \"How sad is it to see a legendary beg for help from her own enemies. Face it, you're just cock food now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sadly to Shasta, they were right. It was over for her now, and it was humiliating to beg for mercy now that she had been so cocky beforehand. Half of her body is dragged inside the meaty capsule sinking her in with slimy walls tightening around the consumed portions of her body. The Dreycara can only shiver in distress and her breasts and neck are suckled inside, leaving only her gasping out head to be left out of the green lips of Ruga's cock to get a faceful of the oozing thick pre smearing her face as it keeps leaking with the stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-How...was I beaten? I'm the Dreycara. I was supposed to sa-\" The legendary had a knack for getting cut off by her predator as her cries become muffled once she's completely gulped inside the cock, sliding down to meet her fate in the Flygon's stewing balls. She's dumped into a pool of hot cum with the slick walls tightening around her and sloshing about, but the girl had long given up. She sulks inside the murky liquid to become a part of just her mate's own spooge, knowing full well that she had failed Mew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew watches with her psychic abilities of Shasta's progress, only cupping her mouth with a hand as she watches Ruga rape his own mate and to later cock vore her down. Before she was going to take the mental image away, she sees the Houndooms approach the infected Flygon, congratulating him, and insulting Shasta's weakness from the aftermath of what they witnessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wouldn't have mattered if we ate her or not. Seeing as how weak she was, we would've barely become any stronger anyhow.\" The younger brother chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older brother smiles at his sibling, staring at the large cock and balls of the Flygon, \"Indeed so. In fact, why don't we finish her off for good together?\" The two Houndooms then get on their and begin to rub and lick at the massive green balls for Ruga, causing the feral to growl happily and louder than ever before. The Growlithe even joins in to hug itself around the tall and thick rod, stroking away at it while lapping at the hot pre oozing from it to help the Flygon at last cum. Massive amounts of his semen shoot out from the head to spill onto the grass in large, collected puddles and ropes, with Mew shocked to see how much he had produced and knowing fully well that those very puddles were all that remains of Shasta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was more than enough for her to see to know that the world was doomed now.</span></div></div>",

A female Growlithe had pounced out from behind the Flygon and Dreycara, pushing them to the ground for it to leap again towards her callers. There, the canine had released a small fan of flames to burn away at the rope keeping them on the ground without truly harming them from their types.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShasta gets back up from the ground as the Growlithe takes a battle stance towards her with Ruga standing upright once more as well. The Dreycara only grins and with a bellowing chuckle, \"Ha, that's all you have to save you? It's just a simple feral. We beat you once, and we'll do it again, even with your 'heroic savior' here, right Ruga?\" The Flygon smiles and nods with her, prepping up for another battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, the older Houndoom brother simply laughs, \"Heh, don't get so cocky girl...\" He suddenly shoots out a cloud of smoke from his mouth for a smokescreen in front of the two heroes, causing them to rub their eyes from the sting and blindness while the Growlithe howls. It then charges forward and lunges at Shasta with an open maw, and the girl was too late to stop it from coming any closer. The feral chomps down on her shoulder while tackling her to the ground, making her yelp in shock as it quickly leaps back off again. She was about to get up and show the mutt how powerful she truly was, yet something was strangely fuzzy and numb with her surroundings. Her mind was growing tired by the second and the world was spinning some, as well as becoming strangely...purple?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Houndoom continued his statement with a malicious sneer, \"Legendary or not...you're still able to fall under our control with just a mere bite. Looks like you're going to be ours after all, Dreycara. You shouldn't have been so careless, eh heh hehhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shasta!\" Ruga calls out to you while running to your side. The legendary can only make certain grunts and coughs before her entire world fades out with her eyes closing. Her mate gets to his knees and grabs her by the shoulders, \"Shasta! Wake up! You have to! We can't let these guys win, remember? Y-You're a special kind of legendary right? M-Maybe you can overcome the bite, but you just gotta fight! Shasta!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJostling her seemed to have no effect, all until her eyes open with a vivid hue of purple that had Ruga's eyes widen in disbelief as the Dreycara groans and gets onto its hindpaws without any kind of sentience. The Flygon fell back on his rear, shuddering with his jaw as his lover towers over him as an infected now. \"Sh-Shasta...?\" The Dreycara merely resounds a low grumble while her violet eyes gaze down at the terrified Flygon trying to back away on the grass. Her tails wavers from behind her and go around her body to wrap some of them around Ruga's ankles, dragging him back closer to her for more of the tails to scoop around him. The dragon tenses up and begins to lightly squirm with the furry tendrils over taking him, plucking him off from the ground with tails wrapped around his body to pin his arms to sides, squishing his belly some, and spreading his legs apart to his horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger Houndoom then ridicules the trapped dragon, \"Heh, looks like your girlfriend is a little hungry and its playtime. Ready to be gulped down by your mate, Flygon?\" Ruga can only retaliate with thrashes, light kicks, and muffled groans as a tail obscures his mouth. He would use his dragon breath to free himself from her coils, but he was still conflicted with hurting Shasta in that same process to where he didn't know what he should do. The Dreycara, however, had very clear intentions with her tails tightening around the chubby Flygon as two of the furry tendrils make their way in between his legs to suddenly brush of his genitals. The act has Ruga open his mouth in a startled gasp that only causes his legs and tail to lash out more pathetically in the air. The infected legendary grins as the tails work their magic into guiding the dragon's green member to a throbbing height, forcing the member into a stiff erection that wiggles as much as the dragon does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuga groans with a wide mouth and panting voice, \"Ehhh...eh...Sh-Shasta...\" The Dreycara then proceeds to wrap the two tail ends around his member to squeeze and tug, along with a third tail tip to lightly tickle and brush its hair over the head of his member. Ruga yells as his head tosses back, submitting to the pleasure and thrusts the best he can from the tails. His hands writhe at his sides, aching to just grab whatever they can or to swat the tails away from the sheer sensitivity to get off the Shasta's soft fur. The Houndoom brothers merely grin as they watch the two heroes take care of themselves in defeat while also petting the Growlithe feral for a job well done. The tails yank and squeeze at the thick dragonhood, enjoying the globs of pre oozing out from its end to trickle down on the tendrils and mat their fur with sticky glazing and strands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuga bites his bottom lip while his tail swats around anywhere it can before he roars out, \"Ahhhh-ahh! Stop! St-stop! I'm g-g-gonna...expl-ahhhhh~!\" At last, the Flygon can't contain his lust any longer, and creams himself to his mate's tails. White, hot semen squirts our from his member to rope along the silk coat of fur on Shasta's tails, only making them even slimier as they constrict even tighter to force another squeal from him. There, a fourth tail rubs underneath Ruga's rear end before giving it a powerful swat to spank one his green globes. The dragon yipes as his butt blushes red from the tight hit as well as his face as he watches the tails attack at his cock again. \"Pl-please...no more...!\" His weak big legs fail to do anything as they kick out and his pleas would soon cease once Shasta hovers her last tail above his head. The Flygon stares dumbfoundedly at it as the tail presses against his, all until its tip opens up and crams him inside!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe event has the dragon muffledly yelling inside of the furry tentacle as his crotch and ass are still continuously bombarded with pleasure with the other tails stroking, rubbing, and spanking the Flygon dry of his seed, all until his balls were completely milked of his cum. Ruga moans inside the swallowing tendril that takes in his long neck and chest with a simple <i>shlurp</i> as his groin is assaulted with a mad barrage of tails brushing. As soon as the devouring tail makes it around his chest, Ruga whimpers as he delivers his last hump into Shasta's tail tips, ejaculating once again for more of the white, hot goo to string over in heavy globs to litter the fur in his contents. The orgasm has the dragon twitch a few more times before going completely limp in her tails, releasing a groan of defeat right after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dreycara murrs as she works in faster to take the dragon, while of course, bringing a couple of her tails to unravel his crotch and rise up to her lips for the feral to lick happily down. Ruga's slightly pudgy belly and thick legs are dragged inside the tail, making it protrude out quite fatly as his tail was the only thing left of him. The Houndooms laugh and clap as his tail is slurped down in with the rest of the dragon with the bulges traveling down the tendril to empty out inside her stomach, creating a round dome in Shasta's gut. The girl murrs entirely with ecstasy with her hands sliding up to squeeze and rub the furry globe sloshing out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was Ruga, distraught that his mate and hero had fallen so easily to the Houndoom brothers, right after he even saved her. Maybe that meant that this was supposed to happen, but he couldn't really ask for more. He humps against the stomach walls the best he can, still pent up with arousal from the thoughts of being consumed by Shasta hit him, that only causes the stomach to bounce slightly up and down for the girl. He pants from his maw and moans from his mouth as stomach juices was warmly over his body and cock, tossing his head back with embarrassment hoping that Mew wasn't watching to two heroes and how they failed. It wouldn't matter, because as soon as the dragon releases his third and smallest orgasm all over his belly in the stomach, he passes out with his body slumped inside the stomach with the liquid pooling over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew was horrified at the psychic image before her as she watches the legendary Dreycara fall to a mere Growlithe feral and become infected. She was about to look away until she notices the Flygon submitting himself into the infected Shasta's tails almost willingly, barely putting up a fight as he squeezed clean of his semen and dragged inside one of her tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the scene of him finally being pulled into the stomach, the Houndoom brothers approach their new slave with evil grins. \"Excellent work, you stupid little slut! With you on our side now, there's no one who can possibly stop us, heeheeheeee!\" The younger brother cheers as all of the fire-types head back towards the cabin to digest Ruga and to plan their next move. Mew then fades the image away, but blushes as she notices she's wet with pre between her legs from watching Ruga being consumed.</span></div></div>",

Say these people know who they're looking for. They'd know we could both fly, and would expect us to do so. They more than likely have dozens of guards patrolling the skies.

It completely ruins their mental stability.

Worst case scenario.... Death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best case scenario, they completely regain their mental bearings, and don't remember the horrible acts they have committed.

Back to back with one another, each hero endeavors to free themselves from the immensely thick coils encircling their midsections. Their arms are bound to their own sides while their legs kick about uselessly in the lake water, a simple but embarrassingly easy tactic to keep them still; even their wings are flattened against their backs to ensure neither can escape. Shasta growls in frustration, \"Ggnh! There's no way I'm letting our journey end to this random thing!\" Her maw opens up to prepare a flaming attack, only to be halted with the Milotic opens its own mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beautiful male eel releases a piercing Disarming Voice, ringing the ears of its captured prey to completely disorientate them. Shasta swings her head about as Ruga groans loudly from the intense sound. Their vision grows blurry and their voices are muted from one another. The Dreycara whines out, \"A-Aghh...! Ruga, quick, use Dragon Tail on it. I can't use my tails, but you can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Flygon however was left blinking repeatedly, hearing nothing but the pulsating ringing in his head after the attack. \"H-Huh? What...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShasta could barely make out what her companion was even saying, all before hearing his voice distort even more. It sounded like he wasn't even emitting words. Unable to see what was happening behind her, she could at least guess from what she felt. Ruga's back was dragging down from Shasta's own, and the Milotic's cock wasn't grazing her anymore. In fact, Ruga's muffled noises were that of distressed yelling. The Milotic was submerging the Flygon's tail and legs into its shaft. The pillar of meat grew and flexed in the water, making enough room to pull the unfortunate bug dragon right on in. \"R-Ruga?\" Shasta calls out to him again, only to hear the faint sputters of her name from the Flygon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Nngh! It's taking me in?!\" Ruga exclaims aloud, even having a hard time to hear himself. \"Sh-Shasta, you have to get out of here! Go, when the coils get loose...!\" The dragon's heart sank to say it, but he wanted to ensure Shasta had a fighting chance if he was going to be eaten. It baffled the Flygon that a single infected would prove to be this problematic, after all that the pair had been through together. His hips sink down with a pull, trapping his tail and legs into the tight space of the Milotic's shaft where it's weight balls bob in the water, eager to claim the fit Flygon. The bug dragon's belly squishes atop the cocktip as the wet meat squelches around his lower half, eating him down with tug after tug. The infected Milotic murrs in bliss to finally sate its perverse hunger. Its coils tighten up again for a crushing squeeze to both of its prey, forcing Shasta and Ruga to gag aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of loosening the coils when submerging one of the meals down, the lengthy and slick figure circles in tighter to ensure Shasta remains next in line to feed the Milotic's balls. The orbs swell with cum underneath, exciting them now that Ruga was slipping further and further down. His bound arms and shoulders are sealed into the urethral lips of the monster, leaving only that of his long neck to be taken in with ease. In a single long streak, Ruga's head descends into the cocktip. His teeth gnash together in frustration while his eyes glance up with worry to the towering predator. The Milotic glares down at his through his glazed view, savoring the fearing expression. Down the infected wet chest and stomach, it mashes a hand flat on Ruga's face, dooming the Flygon down into its sac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trail of bulges travel through the shaft and swell out the round nuts wafting in the lake water, leaving Shasta to smacking her back against the Milotic's front. Between her legs, she straddles onto the cock that had devoured her lover as he clearly fills out one of the testicles under the rippling water. From the new weight, the sac even surfaces up from the water with the Milotic's shaft once the eel leans itself back, using its arms to entrap the woman. The winged legendary swings and sways herself as best she could, yet the might of the Milotic proves to be too much for her in its own element. A loop of its coils wraps around her legs to squeeze them up together as its hands latch onto her chest, squeezing into the Dreycara's breasts for a better grip. Shasta gasps aloud at the gesture, blushing with fury, \"Ggrrrnhh, hands off! You're just some dumb eel thing...! I'm going to save Ruga and-!\" The Dreycara wouldn't get to finish as the tail-coil slings her right upside down, with the Milotic's hands trading from her tits to her wrists instead now that her arms dangled downwards. Shasta's figure sways all the more now to free herself. But her turmoil would lead to her demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuga meanwhile squishes into the thick, dark chamber of seed that compacts around him, forcing him into an uncomfortable ball. With semen submerging most of his body, he awkwardly mashes his arms and legs to the testicle's walls. \"N-Nnngh! Shasta! You can do it! You can beat him...!\" He tries to cheer his lover on, but he had no idea of knowing what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...All until a familiar train of grunts and whines sound out. The cock encases Shasta's head into its lips, plunging her in after a tight enough grip yanks her down. The Dreycara's legs and wings spasm in place, causing quite the ruckus for the Milotic to restrain her while they splash about in the lake. Unfortunately, it looks grim for the legendary hero. Her shoulders mash on through, getting the cock to flex around her and pull her in with another swallow. Pre-cum soaks into her already wet fur to make her descent vastly easier to slide into the lower depths of the cock. \"M-Mmmphk! Grmnghk! Rngh!\" She growls within the slick walls. It was sickening to fall like this in her adventure. A wordless creature taking advantage of her simple task fo drawing water. Shasta ran through every scenario to have known she'd be attacked, but ultimately, the blame was on her for ever letting her guard down, even after having a heart to heart with Ruga. <i>'Is this really how it ends for us...?!'</i> She thought to herself. The answer was obvious but pathetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her wings folding in and her arms clapping up to her sides once again, the legendary Dreycara is guzzled into the Milotic's large shaft all the more. Her tails and legs desperately sway outside of the summit, but the more the cock submerges her, the less mobility they had. Eventually, her hindpaws and tail-tips are left to slip in between the dick's lips, sealing up just over them to contain the last Dreycara down. Darkness and intense squelching surround Shasta as she nosedives through the slimy tunnel. The flexes of the cock help to compress her in, with a rippling squeeze dragging her in deeper with a vice pull. Shasta's lips wince along her muzzle as she sulks in the situation. <i>'It...really is over...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dreycara packs out the other testicle while the Flygon sloshes inside the other, swelling the Milotic's external balls greatly. The naga eases its hands onto the fat nuts, rolling its hands along the soaked surface of the blubber-like skin to feel his meals writhe in their chambers. Cum submerges both Shasta and Ruga to completely blanket their moans of protest. The best they can manage are mere fidgets in place. The Milotic shares a much more delight moan with them as he props his lengthy body up better from the lake. With both hands readied at sides of the large shaft, the Milotic strokes himself freely between his palms, riding them a majority of the long size. It pants aloud and the balls slap against itself from the bucking motions, which in turn wallow its prey in its spunk. The thick semen utterly coats Shasta and Ruga as they push against the walls, searching for any means of escape. Their reward is only to feel each other through the other's testicle, mashing to the walls just as equally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuga's world shatters to feel Shasta sharing the same fate as him as he tries to beckon to her, but the cum levels rise too much, and the pair are sunken completely in a nut full of spunk. \"...M-Mmblplk! Nn-nnpphhh...\" Ruga's eyes roll up, seeing only the pale darkness sink him within the vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Milotic wildly swings its hips, fapping firmly to jettison pre out from its shaft to splash into the water that ramps up the digestion process. Its meals would loosen up, numbing out to lose their sense of self until they turn just as white as the cum melting them. With a loud churn, the balls batter them up into a gooey paste, absorbing them in to completely change them into the infected's next load. The Milotic tenses up and flexes its pecs, finally erupting a hot mess out from its large rod. The white cream spurts in long, gloppy ropes that splash against the water, rippling to the lake's edge. Shot after shot, the remnants of Shasta and Ruga disappear into a milky white fog that dissipates in the water. The infected jizzes out repeatedly, all until it was lazily dribbling the cum out from its cock tip. It huffs aloud, cupping a hand to its chest to admire the work it did. It was fortunate enough to have the legendary Dreycara lower her guard so easily, let along put up a lackluster fight to sate its primal needs. As it releases its cock, the spent Milotic dives back into the water, swimming towards its cavern to rest off the intense orgasm it had...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Mew's cave, Latina approaches with Magira to their companion. \"Mew...? Can you check on Shasta and Ruga once more? It has been a while since we last checked their progress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew smiles and nods, \"Of course, if it will put your mind at ease. I presume they've probably already made it past the next series of mountains.\" Closing her eyes and focusing, the psychic develops a mental image. Her eyes shoot wide with great fear however, as only white mist can be seen within a random lake...</span></div></div>",

The Dreycara bellows aloud, \"Ngh! We gotta get this thing off of us! Any ideas?\" Ruga couldn't answer at the Milotic grabs the Flygon's head and shoulder by its hands to swing his neck over. The charming eel readies its drooling mouth, with the teeth especially scaring the Flygon. Shasta asks from over her shoulder, \"Ruga...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-Shasta, it's gonna-!\" The Flygon warns aloud, only to be cut off as he yelps from the Milotic taking its infectious bite. The teeth sink in and latch on tight, bearing in at Ruga's throat to make him tense up. \"A-Ahh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShasta's eyes widen from just the sound, knowing what it'd mean for her lover. \"Ruga, no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Flygon sputters in place and the Milotic gnaws in place, ensuring that the dragon takes the full dosage needed to infect him quickly. But the pair's struggling was proving to be rather annoying for the eel, so with an unhinging of its maw, it releases Ruga's neck; only to swing his head the other way and bite into the neck again at a different spot. \"K-Kyyah! Aahghh...ahh...Shaa...ssttaahh...\" The bug groans with his eyes wavering and his mind beginning to lose its grasp on reality. For Ruga, an intense fire builds in his loins, yearning for pleasure. Yet his stomach sank in a great void, eternally hungry, craving only that of meat. He didn't even feel his body respond to his thoughts anymore, and soon enough, thoughts were a thing of the past to him. \"Ooouugghh...aauuhh...\" He drools out of his mouth and stops struggling, no longer in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dreycara swings her head about, \"D-Damn it, no! Ruga, say something! I know you're still in there!\" The Milotic stares at Ruga's stupe<sub></sub>fied face before letting the Flygon flop out its coils, releasing Ruga to ragdoll into the lake water. This left Shasta alone to deal with the Milotic. \"You bastard...!\" She yells out. Shasta remembers the last conversation they had just before they had set up camp. It was like a twist of irony that Ruga fell to the infection before she ever did, and now the roles they feared had reversed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Milotic cared little, and was only more interested in getting something out of infecting these two heroes. The coils clench up tighter around Shasta now that they had more room to constrict her. The wet loops twist and wring her upper body, forcing the air out of her lungs as she rolls her head up to wheeze for the sky. \"H-Hhhghk...!\" The infected swings her more onto her back at the water's surface as her legs face it. Its hands easily grip them up and spread the limbs out, exposing the woman's slit to tease its erection. It growls in satisfaction, accepting her decent size to be enough to fit its shaft. The large cock lifts out of the water, dripping and sopping wet before skipping the foreplay and nudging itself into the easiest hole it nudged. Her nethers squish right up to the cock, alerting the Dreycara of what's to come. \"H-Hhaah, ngh, don't...you even think about it...\" She grunts tightly in the Milotic's coils, but her thighs tremble in fear. It was unavoidable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Milotic bucks its hips forward and squeezes in a couple of inches of its mass inside of her. The vaginal lips part and Shasta barks to the open air. In forward draws, the eel nudges its waist to really cram in some progress, fighting the tightness to fit itself into her like a sleeve. Shasta's legs cringe within its hands and her voice silences up from how tense her throat gets. It baffles her that she succumbs to the infection like this, after all that she's been through. But that's just it in an apocalypse like this. Everyone is fair game for the infected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a squelching mash, the Milotic manages to fit its full size into Shasta. The Dreycara moans wildly aloud from her stomach bulging at the mass buried within, bumping a coil looped around her middle. Her heart thumps wildly against her chest as she finds herself unable to kick her captor, let alone emit out any of her fiery attacks. She was too drenched in the lake and unable to focus once the eel naga pries his waist back just to shove the wide inches of cock right into her. The Milotic grunts, forcing her inner walls to cave and grant his length entrance as he swings in a few more thrusts to work her out. Shasta groans in each strong shove, struggling to retain the air she gives out. \"A-Aaaahhh...! Uuaaaaahhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe prays for some kind of savior to get her out of this situation, only to hear splashing sound out. She springs her eyes open to hear someone else approach, only to wince to see a familiar face. Ruga now stands in the shallows of the lake, with glowing purple eyes in his red lenses, and a throbbing erection at his groin. The infected Flygon stumbles forward, eager to sate himself just like the Milotic wanted. \"R-Ruga...no, you can't. You have to remember me!\" Shasta yelps aloud as she's bucked into by the eel. The bug dragon just growls down at her without any real expression, the real Ruga long gone now. His hands grasp the sides of her head, almost affectionately...all before swinging his cock directly into her huffing mouth. \"M-Mmphk?!\" The Dreycara grunts out to find her lover's shaft plugging her mouth and pinning her tongue, all before thrusting into her with the fellow infected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPounded from both sides, Shasta whines over the cock as she bounces between the two males in a tug of war match, finding her throat and cervix getting tugged when either pulls for another hump. Working together, the infected were eager to have the legendary woman join their ranks, happy to erase her mind if it meant emptying their loads into her. Shasta's lips numbly slap against Ruga's groin as the Flygon's balls slap up against her face. The dragon growls with bliss and watches how deep of a bulge he can make her throat go as she's forced to guzzle it all down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShasta was pained to lose out to the infected...but should it be anyone to infect her, a selfish part of her at least was glad it was Ruga. Even if it was only partly. She wondered if the two would at least stay together as packmates...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer depressed thoughts are interrupted by the floodgates releasing, and hot cum ruptures through her throat and inside of her cunt. \"M-Mmgglhhp-!\" The Dreycara spasms about again with Ruga and the Milotic collectively jizzing into their prey. The wet slaps rock the lake water about and loosely squelch from both pairs of her lips. Shasta's face heats up in a blush to feel the muscled flexes of Ruga's dick pump his seed into her, finally gifting her despite the situation. The Milotic binds the coils on her in tight to ensure she takes most of its semen before prying itself right out, slumping the length against her drooling pussy. The Dreycara's even granted air to her lungs again once the Flygon pulls out. The dragon cock flicks right up, letting the spunk drool all over Shasta's chin and jawline. She coughs from the gooey heat flooding her body, which only increases the heat within her body. \"A-Aahh...Mew...Latina...Magira...Ruga...I'm sorry...\" She groans as her mind deteriorates as hunger claims her concerns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Milotic releases the woman's body out from its coils to see its job was done. It dives into the water and swims back towards its den to rest off its orgasm, and Ruga is left watching the Dreycara slump in the lake to float at the surface. Her body writhes weakly as she tries to stave off the infection, but it was a pointless attempt. Her eyes begin to fade with a glowing purple, and her voice sputters into a growling rasp. With the deed over, the Flygon spreads its wings and takes to the sky, abandoning the infected Dreycara in search of a meal for itself. Shasta was no longer herself as the infection claims her body, resorting into her groaning in confusion and clawing her way to the lake's coast...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew cups a hand over her mouth as she stares at the mental projection in her eyes.

The supposed savior was now just another rank-and-file animal for the mastermind...</span></div></div>",

Gravity weighed on her battered body, worn from battle and still exhausted from the lack of full sleep. The legendary hero slumps onto the cold, rocky flooring in front of the female anthro Scolipede glaring down at her with its infected purple glare. \"N-Nnghh...Ruga...!\" The Dreycara calls out for her partner in hope being aided, only to hear a muffled whine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing over, she sees the Flygon on his back, panting with an open mouth to inflate his chest and belly repeatedly. He was down for the count, and the male Scolipede before him was licking its lips. Shasta curses herself, \"H-How is this possible? I'm a legendary! I-I should be more powerful than these stupid bugs, and-mmphk?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary is silenced once the female Scolipede squatted down with spread thick thighs to show its drooling slit off. It had grabbed Shasta by the fur on her head and yanked her muzzle forward, forcing her mouth closed as its sandwiched between the slick folds. A wet squelch and an infected moan fills the cave as the defeated hero has a front-row seat to her own doom. The vaginal folds tug and shiver in place from their meal, and either through lust or hunger, Shasta's predator fully crams her face into the glistening entrance to completely seal her head inside. \"G-GGggrrRRPHK!!\" She exclaims in distress, weakly clawing her hands at the bug's legs, but its magenta exoskeleton easily handles her pathetic attempts of escape, whereas the Scolipede's pudgier softer black middle makes it easy to lump out from her head as her neck sinks in. There, the victorious infected repeatedly rocks its hips forwards and backwards, probing Shasta's head in and about the womb to work her like some sexual toy. The sounds of sex fill the ambient cavern walls as the female Scolipede touches at its own body with brushes and gropes of its hands, squeezing at its breasts, nipples, and stomach bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuga wouldn't be spared from a terrible fate either. The male Scolipede had already begun stroking its member as it grew to far intimidating size, large enough to consume the Flygon whole. The hyper-sized pillar of throbbing black meat easily dragged the dragon's tail and legs inside the urethra. The cock lips drool hot and clear pre around the green tendril as they ease their way over his legs as well, getting the Flygon to writhe in place weakly some before he looked down just to see exactly what was happening to him. \"Ghhhyahh! Y-You...gotta be kidding me... I can't go down like this!\" He growls with gnashed fangs, doing his best to claw at the ground to pull himself out as his midsection was slipping into the slimy interior of the meat eating him. \"Shasta...?\" He gasps when needing her help, but she was already halfway up the other Scolipede's groin, sticking her swaying rump, thrashing tails, and kicking legs about uselessly at the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female Scolipede had fully laid down at this point on its back, crossing its legs around the rest of its meal to ease into its spitting slit. The vaginal walls secrete it warm juices around the Dreycara food that would soon restore, matting the fur down and making for a nicely lubricated ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two infected make easy work out of the heroes, and while tuckered from battle, the satisfaction of claiming their two catches as their sexual food was all too much to just ignore. It was revitalizing to them, and the Scolipedes quicken their progress. Shasta's hindpaws disappear within the female bug's slit, leaving the vagina coated in the clear slime with a rotund black belly swelling out on the predator to knead and toy with. The male bug slips Ruga's long neck in within the tense erection before arriving at his head. He pants the last of the open, cold air he would before his world vanished into the dark squelching innards of the Scolipede's cock. \"U-Uuu....uuahh! Shastaaahhh!\" With a seal of the urethral lips, the cock tip captures its prey and sinks the train of Flygon lumps down into the thing's sac. Its round and weight balls orb greatly from their meal, drenching poor Ruga in its hot spunk. The Flygon tries his best to wallow inside for resistance, but the white seed was already churning at his body; the heat alone weakening his defeated state. He calls out to his lover through the sac walls as the male Scolipede sloshes and bounces them in place from its fervent dick-stroking. But the only answers he receives are the pleasured moans of the female Scolipede and slimy gurgling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infected bug claiming Shasta had the Dreycara tightly curled up within its own middle, forced to be drenched in more of its feminine juices to feel herself slowly join it all. Sooner or later, she'd just be a simple orgasm for the Scolipede to enjoy afterwards. \"G-Grrrggphh! R-Ruga! I'll get us out...! Just...er....\" She didn't know what else to say. The fact that these two infected managed to make meals out of them alone was baffling, but even after dealing with the mastermind's Houndoom henchmen too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male Scolipede however suddenly takes advantage of its past lover on the ground, keeping the legs spread and nudging its cocktip to the drooling nethers. With an easing thrust, the bugs make it all fit, helping to really drill their pleasure to churn the two heroes quickly in their respective parts. The slapping balls swinging about easily start to melt down Ruga into a pasty white with Shasta yelping out before becoming clear, hot spunk for the female bug to rain down on her lover's cock as they go at it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-----|-----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Mew's cave, the psychic shakes her head in disapproval at the mental image of the two infected Scolipedes moaning, unloading their orgasms with the cum-remains of their one true hope of defeating the mastermind. \"Shasta, Ruga...how could you let those two get the better of you? Of all the things...\" She mutters to herself, unsure how to break the news to Magira or Latina. She ceases the vision once she sees the two Scolipedes just lying on top of one another with a mess of cum splattered and dripping from their groins. In the end, Ruga and Shasta would spend their final times together...as a puddled mixture of post-coitus...</span></div></div>",

His body straddles on top of the mystical legendary as she squirms violently in turmoil, captured again after just escaping. The hellhound stresses his weight powerfully against Shasta, grinning maliciously, \"Now where do you think you're going? You almost had us there in the midst of our argument, and even with someone to help you and the element of surprise, you <i>still</i> failed! Don't you get it? You're <i>ours</i> now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Houndoom slaps his fat, slimy tongue around his chops, licking hungrily with his eyes peering down at the Dreycara. Ruga was off in the distance again, but helplessly laid out as the older shiny Houndoom slurps at his neck and ready to claim the dragon as his meal. Shasta feels her blood ignite with anger while she manages to curl her legs up underneath her predator, kicking the Houndoom off for the girl to get back up and rush to Ruga's aid. However, the younger Houndoom launches a fireball from his maw to strike Shasta directly into her backside, making her topple back to the ground defeated once more. He pads casually over to the vanquished legendary as he wags his tail happily, standing in front of her before planting his hand on the top of her head. He tugs her back up to her knees as he keeps his grip on the fur of her head, and his brother calls out to him, \"I think we should teach our prey a lesson of what they are now, brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger sibling smiles evilly yet again, and glances back down to Shasta's discontented face. The Dreycara is suddenly faced with the Houndoom's cock riding up along the side of her muzzle, obscuring half of her view. \"Lick.\" The Houndoom demanded, yanking against her fur. The Dreycara was just about to get up, even with all of her injuries, and fight the Houndoom to the death before doing such a sick thing. However, the Houndoom tugs against her again and replies, \"Lick it, or we kill your 'boyfriend' over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShasta is reminded of Ruga again, and by peering over to look at him, she discovers that the Flygon is already on his sucking the older Houndoom's rod. The dragon muffledly whines with all of dog meat stuffing his entire mouth and loud suckling heard from afar. As much as Ruga was unwilling to the idea, he didn't want to see Shasta hurt either. The younger Houndoom presses the head of his cock against Shasta's lips, demanding again, \"Now <i>lick</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dreycara braced herself and reluctantly opened her mouth, dabbing her tongue worriedly out to slide over the tip of his cock. The Houndoom's cruel smile widens to her see her appeasement and prods his cock further against her maw. \"Good girl.\" Shasta grumbles at the taunt and looks over back to Ruga. The Flygon was already really getting into the idea of sucking the older Houndoom's cock, having his hands holding around the dog's thighs with his eyes shut and his head bobbing back and forth, loudly slurping the knotted member that has the older brother lazily murring to himself while thrusting into the dragon's wet mouth. The younger Houndoom suddenly slides his own cock into Shasta's mouth. The Dreycara whines out in protest with her full maw, forced into having the penis slide over her tongue and throb inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were foolish to think you could stop us. Our battle at the lake was merely a fluke, and now you'll be serving a pawn of our master's infection rather than this world's savior.\" The younger Houndoom brags to himself before grinding his length along the inside of Shasta's mouth. The Dreycara grumbles with the meat packing inside and glazing up in her saliva to quicken the smooth ride for the hellhound. She endeavored to keep her tongue away from the penis, but at its size and constant jabs, it fails to evade and is forced to lick around the cock. He tugs her head fur again to pull her mouth closer around his cock, pumping it thoroughly inside to eventually humping full force into her. The cock pumps within her wet jaws again and again, leaking out pre to ooze onto her tongue as it's forced to swirl around and massage the rod. The Houndoom places both of his hands atop her head as a brace and drives his cock further into her throat. Muffled and squelching gags sound out afterwards, as Shasta finds her eyes shutting tightly closed sucking against his cock strongly to her displeasure, yet there was still a sick excitement building up inside of her that disgusts and pleasures her at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Houndoom drills his erect member deep into her maw, plowing around the salivating walls and wrestling against her now-willing tongue dragging over the muscle. Through the midst of the blowjob, Shasta peeks an eye open to see Ruga on the ground panting with cum and drool dripping from his maw as the older Houndoom mounts his from behind. The blue and orange canine gropes his hands around Ruga's rear end, squeezing his round and green cheeks before spreading them apart to reveal his small hole. The Houndoom presses his wet cock against the Flygon's pucker, poking the tip inside and jamming the rest in with a thrust, making the dragon moan out to the air. The Dreycara pitied sorrow for her fallen companion, but as she was ready to see it as rape, the Flygon was actually bucking his hips with the Houndoom as the dog pounds his cock into Ruga's rump. The dog grapples the dragon close into his chest as he humps inside Ruga's ass. The Flygon groans loudly out with lowered eyelids and an open mouth that has his tongue leisurely flopped out and swinging in the force of the thrusting. His rear cheeks blush from arousal and from the Houndoom groin smacking against it with Ruga's tail lifted high. The loud and wet slaps sounding out mixed with dog growling and Ruga's groans of ecstasy fill Shasta's ears, stirring some twisted form of arousal in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger Houndoom continues to tease her, \"Aaaaahhhhhhh...that's a good girl. Having a legendary submit to me and suck my cock was easier than I imagined. How is it that you're so weak? It's almost like you wanted to lose, heh heh.\" His member stabs deep inside her mouth, pulsating madly as it crams her cheeks fully. The Dreycara is forced to gulp powerfully around the throbbing muscle until the Houndoom howls out with joy. Hot hellhound seed spurts down into her throat, seeping down into her stomach with Shasta literally having to milk to the dog's jizz down. The Houndoom continues to happily pump his cum around her maw, thrusting his jizzing member in and out of her muzzle to coat everything in its path. Shasta eventually can't keep up the pace of swallowing to the shots of cum painting her maw white, forced into pulling away to release the cock and have it send ropes of his cream onto har face. Shasta's upper body falls to her hands as she to tries to swallow down the rest of his seed, shuddering helplessly in front of her new dominant master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Houndoom strokes his cock to squish out the last remaining globs of cum onto Shasta panting heavily on the ground. \"Mmmmmrrrrrrr....you liked that, didn't you? You were actually suckling my cock, and you swallowed down all of my cum instead of spitting it out. You're not as strong and legendary as you thought.\" Before Shasta could protest or even respond, the Dreycara hears several gasps of pleasure from afar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older Houndoom was humping strongly into Ruga's rear, orgasming inside to have the Flygon jizz himself on the grass. The dog squeezes the dragon tightly against him, making sure not a single shot or drop of his cum spills out. Ruga claws at the ground with his body rubbing along the grass, murring to his pleasure and losing his willpower. The shiny Houndoom slides his cock out of the dragon's rear, giving it a firm spank before taunting, \"Myaghhh. Brother, you should've gone for this one. He even willingly clenches his cheeks around your cock as you violate him. Isn't that right, my slut?\" He gives the Flygon another smack on his green rear to have Ruga moan again as an answer. But after that, the older brother takes his cock by hand as it begins to grow some. He then takes Ruga by legs, dragging the Flygon backwards to slip his legs into the Houndoom's cock! Ruga was too lost in his pleasure and orgasm to even notice that he was being devoured by the member of the dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Shasta could warn him, her face was suddenly obscured in slick, fleshy darkness. The younger Houndoom had swallowed her head into his own cock, dragging the Dreycara's torso inside that has her breasts sliding against within the cock tunnel...</span></div></div>",

Her legs and tails flail outside as she growls out angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't lose! Not like this...!\" Shasta echoed in her head. She would continue to keep up her struggling, but it only seem to give her false hope as the cock's urethra continued to sink her body closer and closer to the cum-boiling depths of this sick Houndoom's bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the side, the older Houndoom enjoys his meal with Ruga's long neck sliding into his cock resting on his knees and stroking his fat and tall cock containing most of the dragon's body. The Flygon's blushing face still remains outside, panting heavily with pre drenching and smother over his entire head. The large globs of sticky fluid trickle down in large doses around the pillar of meat as the canine strokes his mighty reward. Ruga pants out with his tongue hanging out of his mouth, humping into the cock walls surrounding his body, lost in the sensation of his own pleasure. The older brother grins and plants a hand over the Flygon's head to push down, swallowing the round dragon bulge to slide to its demise. The blue and orange hellhound's sac enlargens out greatly, bouncing slightly by the Flygon's movements as bag digests Ruga into more frothy cum for the Houndoom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older brother approaches his younger brother and his cock-meal, eyeing the Dreycara's defenseless groin hanging out as she struggles with no chance of escape. She was up to her hips inside the knotted rod where the younger Houndoom oddly paused in his cock-meal. Shasta took the time to squirm even harder in the brief time in the moment of advantage, but suddenly, her legs are grabbed by the older brother on the outside with his bulbous cock tip drizzling with hot pre pressing at her slit. Her eyes flare open as she feels the large meat begin to shift into her nethers, sliding inside of her pussy with the flexible flesh stretching around it to accomodate some space by the large muscle's sudden presence. The puncture has Shasta gasping loudly inside of the younger Houndoom's cock, forcing a mouthful of pre to spill into her mouth inside the cramped space. The sibling rubs his bulging cock as it throbs from the Dreycara's movements writhing inside to no extent. The older brother smiles and begins to hump inside Shasta's vagina, protruding an abdominal bulge lumping out of her belly with each ram the hellhound drove in between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger brother smiles to see Shasta in such a state. He bellows out confidently as his hands squeeze the cock-bulges to tease the girl trapped inside, \"Oh what a pitiful sight. The mighty Dreycara raped and devoured by some underlings. You're lucky the ferals didn't get you first. They would have made you <i>last</i> longer for them.\" The older brother continues to plow his cock into the legendary's vagina, murring aloud as her walls begin to moisten and lubricate with pre. Even if she tried, Shasta couldn't help the overwhelming pleasure surging throughout her body each time the knotted penis rammed inside of her, pushing her slightly forward into the cock sucking her in. The shiny hellhound gropes his hands tightly around her rear end to play with the furry orbs, pounding away with audible wet slaps to sound out along with the gurgles coming from the large Houndoom's scrotum cum-digesting his Flygon cock meal inside, already becoming a pool of hot jizz already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShasta moans inside the urethral walls as they close tightly around her, keeping her in and still to allow some time for the older Houndoom to shovel his massive cock deeper, more pleasurably into Shasta's pussy. The Dreycara bucks her hips along with the member penetrating her, willingly pleasuring the older Houndoom with her while her slit oozes out with pre. The humping spree becomes too much for Shasta as she orgasms around the hellhound's enormous shaft, erupting a shower of her fluids over it. The older brother lashes his head back and jams his bulbous knot inside her raining passage, emptying his own load within her. The cum-digested Flygon in his sac flushes into Shasta's vagina in waves of semen, all of the fat spurts globbing into her stomach to expand her belly out in the severe rush of hot spooge. Shasta cries out in excitement as she's trapped partially in the younger Houndoom's cock as the warm cum melts down inside. Her gut stretches a bit out with the amount semen piling inside the organ, fitting close to the amount of Ruga's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older Houndoom repeatedly pounds again and again inside her pussy, clenching her cheeks desperately to hold on with the streaming cum surging through his cock. With Shasta completely full of her partner's cum-remains, defeated, and used, the younger Houndoom begins to drag her body back down along his large rod, sliding the girl's tails and legs inside as they don't even bother to struggle. Shasta pants loudly inside; drool drips out of her maw in a mess with pre forcing to splatter around her face and mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I c-can't...can't...nnngh...\" The Dreycara couldn't even comprehend her situation right now as her belly sloshes with thick cum with her slit leaking out the bubbling goo. She lightly twitches as her body is dumped into yet a different pool of cum, trapped inside the Houndoom's sac to meet the same fate as poor Ruga did. Inside, Shasta feels the weighted sac she was in suddenly drop down, meaning the Houndoom sat down and laughed at her as the slime boils around, preparing her to transform into his seed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, the younger brother plops down on his rump and strokes his hands over his large cock, groaning madly out as he humps between his hands. His arousal and desire to orgasm speeds the cum-digesting process up to Shasta's discomfort, but there wasn't anything else she could do. She had failed to stop the Houndoom brothers, and now she was going to pay for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog pants out as he feels the legendary inside his ball sac melt down into his frothy blend, ready to rocket out with his pleasure. With a final pump of his hands, he shoots out column after column of hot cum to cannon out slather himself with. The Houndoom groans from the ecstasy of being coated in his own cum, having beaten a legendary and used her to his favor. After the last blasts of what was left of Shasta had slathered him, his older brother helped him back onto his hindpaws, complimenting him, \"Excellent work, brother. These two will no longer stay in our way. Our master will be pleased.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger brother rubs his hands around the white cream around his body, grinning, \"I can already feel myself become more powerful. But our victory today feels even more satisfying.\" He licks his hungry tongue around his mouth lick up some of the cum, \"This'll taught that bitch she was mine all along. The battle at Magira's camp was just a fluke, and in fact, let's test out my new power against that foolish Alakazam, shall we? No one abandons our master's will...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew's eyes widened as her mental image to keep track of Shasta's progress only showed her being raped from behind while also being cock-devoured by two Houndooms with Ruga digesting inside one of their sacs.

Swallowing you down to feel your legendary body moan and squirm down my throat.

The Houndoom takes the moment to stuff his tongue inside of her mouth, licking at the inside of it to wrestle with her own tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShasta releases out several relentless groans as the muscle laps within her maw, almost kissing her but in a more twisted, hungry way. The large tongue slides out wetly as the hellhound on top of her swallows down her taste and murrs pleasantly to himself. \"You have a good flavor Dreycara. How lucky of me to catch you before a feral did.\" And with that haughty boast, the Houndoom opens his watering jaws wide for Shasta to stare into as her final destination. The salivating, throbbing muscles eager to consume her with his tongue licking over his menacing fangs. It closes in on her, stuffing the girl's muzzle into his own. Shasta groans and begins to lose her energy struggling within his grip, even though she wanted to escape more than ever now. The Houndoom then writhes his meaty tongue all over her face as it sinks into his jaws for him to suckle and lightly chew on her head. He muffledly chuckles while his hands slide down her arms, stopping at her chest with her defenseless breasts sit out. The hands take the furry orbs into their palms, groping the large cleavage that forces Shasta to immediately gasp from the assault and attempt to strain her head back from inside the sick Houndoom's maw and use her hands to push against his shoulders. He merely chuckles again and squishes her boobs more, pressing them together, rolling them in circles, and grinding his palms into her nipples hidden beneath the fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe constant toying elicits the Dreycara to unwillingly groan from his cruel hands which forces her struggles turn into simple twitches of pleasurable reflex. The hellhound continues to swallow his meal deeper into his throat with her neck sliding over his tongue, followed by her fidgeting shoulders. This causes her arms to start to lose their hold before as they're pinned to her sides with more of her body becoming this dog's dinner. Her draconic wings flap wildly in distress, making the Houndoom grumble with irritation to where he's urged to release Shasta's breasts and hold her wings against her backside. He gulps again, sending half of her upper body down to where her arms and wings are trapped in a bind against her own body while it makes its way to the Houndoom's stomach. Her round breasts tuck inside his jaws where the hellhound certainly goes to lick over. The tongue pumps up and down between them, bathes them in his hot saliva, and laps at her nipples' tips to enjoy Shasta's moaning and wriggling inside his bulging throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his hands free, the Houndoom snakes his hands down her hips and in between her thighs to slide his fingers over the rim of her slit. This forces a quick yelp out of Shasta as his fingers probe at her pussy, gliding back and forth over the soft and warm flesh to even tickle and rub her clit. Her nerves ignite with arousal with her muscles shivering violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nyyghhh...h-he can't do this to me. If only we hadn't been spotted, we could have gotten the drop on these evil d-d-dahhh-hahhhh...!\" She endeavors to curse at the dogs, but can't even keep a focused mind as the finger slip inside and begin to feel around her wet walls. The vaginal flesh throbs at the digits' presence, clenching down on them while they work their way up inside her groin with his thumb rubbing over her sensitive love-button on the outside. All the while, the Houndoom continues to swallow his prey down, taking her breasts down his throat along with her arms, wings, and abdomen. Her bouquet of tails dance outside with half of her body shivering outside by the canine fingering her pussy without mercy. Shasta's rear manages to arrive at his outstretched jaws, giving the Houndoom a coy idea of sliding his two fingers out from her pre-drooling slit to give a spank to her round ass, all until he swallows her butt inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tongue is quick to dive in and stab inside her vagina, lapping at the pre oozing from it with Shasta groaning within his body. She even finds herself beginning to enjoy being used like this in a dark, twisted way down inside of herself that only makes her quiver more apparently for the Houndoom. His squelching tongue throbs and thrashes about, digging in as far as it can go before Shasta releases her orgasm. The Dreycara was unable to hold her unwilling ecstasy out and showers it over into the Houndoom's mouth as she cries out inside the narrow, fleshy tunnel dragging her down into the rumbling stomach. Her muffled groans and sudden flush of her juices was all the Houndoom needed to know that he had finally overwhelmed her willpower, and which he takes the time to soak in his victory by licking up all of the cum drizzling into his mouth before finally tilting his head back and lets her throbbing legs and tails slide down into his throat that ladders the girl down into his stomach. He shuts his mouth closed around her hindpaws, gulping loudly to send the last of her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShasta is forced to curl up inside the thigh stomach with her tails and wings folded and sprawled completely around her to make room inside. Digestive fluids pool up to her shoulders as she whimpers with juices seeping from her pussy and her body still hot and aroused. On the outside, the Houndoom sits down on his rear, rubbing over the round, orange belly sagging out and gurgling with the legendary pokemon digesting inside of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaahhhhhh. You tasted deliciously well, slut! Putting a 'oh powerful pokemon' like you to rest like this is too satisfying. You can't even use your powers and strength correctly. Now all of that power is going to digest with you and help me become even stronger. Just think, a simple pokemon like me defeating a legendary? It's almost too good to be true.\" The Houndoom laughs as the bubbling fluids overtake Shasta. But it didn't matter to her anymore. She had already given up and passed out inside the dog's fat gut. The canine glances over to his older brother, seeing the shiny Houndoom slurp down the Flygon's tail and pat his equally round belly. The blue and orange groans out as he fondles the sloshing belly while it bounces with Ruga's struggles and moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger Houndoom calls out to his brother, \"Mmmm...well done brother. They never stood a chance against us. I say we head back into our cabin and digest these two as we celebrate today's victory. We can go inform the other leaders that the Dreycara has been defeated and disposed afterwards. Our master will surely reward us.\" The older brother snickers to himself as the Flygon trapped inside of him continues to protest and groan inside the round gut. And with that, the two Houndooms walk back to their home with the apocalypse's heroes stewing inside their stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew was watching Shasta along her journey by her psychic powers, watching the Dreycara and Flygon outwit the Houndooms and ready to battle, but it seems Shasta's plan for using the tree as a distraction ironically lead her to be distracted. The Houndooms captured both her and Ruga again, and this time, there was no escape. Mew watches in horror as her last hope is sent sliding down and orgasming down a Houndoom's throat to be digested in its fat stomach. She releases the image, having seen enough. She had no idea of how to tell the news of Shasta's demise to Latina and Magira, having to describe that she had been eaten, but found pleasure in it...</span></div></div>",

The small explosion sent him sliding back through the ground, breaking a crater line in the dirt with him from the force of the impact. Ruga lied on his back against the floor and gagged out, struggling to just breathe by the attack. He lifts his upper body up with his wobbling arms, but only gets shot back down with another aura blast by his brain-washed mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...Sh-Shasta...\" He sobbed, unable to fight any longer. The Dreycara only grinned as a response to his desperate plea, and slowly and quite casually walks over to the fallen dragon. The Flygon gasps in utter horror and unleashes his signature dragon breath attack at Shasta, but only a brush of blue flames come out and hit Shasta. The fire-type scoffs at the weak endeavor and merely sweeps off the soot left over from her shoulder, completely unharmed in her powerful legendary state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe plants a hindpaw on top of Ruga's chest, pinning him down to halt any pathetic struggles left in the dragon's defeated will. Ruga squirms under the constraining paw, grabbing her leg in a weak attempt to remove it. The weighing limb doesn't budge, and Ruga simply tires himself out from the useless exercise, submitting to his past companion's corrupted whims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older Houndoom brother clasps lightly in the success of the show, calling out to Shasta from afar with an amused smirk, \"Very well done, <i>slave</i>. Do with the dragon as you please.\" The younger Houndoom snickered next to his brother, too busy eyeing Shasta's body from behind that presented dirty fantasies in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe added to the compliment, \"Mmmmm...brother, you were right to decide to infect her. She'll make for a nice pet for us at home and an excellent soldier for our campaign. '<i>Legendary</i>' seems to be a fallen name for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older Houndoom smiles with his sibling, watching again in Shasta's debacle to see what she would do with the defeated Flygon now. Shasta licks her chops in a predatory gesture. A thick Flygon would surely be filling for her never-ending hunger for meat, but perhaps she could use Ruga to join her ranks and follow under her command. Then again, he proved to be weak and very unwilling. Shasta liked unwilling prey. Pre glistens from the underside of her crotch, signifying that the infection's desire for constant pleasure was also an issue, so maybe she would actually infect him in a pleasuring form.</span></div></div>",

She added pressure against her footpaw atop Ruga's chest to listen to him squeal one last time before lifting off from him. He let in heaves of air in the act of what seemed like mercy, panting loudly as his eyelids were beginning to descend over his eyes. However, the Dreycara's next act would have him widen his gaze in complete and surprised shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary stood above him, with Ruga's head beneath her slick crotch that allowed him to stare into the pulsing, hot rim of Shasta's vagina. The Flygon blushed immensely by the sight, disturbing him of how much he was enjoying this at the end of his final moments. \"Sh....Shasta...?\" He worriedly asked her deaf ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly murrs before crouching down and pressing Ruga's head in between her legs. Her furry thighs brush past the sides of his head and squeeze it tightly between them, forcing Ruga to yelp at the odd gesture. His face was now firmly nudged against her wet lips, eliciting terrible ideals for the Flygon in his time of need. Of course, Ruga struggled out from under Shasta's body, but was leaning more to the side of squirming in pleasure then escape. The infected Dreycara opened her mouth, releasing a steamy sigh of arousal as she squats down closer on her knees, to the point where her vaginal lips begin stuffing Ruga's face inside! The Flygon shuddered as the feeling of fleshy, gooey, and hot pleasure run over his head as the folds scoop it up powerfully and trap him inside. From the light of world turned into a dark and tight tunnel that winced with the dragon's filling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShasta growled as her hips bucked once with a jump of pleasure, beginning the consumption of her unbirthing meal by sliding the dragon's long neck closer into her body. The length of fleshy meat shifted up with a lubricated journey thanks to Shasta's downpour of her pre seeping down. Ruga, writhing inside of his lover's own crotch helplessly became seduced into licking inside the vaginal walls, collecting a good amount of the fluid into his exploring maw as well as satisfaction from seeing the tunnel clench and wince happily by the act. Shasta tilted her head back, gritting her fangs together as her hands stroked along her furry body, feeling a mad rush of warmth course through her blood. Her hands run over her breasts and slim down the sides of her figure, grasping at her thighs and belly bulge. Ruga's shoulders met with the love cave's entrance, squeezing inside the constricting flesh to completely trap the dragon's chances for freedom. Even if had tried though, the Flygon was too busy tasting and wriggling around for his predator's enjoyment, not necessarily caring for what lied ahead for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Houndoom brothers watch the legendary's devouring with glee, becoming somewhat excited as well. The younger Houndoom brother was beginning to become absorbed in the scene and fingered around his own genitals. His older brother easily noticed his sibling's desperate state of arousal. Giving him a slap on the rear, the shiny Houndoom nudged his head over at Shasta to his brother, \"Go see if you can help her out some. The battle has clearly been won.\" The younger brother's cheeks blushed a little at the forepaw groped around his rump, but his evil smile and determined urge for release never had left his face. He eagerly made his way over to the two helpless pokemon corrupted by the infection's cause and stood behind Shasta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis arms hook under hers, clasping over her furred tits before sneering, \"Heh, need some help, my slut?\" His palms toy with her nipples under the coat of pale fur as his fingers swirl over the breasts. He scaled them in each hand, testing gravity as he alternated his squeezes, gropes, and pushes which roused his knotted cock to poke out to the outside world. The hot canine member rode up along the girl's rear, lining over the crease of her cheeks under her tails that coil around his body lovingly. The Houndoom trembles in pleasure as his slave willingly subjects herself to his wishes as she slurps in a Flygon's chest within her pussy to globe out a large bulge from her abdomen. Her hands latch on over his, aiding him in his pursuit for enticement  which inevitably led for more pre to squirt and drip from Shasta's consuming vagina. The dog softly humped at her rear as his hands clench tightly on the perfectly fitting orbs in his hands, all the while, he licked Shasta's neck with his panting breath. The Dreycara chuckled and moaned some with the satisfaction of being dominated as she too, dominated her prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuga's belly was taken within her, leaving his terribly aroused member and throbbing sac to rub up over the throbbing walls sucking him in. The fluids polish his cock in a blanket of goo, which forced the dragon to start humping inside her, thrusting powerfully in the tight space he had to orgasm. Ruga's desperate and horny needs destroyed his only sense of sanity left, making him merely as this infected creature's toy and meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis legs follow with his body as a sphincter opened up around his head to drag it in, pulling his body deeper into Shasta's womb. His eyes roll back within the narrow chamber while his crotch rings with happiness in grinding against the pussy walls. His feet and tail disappear between the nether lips, lumping out nice bulges to collect together in one massive and round one doming out of the Dreycara's gut. Shasta's own hind quarters quaked and struggled to stand in the crashing pulse of ecstasy washing over her, having her prey squirm inside while her pleasure hole with another male pumps up and down her bum and backside. She pressed her hands deep into the round belly, feeling the Flygon hump in the cum-filling organ groaning loudly in his mate's innards. With one last jolt of his waist, Ruga finally reached his climax and shot out his orgasm, squirting out cum strings over his slime-covered body as the walls compact together to work him in. Hot seed coat his stomach and crotch that make him practically scream in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Houndoom listens to the muffled yell, pleased with such a demise for the one who stood up against him and the infection's cause. \"<i>Hrreeeegh</i>...he won't be missed. But don't worry. I'll be happy to take his place as your sex partner.\" The younger Houndoom cheers as he backs away a little to see Shasta's butt coated by his own pre. There and then, the infected girl orgasms with a startled bark, letting loose a flush of cum out of her vagina, along with a few drops of Ruga's seed that escaped the womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older softly snickered to himself as he rests in a chair, watching the sex take place before him. The trio of the infection's followers had made their way back inside the Houndooms' cabin, although, the younger brother was simply too aroused to give up just yet. He sat in a chair himself, but with Shasta and her filled belly on top of his lap to thrust his burning rod deep into her pussy. The infected slave moaned helplessly in soft whimpers of bliss as the male pile-drives the girl's waist. Her gut squish against his chest and her tails flail throughout the air and occasionally coil over the Houndoom's legs by the rough penetration of her bloomed folds. The normal Houndoom grunted, unable to speak as his climax quickly rushed through his cock and filled the Dreycara's waist even more by pouring cannon-shots of dog seed into it. Shasta arcs her back with the Houndoom's plunges, cumming again herself for the slimy liquids to blend together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sibling ventilates air at a rapid pace, letting his tongue wobble inside his mouth with air coaxing over the girl's face and neck. Shasta limply slides to the wooden flooring, sharing the same pants as the Houndoom that just fucked her with cum pooling on the panels. The older brother gets up from his chair and steps over to their new pet to use. The shiny Houndoom squats down by Shasta, pressing a hand on her large belly to feel the motionless and unconscious Flygon being processed into cum. He grinned and pressed Shasta down on her back before getting on his hands and knees above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ridiculed, \"You're going to have to get rid off all that juice within your system, slave, one way or another.\" Just then, he slams his own arousal into the already gaping and leaking vagina, causing the Dreycara to yelp happily once more. And yet again, she was in another round of Houndoom sex. She wouldn't mind though. Pleasing her masters was all that she knew of now, forgetting all of her past and friends by the infection's corruption. She widens her legs for dominator to get the most pleasure he could on her. His furry and muscular body begins to sweat as he shows a sign of weakness for the first time, overcome with physical satisfaction. The sibling kneels down behind his brother, rubbing his hands over the shiny canine's chest, backside, and shoulders, grinding their bodies against one another to rouse him again. The normal Houndoom licks his brother's neck and eventually starts nipping his ear; too distracted with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so ends Shasta's story. A defeated and infected legendary, which helped the infected masters' campaign better than before, surely dooming the world from all that was good by turning them into sex-craving ravenous monsters. Her intentions to save everyone turned out to destroy them...</span></div></div>",

She leans down next to Ruga, seeing the fear and disappointment in his tired eyes. Licking her chops, she slides herself on top of the dragon, confusing but scaring him terribly. He squirms in a mad panic in an attempt to push Shasta off, however, she grabs his wrists and effectively pinned them to the grass. Ruga sobbed as she rubbed her waist over his round abdomen along with her breasts taunting his face as they squish against his chest. Shasta's bouquet of tails frolicked in the air, wagging and wavering with joy as she rubs herself over the dragon's bod to taunt him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough becoming somewhat excited by the strange act, Ruga was still unaware of Shasta's actions until her tongue dragged itself up along his neck. Her open maw aimed her fangs at his exposed, green flesh, and Ruga was all too late to push the infected Dreycara off. She chomped down, sending the infection's venom inside his body as Ruga yelped  under the helplessness he was subdued in. His body's squirming was at an all new power, writhing wildly more than ever before while Shasta held down her victim, grinning a disturbing smile to see him fight against the overpowering infection. Resistance was futile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, his struggles decimated into more twitches, signalling Shasta that he had given up. His eye color slowly transitioned into a purple hue and his whimpers became soft growls. The Dreycara victoriously stood up from the newly infected Flygon, grinning as Ruga's thoughts, memory, and sanity were all destroyed with his hope. The feral rolled back up to its feet, still hurt from Shasta's previous battle, but now with the infection's power, gave it enough strength to endure and ignore such pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Houndoom brothers chuckle with each other before the older orders, \"Very good my pet.

Lead us to her, and we may even let you claim her as a meal if she resists once more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShasta only answers as the Flygon walks up to the Houndoom brothers, ready to follow his new masters with, \"...<i>Yes, master</i>.\"</span></div></div>",

Around the cave and after the victorious battle with its residents, he first spots Shasta, still infected and under their control as she has a defeated Alakazam on the ground panting. The Dreycara eagerly gets down on her knees to spread Magira's legs wide open, all before leaning her mouth close to the psychic's own nethers to give them a quick slurp. The sudden lick forces a yelp out of Magira, which only prompts Shasta to dive in for another lap, and then another lap. Every smear of that hot tongue elicits the Alakazam's mouth to free out pleasured and unwilling moans to echo in the cave, while also wettening her pussy to the maw of the Dreycara she was beaten by. Shasta wags all of her tails as she goes to work her tongue around over and inside Magira's warm pussy, overwhelming the Alakazam almost enjoy being used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older Houndoom is sated by the sight and checks over at the other girl that needed to be dealt with. Latina the Latias was arm-locked from behind by the younger Houndoom brother as she kicks and squirms to escape from his hold, all until she is approached by Ruga with his large, wobbling green cock erect from his groin. The infected Flygon smacks his wet lips as he grabs the Latias' thighs to spread legs open to view her crotch. The Latias girl blushes and writhes in Houndoom's grapple with the Flygon approaching and aiming his cock close to her red nethers as the canine holding her drags his tongue along the back of her neck. He sneers, \"I hope you don't mind, but our slaves are very pent up with arousal. They just want to borrow your body a bit for some fun before we eat ya. I hope you understand~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, the Flygon rams his member into her folds, alarming and massive to be taken by Latina before she shivers helplessly with each wet slap delivered inside her body as she feels the stick of meat penetrate her and use her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older hellhound glances back down at Mew with a coy expression. \"Sorry Mew, but you're too good to just pass up. Once I swallow and digest your legendary hide, I will gain significant powers and strength from you. You obviously haven't tapped into your full power if a mere hound can beat you, but don't worry yourself. You will become something greater very soon...\" He smiles before opening his drooling maw to slide her groaning head inside as she squirms in his hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud gurgles emit within the ambiance of the cave. The older Houndoom pats his large and orange belly, groping it to feel the Mew inside squirm helplessly in turmoil as she was easily guzzled down by the superior being. He releases a relaxed sigh from his maw before relaxing back, letting his stomach do its work on the legendary. He eyes back over to see Magira, or at least, what was once Magira, stand up with purple eyes and a salivating mouth from being infected. A clear bite mark is shown on her arm thanks to Shasta's help as the Dreycara basks in the victory of claiming another feral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the far end of the cave though, are two Latias legs kicking and thrashing before they slide down a Flygon's throat to join with the rest of her body down inside Ruga's belly to digest into his food. The younger Houndoom brother laughs and rubs the belly for the dragon to tease Latina while she was still conscious, \"You were moaning pretty loud back there, girl, when he was creaming inside of you. It's almost like you were enjoying it, heh heh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older Houndoom grins from their victory today and relaxes, allowing the soft gurgling of his gut soothe him into a nice, digestive sleep.</span></div></div>",

The Lucara felt a sudden surge of energy prowl throughout her entire body as it began to glow with vibrant aura. Ruga's expression was a little taken back at the sight of his mate possessing such energy, and wondered about her next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stand aside, Ruga. I'll take care of these two.\" Shasta spoke out with great confidence. The Flygon reluctantly nodded and backed away from the targeted spot the oncoming Charizards were aimed for, somewhat scared for his mate while she stood alone to face off the ferals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Let's test out my strength. Hopefully I won't regret this decision.</i>\" Her thoughts trembled inside her head. However, she braced herself, preparing her aura attack by collecting the energy into being packed around her arms. Her fur began to float out and glow as she charged a deadly Aura Beam. With the infected Charizards honing in fast, the Lucara released the beam, sending it out rapidly towards the dragons. The ferals saw this tactic coming although, and spiraled out of the way while shooting several fireballs into the ray of aura emitting out of Shasta's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lucara yelped as the beam exploded from the incoherent fire attacks bolting through it, having been disrupted and uncontrollable. Her body flew back and grinded against the ground, creating a cratered trail from her floor slide. Ruga cried out for her as more and more fire attacks continued to bombard her, combusting out and forcing Shasta to remain on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Flygon immediately lifted out with his wings, flying over to his partner and only to be shot down. An infected Charizard came winding down, crashing into the Flygon and tackling him back into the earth. He yelped as the thick dragons began to grapple it out, struggling to overcome the other. Meanwhile, the other Charizard happily landed next to the fallen Lucara within the smoldering crater and approached her body. Shasta grunted in misery on her back as she watched it inspect her body, looking up and down her spent, plus injured, form with luscious desire. The Charizard licked its lips and grabbed Shasta by her legs, cupping its hands under her thighs before bringing her groin close to its crotch. She looked down to see a large cock erect out and wobble helplessly at the female's presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnwilling to go through with it, she began to twist and turn her body, endeavoring to escape the feral's grasp. Nothing gives. Nothing slows down. Shasta winces and barks out as the thick dragonhood jams itself into her folds, sliding its meaty length deep into her pussy. \"Gr-grrraaaoohhh...N-n-nooo....\"  She chokes out as the black Charizard begins his humping rampage. First, starting off slow with mere tugs and nudges, until velocitizing into a clear humping motion, thrusting deep into the slickening walls of the Lucara's vagina. Ruga called out to you, seeing your horrible predicament, which consequently, gave the other Charizard enough time to push Ruga over and release a flamethrower onto him. The Flygon cries out and is unable to escape the flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feral ceased its attack to see Ruga barely conscious now, allowing it to proceed with the next step. Grabbing his shoulders, the Charizard raised the weakened Flygon to his knees to slap his face against its hardening cock. Although a female would've pleasured the infected more, a male would certainly suffice. Its bulbous member's head jabbed into Ruga's cheek, already spurting out beads of pre out. The bug dragon whimpered in response as the cock entered his mouth and stuffed his open maw by its size. After a quick tug, the Charizard started its blowjob punishment, grinding its hot girth along Ruga's tongue with his saliva pouring over it. By now, the Charizard forcefully raping Shasta was at an all-time rapid pace, stabbing its girth deeper and louder into the Lucara's nether region with audible, wet slaps and growls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShasta lost all of her sense in struggling and limply let the shiny feral do with her body as it pleased. She not only failed to evolve, but to even use her powers wisely. Her rushed tactic would lead to the terrible demise that the Charizards' had planned for both Shasta and Ruga. Through the barrage of rocking humps, Shasta looked over to her mate, only to discover that he was now willingly sucking against the feral dragon's cock, motioning his head back and forth with the Charizard's thrusts. The infected had its purple eyes closed while drool seeped down from its open jaws. Ruga was truly doing an excellent job in pleasing his new-found dominator. With a sudden jab, Shasta moaned out, having the feral atop her jab her sensitive end of her vaginal tunnel. Having the Charizard gain much more motivation from the sound, it wrestled against the spot once more, stabbing it again and again for Shasta to yell out more in ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes rolled back as her ears flipped down, forcing the Lucara to claw at the dirt below her in utter pleasure. The Charizard roared, ejecting his hot seed deep into the Lucara's cunny, painting the pussy's walls. It pulled out of her, spurting out its pale seed over her frontside to bathe in. Shasta's last thoughts were of the unimaginable joy and displeasure she felt, all the while of staring at Ruga who had pulled his mouth away, letting the infected dragon he sucked on to smother his blushed face in gooey cum. Without a single second to waste later, Shasta passed out in exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Charizard licked over the somewhat sloshing belly of the Lucara from having its seed swirl inside her midsection. Its tongue basks over the swollen out furry stomach, getting a real kick of victory as it slurped more of her body down. Her motionless legs and tails slide down into its watering mouth, fitting inside its throat quite nicely after disappearing from the outside air. Her body was forced into a balled up position, protruding outside the scaly mass of the infected Charizard to rub beautifully. It grinned and belched out in triumph, successfully using and devouring a legendary's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeeking to its side, the other shiny Charizard finished its meal off after the kicking feet and thrashing tail of the Flygon were gulped down, giving off the same bulging vibe for the feral. The feral dragons took flight now, heading towards their nests to digest their easy prey after such a simple battle. The Lucara's cockiness led to her couple's downfall. Mew looked through the mental image of the Charizards vanishing in the horizon with their hammocking scaled bellies, disappointed that Shasta was unable to tap into her power correctly. Now everyone was surely doomed.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, the Lucara\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aura wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the only thing glowing purple. Several lavender spots shined through the wall of mist, emitting soft growls and groans to terrify Latina and Ruga some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany ferals began to approach the trio, circling around the small group as Ruga prepares to fend them off. Shasta quickly presses a paw at his chest, stopping him as she warned, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re probably Magira\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ferals. They shouldn't harm us as long as they know we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re here to help her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuga settled down, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh\u00e2\u0080\u00a6you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re probably right. Just be careful, Shasta.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He told his mate as she approached the closest infected pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stops in front of a Grimer who curiously tilted its head to see the girl willingly present herself to it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re here to save the Alakazam who controls you. Can you lead us to her?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Shasta asked calmly. The purple-eyed blob simply stared at her for a moment, trying to comprehend what the strange canine was doing. After a low grunt, the Grimer unleashed its fluid-like arms out to grab Shasta! She yelps in surprise and struggles in the thick grey slime morphing around her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuga\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bones winced in shock as Shasta turned to run, but gets caught in the Grimer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grasp against her backside, pulling her body back to submerge parts of her in the goo. The Grimer snickers before its condensed tongue slaps up against Shasta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neck, digging through the bright fur to drench her torso in its fluids. The dragon quickly unleashed his wings out, gliding towards the infected Grimer in fiery rage to save the Lucara while leaving Latina behind. However, a sudden flying pokemon collides into his body, forcing him down along with it to smash into the ground. The Flygon barks out in pain and rolls over onto his hands and knees, looking up with a cold scowl to face his opponent. An infected Archeops stood in his way between his position and Shasta. Yellow feathered breasts puff out of its chest, though lowering down the avian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abdomen, swells a somewhat chubby belly. The feral stands idly in front of its prey, smacking its scaled chops and it eyes the dragon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meaty state. Ruga impatiently growls and unleashes a stream of Dragon Breath towards the prehistoric creature. The Archeops swiftly flies forward and spirals around the stream of blue flames to aim towards Ruga. The Flygon gasps before connecting friction with the feral yet again, except this time, the Archeops manages to straddle herself atop the Flygon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gut. A twisted murr rumbles out of her long neck as her watering smile stretches out more sadistically. Ruga stared into the slimy cavern hovering above his face, noticing several blue embers flicker and glow inside her maw. His eyes widen as the infected Archeops prepares her own counter attack. Dragon Breath flowed out and scorched down against the Flygon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s writhing head. He yelped in pain as his own type performed significant damage against his skin. The Archeops attack was merely a short shot, but effectively immobilized her prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraning her head down closer, her tongue slaps up against Ruga\u00e2\u0080\u0099s saddened face as he groans with the heavy pleasured licks. Saliva lines down his face, coating his head in the clear ooze throughout his slow demise of being this creature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruga!\" His mate called out to him who continued to struggle in the Grimer's muck. Desperate for rescue of any kind, she flicks her sight over to Latina, hoping that she could still help. Thankfully the Latias was still alive and not in a feral\u00e2\u0080\u0099s belly, however, Latina was currently being wrapped into a mass of tentacles, spiraling over her limbs and suggestive sections of her body. She trembled in the mass of aqua-colored tendrils with pink tips, forced into stillness in their vice grasp as her captor was finally revealed. A purple-eyed Tangrowth growled with satisfaction in seeing in the cute meal it snagged. The Latias anthro shuddered as the vines rubbed over her red breasts, wiggled her thighs and arms, tightened over her abdomen, and teased her groin with slithering shifts. A single tentacle encircled around her neck to rise up to her blushed face, aiming near her mouth. It pressed at her panting lips, worming its way into her mouth for the girl to suckle on. It pushed in deeper while throbbing around the salivating opening, working back and forth inside the maw to elicit her groaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVines quickly began to enclose on her twitching body, which was dying in struggles and increased in pleasured reflexes, and found her sensitive spots. A tentacle digs in between the crease of her bright crimson rump and plunges into her pucker, whereas two others begin to drive into her tight pussy. The pre-glistening walls clench against the exploring tendrils and mirror the mouth-thrusting tentacle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movements, pile driving Latina to her utmost highest enticement. Muffled moans garble around her stuffed mouth as her eyes roll back to the tip of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShasta trembled at the sight, yet oddly felt a little excited in her terrifying experience. Suddenly, the Grimer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goo had molded over her legs, rising up to her groin to give her Latina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s similar guilty pleasure. The thick mush crams deep between her nether-lips, stretching out her folds as the fluid floods the vaginal tunnel. The Lucara gasps and begins to wince in fast jolts rather than squirming for escape. How foolish it was of her to think that these ferals worked for Magira. These creatures were the same disgusting beasts Shasta and Ruga faced during their quest. Her thoughts burned into her mind, \"<i>Is this how it ends\u00e2\u0080\u00a6?</i>\" Her question is answered once an infected Sandslash walks up to the captured legendary, licking her furry torso and breasts. The feral wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let the Grimer have all the fun. Several ferals surround the trio now, knowing that there was no escape for them now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Archeops atop of Ruga slides off the defeated dragon to investigate its progress. He whimpered as his limbs failed to move much, forced at the mercy of the infected creature. His green body was left to shine with a large coat of saliva blanketing most of his downed form. The Archeops licked its lips before grabbing the Flygon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tail, slipping it into her jaws. Ruga grumbled in distress as his body was being dragged back and stuffed into the Archeops\u00e2\u0080\u0099 throat. Latina, meanwhile, had already orgasmed twice in the rampage of dominating vines swirling inside her and over her. Pores from the tendril\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tips finally struck in their final pound, spurting out sap as cum into her rectum, vagina, and mouth, washing her innards with its sticky warmth. Latina shuddered and garbled a yell through the bubbling drool around the vine stuck inside her mouth, fainting in the mad rush of pleasure to lie limply in the Tangrowth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mass of tentacles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShasta whimpers as the Sandslash and Grimer have a tug-of-war match with her body, yanking the legendary back and forth by their slimy maws to who collects and earns her as a meal. Shasta couldn't wait for whoever the victor was. Her energy had already been drained by her struggles, enticed physical joy, and the Grimer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s absorbing power. With the loud squelches and growls around her, the Lucara was quick to pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bundle of Lucara tails dangle out from the Grimer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s maw, and the infected blob creature happily lets the furry extremities dwindle into its body. The victorious Grimer releases a liquidy belch as its body protruded out a bit more from the girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stuffing. The Sandslash hissed and pounced away into the forest to find itself an easy course that the Lucara had proven. The blob surely doubted it would have another willingly piece of meat to humbly approach it and offer itself to the feral like this meal had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the field lied a fat Archeops, murring in bliss as a Flygon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crying head vanishes into her mouth. Forming a lump down into her scaly throat and join the large bulge formed in her feathery stomach. Behind it stood a Tangrowth, working an anthro Latias\u00e2\u0080\u0099 twitching legs into one of its vines, tentacle-voring the limbs while her body outstretched the consuming vine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rubbery texture. The massive orb sucked down deep into the mass of tentacles, disappearing in the midsection once the unconscious girl was dumped into the Tangrowth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stomach. The plant feral chortled in a triumphant manner, as the infected digested their prey into nothingness.</span></div></div>",

The Ninetales figured that this infected Delibird was willing to help and still conscious of its actions, and instead of eating or biting her, it simply gifted her with healing supplies. What reason did she even have to doubt it? It clearly just wanted to aid her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Shasta gagged out in a sudden jolt when her body had suddenly become stiff! Her muscles couldn't budge and her head began to swirl in all directions. She looked down to see the fruit she had bitten out of were seeping with an odd coloration of purple juice, completely abnormal to what the color of the substance was originally supposed to be. Her blacking out eyes caught a shot of the Delibird grinning its beak as her body fell back, immobilized while the Ninetales passed out completely from the poisoned berries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infected bird quickly went to work and grabbed her ankles, pulling her into its large bag that it carried. Her body would suffice as an excellent gift to the Delibird's master. The feral was certainly amused in how easy it was to trick the Ninetales into knocking herself out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuga, still in midair, glanced down to see Shasta's unconscious head to poke out from the Delibird's sack and pushed inward. The Flygon gasped with his back facing his dragon opponent, allowing the infected Altaria sometime strike him with her fierce Dragon Breath. Ruga yelped out as the scorching blue flames surrounded his body. He quickly plummeted toward the forest floor, barking out once more from his rough impact with the dirt on his back. The Altaria grinned and circled down towards his soot smeared form as he struggled to move. She shot out a small Dragon Pulse to finish the job with the small blue ring combusting around his body, wounding him greatly into writhing tiredness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Delibird immediately snagged the Flygon's tail, dragging his limp and thick body into its bag to stuff him down with the fainted Ninetales. His groaning body nestled in with her fuzzy form within the massive assortment of fruits and objects. The infected bird tightened the opening of the sack and hauled it over his shoulder. The male Delibird struggled a bit, but began to trudge back into the forest towards its master's camp along with the Altaria keeping watch of the anthro-filled bag to make sure they didn't try escaping. Ruga grumbled as his and Shasta's bodies dragged against the ground, sliding against the back of the sack during their trail to who-knows-what. The Flygon writhed inside, kicking and pushing his arms against the tightly woven walls, even using his claws to try and slash the tough material, but nothing ever seemed to rip or weakened in his efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe helplessly ceased his endeavors for freedom, figuring he would have a better fighting chance of escaping once the Delibird opened the bag again to take them out. However, the Flygon worriedly asked himself in his thoughts, \"How can I get Shasta out too?\" He hugged his unconscious mate, moving her head about to waken her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the Altaria outside noticed the movements within the bag, quickly giving it a swift kick to hit Ruga in the stomach. He gagged out and froze still, struggling to bear through his exhaustion and pain. Although, the bag gaped open!</span></div></div>",

The purple-eyed pokemon growled with grinning toothy maws within the spacious cavern the two meals had been dropped out in. Shasta began to stir awake, grumbling as she rubbed her head once the numbing poison subsided. The Ninetales open her eyes to a terrible scene with incoming ferals from every corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Wha...What?! Wh-Where am I...?!\" She pleaded as Ruga struggled to stand and face the horde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were kidnapped by that Delibird...This doesn't look, Shasta.\" He worriedly sobbed as the infected continued to come closer down on the two easy snacks. Suddenly, a snap of someone's fingers silenced them and caused them to hold their guard immediately. Out from the infected crowd stepped out an Alakazam, female from what the two could tell from its figure and lack of a stache. Her eye color remained a fierce hazel, yet the sinister smirk along her mouth labeled her as the psychic Mew and warned them about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...what have my pets captured today? A beautiful Ninetales and a meaty Flygon? Oh my, I may have to just reward the ones who caught such an excellent pair!\" Her echoing voice spoke out through the small army of ferals. The Delibird's and Altaria's excitement shot up, sparkling their admiration in their disturbing lavender eyes. The Alakazam continued, \"Oh, where are my manners? My name is Magira. And the two of you are...?\" She trailed off for them to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShasta growled out, \"Where's Latina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagira only smiled wider in response. \"Wasn't expecting an answer like that.\" She began to walk in a circle around the two, using a sarcastic pondering expression, \"I'm not sure where that Latias could even be. I think I last recalled her meeting...what was it again? Ah, that's right. One of my precious ferals, a Zangoose to be exact, was simply too busy gulping down her kicking legs, and I couldn't just interrupt one of my pets during his dinner time.\" Her eyes reflected the harshness of her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuga stepped back, \"You...You're sick! I thought you hated the ones controlling the infection! Aren't you forced to do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Alakazam laughed, \"Yes, I was quite resistant to the idea, but seeing how powerful the other masters are and to see how powerful that I have become, I'm all for it. Let's just suggest I switched to the winning team is all. You would do the same if you were in my position. Becoming these animals' guide for prosperity was the greatest thing I could ever do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShasta roared and lunged out for the psychic, yet, falls short as the numbness in her leg causes her to plunge back to the rocky earth. Magira cackled at the sight and replied, \"Oh how sad. Say, how do the two of you even know about Latina and my background? That must mean...\" Her eyes lighten up in sadistic happiness. \"No, you can't be serious. Mew sent you two, didn't she? Is that little runt still alive these days? I think I'll need to send out some scouting groups of ferals to find where she's been hiding all this time. My ferals can track the path  you two have come from to retrace your steps. My oh my, this catch is turning out better each second that goes by!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Alakazam padded over to both Shasta and Ruga, having her eyes glow in a bright-blue hue that also outlined the two struggling victims. From her psychic abilities, they are forced onto their knees, frozen stiff by Magira's power to weep to her mercy. She glanced over at the infected Delibird and Altaria that had captured them in the first place, calling out to them, \"With this nice bunch you managed to bring here, I'll leave one of them to you. However, I'll need to devour one in order to gain their energy and powers as your fee, so the feral who doesn't receive a meal shall be pleasured by me.\" She winked at the two infected, arousing them and hyping their anxiousness up dramatically. Drool watered from their beaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShasta whined through her shut closed muzzle, writhing within her kinetic binds of energy. Magira looked back and forth between the two, questioning, \"Hmmmm....Now this is certainly a difficult decision. Should I go with the sexy female, or the plump male...? I think I want...\" Both Shasta's and Ruga's faces went pale as her finger came down, pointing at...</span></div></div>",

The Alakazam called out in triumph, \u201cI think you\u2019ll fit nicely inside me, Ninetales. Ignoring such a beautiful figure would be foolish of me to not have you. My pets may deal with the Flygon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShasta\u2019s ears lowered down as Ruga\u2019s shocked face glanced over to her. The dragon flailed helplessly in his statue-like hold down on his knees from Magira\u2019s overwhelming power, failing into rescuing his mate. Shasta gulped as her body was being dragged by the psychic force closer to the Alakazam and reached to the point of mere inches away from each other. The infected Altaria was the first of the two from the duo\u2019s captors to dash towards Ruga, eager to collect the Flygon as her meal before the Delibird could. Hopping up, her taloned feet came down against his shoulders, perching atop his upper body while also causing the dragon to tilt and fall against his back. He grumbled in ire as the Altaria stared down at his body beneath her feminine form, letting her underside do the taunting for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the clouded puff over the Altaria\u2019s midsection and underside, a clear goo slowly glistened out to drip on Ruga\u2019s face. He blushed in response as the Altaria feral used her wings to spread open the cloud material, showing the blue skin of her groin that revealed her blooming vagina. The folds were slick and hot with arousal, and the feral would take the best of both worlds of hunger and horniness. She lowered her legs down, stuffing the unwilling and surprised Flygon\u2019s head up into her pussy. Magira watched from afar, amused with the entire show of seeing the Flygon\u2019s neck shift deep into the vaginal tunnel of the Altaria as the feral cooed in enticement. Ruga\u2019s aroused hard-on protruding out from between his legs obviously signified his own involuntary treatment, which sparked a cruel idea in the Alakazam\u2019s corrupt mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn you go, my dear.\u201d She spoke to her soon-to-be-prey as she began to finger around her own nether region. Shasta couldn\u2019t bare the sight of the Alakazam\u2019s folds beginning to loosen and pulsate. The blushed lips throbbed for the Ninetales\u2019 body, wet with pre already as Magira stepped over the kneeling meal. Shasta submissively closes her eyes once the psychic\u2019s waist had descended down onto her cranium, slurping in her muzzle and head! The Ninetales\u2019 pessimistic thoughts wavered in her mind as her head slipped in deeper into the clenching, wet walls surrounding her, working up into the Alakazam\u2019s womb with each and every dragging motion. Her love juices rinsed throughout Shasta\u2019s coat of bright pale fur, clumping it together in sticky patches and lubricating her ride upward much faster for the psychic\u2019s delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ninetales whimpered in thought, \u201c<i>A-A-Aggh\u2026Is this how it really ends? Why did I even trust that Delibird in the first place</i>?\u201d The only thing that had answered her mournful question was the ambient squelching of the vaginal innards securing a majority of her stunned state. Her entire upper body was neatly tucked between Magira\u2019s folds, forcing her tails to fold and wrap around her legs to fit inside without it hurting her. Magira groaned as Shasta\u2019s head poked out of the psychic\u2019s stomach, allowing Magira to cup her hand over the bulge and rub over as her other hand glided and played with a breast. Through her flush of pleasure, her aroused mind began to lose concentration of her powers, which allowed Shasta to break from the psychic binds and move once again. However, it would turn out to be a useless hope for she could only squirm in a humiliating manner as it was all too late to free herself. The fleshy prison constricted her form even tighter and pulled in her waist into the blushing nether-lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, the infected Altaria\u2019s waist stuffed  the Flygon\u2019s green belly inward, purring its smirked  beak. The psychic outline around Ruga\u2019s body also slowly started to dissipate which freed the dragon to move around once more! But Ruga never realized this because he had already given up his fight for survival. His crotch squeezes inward, allowing his hardened cock to nestle and ride up against the hot vaginal walls of the infected\u2019s pussy. He grunted and submissively grinded his member at the slick flesh with soft humps. There was little room within the tight tunnel to thrust, but all in all, the pleasure the Flygon\u2019s expectations. The Altaria\u2019s feminine pre slathered his blushed face in no time, and Ruga took the chance to begin licking inside his doom. The warming nectar was swallowed, sending chill waves of submissive happiness down in Ruga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Shasta\u2019s legs and tails thrashed out in woeful endeavors, doing nothing but shifting more of her body up into the crouched Alakazam. Just then, the infected Delibird waddled over and grabbed the Ninetales\u2019 calves and attempted to push the limbs deeper and faster into Magira! The psychic gasped with an open smile, constantly humping against her food-toy as her infected bird pet appeased its master with its service. With a red, hot face, Magira howled out and erupted her orgasm. Shasta whimpered with muffled cries as the gooey substance slathered over her in a flush of arousal. With a final tug, the Ninetales\u2019 padded hindpaws and twitching tail-tips embraced the welcoming sex-line and disappeared between the clenched opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagira rest back against her stone chair, letting her yellow belly stretch out with the curled up canine inside the womb round out. Shasta moaned inside the organ as it immobilized her once more into a bound position. The walls began to pucker up and slush her into the cum-producing system, prepping her weakened body to absorb into orgasm juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>I\u2026I failed\u2026</i>\u201d was all Shasta could think as darkness swept her away into depressed slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagira fingered her open folds, still slick with her previous release while watching the helpless Flygon\u2019s feet and tail slurp into the Altaria\u2019s womb just the same. The clouded midsection of the infected dragon bird orbed outward and wriggled in joy. The Altaria\u2019s eyes shut and its legs wobbled in bliss as it felt the Flygon inside of it ejaculate a massive and burning orgasm within its womb. It shivered from its own release but fell onto its rump. The Alakazam chuckled and continued to run her palms over the smooth globe emitting from her belly as it gurgled from absorption. The Ninetales kicked in unconscious reflex as her body was melting down into cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagira looked over to the horny Delibird and noticed the erect cock slapping up against its waist. \u201cAhhh, thank you my dear slaves. That girl was certainly an excellent prize for today\u2019s catch.\u201d She glanced over to the Delibird and gestured for it to approach her. The feral avian gratefully ran up towards her and climbed on. The Alakazam spread her legs wide open to showcase the very vagina that had consumed the Ninetales the Delibird helped feed her to. Its rod jumped while Magira gave it permission to enter. Her head tilted back with a wide smile stretched along her mouth as the bird positioned itself and lifted her gut up somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wet and loud slaps jostled the Alakazam to slide back and forth atop her throne, rolling her breasts and large stomach with the Delibird\u2019s mad humping spree. The psychic thoroughly enjoyed the stout avian\u2019s shaft of meat penetrating her over and over again, along with the tightened fire-type fox sloshing in her belly with each thrust. During the feral\u2019s sex-craze, she looked over to see that the other ferals surrounding her home had been watching the entire time and masturbated towards the scene. Magira chuckled as she watched the wet smacks of the infecteds\u2019 chops envy the Delibird and its gift of their master\u2019s love hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagira patted her fat gut once more, replying, \u201cYou\u2019ll supply me with an excellent orgasm after this bird is done with me, Ninetales. Your life was certainly not in vain.\"</span></div></div>",

Magira chortled, \"I can't help but eye your scaly hide, Flygon. You'll make a fine morsel to my stomach with that delicious hide of yours.\" She looked back towards her capturing mind slaves, adding, \"Do as you wish to the girl.\" Shasta desperately wanted to glance back with the ability to move from the psychic binding to see the Delibird and Altaria approach her,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! This can't be happening! What are they gonna do to me?\" Her brain cried out as she heard the infected avians' footsteps arrive closer and closer to her downed form. The Alakazam left Shasta with her ill fate and approached Ruga with a smug expression running across her face. He growled through his closed mouth as she forced him onto his back with her powers. Grabbing the green dragon by his hind quarters, The psychic lifted his feet into the air in front of her maw, allowing her to slap her tongue over his scaly soles to run over them with. He grunted and flinched from the odd sensation dragging over his digitless extremities. She licked over his hindpaws more forcefully, occasionally sucking on them and clench his ankles tighter. Ruga could only sit and wait as the Alakazam enjoyed her savory meal and stuffed his feet into her open maw as his lover would soon share a similar demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShasta felt the Delibird's flippers grab her sides to yank her onto her back also. The defiant feral hissed an entertained tone as to waddled over her head, blocking most of the light of the cave torches to silhouette above her. Her eyes widen in despair as she sees the red feathery rump lower down plop atop her face. Her muzzle softly squeezes into its gaping pucker, which soon caused her entire head to slump inward! The canine quickly squirmed in distress, scared off what this Delibird's intentions truly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Aghk! I-I can't be eaten! Especially not like this!</i>\" She raged out with fury. Her thoughts boiled in alarm while her shoulders are squeezed into the dragging anus. The Delibird\u2019s eyelids lower down halfway and its tongue lightly waves with the rumbling of its purrs. The feral\u2019s arousal sprouted out with the added enjoyment of having the Ninetales\u2019 breasted chest tug deeply into its constricting rectum. The hot anal walls wriggle with Shasta\u2019s consumption and squeeze her into a somewhat painful hug with powerful suction. Just then, Shasta could feel several hands and mouths clasp around her undevoured section. The infected around the cave who had been watching the eye-appealing show appeared to want in on the action, and quickly chose a body part left off the Ninetales to play with before she disappeared for good. Infected ferals groped her rear, licked over her calves, tugged on her tails, humped her paws, licked her anus and stomach, and eventually, the infected Altaria who never received a meal opened her maw over the Shasta\u2019s womanhood. The dragon bird\u2019s tongue dove into the blushed folds hidden in the fur, drilling inside and running over her clit. The Ninetales groaned out in unwilling pleasure and simply twitched in response. Her limbs continued to fail her, as she had failed to protect Ruga and herself, along with saving Latina. The ferals were too strong and too seductive to simply ignore. The Delibird\u2019s dishonesty led her to her downfall, and now she was paying for it. In the barrage of humps, licks, and grinds, many types of sticky liquids slathered her lower body, glistening her fur with ropes of cum, trails of pokemon drool and pre. The Ninetales released one last whine of sensitivity before draining herself with her own orgasm. Some of the cum hit the Altaria in the face, but it simply licked over the sticky nectar instead of becoming infuriated towards it. Shasta\u2019s hips and waist enter the  infected Delibird\u2019s pressing sphincter, swallowing up her legs and tails to send her directly towards the feral\u2019s stomach by a narrow and hot trip. A pucker opens up around her nose tip, and begins pulling the rest of her form into the digestive organ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body curls up within the hammocking chamber, sloshing about as the Delibird toyed with his stomach by rubbing his flippers along his feathery dome. The Ninetales squirmed within the belly after Magira\u2019s psychic hold on her vanished. Suddenly, digestive fluids began to spurt inside the fleshy prison, coating over Shasta\u2019s body to tingle at her fur while the feral bird continued to rock her body back and forth with its delightful gut-play. She moaned helplessly during the torture, finding it difficult to stay awake through such defeat. The poison from the Delibird\u2019s berry still remained running through her system, which added to her exhaustion from her struggles. On the outside, Magira had swallowed in Ruga\u2019s crotch and belly inside, licking her thick tongue over his scaled tummy and erect genitals. The Flygon moaned from the treatment, wiggling his body in order to escape the Alakazam\u2019s pursuing jaws. Nothing loosened in turn, and afterwards, the dragon was forced to lie still as his upper body slipped further inside. Ruga just hoped that his and Shasta\u2019s demise would be a painless one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagira continued chomping down on the Flygon\u2019s neck, finally reaching his head at last. His flavor proved to be quite delectable, and she was purely ready to finish the delicious course down. Her chest and abdomen already poked out from his larger saliva-covered lower body, which of course she rubbed with her hands to please her womanly senses. She took a large bite and gulp over the final part of the dragon\u2019s body, finishing her meal with a loud and juicy swallow. The psychic released a sigh of joy and rested back into her rock-carved throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing the Altaria standing the open next to the Delibird who resumed to jiggling the Ninetales trapped inside of it around as it digested, Magira smiled and curled her finger towards herself, beckoning the infected dragon bird to her. Following orders, the female Altaria slid herself next to her master, spreading a cloud wing over the massive yellow belly swelling out from the Alakazam. \u201cYou\u2019ve done well, my pets. I\u2019ll be sure to have you venture through the lands and use whatever tactics before to collect ourselves more dinner in the future.\u201d She snapped her fingers towards a small pack of ferals. \u201cGo follow the scent of these two meals to find a pokemon known as Mew. You can her bring back alive, but if she has been\u2026<i>disposed</i> of inside one of you, then I shall reward you myself in the same manner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infected nodded with glee and bounded away towards the mountains. Magira looked back at the Altaria. \u201cAnd as for <i>you</i>\u2026\u201d She leaned in and kissed the feral. Their mouths made contact; their tongues cross. The feral trembled in bliss as her master toyed with her open beak while lowering a finger down, sliding it in inside the bird\u2019s vagina. The two would continue to play with each other\u2019s bodies through the evening, as the Flygon and Ninetales that had fainted sat in their soup-melting processes, digesting away forever.</span></div></div>",

She looked up at the infected Latina, seeing how her beautiful figure could become such a hungry monster. The feral stood at a tall height, sporting small but fairly round and red breasts, curving down her hips for a meaty crimson rump, grey thighs and red boot-like legs. Her grey head sported the intrigued purple eyes, resting under the triangle, blood-red print on her face. Her arms were grey until lowering down to her elbows, which transferred into the thick red arms and hands. The Latias licked her grey lips as she approached the downed Ninetales while Shasta attempted to crawl away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly felt Latina grab her by the ankles, yanking her hindpaws into a hot, fleshy tightness. Looking back, the Ninetales expected to see her feet trapped inside the Latias\u2019 maw, although, she immediately found out that actually her paws were forcefully jammed into the tailhole instead! The red fan tail was raised up and Latina was bent over, growling as Shasta\u2019s hindpaws were slurped inside the musky ring, dragging her back some. The Ninetales gasped and began to desperately kick and wriggle her legs which only seem to pleasure Latina further as they massaged the anal walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-Ruga! Help me!\u201d She called out as the Flygon glided closer to her. The infected Latias easily noticed her oncoming pursuer, and shot out a Dragon Pulse ring to strike Ruga. The dragon-type howled in the weakness of his own type, quickly spiraling down and grinding against the frozen lake top, hitting his head in the process. The Flygon lied there limply, knocked out from the crash landing next to his mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feral grinned as her bum sucked Shasta\u2019s legs fully inward, pinning her assortment of tails to her back and around her upper frame. She whimpered out loud, clawing at the ice as her waist yanked inside the pulsing anus. It gaped open and retracted back, pulling in her midsection while her lower body suffered by the murky, fleshy walls dragging her back, sucking them into the Latias\u2019 stomach. The infected\u2019s red belly began to poke out from the feeling, rousing it to growl in bliss as Shasta\u2019s arms and shoulders neatly fit themselves inside the rectum. The Ninetales looks back at her unconscious mate for the final time before a circular ring outline closes over her muzzle. The hot dank air blankets Shasta in its musky heat as she travels up into the small stomach. The walls constrict around her, pulsing with the happy heartbeat of the Latias she filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infected Latina rubber her hands over her belly, grabbing it and jiggling it up and down to torture her late rescuer inside. Stomach fluids began to squirt inside the organ Shasta was immobilized in, having her to struggle helplessly as it started to pool up to her chest before she tilts her head down in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>I was\u2026too late to save her\u2026I even got Ruga to suffer the same fate as me\u2026</i>\u201d Her thoughts floated pressingly in her head.

She looked up at the infected Latina, seeing how her beautiful figure could become such a hungry monster. The feral stood at a tall height, sporting small but fairly round and red breasts, curving down her hips for a meaty crimson rump, greyish white thighs and red boot-like legs. Her pale head sported the intrigued purple eyes, resting under the triangle, blood-red print on her face. Her arms were white until lowering down to her elbows, which transferred into the thick red arms and hands. The Latias licked her lips as she approached the downed Ninetales while Shasta attempted to back away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForced to her knees, Shasta was held down by the infected Latias as she growled in high esteem. Shasta was prepared to fire off a flaming attack at Latina, but eeped in surprise as the Latias' groin swung down and stuffed her muzzle inside the vaginal walls. The beading pre slathered her mouth and face as the feral growled in blissful pleasure. Shocked and disturbed, she began to wriggle about in the infected's hold, unable to escape or retract her head back. The pussy was literally sucking in her face! Her head was unable to fight the sucking force taking in her body, sliding Shasta's head and shoulders deep inside the wobbling tight walls clenching and humping around her. The hot air and oozing love juices splattered the canine's fur, flattening it to help marinate her struggling body while it worked up into the Latias' nether-lips. Her expanding folds slurped in the Ninetales' entire upper form, submerging the girl's sides and hip into Latina's red underside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendary hissed in seduced arousal, thrusting and pounding at the half-unbirthed fox as Shasta whimpered in powerless defeat. \"<i>I...wasn't able to save her in time...I failed everyone...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, her tails were burdened into wrapping around her legs for her to be able to fit inside the narrow cavern comfortably. Shasta realized that her squirms and twists were simply pleasuring the Latias even more, so with a final tug, the Ninetales loosened her body inside the vaginal chamber. Her legs dangle uselessly outside int he cold air, shivering with the snowy winds as the feral's cunny area expelled strange yet calming heat into the victim's body. The rocking motions and pulsing warmth stirred a strange sensation in Shasta's mind, forcing her to have to relax in her last moments to tire her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer limbs suck inside, concealing around her footpaws for her entire submissive from to be trapped inside the Latias' womb. Latina fell against her back, rubbing over her breasts and round red belly in utter joy as her pussy leaked her physical happiness. The loud gurgling and cum surrounding Shasta wore her out completely, allowing the depressed Ninetales to finally pass out in the pool of slimy fluids pooling around her furry state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Latias was just at the point of fingering herself, when out of nowhere, a male voice called out worriedly, \"Shasta? Are you out there? Was that Latina I saw catch you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Flygon is revealed through the snowy mist, gliding out of the sheet of white fog towards the feral unknowingly. The feral grinned and took to the skies, tackling the dragon in surprise to force him back down to the ground. Ruga gagged out as they hit a snow pile, forcing his type-nature to struggle in the ice. The infected Latias licked her lips as she humped against his body, ready to make a playful meal out of his hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA green dragon's head sticks out of the Latias' pussy, groaning in unwilling pleasure with a blushed weak face as the nether-lips pull in his long neck. The Flygon's head disappears within the pulsing thick vagina, squirting out a drastic orgasm from the feral.

The Glaceon skidded along the ice swiftly and aimed towards her Flygon opponent. Shasta noticed the feral\u2019s intentions and type difference to quickly bound towards her partner, igniting fire from her maw. Just mere steps away from the oncoming Glaceon, a powerful jet of water strikes the Ninetales in her side, forcing her to yell out and be sent skidding along the icy surface of the frozen lake. Shasta writhes in the puddle of cold water, only to be blasted by another water cannon by the Vaporeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShasta!\u201d Ruga cried out before the Glaceon shoots an ice beam at his legs. Thick ice forms around Ruga\u2019s lower body, immobilizing the dragon into a stiff standing posture to leave him to struggle uselessly in his frozen prison. \u201cNo\u2026! Pl-please\u2026you can\u2019t d-d-do th-<i>Gah</i>!\u201d The Flygon\u2019s plea would stop short after being hit again by more shots of the Glaceon to solidify his entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShasta's physical capabilities allowed her to merely get atop her hands and knees, shivering from the water\u2019s exhaustion to her drenched body. She looks up to find her mate completely surrounded in ice, petrified and utterly still. The Glaceon walked over to her icy statue prey, quickly whiplashing her tail to force the ice to crumble. Ruga\u2019s eyes were left closed as he falls to his knees, struggling to even stay conscious. The Ninetales grows incredibly furious, emitting intense body heat in her rage. The act would counter her expression by melting the ice beneath her, letting Shasta to yelp before submerging into the frigid waters of the lake. She whimpered and skittered to reach the hole she fell through, managing to pull her head out of the surface to breathe and claw at the hole\u2019s snow-covered edges. She watched the Vaporeon dive into an open part of the lake, and with a brief moment passing, felt something clutching her tails and bursting from the water carrying her. The Ninetales glided back onto the frozen top of the lake, only to have a female Vaporeon plant a hind paw on her back. She knew the infected\u2019s act was not of grace but as a means to collect its prize in an attempt to eat her <i>alive</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeakly looking up, her eyes shrank back as the blooming folds of the Vaporeon\u2019s vagina glistened with pre and pulsed heat out wildly. Not giving hope just yet, Shasta looked back to Ruga, just to find the Glaceon\u2019s hands grabbing him by the tail and plopping it into her mouth. The Flygon only whimpered in response, trembling in the effective cold chilling over his entire body. The Glaceon roamed her hot tongue around the long tail, quickly slurping it in to bring his thick legs up to her drooling maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ninetales sobbed and watched the shadow above her grow darker. The Vaporeon squatted down, pressing Shasta\u2019s muzzle at the entrance to her pussy. With a pleased grin, the water-type began to ease Shasta\u2019s face into her tight, yet elastic opening, sliding her head in between the throbbing hot walls of the vertical slit. The slimy juices slather Shasta\u2019s face as the vaginal tunnel drags her tuckered body deeper and further inward. The Vaporeon growls in pleasure, pressing a hand at the small lump forming out of its abdomen made by the Ninetales\u2019 entering presence, whereas the other hand glides along the backside of Shasta\u2019s fur. It tugged on it to yank the fire-type closer upward into its depths, murring louder the more of Shasta\u2019s body slid up. The nether lips scroll past her shoulders and breasts, tucking them inside the feral\u2019s waist as her pinned arms and upper body were fully slurped inside the vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ninetales meekly kicked her legs, while her tails shuddered by the dropping temperatures of her body. Her thick bright coat barely added any comfort to the constant trembles her muscles ached. She closes her eyes within the slimy compacting tunnel, finding the warmth of the hot innards to be unwillingly comfortable and the only way for Shasta to even remain conscious through the frigidness. Her rump is finally encompassed, binding her bouquet of tails around her legs as they sink up together into the crouched legs of the Vaporeon. Her nosetip enters a new, yet barely spacious opening, softly curling inside as more of her body is pressed inside the womb of her predator. The fleshy prison suddenly quakes and sloshes Shasta\u2019s upper body inside once the Vaporeon lied all the way down on her back, spreading her legs wider as the Ninetales\u2019 slowly squeezed in between her pussy, while the feral rubbed her fingers around the pussy's edges and clit. Shasta feels the last of the cold air outside abandon her footpaws after they slip inside the closing vaginal slit, making their way to curl up with her and press against the pulsating walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShasta squirmed in tiredness as the organ\u2019s room began to narrow and compress her tightly into a fixated position. She sloshed about in the hammock of tissue as the Vaporeon had gotten up and began walking to a cooler, more comfortable spot. The Glaceon next to her stifled back a smell belch after swallowing his groaning head down. She rubbed her light blue belly while it wobbled in the Flygon\u2019s struggles. Satisfied and aroused, her hands toy with her breasts, fingering over the dark blue nipples as her purple eyes close with glee. The two Eeveelutions walked back into the dense fog amongst the lake, until all that remained of Shasta and Ruga were the ambient gurgles of the feral\u2019s round stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew used her psychic abilities to watch Shasta along her journey, only to find the image of a female Vaporeon stroking her large blue gut as it wriggled every now and then, turning the Ninetales trapped inside into cum. Mew woefully released her psychic link to make the image disappear, and her soft voice whispered out, \u201cSuch a shame. I was certain those two would be able to stop this infection.

She winces as the teeth sink into her side, letting its venom numb her body quickly as she limply hit the grass flooring. She writhed on the ground, unable to move as Ruga cried out to her. The fox's new mate could barely even finish calling her name before his speech suddenly became muffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infected naga held the Flygon tightly in his coils, having his head stuffed into its jaws as it sucked on him. Ruga's long neck and shoulders glide into the snake's lips, struggling helplessly while the poisoned Ninetales were left to watch his demise. She could feel a sudden heat pulsing into your pussy and breasts, letting her desires become much more vibrant as her stomach starts to feel incredibly empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Ruga...\" Shasta managed to say before her voice began to grow garbled and ferocious. Her entire environment seem to grow purplish with many infected ferals staring at the Ninetales' twitching form, grinning and leaving her to succumb to the infection. She felt heart broken that she wasn't able to save her lover, but thankful that her last memory together with him was the happiest one she could ever imagine. Shasta watched the Flygon's swishing tail and toe-less hindpaws be pulled in by the Serperior's forked tongue, leaving Ruga to be nothing more than a squirming, wailing lump sliding down the naga's long tubed body. The spherical bulge stopped in its midsection for the snake to rub happily, hissing in a purring fashion as bubbly rumbles sounded out from its gut. Shasta submitted to the brainwashing venom, letting herself become a feral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter just a minute of watching the feral rub her mate through its meaty coils, Shasta was overwhelmed with ravenous lust, causing her to lose all of her senses of control and memories. She rose up, growling with glowing purple eyes as she leaped away to catch her own prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuga was left to pass out inside the Serperior's stomach, squirming and whimpering helplessly inside the tight slimy tunnel that the naga spiraled around and squeezed. Good thing it was quick enough to spot the oncoming Ninetales and infect her, or it may have lost its meal.</span></div></div>",

He reaches up and rubs her leg as he slowly pushes his tongue inside the girl's folds. Shasta moans louder and begins to slightly grind on the Flygon's face as she jerks his cock with one of her tails, using another to gently tickle his tip. Ruga closes his eyes and moves his hand over, pushing a claw into her tight pucker. He flicks his tail and winces as Shasta shivers and orgasms onto Ruga's tongue and face. He drinks the juices she pours into his mouth and onto his tongue as the Ninetales moves her tails away from his member. She pulls back as he laps up the last of Shasta's juices. She kicks him down more, making sure not to hurt him too much as he goes onto his back from the kick. The fox moves on top of him and growls lovingly again as she lowers herself onto his member. He winces a bit as his cock pushes inside Shasta's slit and she murrs as she feels the hot piece of meat push into her. She places her hands on his chest and begins bouncing on his cock, moaning loudly. Shasta moves two of her tails over and entwine them with his as she rides his impressive member. \"Oh Shasta... You're so tight...\" He says between his moans. She clamps down on his cock, making him moan even louder. The feral bounces faster and closes her eyes as she orgasms around his cock. He winces as this sets him off the edge and he grabs her waist, making Shasta go down entirely on his cock and have it penetrate into her womb. He growls loudly and cums, filling her womb with spurt after spurt of his cum. \"Oh, Shasta... That was-\" He cuts himself off and becomes wide-eyed, his  claws releasing Shasta as some of the infection was sent into his body from his oral play with her pussy. Shasta gets off his cock and moves over. She sits beside him and kisses him. He closes his now purple eyes and swirls his tongue around hers. After a few minutes of passionate kissing, the Ninetales break the kiss and gently pets him on the head. He leans into her hand and looks up at the fox as she stops. She growls commandingly and he stands up, following her as both of them walk away to find someone to feed on.</span></div></div>",

A cloud of rubble and dust wavers over her in the tremendous force of the infected Aerodactyl's drop off the mountain ledge, blinding the Ninetales of her surroundings. She slides off the scaled backside of the dragon and cautiously steps closer to its head. As the dust curtains begin to settle, Shasta peeks over the feral's shoulder, seeing that its eyes were closed and its body completely motionless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe relieves herself with a sigh of contentment that she had succeeded in at least knocking the large beast out. She trembled at the thought of sliding down its drooling jaws. Turning her back, the Ninetales padded over out of the smoldering dirt clouds and back to the incline to lead her to Ruga, but unbeknownst to her, the Aerodactyl's violet gaze gaped open once more, spotting the unaware fox immediately. Shasta gasped as she felt a powerful and scaly hand snatch her into its clutch with a forceful swing, trapping her within its thick fingers. The Ninetales gagged out once the fist clenched even tighter, constricting her writhing form with compound force as the Aerodactyl rose back up, clearly ticked off at the fox that had injured it terribly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShasta! Are you okay down there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d A familiar voice called out for her. Shasta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ears perked up as she saw the Flygon flying closer and closer down towards the pillar of dust she was trapped in. She opened her mouth to warn Ruga, but the Aerodactyl nudges a finger over her muzzle, silencing her. The Ninetales whimpered through her muffled cries as the infected dragon took flight into the air. Ruga peered through the powdery debris, only to discover a large Aerodactyl flapping straight out of it and reaching out for him! Terrified, the Flygon brakes his downward pursuit and begins to frantically beat his wings to try and bring him back up, yet it was all too late. The other winged arm of the feral came swinging out, snatching Ruga with a loud snap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAgh! No!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He yelled out before the Aerodactyl slammed his body into a rock wall, flying upward to drag Ruga into the mountain gravel. The infected dragon plucks him out of the rock, appeased to find the Flygon to writhe helplessly and in tired anguish as it landed on a nearby ledge. Shasta wriggles within her drastic distress, growling and endeavoring to plug her arms out. Opening her maw to fire off a Flamethrower, she soon finds a massive, fat tongue lowering down to scraped over her entire body, almost sliding her out of the Aerodactyl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fist. The dragon murred as hot and thick curtains of drool smeared over the Ninetales\u00e2\u0080\u0099 form. Shasta shivered as the warm goo cascades onto her, letting her to simply sit in her bath torture until the rough tongue ditches her spit-covered body and over to the dry dragon next to her. She listened to the many licks and resentful grunts of Ruga\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mirrored punishment as Shasta cursed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is what I get for trying to help others! I should've never let this dragon tag along! Now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m surely feral fat at this rate\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Her mind conjured. A loud snap suddenly stole her attention. The Ninetales looks up to see Ruga\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tail wiggling aimlessly outside of the grey dragon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lips. With closed eyes, the Aerodactyl growled by the pokemon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meaty body and flavor, quickly and quite loudly swallowing the other dragon down into its belly. Shasta unwillingly watched the grumbling bulge sink down the infected\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long neck, past its chest to lump out its scaled gut even more. The potbelly sagged and kicked out from Ruga\u00e2\u0080\u0099s struggles, rousing the Aerodactyl to growl louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts lavender stare strikes Shasta, giving it an idea of how to enjoy its second course. Shasta eeps as her body is grabbed by the scruff of her neck and lifted high above the Aerodactyl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head. Its sinister face stared at the Ninetales\u00e2\u0080\u0099 underside, blissfully enjoying watching its victim struggle and swing in the air in a pointless manner. Finally, the pinched fingertips released the fox anthro downward, plummeting her body for a wet, muscles bed to land on. Darkness overcame her surroundings once its jaws shut close, twisting its tongue and coiling Shasta within its stuffed cheeks. Its gums and tastebuds squish her body, softly nibbling the helpless pokemon as she cried out fearfully. Dense spittle slathered her fur to slicken down to marinate her, preparing her body to sink down into its tight throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShasta whimpered as the muscles convulsed into her, pulling her into the esophagus to travel into the tunnel throbbing at her filling. The squelching innards and slimy walls pierce Shasta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart into panic and disappointment as the throat works her down inside the dragon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stomach, nestled into the slick form of Ruga. He wobbled, pushed, and whimpered madly as the stomach acids began to spew out and coat his thick form, including Shasta's own spit-slathered body as the two of fallen heroes were forced to grind against each other from the rocking motions of the organ. Shasta sags her head down, closing her eyes to await her fate from her failed mission while the wriggling Flygon beside her sobbed at the tingling fizz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infected Aerodactyl listened closely to the audible stomach gurgles emitting from within its gut, feeling the struggles of its prey dwindle into nothingness. Beating its large wings into the air, it flew off back to its nest to rest off the Ninetales and Flygon it was lucky enough to devour. After the close call with the Ninetales\u00e2\u0080\u0099 attack, it was an excellent thing that she had spent most of all her energy in the single move. It wasn't often the dragon earned to pieces of meat in one sitting.</span></div></div>",

Their purple eye focus on the unaware Flygon as the feral prepares to shoot its Hyper Beam. Shasta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fur spiked as she began to dash towards Ruga, yelling, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGet out of the way! Move it you big oaf!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuga turned around to look at Shasta, confused in what she was ordering until it was all too late. The infected Dragonite launched its beam towards the Flygon and Ninetales, exploding in an immense combustion of burning rock to catapult the two anthros away from each other. Shasta crashed into the ground, quivering in at the damage she sustained while searching around for Ruga. Past the smoldering crater of the explosion, the Flygon remained laying upon back, motionless from being knocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cD-Dang it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d She uttered before attempting to stand. Her legs wobbled and her muscles ached in pain, plus to add to her misery, her battle stance appeared to be absolutely pathetic while the Dragonite lowered its guard at the sight of its prey already exhausted from its powerful attack. The Ninetales snarled and managed to bolt towards the fat dragon, igniting fire around her fist as she pulled it back for a Fire Punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c<i>It should be slightly weakened from draining its energy for that Hyper Beam.

Arriving at the still Dragonite, who seemed highly threatened by Shasta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision, she hurled her arm out, jabbing the lizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scaly belly, only to have it retract and bounce her back to the ground. She gagged as her chest collided into the rocky flooring, and struggled to even move again. The Dragonite chuckled and padded over to the weakened fox, causing tiny tremors to rumble the ground as its steps approached her. Her ears fold back as it lifts one of its intimidating, thick legs, stomping it down to grind her body beneath its clawed footpaw. The orange scaled sole grinded her fuzzy and frail state, puncturing a Ninetales shaped crater in the ground. Shasta whimpered as the Dragonite smushed her smaller body into the gravel before lifting off and letting light enter her eyes once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven the brief moment of the fresh mountain air once her body squirmed along the ground to pull herself out, she quickly felt the Dragonite\u00e2\u0080\u0099s large rear sit down on top of her, squeezing Shasta back into the floor under is fat scaled mass that it pressed all of its weight on. Wondering if she was truly going to die by being crushed by a big lizard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ass, an opening oddly clamped over her head. Her environment grew even darker than before, and much hotter to add to that fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ninetales squirmed about, only to discover that she was being sucked inside its anus! The Dragonite purred as it clenched its globular cheeks together, pulling Shasta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s upper body into its rectum as she writhed in its rump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grasp. Rolling onto its hands and knees, the infected lifted its rear end upwards, letting the fox\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kicking legs and swirling tails slide inside its inner workings. Shasta growled within the compacted fleshy tunnel, sinking through the hot tissue and into the large stomach that was somewhat spacious due to the Dragonite\u00e2\u0080\u0099s size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe plucked into the pool of digesting enzymes that fizzed around her body. The tingling sensation wasn't at all painful, however, the Ninetales madly kicked and pressed against the walls that softly converged around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGah! This is what I get for trying to protect someone again! You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trust anyone, whether they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re treacherous or weak. I gotta get out of here. I have to find the one person I know that can help stop this infection!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She screamed out within the dragon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gut as the walls were soon closing in on her. Suddenly, a loud tremble shook and sloshed Shasta inside, and out from the same tight ring she had slid through appeared to be tugging a Flygon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unconscious head in. Ruga\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body was fully pulled inside, and forced into pressing against Shasta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s panicking form. The acids slather the two in its gooey heat after the organ walls had fully encased the two into fixated positions that ceased the Ninetales\u00e2\u0080\u0099 squirms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, the infected Dragonite rubbed over its expanded belly, feeling around the trapped prey inside as the fox it devoured finally passed out in exhaustion. She had been a tough fighter, but now her willpower and energy will provide excellent strength for the Dragonite. It laid back on a rock wall, drumming its scaled gut before falling asleep, letting the Ninetales and Flygon inside digest with a bubbly doom. </span></div></div>",

Stuffing the feet into his maw, he began to slurp in your legs and tail into his gullet, having his throat stretch and expand out from the filling entry of your body. The bug pokemon hollered and hooted for their leader to gulp your motionless body up, to finish what the Venusaur hadn't accomplished. Scythers were still amazed you escaped her vines, but passed it off as sheer luck.

Your legs and tails are constricted into the tight, slimy innards of the bug leader with your gut being continuously licked over. The action has you throbbing all down across your body, however, your frail arms fail to push your lower posture back out from the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bug audience cheered, \"Hah hah aha ha!

You look down to see that none other than the Scizor had said it, pinching his claws over your shoulders and plunging you father inward. You gasp, finding your chest and arms to disappear under his dragging lips as the inner cheek walls tug on your flesh. You take a last look at your traveling companions, all piled up and unconscious while you were left to be unable to save them. Steamy, squelching darkness soon surround your head as you trailed into a muscled ring to push your exhausted body into the Scizor's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Scizor patted his red shelled belly as it bloomed outward for a nice, round dome. The reptile wriggled and wobbled about inside the organ, whimpering to pleasure the bug leader's victory. He raised an arm up into the air, snapping his claws, \"The Rampardos has failed! You may feast upon on the others in the pile, my fellow insects!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Scythers wailed in happiness, quickly flying over to make sure they could collect a whole body for themselves to swallow down. The Scizor rested back into a stone throne chair, letting the Rampardos inside his gut kick meekly at the stomach walls during his nestling rubs, listening to his opponent's pathetic cries. \"If only you had been stronger, then I would've let you and your friends completely free, but I do not simply let loose easily caught meals for the ferals to get.

Three legendary psychic type pokemon lived there and practiced their power. A Cresselia, A Mew and a Deoxys... These three would often find ways to communicate with other pokemon and often take them in to test if they were worthy. I went to the caverns with a Gardevoir, a Xatu and a Hypno to see if the rumor of gaining strength was true but what we didn't know that the caverns hold a terrible secret to it... When we followed the three legendaries deep into the cave there a black crystal... And it held a dark power... Cresselia told us not to touch it but Hypno was very curious about the gem and touched it...  A very sinister voice spoke to me and gave me horrible chills 'This world shall fall into chaos...! Let loose your wild instincts and you will survive!' I was mixed with fear and confusion with what that voice was talking about but it became clear when Gardevoir started to attack Deoxys and Hypno and the gem were nowhere to be found... Mew then teleported me and Xatu out of the cave as he let out sharp shriek as he dropped to the ground and holding his head. His eyes started to glow a faint purple and he asked me to eat him. I didn't have much of choice seeing that Gardevoir had the purple eyes too... While I was digesting the large bird I've noticed that pokemon were going crazed and hungry... Some of them even seek for pleasure...! Before I left the entrance to the Aurora Caverns I heard an eerie screech. It echoed throughout the area and drove those couldn't resist to go crazy or infected in other words! I've also noticed the infection can spread to others in two different ways; one, the infected rapes their victim and releasing their seed into them. Two the infected bites a terrified victim, sending the infection into their bodies...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink a few times and ask the pig \"Isn't there anyway to cure the infected pokemon?\" Odie makes a disappointed sigh and replied \"I wish there was but I was lucky that Clyde and Ion had strong wills otherwise I'd be in big trouble.\" You smiled a bit and rubbed your chin a few times \"Well I'm not gonna give up on the search!

You're gonna need it for this maze.\" You gulp nervously as you descend down into the Porygon Maze. You couldn't believe what you were seeing as you trek through the maze. The different polygons seem to be... Parts of different pokemon!? It must mean that many have tried to get the jewel but had failed. You put yourself together knowing that you really needed any and all the help that you can so you decide to press on regardless of your discovery when a figure started to appear... It looked like... Another Rampardos...? \"...Mom?\" You call out to the figure but it runs away from you after hearing your voice. You couldn't consider the fact that you'd meet your mother again... But... Didn't she...? Out of the thoughts of seeing her again after so long since you've started this journey you chase the figure into a dead end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure turns around and upon closer look it looked just like her! A few tears feel down from your eyes as you started to approach the other Rampardos. She gives you a soft smile and waves before speaking. \"Zeke... My son... Come to me... You must be so tired after going through all of those problems.\" You nod a few times as you get closer to her. \"Oh mom...\" A few more tears fell down as you move closer. She then spreads her arms open before saying...</span></div></div>",

You then use Head Smash on the other Rampardos and she stumbles backward screeching in pain before growling at you \"What is the meaning of this!?\" You glared as you got ready to fight \"You're not my mother! Just what the heck are you anyway!?\" The imposter smirked before pixels come by and revealing that she was a shiny Porygon Z! \"And I almost had you there! No matter, I'm just a sample of what you'll be dealing with! Tee hee~\" After she said that she teleports away. You let out a sigh of disappointment after seeing that his mom was a ruse but you really wanted to believe it was her... Oh well.. Back to maze. It seems endless... No matter which way you went you seemed to be going around in circles... You stop and take in a deep breath and observe the patterns on the wall. They seem to repeat onward. As you travel to a split between the paths the patterns are different. You noticed one was the same as the last and head that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep following the same pattern path and come across a lone Porygon. It whimpers a bit and starts to back up from you. You decide to stay still and wait for the polygon pokemon to move and after about a half an hour it slowly comes over to you and asks one question. \"Are you going hurt this land?\" You shake your head once and carefully gaze into the normal type's eyes \"No, I'm trying to save this and all of the lands from this plague.\" The Porygon smiles and nods a few times. \"I believe you...\" He gives you a small nuzzle before heading on his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took about a few hours but you finally reached the center where a jewel is shining brightly. You stare in awe from its dazzling glow but then as you get closer... There is another one with just as a beautiful shine like the other one. Could one of them be a trap?

You let out a low groan as you regain vision and see that your back at the beginning of the maze! You smile softly as you hold onto the jewel and taps on the sealed entrance. The rock starts to move and Quartz greets you with widened eyes \"Is... Is that...?\" You nod a few times and raise the gem up high and with that the Onix quickly grabs you and brings you back to elder's hut. \"Elder! Elder! He did it! He got the jewel!\" He spoke quickly before setting you down while you hold the gem. The pair of golden eyes appear once again and the voice chuckles. \"Well done! I'm very surprised.

At least they could be used to subdue enemies.\" That made the Scyther giggle a bit \"You're right! Thanks Zeke! I'll make the best lasso anyone has ever seen!\" Flora smiled as she nuzzled you \"Zeke, you seem to find ways to make those around you happy~\" You nod as you nuzzle back and the for the rest of the day.

Staying close is key but there be a lot of obstacles that will try to separate you. Should that happen, you will fail. If bonds be broken before you reach Vapol Lake, you fail.

So I decided to train and when I figured I could swallow foes whole I added that to my training. Needless to say it helped a lot but that Aggron was a bit tougher than I thought.

You start to reach a quarter of the way and you let out a soft moan as something was giving you pleasure. \"...Huh?\" You look down and see a pink Durant rubbing your large balls and shout \"H-Hey! Stop that!\" The ant giggled as it stroked more \"No way mister! This balls are just soo goood~ I want to rub them until they're soft!\" Your eyes widen greatly and fired a Flamethrower at the steel/bug type. It yelped from the flames but it kept rubbing. You realized it won't stop so you decide to hurry up the mountain when more pleasure was being felt. You look down and now an Aron as clung to your balls as well. You grit your teeth and continue to climb the mountain trying your best not to give in to the pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon reach the halfway mark and a platform. You quickly reached to the platform and spot a Gigalith blocking the path. \"Wow, I'm pressed that someone actually made it this far without giving into the pleasure. However! I, Geo of the dildo clan will make you give into the pleasure with my life!\" You tilt your head to the side as you wondered why he said that but a Power Gem to the face blinds you and once your vision is restored he's gone! You blink a few times before you feel something pierce your rear and you holler in pain! Geo has gotten behind you and is stuffing himself into your rump hands first! You let out a low groan from the intrusion but your rectum had other plans as it started to pull the Gigalith in. Pleasure was building rapidly and your balls were still being rubbed. You grit your teeth and fight back as much of the pleasure as the rocky golem's shoulders and chest were pulled and your eyes widen as...</span></div></div>",

You managed to keep a leveled head by thinking of how good the prey would be in your belly and not how good it feels doing it. Within a few clenches all that was left of Geo was a pair of kicking legs but they get pulled in and you let out a sigh of relief as you pat your bloated belly as the rock type started to thrash about and shouting. \"I-Impossible!

However... He was unable to budge your arm! Not even an inch! He growled and struggled to push your arm back as you stand your ground and waited for the right moment to strike and when it happened, which was a few moments after him trying you pushed his arm to the ground and the crowd cheered for your victory.

The elder's golden eyes shine through the tend and letting out a hardy laugh. \"Ah... I haven't seen the villagers this riled up in <i>ages</i>! But I digress. Now for the final trial...\" He pauses for a brief moment as everyone was muttering softly. \"Soul Survival! In this trial you will need to utilize everything you know to win a three on one battle with the Legendary Guardians!\" Once he finished speaking fire, lighting and water all formed from the center of the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow nervously as the three elements form bodies. First the fire was a male Entei. He stood eight feet tall and had muscles all over his body, he bears a six pack and he flexed his muscles as he growled fiercely. The water formed a female Suicune. She was two feet shorter than the fire legendary and very sleek. She had a d cup but that was hard to see thanks to her long thick purple hair covering up her chest like a bra. The lighting formed a male Raikou and he stood eight feet tall like the Entei however, he was very fat. His arms and legs were like thick logs and cheeks were puffing out of his face and his immense dome of a belly jiggled as he breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and step to the center of the ring.

I'm Sylvia and the blobby dog is Roan.\" The Raikou chuckled a bit. \"Well now all you have to is survive our onslaught for fifteen minutes!\" Edgar smirked as he glared at you again. \"Let's see what you got!\" You nod as you get ready for the fight. </span></div></div>",

We've been through a whole lot ever since we've met near the forest.\" You nod a few times and smile \"Yeah... And there will be more to come. I won't stop until I put an end to the madness.\" Wes nods and smiles \"I'll be by your side too! No matter what comes our way we'll take it on full force!\" You smile and blush as Flora walks over and giggles \"Aww~ Look at you~ That soo cute~\" You and Wes both blush at the same but you knew that Flora knew. She is your best friend and knows everything about you so you didn't mind it at all while Wes was a bit embarrassed but you make him feel better by giving him a warm hug or as best as you could with your bloated gurgling belly limiting your reach but Wes chuckles from the gesture and hugs your gut. \"Thanks Zeke~\" You smile back and let out a soft purr. \"You're welcome~\" After that the time had passed on to the late evening and it was time to hit the hay.</span></div></div>",

We're gonna take you all out and take our friend with us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said Ion opened up with an Earthquake and with cracks on the ground happening scared all but three villagers and the Primeape growled and spoke out and the three guards, a Blastiose, a Magmortar and a Luxray stepped forward when Xio and Clyde charged in making the fight look uneven for the and the primate had no choice but the join in to even up the odds for them. Darcel and Lesley both stayed hidden and the Dusknoir started to lead the Poliwrath away from the fight and figured if they could deal with \"Tyrant Fang\" maybe that would stop the madness in this area.</span></div></div>",

He carefully played with it for a while as he rubbed, hugged and squished his hands with it before gulping that down and slurps down the legs and tail like noodles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dragonair then frowns as he watched the large bulge travel down his long body and coming to a stop at his stomach. He lets out a small sigh and rubs the bulge a few times. \"I really had hopes for you... A shame that you had to go like this... I'll never have another dough belly like that one. <b>BURP!</b>\" He quickly covered his maw and blushed heavily after that. \"O-Oh my... You really know how to entertain someone all the way~\"</span></div></div>",

He chuckles a bit as he tips you over and you easily fall onto a pile of feathers which softened your landing. The elder then rolls you over and lifts your tail up. \"Oh remember when I said 'your wiggling form'? I'm gonna add something to ensure you wiggle~\" He pulls out a nine inch dildo, pulls your pants off and presses it in causing you to squeal and squirm as something was invading your rear and wriggle wildly to the Dragonair's delight. Once he has the dildo fully inside he plugs it up and moves back watching you squirm in discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, this will be perfect~\" He said as he moves his tail over your head and it envelops it and you let a muffled sound as you continue to wriggle a bit.

His tail stops pulling on your wiggling body as he continues to rub your shaft against your soft belly \"Consider this release your last time for pleasure~\" Once he finished that you let out a loud squeal and your seed smears all over your flabby belly and his tail resumes to pull and he purrs softly as he tail sucks in your tail and watching it squish against it and once that was fully in your legs and own tail go in quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dragonair chuckled a bit as he watched the Rampardos' wriggling body travel up his long tail and into his belly.

I don't think I'll ever find a meal with this much energy.\" He then bellows out \"I need pleasure!

You make a small sigh of relief that the large centipede isn't infected but you couldn't lower your guard but Mark lowers his as he walks up to the bug/poison type and says \"Hello there sir. Do you know where the exit...\" Before he could finish the Scolipede's maw opens up very wide and it clamps down on Mark's head and your eyes widen greatly but you tried to help out your friend but the large bug turns around and swings its thick tail at you knocking you backwards. It then looks at you with Mark struggling to pull his head out but it swallows and pulls in his arms, shoulders and chest. You whimpered weakly as you watched Mark's wide legs kick and flail as his fat belly jiggles and squishes with the bear's movement. The predator makes another swallow squeezing in the Beartic's stomach forcing you watch the bear's legs kick desperately for any chance for escape and he tried to call out for help but the cries fall on deaf ears as the legs and feet vanish from sight and slide down the bug's long black gullet struggling and squirming as Mark is now trapped inside the bug's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make a small whimper as you looked at the squirming stomach and then back at the Scolipede... It stares back at you with hungry eyes... It wants a second course and you're going to join Mark! You struggled to get on your feet but the attack you suffered was worse than you thought as you look at the Scolipede as its maw envelops your head. You make a small whimper as the gigantic insect swallows down your shoulders and pinned your arms to the side. All you could do now was regret not following Wes' warning about the dangers that came with this luminous forest... You cease your whimpering and allowed the Scolipede to slurp up the rest of your body without any resistance... You slide neatly inside the predator's stomach where Mark was quivering in fear as you simply closed your eyes and awaited your fate....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Scolipede churred as it looked at its overstuffed belly as it sagged to the ground. With the preys' struggle going for no more than a couple minutes it rested on a the forest floor letting the sound of gurgles and grumbles fill the forest area as it digests its meal.</span></div></div>",

You tried to get up but paralysis has a good grip on you forcing you to watch you're friends being engulfed by the beast as it picks you up by your tail and starts stuffing that in with the Nidoqueen's feet. You make a yelp and could only watch the world around become limited and darker as your head sticks out of the predator's maw.

It obviously misses, and the Machoke takes the time of his evasion to good use, and dove towards you. You were unable to release your Flamethrower attack away in time for you to back away from the oncoming fighter, receiving a Dynamic Punch delivered from his powerful fist to send you spiraling out a couple of times through the air. You crash against the ground yet again, except this time, you truly were down for the count and laying atop your chest. Placing your arms underneath your heaving chest, you attempt to lift yourself back up only to discover your strength had vanished, forcing your upper body to collapse back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grumble as your head pounds with aching misery while your senses were utterly foggy. Even with the pain in your mind, you could still hear the deep chuckles of the Machoke as he sneered, \"I think that'll show that dino who's in charge! Heh heh. He's lucky I didn't agree that we eat the loser of the match!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hippowdon slapped the Machoke's back, exclaiming, \"Yeah, you really kicked that lizard's ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora rushed over to your fallen form, checking all of the bruises along your body. \"Oh no! Zeke! Are you alright?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe victor of the match stepped forward, crossing his beefy arms with a coy smirk along his face. \"Alright, I won fair and square, <i>Rampardos</i>.

Stirring into awakening, you open your eyes back to the outside word, letting the sunset's haze blind you for a moment until your pupils adjusted to the sunlight. You lift your upper body off the grassy flooring, discovering that Flora and Wes must have flipped you over and dragged you off the dirt road while you were unconscious. The pounding pain never ceased pulsating from within your rib cage, as your loins tightened in misery. The Machoke really did you in for a world of hurt and your thoughts couldn't help but regret your decision to stand up to the fighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was disappointing that you lost Odie and several traveling companions who you figured to be friends, although, this means you only have two other traveling mates now, and you still hadn't received information on the infection from the Grumpig either. It was truly an all-or-nothing battle. Now you had to start from scratch to solve the infection. Listening out, your hearing senses were still slightly suppressed as a ringing noise sounded out throughout your brain. Clenching your chest, you struggle to get up before calling out, \"Wes...Flora...can you help me up...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange noise answered your request, confusing you with its garbled octave. You look to your side and discover a horrible tragedy. It had been Flora to answer your call, but in compliance to help you; she was crying out for help as an infected Smeargle's maw was clamped over her head from behind. Its paintbrush tail was wrapped around her sides, tying her arms down and render them useless while she struggles horribly for rescue. Your scared eyes scan over to Wes, only to find his body on the ground, tired and paralyzed as a Lickitung smothered his body on puddles of saliva and the wall of tastebuds slapping over his hide. The Tyranitar grumbled in dissatisfaction, all until the massive tongue scoops under his thick form and rolls him into it. The infected Lickitung retracted its tongue back, cramming Wes's head and shoulders in as it sucked on him, pushing him farther and farther down with each small budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys! No! <i>Aghk</i>!\" You snarl out before almost tipping over again. The commotion from your battle and setting daylight must have attracted many ferals to investigate your position, discovering a small pack of pokemon that had a faint leader and two unprepared watchers. If only the others hadn't left, you and the rest of everyone would still have a fighting chance! Suddenly, a shadow covers the orange glow of the sunset from you, forcing you to stare at the silhouette of a large, feral Zweilous anthro. The two headed dragon had covered eyes, but it was obvious this heavy-breathing and mouthwatering pokemon was infected, purple eyes or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were unable to back away from your sustained injuries to have your body suddenly tackled and pinned by the dragon. One head hovers above your face as you lie on your backside, just to have your face meet the infected's tongue for it to bathe you in hot spittle. You wriggle about as the second head stretches its long neck over to your lower portion, letting you feel the sudden embrace of your feet being licked. Your scaled and clawed hindpaws are briefly licked, being coated in saliva before the secondary head sucks them inside its maw along with your tail-tip. The other head works down on the other side of your body, slurping your head inside its squelching jaws to work down past your shoulders and chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhimpering aloud, your wriggling form is eaten from both sides, having a majority of your upper body stuffed in one slimy throat of the Zweilous as the other slid your legs and tail completely down, working its tongue over the hardening bulge under behind shorts. You gasp inside the tightening esophagus, doing your best not to become aroused by the dragon's fat tongue stroking under the shorts to drag against your erect arousal. The members throbs at the sensation of being licked, enjoying each brush and curl the tongue performs on your cock, leaving you to grunt in unwilling pleasure and hump the cheek walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the Zweilous had come to an impasse. Both heads arrived at your exposed chubby belly, fighting over you like territory as tongues throbbed over your smooth gut. You groan in pleasure as you feel your body being yanked back and froth by the drooling tunnels while they bicker over who gets to swallow the Rampardos. Used as nothing more than a tug-of-war toy, the second dragon arrives to be the victor after pulling far enough back to slide your head and chest out from the other Zweilous maw. The first head scowls but seemed satisfied to have been able to taste you. You whimper as this act gives you a second chance to see the outside world again. A fat Smeargle rubs over its immense belly, pressing the squirming Nidoqueen trapped inside into a compacted ball to digest in. Wes' legs and tail fling about tiredly out of the Lickitung's maw from his constant struggles, only to have them slide down and be returned with a hearty belch from his devourer. Soon enough, the Zweilous head lifted back, letting the rest of your drool-collected body ease inside the dragon's throat and travelling into its stomach. You tuck into the fleshy hammock as the sphincters close to lock you within the hot chamber. You writhe inside the stomach as it shakes about from the Zweilous rolling onto its back to circle its hands over the nice lump you protruded from its blue and pink-striped belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes and lower your head down once the digestive fluids flush inside, getting ready to break you down into nothing but a murky soup. With pleasure, you pass out willingly inside the asphyxiating stomach, positive that fighting the Machoke was the biggest mistake of your life. Hopefully the others could solve the infection without you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infected two-headed dragon belched from both gullets, purring as the chubby lizard inside it began to digest away, along with the Lickitung's and Smeargle's prey. The kicking guts sloshed about to rouse the ferals into toying with their victims by swinging them around, content on yet another unaware and easy catch of food. The three soon raise their heads up, catching the scents of several other anthros having been previously on the dirt road. They howled out loudly into the air, signaling for more infected to approach the spot as they waddle and dash down the path, eager to catch the other large pack of non-infected pokemon who weren't too far ahead.</span></div></div>",

Flora, Mark, and Ion continued to struggle however from the Hippowdon's attack, groaning and terribly rejuvenating their senses. You nod with Clyde's suggestion and look ahead, wondering which particular feral to fight. Xio had already charged the Ursarang and the Tyranitar faced a violent grappling battle with the Kangaskhan. Clyde would attack which ever one you didn't face to avoid any overpowering by the infected, and it appeared that the Machoke of the group seemed like their pack leader as it took front and seemed as the toughest of the group to face off to. The Haxorus would surely have a tough time facing that thing. Although, the Hippowdon was preparing another ground attack to hit your downed friends, and you could try to counteract it with your own ground-type body.

The feral humanoid discovers your attack and quickly catches your domed cranium with his hand, being forced back along the grassy pavement some by the force. Clyde immediately pounces towards the Hippowdon for an equal fight of four on four! You struggle in the Machoke's grasp as you pull and launch your body within its grasp. Its muscled hand doesn't give however, and it uses its other free hand to deliver a mach punch to your chest. You yelp as you're sent into the air by a meter before falling back down onto your knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan and release a Flamethrower and spew the jet stream of fire at the infected Machoke. It quickly jumps back, giving you some distance between your opponent again. To win such a battle, you would have to win through long ranged attacks. That means Flamethrower and Ancientpower were all that you had to rely on. Bracing your energy, you release an Ancientpower attack directly at the fighting-type, although, the move did little damage to the impenetrable body of the Machoke's muscle. The feral grinned and used a Low Kick to burst soil at you, shrouding your vision as the infected dashed towards you. You gasp as you attempt to stagger back away from the cloud of dust, only to receive yet another Mach Punch jabbed into your backside. You crash into the ground, grumbling as the fighter continues his pursuit. Briefly rolling away to the side, you managed to dodge a menacing chop descending down from the Machoke, breaking the ground next to you. You open your maw for flames shoot out for another Flamethrower, and this time, able to do much more damage with the Machoke so close to the flames. It howls and tackles down on top of you, causing the two of you to roll frantically along the forest floor. You struggle to make sure he doesn't get a hold of you, but his strength seems to outmatch yours. As its opens its mouth to slap its tongue over your face, it drags over your chin and mouth to water its drool onto your head. You gag out and sling your tough noggin forward, striking his own head with a Zen Headbutt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe psychic attack forces the fighter to fly off of you, slamming into a nearby rock. Rolling onto your feet, you check to make sure what everyone's status in the rampage. A Haxorus' tail wiggles helplessly out of the fat Hippowdon's large maw while it was being thoroughly licked over by the thick tongue as the infected hippo rubbed the wiggling and yelling bulges stretching out of its neck and chest. The Ursarang held a choke-hold around a pokemon in each arm by their necks, Xio and Odie. The Scyther gagged out violently as the Grumpig squealed and writhed in the bear's arms. The infected Ursarang rained down his saliva over Xio's head, basting the bug's head in the sticky goo for a clean ride down its throat. Meanwhile, the female Kangaskahn growled in bliss as it grinded its waist down on top of Wes, who looked badly injured and lied on his back, groaning in misery as the feral used his frontside as a toy. Her pre slathered his chest and belly, perfecting the Tyranitar for an excellent unbirthing victim. You couldn't figure out who or how to help the others, so you check back towards your fallen friends in the back, only to discover that they were trapped under the Hippowdon's Rock Tomb! These ferals certainly knew how to keep their prey sustained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a pounding force lodges itself into your chubby belly, causing you to cringe in agony and fall to your knees. The Machoke had regained its composure and slung a powerful Dynamicpunch into you. Now, you were back to where you were before; sitting at the Machoke's mercy, except this time, a bruise blemished from his head and a terrifying bulge stretched out in his elastic black garments that the infected still adorned. You tremble in fear to what the feral would do to you now. Suddenly, its thick blue hands cup over your shoulders, yanking you face-first into the Machoke's maw. You grumble in misery as the tongue wavers over your face again, giving it a dense bath as you nose-dive into your doom. If only your group had been stronger, then maybe this whole battle would have turned out for the better. You were ashamed that at the very moment you succeeded into finding Odie the Grumpig, he would simply be just some pork dinner for a feral, along with you and your entire group. Throbbing in the hot wave of air pulsing around your body with the slimy flesh tugging you down, you pass out with the feeling the the Machoke's tongue working your gut in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infected Machoke belched loudly for its pack to hear after letting the Rampardos' scaly legs and tail slide down its throat with a slick sound. It's abbed stomach rounded out into a large blue sphere for the feral to rub. The large hands circle over its sloshing belly as the dinosaur inside starts to digest within the compacted stomach and fizzling pool. The humanoid fighter checks on its pack-mates, seeing a Tyranitar's tail swish wildly out of the crevice of the pleasured Kangaskahn's pussy, splattering her love juices droplets all about underneath it. Next to her was the Ursarang, who sprouted a beautiful furry belly that contained the Scyther's voice to call out inside, all the while, a Grumpig's woeful head quietly sank into the maw as it sobbed to his failing saviors. The Hippowdon rested on its obese rump, jiggling and toying with its fat belly to shake the unconscious Haxorus inside who long ago gave up its fight to survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pack leader grinned and stroked its bubbling gut with glee. The dino proved to put up a great fight, however, letting its guard down due to its weaker friends led to its downfall. The Machoke, now reminded of the three out of the battle, walked over to the large boulders concealing them and using a powerful Rock Smash punch to force the rock to crumble down and reveal a weakened Nidoqueen lying down. She gasped at the sudden purple-eyed Machoke glaring down at her with a fully wriggling belly bouncing in front of it. A drop of saliva out of the fighter's open mouth was the last thing she would feel outside before the jaws came closing down around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ferals surrounded the fainted Beartic and Marowak, ready to fight for whoever gets to eat who.</span></div></div>",

Odie the Grumpig suddenly skids to your side, trembling yet staying calm, \"I-I'm here to help. Just tell me which one to take on w-w-with you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and lower your head down, preparing your Zen Headbutt ability and charge towards the obese hippo. Odie pounces out with you, dashing next your side as the Haxorus fends off the Machoke in a spurring wrestle. The infected Hippowdon was fully prepared to stomp down its mighty leg to erupt an Earthquake attack, however, your sudden dive jams into its large belly, forcing the Hippowdon to cease its preparation and gag out. Although, the move would counter by bouncing you off of its hide, knocking you directly into Odie! The pig squealed as the two of you roll against the dirt from the force of the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan helplessly before you get back up to your feet, ready to attack again. You lost the element of surprise though, meaning the potential of taking this large feral down diminished dramatically. The Hippowdon snorted and erupted a Sand Tomb attack out from the pores of its back. Waves of sand splattered towards you, and you quickly grab the fallen Grumpig and evade the the attack with a high bound. Odie shoots his hands out, hitting the feral's mind with Confusion and forced the Hippowdon's actions and thoughts to scramble relentlessly. Another backfire occurred while the hippo released multiple and random attacks at the two you in jumbled confusion. The ground rumbled and tore, destroying the landscape around you in a chaotic sandstorm cycling about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wall of sand smashes down over you, swallowing you up in a mound of dirt with only your upper body sticking out through the waving clouds of dust. Through the dirty mist, you watch in fear as you see Odie's thick legs lightly kick out of the Hippowdon's immense maw, struggling effortlessly as they slide down the slimy cavern of the hippo's gullet. A chubby bulge stretches and sinks down through the feral's thick throat and stops at the base of its gut, globing out of its belly. The infected Hippowdon belched loudly and grabbed its new fat, tugging at the round flesh the pig was writhing within in dire amusement. Its purple eyes flicker at you, terrifying your scales on edge before you begin to wriggle within the mound of sand immobilizing you. Looking down, you attempt to free your legs inside the thick amount of sediments as you listen to the heavy footsteps of the hippo nearing you. With one last tug, you twist around after successfully escaping the pile of sand, but woefully fail once you felt meaty hands grasp your tail from behind. A firm wetness chomps down around your tail, forcing an eep of displeasure as your tail is slurped inside its long jaws. You begin to panic and try kicking at the dark lips clamping down on your rear to slip it inside the slimy tunnel. Having you slide back even further, your legs are lifting up with each lip smack, bringing them closer and closer to fold up against your chest. Its thick tongue slithers its way onto your gulped crotch, latching itself onto the hardening bulge stretching out of your shorts to wiggle on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan in unwilling pleasure as your struggling form is brought back with simple mouth pulls, sinking you deeper into the gaping throat waiting to swallow you completely. As your scaly belly gets licked over, you look to see if your friends could help. The infected Kangaskahn had tackled down Wes, drooling over his head as her tongue throbbed around his face with intense licks. The Tyranitar merely grumbled in misery inside his pinned state as the Ursarang roars in bliss with only Xio's head sticking out between its furry rump cheeks, slowly seeping inside its rectum. The Machoke pack leader chuckled as it pushed a weakened Haxorus down past broken shards. Apparently, it had destroyed Clyde's tail and mouth blades for a more comfortable meal to crawl down inside its stomach. Clyde whimpered as the infected humanoid grasped his ankles lifting his hind quarters up to present it to the Machoke's hungry maw. It licks along the soles of the Haxorus' feet, swiping its saliva over the three clawed digits before stuffing the extremities in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hippowdon's sudden chest lick brings you back to your doomed position with your legs pathetically forced up at your upper body. With a powerful gulp, only your head and feet stick, sobbing after moist darkness envelops your vision. You feel your body travel down tail-first into the hippo's large stomach, sliding down next the Odie as he shudders in the slimy heat of the tight chamber. The fleshy walls clench over your two saliva-coated bodies, fixating you to curl into each other for an easy digestion. You weep with the pig as digestive juices begin to sizzle in, pooling up to your fainting forms while the Hippowdon massages them with its hand outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infected Hippowdon grumbled happily with its grinning wet lips, listening to the loud gurgling emitting out from its spherical belly. A struggling Beartic's arms and legs flail uselessly out from its large mouth while the feral licks over its victim. The furry polar bear groans out in submissive failure before a massive swallow sends him sliding down with an unconscious dinosaur and pig to digest with them. The hippo plops down onto its rear with a small tremor rumbling the ground by its weight. The three bodies stewed well inside its gut as it slaps its hands over the sloshing fat, rubbing over the bulges with its smooth palms. It checks back on the others to see a Nidoqueen's motionless tail dangle out of the Kangaskahn's mouth and a yelling Marowak shifting deeper into the Ursarang's stretching anus along with the bug kicking within the bear's outstretched belly. The Machoke's blue and puffed abs jiggle with the stomach's workings on the Haxorus whimper in it as it used a single blade shard to pick its teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis pack of travelers couldn't have shown up at a better time for the ferals, for if they hadn't then they would've had to fought for the lone pig instead of being able to share seven entire snacks.</span></div></div>",

With tensed muscles, you nod to the Serperior and head towards the pursuit. Flora grabs you by the arm however, tugging you back as she looks into your eyes, \"Zeke, be careful! Don't ever let them overpower you or surround you!\" The Nidoqueen worriedly warned you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flashed a small grin, \"I'll try my best. Now come on!

Mark nodded and trailed behind the naga at a quick pace, struggling to keep up with the lithe serpent. Left to fight on your own, you scan the field in hopes to see who was struggling the most. Out in the distance, stood a lone Excadrill, swallowing down more than half of a Haxorus' body. Clyde squirmed in the mole's maw, whimpering while all that remained of his body was sticking outside from chest up. His belly and legs bulge out of the feral's neck, letting the infected Excadrill elicit moans while groping the wiggling lumps with its clawed hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lower your head down and kick back dirt with your right leg, growling loudly as you bolted towards the Excadrill.

Your body comes to a complete halt as you slam into the rock wall head-first, rocking your tough skull violently as you struggle to stand after the pounding tidal wave of pain you suffered. Your entire body trembled while all of your senses were left scrambled in an inattentive mess. Your legs take several dysfunctional steps, unable to keep your balance as your eyes rolled around in their sockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you inevitably fall against your back, groaning loudly as Clyde watched in disappointment. His head slipped past the triumphant Excadrill\u2019s lips, shuddering as the tongue slapped over his face and pulled his body down its narrow throat. The Haxorus\u2019 wobbling body-bulge slid down out of the mole\u2019s neck and chest, collecting together to distend its belly. The Excadrill snickered a hiss and hugged its clawed digits over its new fat pouch sagging out, rubbing over the soft-furred flesh that kicked out from the reptile\u2019s kicks. Reminded of feasting on lizards, the feral looked over to your stunned body, watching you grumble loudly and unable to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brain continued to shake inside your head and your limbs wouldn\u2019t respond into getting up. Suddenly, a wet sensation dragged over your reptilian hindpaws, having some rough material stroke up and down your feet to slather your scales in a slimy substance. Blinking some, you stare down to see the Excadrill having raised your legs ups to lick over your clawed paws. The mole purred as your feet make their way into being stuffed inside its suckling maw while your calves soon suck in between the nibbling jaws. You whine out and squirm to be of what you were capable of doing, yet it all seemed pointless. The Excadrill had already gulped your hind-quarters in and sliced one of his claw-fingers up to clip off your shorts. With your genitals exposed, the feral\u2019s thick tongue dove over your cock and sac, throbbing over the hot meat as you twitch in reflex at the sensitive touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder while the Excadrill marinated your privates in its dense drool, unable to do anything to stop it. With a final lick to now fully-erect member, the tongue wiggled down over your groin to your undefended anus, plunging deep into the pucker that emitted a loud squelching sound. You react with a fierce jolt of your muscles and toss your head back, gasping by the involuntary pleasure slithered inside your rectal walls. Your claws scrunch inside the Excadrill\u2019s esophagus while your loose arms dangle below your exposed upper body swing and cringe. Your blushed face closed its eyes, regretting to help defend Carola Village. Now it would be impossible to track Odie or gain any kind of intelligence on this infection. But could you do? You weren\u2019t going to let some village fall because of your fear or incapability to save it. However, with the draining realization of failure, you loosen whatever pathetic fight you put up against the infected Excadrill in struggles to et it enjoy the last moments of its meal. The feral favored your submission as gladly reward you with tongue pumps in and out of your anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grumble in arousal, slightly humping the roof of the cavernous wet maw as your legs grind in the reverberating throat walls that clench around them. Your cock is pressed tightly between your chubby belly and the infected\u2019s upper mouth rim, finishing the job once you finally release your load of cum. The white goo spews over your belly to droop down to pool inside the Excadrill\u2019s maw. The mole murred happily as the hot seed fills its stuffed mouth, pouring into any small crevice it could find. Your cum began to squirt or bubble out of the outstretched lips of the feral, discovering no room to be left and out to coat you. You release a sigh of pleasured defeat, letting the Excadrill lick up the last of your batch before swallowing you down again. Your back and chest slide in, all until your head tucks down past the throbbing mouth walls, allowing the mole to finish his conquered prey. Tilting up more, the infected Excadrill slurps down your arms above you like thick scaly noodles before your clawed hands submerge inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slip into the already filled stomach, nuzzling against the spit-covered Haxorus, quivering dramatically in terror. Clyde had long ago given up his struggles within the Excadrill stomach, having his head lowered down and choking out whines. You quietly await your shared demise with him, shaking somewhat by the digestive juices that began to spurt inside the organ to coat you even more in mole fluids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Excadrill belched and cupped its clawed hands over the smooth dome of its gut once again. It slid over the round belly that initiated its digestion on the two wet lizards trembling inside, all until the small shakes began to deteriorate into still motionless. It licked its cum-leaking lips, swallowing down the lump of thick spit to rain down on its passed out victims below. It looked over to see the infected pack was successful in apprehending several villagers and swallowing down. It noticed an Excadrill slurping down a Serperior\u2019s tail as it sat atop an unconscious Beartic who would serve as its next meal once done with the naga. The remaining Quagsire pack that had been able to retreat now returned, seeing that the village defense was finally penetrated and weakened. Carola village would soon become a ghost town of belly-filled ferals.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, clawed hands shot out from the ground, latching around your ankles to yank you down. You cry out as your body plunges into the earth that was oddly giving away and crumbling down. Pulled a few feet down into the dirt layer, you crash into the ground, discovering a narrow hole and burrow had been carved out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling from the ache in your rump from the land, you quickly get into a battle stance to see whatever had pulled you into this dug tunnel. Your eyes widen as you notice an infected Excadrill standing before you, having a massive cock sprout out with a Marowak's legs sticking out! Ion's body quickly disappears once the cock-tip tug his legs down, sending a struggling bulge to slide down its muscled length and into the side of the feral's sac. The sheer sight has you staring in bewilderment and disbelief, allowing the Excadrill some time to attack. It thrusted forward, striking its urethral lips to snag your face! You yell though the rippling, wet flesh as it sucks in your smooth skull into the member's bulbous head. Pre squirts out to hit your face as the rod absorbs your shoulders down. From what you thought to be trapped in a narrow tunnel, you were now trapped into an even tighter one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squirm your upper body from side to side as your legs begin to kick in the air once they began to pick off the ground from the Excadrill's cock rising up. At an declining slope, your belly and short-clothed legs tremble for the last time outside before being fully submerged into the penis flesh. The mole chuckled while its cock thrummed with joy by having a nice, plump lizard sliding down within itself, rousing the Excadrill to begin fapping and turning the Marowak inside its sac into its frothy seed. More globs of pre-cum appear to blanket your cock-entering form, making for an easy dip for you to be slurped further down. Your tail-tip vanishes in between the urethra, ending off with a slimy swallowing sound. The Excadrill's palms stroked deeper and faster along its erect flesh, masturbating fervently as your reptilian body curls up within the other testicle of the massive ball sac swinging from the Excadrill's rocking legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeral seed immersed your body, having risen up to your neck with your filling hide. You whimper as you feel Ion's struggles through fleshy walling next to you, groaning before quietly subsiding in motions. You look down to find your scales softening up and becoming paler. Shrinking your eyes back at the disturbing sight, it was enough to force you to faint, sulking down unconsciously into the pool of cum as your body begins to blend with the goo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cock-voring Excadrill began to pant anxiously, sweating a bit as his sac was dragging against the ground from having eaten the two prey catches. The Marowak and Rampardos had finally melted down into hot semen, ready to volcano out of the mole's thick member. With a grunt and a tremendous stroke, big ropes of seed expelled out, shooting and splashing into the small tunnel the Excadrill had dug. Puddles collected and splatted on the dark dirt flooring, sloshing around a bit from the force before settling into nice patches for the feral to stare at. The dino's thick hide certainly produced a large amount of cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Excadrill looked up and heard footsteps approaching above. Efficiently and immediately, it stabbed its arms up into the tunnel ceiling, catching some pokemon's legs by surprise and tugging them down. A plump Nidoqueen fell down into the tunnel, screaming in shock. She landed into the puddles of mole seed along the ground, surprised to see such an amount. But with a closer look, she notices small patches of a Rampardos' shorts that she remembered. Titling her head over, her last surprise would be the oncoming Excadrill maw chomping down on her head.</span></div></div>",

The huge spider gets annoyed and fires Spider Web and sealing your party within the center of the forest! You tired Flamethrower again and Darwin charges in with Iron Tail but the Ariados dodges the flames again and grabs the Aggron's tail!

Mark tried to attack while the arachnid had its back turned but his Ice Punch doesn't freeze it and the large bear is quickly wrapped up and tossed with the others...

It enjoys the prey's movements and its pointless cries for help. It soon reach the end of the cocoon and swallowed the rest of it. It lets out a large burp and moved over to the next cocoon. \"It's quite rare to find one of these scrumptious Swamperts but I'm glad this one came with the Sceptile!\" It then repeated with what it did to the Sceptile. You stand in your silky casing as you observe the gluttonous spider swallow down the second cocoon and enjoying it as it did. Soon the large mudfish was swallowed whole and it went over to Darwin's cocoon. You wanted to help him but your tired and wrapped up in String Shot. All you do now was watch in defeat as your friends get devoured by the Ariados as it gulps down the Aggron then the Beartic and finally the Nidoqueen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it was done and rubbing its enormous belly it scurries over to you and its maw was drooling still \"Oh how a wonderful meal this has been~ Now for some dessert!\" It then grabs your webbed up feet and starts to swallow you down. You didn't even try to fight deep down you knew this would happen and if you couldn't find a cure you would be devoured. The spider noticed you weren't struggling or moving at all and it starts to lick where your crotch was and you let out sudden moan and wriggled a bit from the licking it was doing. Your rod soon became rock hard and throbbing as you tried to hump into its maw. After a minute of licking you let out a sharp screech and released your load into the silk for the Ariados to taste. It makes a loud slurp as it gulps down your crotch area and you close eyes knowing that you wouldn't be able to see the outside world again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large spider soon reached to the dinosaur's head and swallowed one last time. It lets out burp as it strokes its overstuffed belly as it makes small movements from inside. It then hops onto the web to sleep off the huge banquet as the other prey soon gave up like the Rampardos and let their bodies churn in the spider's stomach...</span></div></div>",

However, you could make out several figures in the hue of torchlight, spotting an anthro Absol, female from its figure and choice of clothing, as it wore a grey top around her chest and a loin cloth of the same color while she leans over a wooden table which was sprawled with a map. Across the circular table sat a large Seviper naga, male with a flat and muscular chest and arms, wearing a black hooded jacket lined with red zippers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm...hello.\" You nervously ask. Flora stays close to your side as the two anthros eye your body, mainly focusing on your large, scaly belly digesting the prey inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Absol spoke first, breaking the silence, \"...Oh my, who is this, Grand Elder? These two don't look like they're from around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gruff Stoutland chuckled from behind you, closing the hut door, \"No, Elice, they're not. I caught them snooping around town asking about the infection...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Seviper's crimson gaze flashes and looks down at you, \"They know of it, do they?\" The naga slithers his scaled body closer to you, sliding up coyly towards you as you step back from his intimidating form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, w-we're looking for information or a cure on the infection. Can I ask who you are?\" You kindly ask. The Seviper pauses for a moment, sitting still which terribly made you feel uncomfortable along with Flora as he peered over you with an unreadable expression. The Stoutland walks over to him, whispers something to him and chuckles afterwards. You glance at the Absol, seeing her sit atop the table while crossing her leg over the other, smiling in a witchy way. Suddenly, the serpent grins and strikes out with an open maw! You wince as Flora yelps to see his crimson fangs sink into your shoulder, dripping with venom to seep into the tiny wound. You howl out before collapsing to the ground, struggling through the numbness coursing through your body from the Seviper's poison while your Nidoqueen partner growls at the snake, jumping forward to stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a Night Slash smashes into her side from the Absol and sends her into the stone bricked walls of the hut room. Elice quickly straddles herself atop Flora's stomach, grinning as she held your partner's arms down while calling out, \"Hurry up and bite her with your venom, <i>Solace</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolace, the Seviper, merely coiled around your body, binding you tightly in its spiral as he hissed with a sly grin, \"She's a poison type, so it wouldn't have much effect on her. Besides, she seems weak enough for you to handle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora growled, \"What are you freaks doing? We're trying to save people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Absol on top of her clenched Flora's wrists more powerfully, replying, \"Yes, but we're not ones to just give up an opportunity like this. Now we can eat as many villagers as we want, and if people get too nosy about it all, the infected ferals can be the ones to blame before we ditch this rut of a town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Elder sneered, \"Precisely. And besides, the citizens wouldn't know or care if the two of you '<i>disappeared</i>' suddenly. They probably figured you have left already!\" The old dog chuckled as a loud rumble emits from his gut. \"Chow down time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou writhe within Solace's coils, but he simply tightens his vice grip around you, licking his forked tongue, \"My, what a delicious hide you have, especially with all of that chubby meat on you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Elder raises a hand, \"Now now my selected pair. I didn't share this little scheme of prey for simple meals. Make sure we can...\"</span></div></div>",

His tattered royal blue cape swayed behind him as the source of his panic came into view for you - a Rhydon Guardian that was serving alongside seasoned Rhyperior veterans in the front line for the Royal Army of your castle town within Bulkhead Fort. There were hundreds of thousands of red gleams in the distance - a sure sign of a legion of the Infected. The Charmander that was in your sights looked back every ten seconds to see that the abundant group of assorted Venusaurs, Metagross, Sableyes, Gardevoirs, and Salamences were gaining on him. After a couple glances behind him, he turned around and started running backwards while he faced the oncoming horde and started shooting Ice Beams and Thunderbolts from his hands in an effort to subdue any Sableyes that got within his danger range. The Sableyes were immediately downed with each special attack, but they were still pouring out of the Infected front line in droves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0By this point, you had adjusted your Protector suit in preparation for the worst and prepared an Earthquake-inducing stomp while your commanding officer, an Aggron, yelled to you and the front line, \"Guardians! On my mark!!\" It was plainly visible to you that the uninfected Charmander was nowhere close to escaping the range of an Earthquake attack, and if all 100+ Guardians, yourself included, made a synchronized quake now, the earth beneath the Charmander's feet would become naught but dust, and he would have no chance of avoiding a fate that involved being swallowed up by the earth on which he was making his retreat. With that in mind, you were hesitant about following through with the order, especially when you were quite familiar with the flame lizard for whom you were a personal bodyguard before you were drafted back into the Guardians in preparation for this battle. Now you are presented with a choice... Do you follow the imminent order to make a localized continent-obliterating Earthquake to slow the advance of the Infected, or will you break off of the front line and risk your life in order to defend your former client?</span></span></div></div>",

There was no doubt in your mind that every single member of the front line - yourself included - was needed to get this quake just right. With a heavy weight in your heart, you raised your foot and awaited your commanding officer's order to demolish the earth ahead. All you could think while you waited for the command was, <i>Max... I'm sorry...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then you heard your commander yell out, \"<b>Sink the Infected!!!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You and the other front-line Guardians stomped the earth with all of your collective might, and surely enough, the earth ahead of you was crumbling like dust. The Charmander - the one you thought of as Max - realized that he wasn't going to make it with foot speed alone, so he tried to propel himself toward you with his Flamethrower. Sadly, the Char's flames weren't strong enough to ascend - only to float for a while before the earth underneath the flames crumbled into naught but powder and dust.

You were barely able to stay ahead of the crumbling earth for a while until the earth restabilized. You ended up exhausting yourself in your escape of untimely suicide, and there were still Salamence in the skies that were headed toward Bulkhead. From your position, you tried to fire off Rock Blasts at the flying dragons, and you managed to some of the airborne group's attention with some hits and near-misses, but at least 15 of them managed to get into Bulkhead from the air, and the Pokemon there had no hope of escaping their untimely fates as meals for draconic maws, asses, and cocks. You, on the other hand, were now the center of attention for five of the infected Salamence, all of which were licking their lips in hunger and lust as they looked you over, sized you up, and thought of how to enjoy their new prize...</span></span></div></div>",

Your mind is racing as you desperately think about how to escape with your life, but the Salamence to your right side doesn't seem to have the patience for this unfair standoff. The light-blue dragon suddenly leaps toward you, and all you could see was the hungry look in its eyes before it tackled you and pinned you to the ground. Surely you were strong enough to lighten the load being forced on your body, but you couldn't exactly escape when this dragon immediately shot an Ice Beam into your face and managed to freeze it solid.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As you were headbutting the first Salamence to try to break the ice and allow yourself the ability to breathe, one of its comrades helped to keep you still by holding down your arms while the first started licking at your feet. The feeling of the hungry dragon's broad tongue on your surprisingly sensitive feet caused you to squirm a little before your legs were graciously welcomed into the impatient one's maw, soon to be followed by your lower body. While the Guardians of Bulkhead were running from, and being claimed by, the other Salamences flying through your hometown, this particular enemy specimen was swallowing the lower half of your body with half-lidded eyes; it seemed that your robust, earthy flavor was something that this dragon had quite the penchant for. Your arms were still held down by the diner's friend, and you couldn't manage much effort due to the lack of oxygen. Everything was getting fuzzy, and your head was feeling light as you continued to thrash your head against the second Salamence and the ground in a desperate struggle to breathe again. It didn't take long for the ice to give, and you gasped in the air once your face was free, but you were now shoulder-deep in Salamence maw and throat, with your arms held to your side. All you could do now was try in vain to wriggle outward while your body was being swallowed closer and closer to the dragon's stomach...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">-=O=-</div><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0...You've finally made it into the Salamence's stomach.

In the meantime, the Salamence who ate you was lounging in the central square while his friends were raping and devouring the helpless Guardians and the citizens Bulkhead, and not necessarily in that order. The forces of the Infected would gain a lot of power on this dismal day, and all you would be is a bundle of nutrition for a dragon by the time the struggle for a cure was put to an untimely end...</span></span></div></div>",

You hear your Aggron commander yell in a harsh, unforgiving tone, \"Guardian, you will return to the front line <b>at once</b> if you value your hide!\" as you run with surprising speed toward the Charmander and yell, \"Max!! Hurry up! They're starting!!\" It seems that the Charmander finds a second wind and speeds up when he hears you call him by name, and with unintended motivation from you, Max manages to outrun the Infected in about five minutes, albeit barely so, as he hides behind your bulky body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You know that there is no time to waste before the Rhyperiors of the front line initiate their unified Earthquake attack in an effort to create an impassible trench that will keep the land-based infected at bay, so you easily pick up your magically inclined client and set him on your shoulder to face the incoming Infected before you run back toward the front line. As you figured, more of the Sableyes were rushing to you as you made your desparate dash, but Max easily and swiftly dispatched the incoming Infected scouts with a few Flame Bursts, and the backlash from the Fire attacks did absolutely nothing to slow you down or offer inconvenience. Max may have been doing well, and you may have been closing in on the Rhyperiors, but a Salamence was closing in on you, and the Infected front line was gaining ground.

The rocky bipedal rhino-saur stands at a whopping 7'3\" with about 375 lbs. of bulk that he takes advantage of in order to protect his Charmander client. As a Ground Type, Ramnas is rather stoic and noble, but he can be quite aggressive if he wants to - or if something threatens his client. The Rhydon is devoted to his job, just like religious fanatics are devoted to their god(s), and he takes great pride in keeping his client safe. However, Ramnas's devotion doesn't necessarily mean that he's boring and overly reserved; to the contrary, the Rhydon likes to have a drink every now and again at the local tavern, and he loves to partake in a few friendly drinking games and organized bar fights with either his former brethren in arms or anyone who will humor him for such an activity.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Right now, Ramnas isn't wearing anything as he stands at your bedside, but in the throes of battle, he usually sports a custom-made Protector that was improved from the Royal Guardians' standard-issue gear and designed for greater mobility without sacrificing protection. He also wears his armor in public, but it is the only garment/gear that he wears aside from a huge backpack that is donned when he and his client are out in the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You, the Charmander that Ramnas works so hard to protect, are Max Eclipscia, a wandering mage that has been looking into the particulars of the Infection in hopes of deriving a cure. You stand at about 4'6\" tall when you stand up on the floor next to your bed, and you weigh in at a light 87 lbs. that you don't exactly care to thrust into dangerous situations. You tend to take a backseat when it comes to glory and whatnot - all you really care about is being helpful in bringing about a favorable outcome. Much like your bodyguard, Ramnas, you are passionate about what you do, but whereas he devotes himself to your protection, you devote yourself to your studies and your worship of certain Legendary Pokemon - namely, Ho-oh, Dialga, Rayquaza, and Arceus. Unlike your Guardian, you aren't one to drink. You also aren't a fan of needless violence, and you would rather question/negotiate first, but you are quite capable of defending yourself if the need arises.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Right now, you are wearing nothing but a pair of blue pants as pajamas, but you usually wear a red vest, a pair of dark blue pants with a leather belt that features small pouches for berries and other small necessities, brown leather shoes, and a royal-blue cape in public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ramnas towers over you as you stretch, and after you put your clothes on, he goes on to ask, \"How was your sleep, Max?\" The Rhydon is always extremely concerned with your well-being - much more so than a Guardian is with a client in most cases, and he comes across as the father that your biological one could never hope to be. With that in mind, you tell him about the dream. Ramnas laughs a little when you tell him that you were seeing the dream through his eyes, but aside from that weird detail, he thinks for a bit(not his strongest suit, but he wasn't an idiot) before he assures you, \"It's just a dream - don't let it get to you. I mean, we need to go out and find the cure for this thing today!\"</span></span></div></div>",

A few random anthros would pass you by as they carried on with their routines - some would head to the tavern that was to your right while others would head to the nearby marketplace to your left. However, even with the routine traffic of walking Pokemon that was complimented with the occasional horse-drawn taxi carriage, one couldn't help but sense the uncertainty in the air, for although Bulkhead was famous for its nigh-impenetrable defenses, the Infection was still quite infamous for its onset and virile contagion factor, and for the power that the afflicted possessed.

A few bards were setting the cheerful mood as they played their instruments to favorable effect and good times. Everyone was talking to everyone all at once, and it was truly a trial for the common eavesdropper to pinpoint conversations amidst the chaos. The bar seemed half-full with seated customers who were enjoying some of the strongest ale known across the lands, all of which was specially brewed by Janet, the alluring Gothitelle. Meanwhile, you saw that there was an entrance to a back room, which you weren't sure about, but knew that Ramnas had heard of.

You also go on to let him know that you're just trying to appeal to the textbook medieval fantasy junkies out there. After your efforts to break the fourth wall, Ramnas just blankly stares at you for a little before he starts bursting into loud, hearty laughter. \"Hahaha- And here I thought you mages couldn't hold your wine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After getting a good, unintended laugh out of your bodyguard, you decide to...</span></span></div></div>",

To you, this may have been just another patron within your and Ramnas's vicinity, but Ramnas's eyes widened along with his mouth when he saw this Nido watching the Gothitelle and her work rather intently. Without warning, the gregarious Rhydon suddenly slapped the Nidoking's back with great force that seemed only to push the other formidable male forward over the bar a little. The patrons and the bards became silent when the Nidoking violently pushed Ramnas's arm aside and scowled at your bodyguard, but it took only three seconds of elapsed time for him to convert his visage of retaliatory anger into one of hearty nostalgia as he shouted, \"Hah! If it isn't the Knight in Ale's Armor in the flesh! You're just in time to see me claim conquest over the 'Throbbing Knife!'

However, given your knowledge of type matchups(usually Lesson 3 in most arcane academies), it was clear that the 'King at the bar might be in for some regret if Janet ever lost her cool...and Janet seemed a little on-edge as it stood..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That in mind, you also seem to be overhearing something at the closest table, and there seems to be talk of another safe haven - a civilized hub where the Infection hasn't taken its toll...yet.

As it turned out, your Rhydon Guardian was sensitive about his bulk, and that sensitivity trumped his bond with you in deciding his course of action. Surely, you meant only to poke innocent fun, but apparently, you managed to press a well-hidden ire button in Ramnas's psyche. With that in mind, Ramnas looked at you with sudden disdain and hatred as he harshly grabbed your not-so-built body with a firm, tight grip and brought you up to his face. You could feel the breath being squeezed out of you as the rocky rhino-saur said, \"I told you about that, Max...\" You tried to squirm free and assure your Guardian, \"I'm...sorry...

While Ramnas mulled over the possibilities, you were shuddering as you felt saliva all over your body. Surely, being subjected to such treatment was shocking, but not as much as the revelation that you were...aroused by the warmth and viscosity of Ramnas's drool? And your cock was trying to emerge from your male slit as a result? Your shaft's efforts resulted in success as it poked against Ramnas's hand, and the Rhydon gave a look of surprise that soon turned to a devious visage as he thought of even more ideas...</span></span></div></div>",

At this point, you knew that you were powerless against Ramnas, since you weren't armed with the crossbow that served as the catalyst for your magical abilities, but even if you could, you knew that things would only get worse if that didn't work, so you continued to try out reason, which had the potential to do more than a few futile attempts at struggling could.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0However, before you could speak, Ramnas answered your rhetorical question. \"Yes - Breakfast. Besides, something tells me that this kind of thing would be a guilty pleasure for a lonely little bitch-mage like you...~\" After he spoke, the Rhydon squeezed you again just to see you wince and writhe in agony before he enjoyed his hot, sweet vengeance upon you... With that done, he placed you into his mouth again and continued to savor your berry-coated body while you were continuously slathered with his warm, thick saliva - especially over your half-erect member, which gradually stood straight while you were being prepared for consumption. Ramnas still maintained his devious smile as he demanded, \"Writhe for me, bitch!\" offered, \"Maybe I'll let you out if you do it well enough~\" and continued his sensual assault on your sensitive cock with his tongue and spit.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In response to this, you instinctively writhe to the additional slathering, and you start to give in to your \"guilty pleasures\" - namely, your fetishes for saliva and vore - and you grind and nuzzle against his tongue(partly in hopes of escape and survival, and partly in response to your lust for your fantasies). It seems that Ramnas is satisfied so far, since he's still savoring you instead of swallowing you, and his tongue is manipulating you in such a way that it has you pinned underneath it while lust takes free reign over your body and compels you to thrust into the thick muscle with a pre-tipped shaft while you kiss the tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hopefully your lust will save your ass from becoming Rhydon chow....</span></span></div></div>",

Growlithe flew back while Tia shot a cloud of smog from her mouth to the infected canine. He started suffocating in the smog and tried to walk out, but Tia held him in place. Since it was her smog, it wasn't damaging her lungs. The Growlithe started coughing and then went limp. He had fainted. Tia's stomach growled at this moment. She was hungry, but the grocery store was at least a mile away, and who would know if anything rotted or if any purple-eyed-pokemon were there. She looked at the Growlithe. She never vored before in her life, but seeing few options, she felt it would harm nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a gulp of air before making her move. She put her mouth around the Growlithe's head and moans at the taste of the Growlithe as she continued gulping him down. The Growlithe started waking up inside her. He shot an ember down her esophagus, but all that managed to do was light up her belly for a second. Tia had a few difficulties with his belly and struggling, but she got his chubby gut down. She then got to his rear. She smacked his ass once before continuing to eat him. The reached his feet in no time after his ass went down, and then he was gone. Her belly wiggled and jiggled with the Growlithe's futile attempts to escape alive. Her belly was much more massive than before. Not only did swallowing him whole feel and taste good, but the feeling of her belly being this big was amazing. She let out a satisfied burp, removing the Growlithe's air, making him slowly lose consciousness. She decides to go back to her den and sleep the meal off. She obviously wasn't hungry enough to go get something else to eat... unless it was another feral, of coarse. She got into her king sized bed and started to sleep.

Zebah?...\" Tia asked opening her eyes and turning to see that Zebah wasn't there. She looked down to her feet to see that she was stuck knee deep... Into Zebah's pucker. \"Ah... so, is sleeping stupid is finally awake?\" Zebah asked coyly. \"What? What the Fuck are you doing?\" Tia asked frightfully. \"Warming you up with my ass, what does it look like I'm doing?\" Zebah said jerkily. \"Why would you do such a thing?\" Tia asked, her eyes tearing up. \"I just wanted your den. It looked all cozy from the outside. The Meal is an obvious plus.\" Zebah said. \"What about the Feral chasing you?\" Tia asked. \"All a cover story for anyone inside to let their guard down.\" Zebah said starting to pull Tia in. \"NO! WAIT! STOP! I-I'll tell you what. if you let me go, I'll let you have your way with me. Any way. Oral, Anal, between my tits... I-I'll even be your slave for a week... Deal?\" Tia begged.

Number two, You will do EVERYTHING I tell you to do. You'll be free to not do what it is that I ask you. You will, however, be punished. Number three, You will not hurt me in any way unless if I tell you to. Number four, You will wear a Collar around your neck AT ALL TIMES.\" Zebah said before taking out a blue collar and putting it around Tia's neck. Tia frowned at knowing that she'd be a slave. However, she'd rather be a slave for a week than be in his belly. \"The first thing I want you to do is clear everything of yours but your, well... My bed.\" Zebah said. \"Yes Master.\" Tia said getting to work. Tia worked all night removing what was previously her stuff. The room was now empty with everything but the bed. \"Here you go, Master. All clean.\" Tia said getting back inside the den. \"Sweet work!\" Zebah said. \"I'd like you to sit out in the main room of MY den. Do whatever you want in there, just don't leave the room without my permission.\" Zebah said. Before Tia left, some matters needed to be attended to... outside. \"But before I do, Master... I have to go...\" Tia said holding her belly.\"Make it quick.\" Zebah said before Tia ran outside. After a minute... Tia, now normal sized, returned to the main room of what used to be her home. Now she awaits Zebah's command. He enters the room, Tia is quick to pay attention. \"Back? Good!

She passed a wooden shelter that wasn't there the last time she was in this part of the village, which was 2 months ago. She saw no sign of wear in it, looking like it was built last week. She heard a door opening. Coming from the side out of a door was an Umbreon Anthro. He was 5' 2'' with crimson eyes. He had glorious looking marks on his ears that were atop his head, on his forehead, his shoulders, his hips and his tail. He has black fur all the way across his body. \"Hey there, Sexy.

Tia sighed and said, \"Well, guess I'm going to get him... Why me?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTia went to a fort that was supposedly haunted, seeing nowhere else better to check. She entered through the gate that was long since busted down. She entered the only building. Tia looked to the center of the main room, and in there was Zebah, tied up in rope and scratched on the right cheek to the point that it bleeds lightly. \"Tia, thank arceus you're here! Hurry, before she comes back!\". Tia started to step closer, and from the ceiling jumped out a thin empoleon with an E cup chest and landed  on the floor between Tia and Zebah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, even after he enslaved you, you still want him alive? Interesting.\". The empoleon stepped closer to Tia curiously. Tia looked enraged at her and said, \"I owe him my life for saving me...\". The Empoleon laughed and said, \"After he threatened to end the life you owe him. You BEGGED him to spare your life! And you're risking it to save him? You should be a comedian.\". Tia looked down and gathered her thoughts. after a few seconds, she lifted her head and said, \"Everyone deserves a second chance.\". the sound of this put a smile on Zebah's face. The Empoleon growled and started to charge at Tia with her claws a shadowy black. Tia ran around her just as she slashed at Tia. She quickly turned around and shot her with incinerate.The Empoleon was shot to the floor. But oddly, She started to turn grey and started hair turning  long and red. Her hands took a different shape and her claws changed from yellow to red. And her chest shrunk to a small B cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTia quickly ran to Zebah's side. The Pokemon got up and jumped in front of Tia. Now she could tell that the woman in front of her was a Zoroark. She looked like she had heavy red lipstick and eyeliner on her. \"Why are you so intent on saving him? I want that fucker DEAD!\" The Zoroark said with her eyes tearing up. Tia walked up to her and said \"Because he deserves a second chance like a lot of Pokemon.\" The Zoroark looked at Tia with fury and yelled, \"Not after he killed my husband and daughter!\". The Zoroark held her face in her hands and said, \"Their screams of terror as they went down the abyss known as his mouth still haunt me after 2 years...\". The Zoroark started to have tears roll down her neck. Zebah was struck with fear when she said that. Zebah then says, \"O-Oh! Y-You're Leah. Hey, forgive me, please! I don't want to die. Just let me go and we'll act as if nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah fiercely glared back to Zebah, who almost had a sudden heart attack. \"I'LL KILL YOU IF I ARCEUS DAMN WELL PLEASE!\" Leah yelled. \"Leah,\" Tia said suddenly calming Leah down, \"I'd consider his wishes. He's clearly learned his lesson. If you choose to kill him, I won't stop you. But think for a second on what would truly be right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah had a lot on her mind right now.

She raised her hand and separated her claws. Zebah slightly opened his left eye to see her hand raised. Leah swooped her hand and slashed at the rope, slicing it apart. Zebah didn't have a scratch on him from that slashing motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah then said, \"I don't know how I feel about you now, even though you killed my family.

Am I in heat again?\". Zebah looked at her slightly shocked and said, \"Are you really in heat?\". Leah quickly pulled her hands out, trying not to encourage the urge to fuck someone. \"I should probably sleep this off.\" Leah said laying down on a bed of grass.

She ran as quickly as she could to a nearby river that was quite a popular spot any time of day. Once there, she looked around for any males or herms that were alone. There was the occasional Pokemon, but they were female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is bad, am I really going to have to stay awake the whole night to find a mate?\" Leah said loudly, rubbing her wet pussy as she ran. Suddenly, small fires burst right in front of her. She stopped and turned around to see if anyone was there. And sure enough, there was. an Infernape walked up from behind her, panting, and stepped on the fires to put them out. He was muscular, more so than the average Infernape. His fiery red hair was long and lead to a white furred head with red eyebrows. He had glorious blue eyes to go with that wonderful body. His torso was also covered in white fur. His shoulders, elbows, wrists, chest (Where the nipples are), and knees had golden armor-like sections. he had a long, orange monkey tail. his feet were also covered in white fur. And his fingers and toes were the perfect shade of blue for Leah, Royal blue. Was he looking for her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I needed to stop you. You looked like you were in trouble. But even with my shouting, you seemed to ignore me, so I put that fire there to get your attention.\" The infernape said snuffing out the last flame. \"Sorry, I was looking all around for someone to- why am I explaining this when my prayers have been answered?\" Leah said getting close. \"What do you mean?\" The infernape asked. Leah turned around and got on all fours and said, \"PLEASE, FUCK ME!\". The infernape seemed shocked. Leah now got a chance to see the 9-inch cock he had, and she wanted it inside her so bad. \"Wait, don't you want to get to know each other first?\" the infernape said. Leah looked at him and said, \"That can happen later, right now, fuck me. And I swear to Arceus, don't pull out! I don't care if I get pregnant, just stop me from being in heat!\". \"Are you su-\" was all the Infernape could get out before Leah yelled, \"YES!\". \"okay then...\" The Infernape said walking up to her, quickly growing stiff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed her hips and got his cock in closer. before it entered Leah's awaiting pussy, the Infernape asked, \"Before I enter, what's your name?\". Leah looked back at him and said, \"Does that even matter right now?\". The infernape said, \"Yes, it'd be a little awkward if we don't even know our names. My name's Ike.\". Leah cupped her right breast and said, \"Name's Leah. Nice name to go with that glorious body of yours.\". Ike slowly put himself inside Leah's awaiting pussy. Leah pushed back, putting all of his cock in. \"AAAaahhh!\" Leah shakily moaned as she pushed back. \"Wanting to go rough, do we?\" Ike said increasing his speed a lot. Leah nodded as she panted and fondled her right tit, flicking her nipple. Ike's speed gradually increased from that point. To Leah, sex never felt so good. She started to suck her left tit as she fondled the other one faster. Leah was about to cum, but she wouldn't admit it. in a few moments, Ike's speed maxed out as he said, \"I'm cumming soon!\". as they both cummed, Leah let out a low, lustful moan. \"Oh, Ike, that was amazing.\" Leah said as he stopped cumming. Leah stopped fondling her breasts at this point. \"*Phew* I never cummed harder before in my life.\" Ike said pulling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah felt the feeling of needing to be fucked dissipate into nothing. However, she now knew that she was pregnant. \"Well, the need to be fucked is gone. However, I'm going to be a mother once more. But, I'm glad you put me ahead of any lust you had. And even though I felt I needed rough, like most males that just want to fuck, you started slow. Thank you.\" Leah said sitting down. \"Hey, to me, the woman always gets her way. In terms of sex anyway.\" Ike said sitting down. As Leah started to get up, she said, \"Well, I'm going home. Thanks for the experience.\". Ike stood up and said, \"I'm going with you. It'd be wrong for the kid to grow up without a father, and I'm with no one, so there's no reason for me not to go with you.\". \"Oh, Ike, you're just the sweetest Pokemon I know.\" Leah said with Ike following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reach the fort, the sun was starting to rise. \"Nice place you got here.\" Ike said entering the front gates. They open the door and see Tia and Zebah looking around, probably for Leah. \"Where have you been all night? and who's your friend? and why is he with you?\" Zebah asked, looking at them. Leah blushed and said, \"Well, being in heat kept me awake for two hours after waking up from one hour of tossing and turning in my sleep. I debated on waking you up... But I decided to look for someone while you slept. And long story short, I'm pregnant, and Ike's the father.\". Ike waved and said, \"Nice to meet you.\". Tia yawned and said, \"Well, since we've found her, I'm heading out.\". Leah smiled and said, \"Zebah, you can stay here. Tia, can we come with you?\". Tia, startled, asked, \"Why? It'll be dangerous.\". Leah looked outside and said, \"Well, this area is dangerous in itself, because of all the ferals in this abandoned village.\". Tia smiled and said, \"Sure, let's get going.\".</span></div></div>",

Ike put his left hand over her back and said, \"Well, we'll have to think of one for both sexes. just in case it isn't what we're expecting for.\". Leah moved her right hand to her chin and said, \"I'll think of a girl name, and you think of a boy name. Hmmm... Walda is a good name.\". \"I think Zafir will be a good name for '<i>him</i>'.\". They reach the gates to Greppa grove, which were guarded by a buff looking Lucario. After a quick eye check, the Lucario opened the right gate door and said, \"Welcome to greppa grove. And take care, miss.\". Giving the Lucario a smile, Leah entered first followed by Tia and Ike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA more humanoid Audino stops them after they enter. \"Sorry People, I need to make some health checks. Safety protocol in Greppa grove.\" The Audino says walking to them with medical supplies. Tia and Ike checked out fine. \"Oh, it seems like we have a mother here. Let's check on the egg.\" The Audino said, putting her large ear to Leah's belly. \"Well,\" The Audino said raising her head, \"It seems it's ready to be laid any time within the hour.

Tia came into the tent and looked at the egg. \"Congratz! Uhhh... so how do we figure out it's gender?\" Was all Tia could say. \"We have to wait for it to hatch...

Ike looked up from a card game that Tia and him were playing and asked, \"Back so soon?\". Leah grabbed an orange baby blanket that was given to them from the staff of the Medi tents. The egg moved, so I thought It'd-\". *!CRACK!* \"Hatch soon!\" Leah said taking the egg out of her hair and onto the orange Blanket. The egg was slightly cracked along the center of the egg. The crack started to get bigger as a small black dog nose popped out of the crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon out, We've been waiting for you little one.\" Leah said sticking her claw to the Zoura's nose and let it smell her. \"*BARK*!\" The little Zorua said peeking a small red eye out. \"Hi there.\" Leah said to the Zorua. The Zorua popped the top of the egg off. Leah gasped at what she sees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Ike asked walking over. \"He's a shiny Zorua!!!\" Leah said about to fall backwards. Ike walked over and saw that Zafir was indeed a Shiny Zorua. Pokemon have a weird cycle to go through life, however. All Pokemon after being hatched are non-anthro until later. Some Pokemon call this a <i>Pre-Evolution</i>. Zafir looked at Ike oddly, as if saying, \"Who are you?\". Ike reached his hand slowly forward so that Zafir would smell his hand. Zafir sniffed Ike's finger then sniffing himself. Zafir leaped into Ike's hands and started cuddling him. Leah stood up and said, \"Hey, don't forget to show mama some love.\". Zafir unsteadily stepped onto the ground and snuggled Leah's leg. Zafir started jumping and barking happily. Tia couldn't help but giggle. Once Zafir saw Tia, he hid behind Leah's leg. Leah grabbed him, picked him up and said, \"Relax, that's our friend, Tia. \"Awwoooo?\" was all Zafir said. Leah found a little slit behind his... sorry, HIR ball sack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOP! sorry, it's not a boy. it's a Herm.\" Leah said handing hir to Ike. \"Well, do you want to take hir on a walk?\" Ike asked. \"*WOOF*! *ARF*!\" Zafir said wagging hir tail. \"I guess shi does. Wanna join, Tia?\". Tia looked at them and said, \"Nah, I think I'll catch some sleep.\". \"Your loss.\" Ike said leaving with Zafir and Leah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey're enjoying the warm air in the Park. Zafir runs around looking at everything, also running into a pair of Lopunny cheeks. \"Watch where you're going!\" yelled the Lopunny, not caring to look at who bumped into her ass. Zafir whimpered sadly from being yelled at. \"Sorry, miss. We were just letting little Zafir run around, and that happened.\". The Lopunny finally turned around to see who bumped into her. \"Oh gosh! No, I'm the one who should be sorry for yelling at him. I didn't even turn around to see who bumped me. Oh, and congratz on hir being a shiny.\". Leah grabbed Zafir and said, \"Sorry to have bothered you.\" and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater durring the walk, Zafir stayed close to Leah and Ike. It was peaceful in the Park afterwards. Until a flash of light came from Zafir. The light faded as fast as it appeared. When the light faded, Zafir stood upright, hir blue hair sticking up. Shi had blue hands and feet. Shi was deep brown. and he also had a large black mane around his neck. Shi also had hardly noticeable A cup breasts and hir cock was only 4 inches long<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah... good, finally able to talk.\" Zafir said in a young adult masculine voice. All Pokemon in Anthro forms can breed as long as their reproductive system is able to. Zafir looked at Leah and said, \"Thanks for giving me such a good time for the half day I needed.\". \"The absolute least I could do, Zafir.\"</span></div></div>",

Leah walked over to Tia and asked, \"Who was that?\". Tia, with hands behind her back, said, \"Ohhhh...\" Tia showed a piece of paper to them and said, \"Just the Mayor with a little surprise for you three.\". Tia gave Leah the piece of paper and said, \"A free home?! How?\". Tia guided Leah, Ike, and Zafir into town and said, \"It's a little gift he gave you for having Zafir. I told him, you were looking for a home, and we got documentations going. You came around just as we got finished. \"Sweet! I hope the neighbors are some sexy bitches to fuck!\" Zafir said. \"Zafir! I know you're mature enough to have sex, but just wait to be in a relationship.\" Leah said, still walking. Ike face-palmed and said, \"Didn't you fuck me when we just met?\". Leah glared at Ike and said, \"I was in heat, there's a difference!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reach the house that the deed belonged to. It was a nice home. it was a rather large hut, it seemed to be two story. There were two bedrooms, one with Three-Pokemon bedding, one with Two-Pokemon bedding.Every wall was a lime green. Leah and Ike looked at the rooms. \"Well,\" Leah said, \"It seems Tia will have to be in one of our rooms. Ike, stay with me in the bigger room. Zafir, you can stay in the smaller one. Tia, make a choice on who you'll stay with.\". Tia looked at the two rooms, seeing if there was anything different. She saw nothing besides the size difference. With the differences minor, she decided to stay with...</span></div></div>",

Before Tia went to bed though, Ike and Leah entered the room and told her, \"We're going to be gone for a little date tonight. Keep the home safe while we're gone.\". Zafir thought of how much fun could be had. Tia was sleeping on the bedding. \"Tia,\" Zafir said in the entryway of the room, \"You know how mom and dad are gone? You wanna have some fun while they're gone?\". Tia looked at hir and the pose shi has taken. \"Zafir, no. I don't want to do something like that behind their back.\" Tia said sitting up. Zafir reached the bed and said, \"C'mon, they don't need to know... All we have to do is clean up afterward.\". Tia said as Shi sat down, \"It's the trust factor I'm afraid of.\". \"C'mon Bacon Babe, If they don't know, it won't hurt them. and you're not in heat now, are you? So there's nothing to worry about.\". Tia thought to herself, \"<i>Shi's right... I won't get pregnant, They won't figure out, We'll have some fun... Nothing wrong here to me.</i>\". Tia laid down on her back and said, \"Just do as I say, Handsome.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZafir smiled and said, \"What first, Babe?\". Tia smiled, rolled on her back and said, \"Massage my back.\". Zafir looked at her confused and said, \"Huh?\". Tia looked back at Hir and said, \"It's a little thing called <i>Foreplay</i>. Just go further down my back until you reach my ass and I'll tell you from there.\". Zafir nodded and started rubbing Tia's upper back. \"Oooooh. That feels nice...\" Tia said. Shi did as Tia said from harder to softer. Shi also progressively moved down Tia's back until shi reached the upper part of her cheeks. Zafir looked up from hir hands to Tia and asked, \"I've reached your ass, what now?\". Tia looked back at Zafir and said, \"Continue until you're at the middle of my ass.\". Zafir nodded and continued massaging Tia. Shi felt hir cock stiffening up. Shi reached the middle of Tia's orbs. \"Mmmmmm... Just keep rubbing there for a sec.\" Tia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZafir just stared at Tia's perfect ass. it was large, round, and perfectly sexy for Hir eyes. Then Shi saw Tia's pucker. For some reason, Zafir was just compelled.. to... just... lick it. Shi slowly brought Hir face towards Tia's ass. Tia happened to look back just before Zafir stuck hir face in her cheeks and asked, \"Zafir, what are you doing?\". Zafir looked at Tia for one second before plunging hir face into the orbs. \"Wanting to get to IIIIIIIT!?\" Tia said as she felt a wet, rough, meaty object pass her anus. Tia looked back and saw Zafir licking at her asshole. At first, she was disgusted. But the next moment, she was turned on. \"Keep o-on doing what y-you're doing.\" Tia said, shaking a little bit on the licks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZafir got hir crotch up closer to Tia's ass. Tia obviously knew that Zafir was wildly driven with lust. Tia looked back seductively and said, \"Go on ahead. Fuck my asshole.\". Zafir needed no command, shi was going to do so. \"Is my Bacon bitch ready for this?\" Zafir said, bringing hir cock closer to Tia's pucker. Tia grinned and nodded. Zafir thrust hir hips at an incredible speed. Tia Squealed in both pain and pleasure. Zafir kept up the pace for a while until Tia heard...</span></div></div>",

After all, it's still early in hir life and shi won't be used to Tia. \"I'll stay with you two, if you don't mind.\" Tia said entering the room. Leah laid down and said, \"I don't know how this will work... I mean... We were going to have a romantic night tonight. In fact, we were planning on leaving the hut soon.\". Ike enters the room with his left hand on his chin, wraps his right arm around Tia, and said, \"Well, maybe we can have our romantic night some other night. Maybe we can have a more casual night tonight. We can even have Tia join in the fun, if she wants to.\". Tia looked at Ike and asked, \"What do you mean?\". Ike then walked to the bedding and said, \"We were going to have sex. But I was thinking of having you join in on the fun. I mean, even though Leah's body I love, you still have a very attractive body yourself.\". Leah looked at Ike with a glare at first, but almost instantaneously changed into a sly grin. Leah then looked at Tia and said, \"That sounds like it'd be quite the fun time. Can't wait to get <i>that</i> started.\". Tia ran over to the bedding and laid down directly next to Leah, facing towards her. Tia and Leah smiled seductively at each other then to Ike. \"Give me some room to get some foreplay going.\" Ike said laying down between the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting between them, Leah came in for a deep, passionate kiss. Tia kissed Ike's cheek as both Tia and Leah rubbed Ike's flat belly. Ike grabbed Leah's left breast and Tia's right ass cheek. Tia stopped kissing Ike's cheek after a bit and said, \"I think someone's ready to move away from the Foreplay. Don't you think, Leah?\". Leah, still kissing Ike, looked down and saw how hard Ike was. It was constantly throbbing, needing attention. Leah broke the kiss and said, \"Take his lips, I'll go down under.\". Tia nodded and they both sat up. Tia positioned her nether lips above Ike's mouth, while Leah lined up hers above Ike's throbbing dick. \"Both go down on three. okay?\" Tia said getting ready. Leah nodded. Tia looked down at Ike and said, \"Okay... One... Two...... Three!\". Both of the ladies lowered their hips at the same time onto their intended targets. Ike started licking Tia's pussy while Leah got into a smooth rhythm further down. Both Tia and Leah moaned as the pleasure crept up their spines. Leah looked at Tia with a deep blush and said, \"Tia, bring your face in closer to mine.\". Tia brought her face closer, knowing what she wanted. Leah grabbed Tia gently and passionately kissed her. They moaned into each others mouth. Tia was deeply aroused, as were Ike and Leah. Tia grabbed onto Leah's tits, causing her to open her eyes in shock. Leah closed her eyes again and grabbed onto Tia's. They both fondled the other ones tits, flicking the other ones nipples, as they both moaned into the other ones mouth even louder. Ike stopped licking and said, \"I'm gonna cum!\" then resuming his licking. Leah stopped the kiss long enough for the both of them to say, \"Me too!\". All three of them cummed at the same time. Tia onto Ike's face, Ike into Leah's pussy, and Leah onto Ike's lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another make-out session, Ike finally said, \"Was that enough for you, ladies?\".

Tia got her mounds up to the left side of Ike's Member and said, \"Eh, Just gonna put my tits next to it and start licking.\". Leah placed her pillows next to Ike's member as well and said, \"We're doing this together. I hope you give both of us a good white shower, <i>sweetie</i>. Leah and Tia brought their faces in and stuck their tongues to Ike's pole and start licking. \"Ooooooh.\" Ike moans as he closes his eyes. The girls start to lick slightly faster and lifting and lowering their funbags. \"This feels great.\" Ike said, grabbing the bedding. Tia licked Ike faster and faster as did Leah, until Ike said, \"Get ready, Ladies! Because you're gonna get showered.\". Tia licked at the slit of his cock to speed up the process. Ike started to thrust slightly, so Tia tilted her head up and opened wide, as did Leah. \"Here I cum!\" Ike yelled before his seed shot out of his member, Covering Tia and Leah. Tia gasped at seeing how covered she was, while Leah just started to lick herself clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feels good...\" Tia said starting to lick herself clean. \"Here... let me get that for you...\" Leah said in a sultry tone. Leah then crawled over to Tia and started to lick her off. The feeling of Leah's rough tongue tingled her skin. Leah licked slightly slower when she was around Tia's lips. Then, her intentions became apparent. She kissed Tia, almost flinging her tongue into Tia's. Leah started to once again play with Tia's tits as she moaned. Tia reached for Leah's nethers, almost immediately cumming from the arousal. Leah panted as she lay there on the bed. \"Well, that was better than I thought it'd be. I'm getting tired... Good... Night...\" Leah said falling asleep mid-sentence. \"I think I'll follow suit, good night Tia.\" Ike said closing his eyes. Tia, seeing nothing else to do, closed her eyes as well, drifting into a well deserved sleep.</span></div></div>",

Leah and Tia looked at the window and saw a Cresselia. Her blond hair formed a crescent moon. She had bright blue skin. the front of her torso was yellow. she was slim figured She had a bloated belly, digesting something that made a strange sound. She had magenta half-ring like wings. She had magenta nipples on her C cup breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here, Robin?\" Leah asked Robin, the Cresselia. \"I'm here to warn you about the nightmare Tia was having. If she woke up normally, she wouldn't remember it. So I ate her Nightmares as she had them. I swear, I'm going to have diarrhea all day tomorrow because of this. but what it shows is more important than my well-being.\" Robin said patting her belly. \"So... how are you going to show my nightmares to us?\" Tia asked, Ike and Leah getting a confused look on their faces. Robin reached her thin arm down her throat until she literally threw up rainbows. The puddle on the floor glowed a vibrant pink. \"This is your nightmare, I'll manipulate it to show what it shows.\" Robin said, swirling the puddle with her finger. It showed Tia in a black background. \"You think you can stop the Virus?\" Said a ferocious and strange voice. Tia looked around for anything in the darkness. Tia came upon red glowing eyes. \"I mean you no harm girl... this time...\" Said the voice as the Nightmare Tia started to grab her neck as if she was choking. \"I will destroy all! You cannot stop me!\" Said the voice as the vision faded into a smudgy black. Robin stopped swirling the puddle and stood up. \"And that's the end of it.\" Robin said as before she grabbed a rag and wiped up the puddle. \"So, what is this?\" Leah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea who the voice was... however, this isn't the first time this happened when I did some research. Millions of years ago, this very same thing happened... only... the whole world was under the virus' influence...\" Robin said after throwing away the rag. Tia jumped out of the bedding and said, \"How the hell aren't we infected then?!\". Robin looked to the sky and said, \"Arceus... Arceus saved us by... eating the whole world... I was hatched inside his stomach. As with a lot of the legendaries.\". Tia looked to the skies and asked, \"So, he spat the earth out?\". Robin looked down and then said, \"No... Heeeeee... Shat us out... He killed the virus inside of him and reformed most of the ones that died in his stomach.\". Ike then piped up and said, \"So, you're saying we're all piles of shit?\". Robin frowned and said, \"Unfortunately. But that's not the point. Right now, we're under the same threat as all the world was eons ago. And we need to find who's behind this.\". Tia then said as Zafir opened the door, hearing everything, \"We'll set out in the morning. nothing will stand in our way.\". Robin smiled and said, \"I guess I'll be on my way then.\".

Cooked perfectly.\" Leah said before taking a hefty bite. Zafir was already done with hir piece shi was given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Door suddenly burst open, Robin running in and shutting the door. \"Robin, what are you-\" Leah said before Robin shut her mouth. She put her finger over her mouth. Tia looked down and noticed that her pussy was wet. She looked to the door with fear. Knocking could be heard at the door. Leah started to walk to the door, but Robin stopped her. A majestic male voice on the other side of the door said, \"I know you're in there, Robin... I'll let you free for now... But, one day, you will join me!\". Footsteps walked off away from the door. \"Thank... I don't even know who to thank now...\" Robin said panting. \"Don't you want to thank Arceus?\" Tia asked, putting her arm around Robin. \"NO! I can't thank him! Not after what he's done to me and this world! In fact, if there wads an Anticeus, or Anti-Arceus, I'd be thanking him!\" Robin said clenching her fists. \"WOAH!

Chill Robin, just tell us what happened.\" Ike said. \"Arceus...\" Robin said, crying, \"He... He... Raped me!\". Everyone gasped in absolute shock. \"And that's not even the worst part! He's... He's... INFECTED!!! The Infection must've controlled his system over the eons. and now, his system is corrupted! He's the one behind the virus' revival! So at least I escaped before he cummed.\".

Robin, I haven't expected you to come here. Who's this?\" Arceus said coming out of the shadows. He was 7' 2\". He had white fur with grey accents. He had a yellow \"Belt\" around his waist. He also had yellow finger and toe nails. And strangely, green eyes and cheeks. Tia, Leah and Ike were behind a bush, looking and waiting. \"Shi's a before sex snack for you, Arceus sweetie.\" Robin said in a seductive voice. \"So, you've finally decided to join me? Why the sudden change of heart?\" Arceus asked. \"I thought there would be no way to stop you... So I decided to join the winning team... All I ask is that you let me keep my speech capabilities.\" Robin said. \"That I shall do... But let's inspect the snack first.\" Arceus said, bringing his face closer to hirs. Zafir looked back to see hir mother's and father's face sheding tears of sorrow, seeing their flesh and blood about to die. \"Make this quick... please... Just so it will all end...\" Zafir said, looking back to Arceus. \"By the way, what was your name again, I've forgotten it over the years.\". Arceus looked to robin quickly and said, \"It's Ansel.\" Ansel, Arceus, said. Looking back at Zafir, Ansel said, \"And as for you, young hermaphrodite, You'll be sparred a slow swallow, since you complied so well.\". Zafir closed hir eyes and nodded. Ansel then took off the rope and opened his mouth wide. Leah looked away, almost sobbing. Ansel quickly swallowed hir to appease hir wishes. Leah slowly walked off, Knowing that her son just died. Ike, however, remained watching. \"Ahhh... Delicious snack you've given me. Now, are you ready?\" Ansel said, looking at Robin. \"How are you still infected? Shi was a newly hatched Pokemon.\" Robin said in disbelief. \"Shi had some taint in hir. shi has lusted at one point in hir life. That makes hir not pure.\" Ansel said licking his chaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! We gave up hir life so that-\" Robin said before Ansel yelled, \"WHAT?! <i>WE</i> PLANNED THAT?! You were hoping that shi was pure enough to disinfect me! Who are you with!?\". Robin looked strait into his eyes with rage and said, \"Why the fuck would I tell you?\". Ansel growled demonically, his eyes glowing purple. From the ground came a purple wall. The wll then had chains that wrapped around Robin's arms, legs, and neck. A ball came from around the back of her neck and gagged her mouth shut. Tia and Ike heard Robin's voice in their heads. She said, \"<i><span class=\"clteal\">Tia, Ike... Run like hell! It's over for me... just go!</span></i>\". Robin started to cry, knowing that being infected and being under Ansel's rule was the next thing in her life. Ansel heard Robin's voice in his head next. \"<i><span class=\"cteal\">Just please... Let me keep my speech from this...</span></i>\". Ansel looked at the terror in Robin's face and said, \"I'll grant that wish. Just hold still.\". Robin nodded, still crying. Tia and Ike ran from the scene as fast as they could.</span></div></div>",

Ike put his arm around her back and said, \"Shi died for a noble cause.\". All Leah had to say was, \"Zafir... why?... Why did I let you do that?\". Leah started walking into the hut.

A soft male voice boomed in the silence of the sunrise saying, \"Tia?! Tia, is that you?!\". Tia recognized this voice from years ago. It was a friend that moved out of Lum Village when they were quite young. Tia turned to the voice with a big smile on her face and saw it was her friend. He was a Quilava known as Aedus. He stood less than an inch taller than Tia. He had greenish-blue fur running down his back and the upper parts of his shoulders and his forehead, the rest of his body was creamy in color. His fur was slightly taller on the top of his head, but had spots where the flame spouts are. He also had flame spouts where his tail bone is. He had pointed ears and rose red eyes. \"Well I'll be! It's Aedus!!!\" Tia said running to him and giving him a hug. Leah and Ike turned towards them and Leah said, \"Friend of yours?\". Tia looked back to them and said, \"One that I haven't seen in years!\". They were introduced to him and he told stories of him living here. At the same time, Tia, Leah, and Ike told him why they were on their journey, and what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... Ansel is behind this whole thing? So... Even god has turned his back on us...

You made it out of the situation back there?!?\" Tia asked, not getting closer. \"No... No I didn't...\" Robin said turning around. Tia looked at her face and noticed that her eyes were the same shade of green as Ansel's. \"No... Why did you come after us, Robin?\" Tia asked, taking a step back. Robin crossed her arms over her belly and said, \"Ansel told me not to hurt you... It's hard to do since my appetite has increased by 10 times... So hungry right now... Anyway, I'm here to inform you that we're after you... And don't bother resisting... He's much stronger than you can comprehend. That's my message.

They Enter through the barbed wire city gates and saw a whole bunch of Pokemon. \"Let's find somewhere to stay first... We need a base of operations.\" Leah said walking towards the town. \"Excuse me, are you Tia Hoofoot?\" Asked a feminine voice from the alleyway. A Purrloin  That was no taller than 4' 3'' Was standing in the alley. She had purple fur with white accents. She had pink eyelids and green eyes. Her cat tail managed to reach the ground. The Purrloin girl had B-cup breasts and a rather large ass. Tia looked at her oddly and said, \"Yes. Yes I am.\". The Purrloin smiled and said, \"Good, My master would like to see you now. He has predicted of your coming for the last month, and he's been anxiously waiting for your arrival. \". Tia looked at the door behind her and saw a poster that said, \"Mind &amp; Body Dojo\". Tia and co walked through the door and saw it was a spiffy looking Dojo. The Purrloin girl then said, \"She's here, Master Akil.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind some curtains with a Yin-Yang symbol on them came out a Pokemon. Tia expected a Fighting Type to come out. But, oddly, it was an Espeon. He was at least, Tia estimated, 5'8''. He was quite buff, Unusual for an Espeon. He had purple fur that shined slightly in his sweat. He had a long Tail that split into two half way down the tail. He had a Red Gem on his forehead. He had long ears with a darker purple inside. He also had white Pupils along with his white irises on his purple eyes, but that was normal. \"Welcome, Tia. And friends obviously. I am Akil. You are wondering why I've summoned you here?\" The Espeon said. Tia bowed to him and said, \"Yes. Yes we are. Akil looked to the Purrloin and said, \"Rosa, give our guests some refreshments.\". The Purrloin, apparently named Rosa, smiled and said, \"Right away, Master Akil.\". Rosa left the Main room to a room behind a curtain with a knife and fork. Akil gestured them to a large table in the room he was in before. \"Sit.\" Akil simply said. Everyone sat down on chairs at the table as Rosa came in with what appeared to be pink fruit juices in cocktail glasses. Rosa placed one glass at everyone's spot and said, \"Here you go, one Pecha and Watmel Berry Stinger for each of you, enjoy!\" Everyone willingly accepted the drinks, for as long as you were in the anthro stage, you were old enough to drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sipping his Stinger, Akil said, \"Now Tia. You came here to gain allies for your fight against Ansel, right?\". Tia, after finishing her sip, said, \"Yeah. How do you know?\". Akil looked at her and said, \"I had a vision of you training with me. And then in the same vision... I saw what terror has been unleashed in this world.\". Tia rolled her eyes and said, \"Let me guess. Me fighting Ansel?\". Akil closed his eyes and said, \"Precisely. However, you do not have the power to stop him as of now. In my vision, you trained at this Dojo, fighting toe-to-toe with my power. I may be an Espeon, but my Attack stat is higher than that of a higher-than-average Fighting-Type. You must train with me.\". Tia almost choked on her stinger when she heard this. \"What?!\" Tia asked after she got done coughing. Akil looked at her with a stern face and said, \"It will vastly improve your chances of defeating Ansel! It will require a lot of work. But please, consider my help.\". Tia thought of her options. Either train with him and who knows what will happen, or don't and risk losing in the final battle. Tia thought for a full 15 minutes, having another glass of the Pecha and Watmel Stinger in the process, then decided that.</span></div></div>",

Akil chuckled and smiled at this sight. Tia ran at him and Akil used Retaliate and knocked her down again. \"All of this time here, and you've hardly improved...\" Akil said smiling. Tia opens her eyes, gets up and yells, \"I HAVE!!!\". Tia had a red aura radiate off of her now. Akil opened his eyes in shock. Tia suddenly became really buff, as if she used three bulk ups at the same time. Tia rushed at Akil. Akil blocked the mighty punch the put out and knocked him into the far wall. Tia then became her normal self. Tia was panting heavily as she knelt on the floor. Akil smiled at her and said, \"Well done, what you just used was Superpower. Congratulations, Tia.\". Tia stood up, bowed and said, \"Thank you, Master Akil.\". Tia lit up like a light bulb. Tia's form started changing. She became slightly taller, now at 5' 0'', and a little slimmer. She stopped glowing soon after, now everything was visible. Her tail no longer ended with a crystal-like ball. it was now a ball of fluffy fur. It looked like she had brown overalls on, but it was clearly bare skin. She now sported a small six-pack under her now E-cup size breasts. Tia looked herself over, seeing the lack of fat around her body. She looked at her now slightly buffer arms and gave them a flex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkil walked over to Tia and said, \"Now, your training is complete. Continue with your journey, Tia.\".

Oh, and tell mom and dad that I said, 'Hi' and that I'm fine...I hope to see you some time again, Tia.\". With a final wave, Zafir turned back up the stairs. the stairs and hir eventually faded.

They were green with red irises, just like Ansel's. \"No...\" Tia said taking steps back. Zafir put hir hands on hir hips and then said, \"I've came here under Ansel's power to give you a message. The message is, 'We're after her'. She's safe for now. but when the sun rises once again,\" Zafir licks hir lips, \"She's fair game. Ready to be any of our meals.\". Zafir turned and walked out the door. Akil then shut the door behind hir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Why...\" Tia said continuing the treatment for Ginger's egg. Leah walked to the room where Tia was and said, \"We've got the bed ready for Ginger.\". Tia smiled and said, \"That's good!\". She was unsuccessful at hiding the somberness in her voice. Leah tilted her head and asked, \"What's wrong Tia? I've never seen you act this way.\". Tia looked down and said, \"It's Zafir...\". Leah smiled and said, \"Zafir's fine. Didn't shi say that in your dream?\". Tia looked back up and said, \"Yes, shi did. But I think that was before... Whatever the hell happened.\". Leah sensed some fear in her voice and asked, \"What was it that you saw earlier today?\". Tia frowned and said, \"I... I saw Zafir... and hir eyes... were similar to that of Ansel's... Shi's become... Infected...\". Leah's heart nearly stopped as Tia was saying that. Ike went into the room to see what was the hold up. \"What's taking so long out here?\" Ike asked Leah and Tia. Leah just turned around and hugged Ike. Crying in his chest, she said, \"ZAFIR! WHY?!\". Ike tilted his head at Tia. Tia explained everything. Ike started burning up in rage. \"THAT RAT BASTARD, ANSEL! HE'S GOING TO PAY FOR WHAT HE'S DONE TO HIR!!!\". Ike started burning intensely, until Tia said, \"Calm down, I don't want a hard boiled Ginger!\". Ike realized what was going on and calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Tia went into the room to see what they made for Ginger. It was just how Tia wanted it. The walls were fiery-orange, the furniture was black and red. It was as if they were around a pit of lava/magma. \"It's perfect!\" Tia said placing Ginger's egg onto the red bed with a black hexagonal pattern quilt.</span></div></div>",

I'd want to kill you by thrusting my claws into your heart and ripping it out! However, I feel it would be more fitting if you died the way they did. But, I feel like I deserve more enjoyment out of your death than that.\" With that said, Leah got a devious grin on her face. Zebah panicked and said, \"Tia, please reconsider letting her kill me.\". Tia shook her head no and sat down to enjoy the show. Zebah started to struggle to try to get out of both the tight wrapped rope and Leah's tighter grip. Leah stood up higher above Zebah and said, \"I know how much you like pussy. So ironic that it's going to be the thing of your death. I'm going to enjoy this!\". Leah thrusted her vagina onto Zebah's head. Leah shuddered in anticipation of Zebah's struggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZebah, his eyes submerged, begged, \"Please! Don't kill me! I'll do anything! Just please, stop!\". Leah stopped and said, \"I said the same thing to you two years ago when I saw my husband and my daughter go down that hell hole you call a mouth. And I'm doing the same thing you did when I begged for their lives, Ignoring your pleas and taking you in!\". Leah dropped to the point of covering Zebah's mouth. Muffled begging could be heard. \"OH, THIS FEELS SO GOOD!\" Leah squealed, pushing him in further. Zebah started to struggle once Leah got to his upper arms. \"YES! Don't stop struggling! It turns me on SOOOOO MUCH!\". Tia realized how hot this was getting when she found herself absentmindedly reaching down for her own nethers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Leah was down to the midsection of Zebah's belly. \"OOOOOOHHHH!!!\" Leah moaned, expelling her juices over what was left exposed of Zebah's body. Tia felt herself about to cum as well. Leah's belly started to bulge out a decent amount. Tia felt her clit squeezing her fingers as she cummed all over them. Leah reached Zebah's cock, stiff from arousal. Leah reached for it and squeezed hard, causing Zebah to scream in ecstasy inside Leah's womb. Leah swiftly shoved Zebah to his knees in her pussy. Leah, panting, saw Tia, her fingers wet and cheeks clearly blushing. The sight of Tia like this made Leah blush. Leah then looked down and saw that her belly was now sized as if she was 8 months pregnant with quadruplets. Leah closed her eyes, and with a final slurp, sucked Zebah's legs into her life chamber, which now became Zebah's death chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeah sighed as she stood regularly and faced Tia. Leah then said, \"Liked the show? Don't answer, because by how wet your fingers are, I know you did.\". Tia blushed as she got up. Zebah stopped struggling and faint whimpers were heard in the silent wood fort. Leah hit her stomach lightly and said, \"HEY! Quiet in there!\". Her Belly stopped moving around as Zebah gave up. \"Phew! I'm tired after that. Would you like to stay here for tonight? It gets lonely here often.\" Leah said getting on a pile of grass. Tia walked over to the grass pile and said, \"Sure, maybe I can head out tomorrow to find who or what is causing the infection.\". Leah then said, \"Can I come along? I've been curious since this whole thing started.\". Tia lay her head down on the grass pile and closed her eyes then said, \"Sure, the more the merrier.\". Leah and Tia soon fell asleep. When Tia woke up, she saw a light. It was...</span></div></div>",

Tia started sobbing, knowing this is the end. Tia turned around and tried one last time \"Please, let me live. Rape me, impregnate me, mutilate me... just let me live...\". Zebah rolled his eyes at Tia's pathetic request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitch! your my meal, end of story!\" Zebah cruelly said. Tia remained silent, caught between despair and Fury. She, however, did not put up a fight. \"Just make it quick...\" Tia said softly. Zebah sucked her up his ass as fast as he could. Tia looked at the world around her one last time. The cold, dank place that used to be her home. She curled up and cried until she became unconscious inside of Zebah.</span></div></div>",

There was nothing out of the ordinary. \"Must've been a nightmare.\" Tia said, seeing that everything was okay. The village was unusually quiet today. Sure, it lost all inhabitants but her, but it's even more quiet today, as if the Ferals left in the middle of the night. \"Must be my lucky day!\" Tia said looking around the village. She'll need supplies for her journey across the world if she was going to find the source of the infection. She looked in medical huts to check on any status healing berries. And just her luck, There were a few lum berries. There was also a Rallok berry, a berry discovered just before the infection that aids digestion. She ate the Rallok berry. Spicy and sweet, just how she likes it. She headed on her way to look around the village for anything that would be of assistance. She found an old backpack, it was in fairly good condition. She found nothing else of note. By the time she was done looking through the village, the sun was starting to set. Before she went to her den though, she had other matters to attend to... after she was done with that, Tia, back to normal chubby size, went into her den to end the day on her bed.

Baby steps first.\" Tia said walking east. there is a village she used to go to as a piglet to the east of her now abandoned village and hometown. \"Hopefully nothing bad happened to the village.\" Tia said walking further away from Lum village (Where Tia was at). Now she headed for Grepa Grove, the only other village she knows of. \"Hey, where you going beautiful?\" Said a male voice to her left. She looked in that direction and saw A Blaziken siting on a tree. \"None of your business.\" Tia said moving on. \"Hey, don't be that way. Come here, and we'll have a fun time.\" The Blaziken said getting down from the branch. \"If a fun time is smacking you in the face, I'll get over there.\" Tia said. \"Gimme a chance, babe.\" The Blaziken said in the nicest voice Tia ever heard. Tia started to get soft on him. However, she knew where going with him would more than likely lead to. So she thought hard for a compromise. She turned around and the Blaziken smiled. \"I'm not going with you.\" Tia said making the Blaziken frown. \"However, If this place I'm going to is not in as good of a condition as I'm hoping, I'll come stay with you for a while.\" Tia said, making the Blaziken smile again. \"Alright. At worst I don't get you, but I don't get you angry. Fair enough. If you come looking for me, this tree is my home.\" The Blaziken said. \"Good luck to you if we don't see each other again.\" Tia said continuing east, waving goodbye to the Blaziken.

Soon she was up to her lower chest in Ben's throat. Tia remembered the family she searched the source of the infection for. She closed her eyes, knowing she let her father down.

She landed in the digestive juice filled sack and cried even more. \"I'm sorry Daddy!\" Tia said with her last breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen let out a fiery belch that got the cabin on fire.

Tia exited the Cabin, seeing Safa looking at him. \"Morning Wille!\" Tia said. \"Morning Tia.\" Wille said turning around and seeing Safa, blushing even harder now.

The Gothitelle laughed menacingly, seeing her prey effected by her psychic abilities. The Gothitelle walked up to the three of them, and they all watched in fear as she removed her dress. She grabbed Safa first. Safa looked in fear, not being able to shut her eyelids, as she was positioned head first into Gothitelle's ass.

Everyone struggled hard, but nothing worked. Safa was the first to go. Then it was Wille, who jerked off furiously to finish what Gothitelle started. Then it was poor Tia's turn.

She felt like she was being watched, but couldn't pinpoint the location of anyone seeing her. She looked all around and saw nothing. However, when she quickly turned around, She saw a Ninjask right behind her. He was around 4' 5'', a small one, but he looked no older than 18. he had a scar over his left eye. \"Who are you?\" Tia asked. \"Are you Tia Hoofoot?\" The Ninjask asked. \"Yes, why?\" Tia asked. \"You only seem to be an insignificant threat to the plan. However, one that must be dealt with.\" The Ninjask said, while another one flew north. \"You'll take me on by yourself? Ha, you are at a significant disadvantage!\" Tia said with a big grin. \"In type, maybe. but I'm much faster than you.\" The Ninjask said flying right at her. Tia charged at him with Flame charge. The Ninjask was sent flying, but seemed to be all right. \"Just a little test!\" The Ninjask said before flying at Tia with dark claws. Tia used incinerate for a ranged attack, but the Ninjask weaved around her attacks. The Ninjask night slashed at Tia's face. Tia jumped back. But, the Jinjask nicked her face, causing her to bleed a little. \"I guess you are faster than I thought. Tia rolled in a ball forwards, squishing the Ninjask. \"OWCH!

You seem... off...\" Safa asked. \"I have the strangest feeling going around me.\" Tia said. \"Does it feel like a blanket of energy?\" Safa asked. \"Yes, how do you know?\" Tia asked. \"Let the flow of energy fill your body!\" Safa said excitedly. \"What?

Tia's form started changing. She became slightly taller, now at 5' 0'', and a little slimmer. She stopped glowing, now everything was visible. Her tail no longer ended with a crystal-like ball. it was now a ball of fluffy fur. It looked like she had brown overalls on, but it was clearly bare skin. She now sported a small six-pack under her now E-cup size breasts. Tia looked herself over, seeing the lack of fat around her body. She looked at her now slightly buffer arms and gave them a flex. She looked down to her chest and lifted one of her breasts out of curiosity. \"I guess we now know where the fat went.\" Tia said. She then looked at Wille and Safa, mostly at Wille who was trying to hide that he was hardening. \"Did that turn you on, Wille?\" Tia asked. \"I-If you'll excuse me.\" Wille said before running into the forest. Tia sighed. \"I guess you can't stop men from being perverts...\" Tia said. \"I don't blame him.\" Safa said, blushing right after saying that. \"Bisexual?\" Tia asked. \"Don't think of me any differently because of it...\" Safa said. Tia came running up and groped Safa's breasts from behind. \"I guess we're 'Bi buddies' then.\" Tia said, grinning. Safa obviously had mixed feelings on both the news, and Tia's approach. On the good news, she was happy that she wouldn't be thought of differently by Tia, however it didn't answer how Wille would react to her being Bisexual. On Tia's approach, She felt relieved because it supported what she said, but it was otherwise unwelcome. \"Tia, could you please stop that.\" Safa said blushing furiously. \"Oh, sorry... just having a little fun...\" Tia said backing off a little. \"You two get along while I was gone?\" Wille asked getting back. Tia looked at his legs and saw a little bit of a white liquid on it. Tia got in close and reached onto the white liquid spot. It was sticky. Tia immediately recognized the liquid... Male cum. Tia smiled and looked at Wille. She slowly licked her finger, keeping her eyes on Wille. Wille blushed and turned away. \"You tease!\" Wille said still looking away, making Safa and Tia laugh. \"Well, at this rate, we're never going to find the source of the infection. It's almost mid-day. Let's go south.\" Tia said.</span></div></div>",

It's a jar of liquid that, if you drink it, makes one aspect of you better. It could increase the size of your breasts, or increase your wisdom. But in your case, I'd suggest you increase your beauty, you ugly swine!\" The Milotic said. \"I'm not ugly! and even if I was, I still wouldn't have been as ugly as a Feebas!\" Tia said. \"True, but look where I am now...\" The Milotic said, not even phased by Tia's comment. \"OH, you want to go?\" Tia asked. \"Even if we did fight, and you won, you'd still be ugly. If you want to prove me wrong, Place in at least 10th in the Beauty Contest.\" Milotic said. \"That should be easy, how many could be in that contest anyway?\" Tia said. \"About 200.\" Milotic said slithering away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...After lunch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT BULLSHIT! There is no chemical or anything that can do that! I should know, I'm a scientist!\" Wille said. \"Something must be up... I'll enter that competition so you can study that liquid. Plus, I have a score to settle with that Milotic!\" Tia said.</span></div></div>",

For those of you who don't know them, let's go over the prizes\" said a Sableye in a white tux and top hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait for my meal.\" Sabrina, the Milotic from the day before, said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to the lucky lady at Number one, the most recent product from <i>Karmo Co</i>, our sponsor for 4 years, the body modifier liquid 'Mod Juice'!\" The Sableye said, receiving cheers from the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, MMM! I wonder who will be on the menu today. Everyone here looks so delicious.\" Sabrina said looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you blabbering about, <i>Slutbrina</i>? Tia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you know the other prize for 1st place? Idiot! It's been given to 1st place since this started.\" Sabrina answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Tia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we can't show who the other prize is because 2nd place hasn't been decided yet. But whoever she is, 1st place is lucky enough to get her gobbled down!\" The Sableye said, receiving more cheers from the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What</i>?!\" Tia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you read the prizes from the Rules/Prizes sheet?\" Sabrina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I skimmed through the prizes part of it.\" Tia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, before we start, I must ask you to refrain from touching yourself during the show, think of the others around you. And now, presenting the winner for the past 12 years, the one and only... SABRINA!\" The Sableye said getting immediate cheers from the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my cue!\" Sabrina said slithering onto the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Sabrina... What do you think will happen? Will thirteen be an unlucky number for you? Or will you have your thirteenth meal on this stage?\" The Sableye asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Sid... I'm so beautiful, that Arceus would damn himself if he gave me bad luck.\" Sabrina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to put this plan into action\" Tia said sneaking out. Wille was just outside the door. \"So, where's that juice you needed a sample of?\" Tia asked looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just down that hall. And it's surprisingly loosely guarded.\" He replied, pointing at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On it, just cause a diversion.\" Tia said, running down the adjacent hall. Wille started running down the hallway directly leading to the one guard in the room with the jar containing the strange red liquid. Wille faked the look he needed to get help for the diversion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELP, HELP!\" Wille yelled running down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the problem?\" Said a Zangoose with a blue cap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A charizard is robbing a Froslass down the hall. And I'm at a serious type disadvantage, so I can't help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lead the way!\" The Zangoose said following Wille. Tia came in from a side hall and got out a baster. She carefully unscrewed the lid and took out some of the revolting smelling liquid. She then screwed back on the lid and ran off, just in time. The Zangoose, seeing that Wille lied, returned to his post, not knowing what happened while he was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTia showed the liquid-filled baster to Wille, who set it out on a table and smelled it. Luckily, Tia didn't have to go on stage yet, being the last one that goes up. \"No... It can't be!\" Wille said looking closer at the drop of revolting liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Tia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one way to find out what is wrong...\" Wille said before he licked the drop off of the table. The taste made him gag. He spat the drop out, knowing what it was. \"Tia, you better win this. because this liquid is what we are hoping to stop. I've smelled and tasted the blood of infected ferals for science, and this liquid tastes and smells just like it!\" Wille said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's almost my time to show my stuff to this audience.\" Tia said before she went backstage and Wille going into the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Tia's preformance and down to the last two contestants, Tia and Sabrina...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, who's going to win and who's being din? Tia, the newcomer, or Sabrina, the 12 year Beauty Queen? I have the ballet...\" Sid the Sableye said. Everyone became silent getting in close to see who won. \"And the winner is...\" Sid said opening the envolope.</span></div></div>",

Sabrina picked up the ballet and said, \"What could be so shocking to use Arceus' name in vain?\". Sabrina dropped the ballet with a still and horrified look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina slithered up to Tia's face and yelled, \"T-This can't be! HOW COULD SUCH A BITCH OF AN UGLY AND FAT SWINE OUT DAZZLE ME!?\". Upon hearing this, everyone in the audience gasped. \"Maybe Arceus didn't damn himself. He must've Damned you.\" Tia said with the happiest smirk ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tia just used Will-o-wisp, because that was one sick <b><u>burn</u></b>!\" Sid said, regaining his consciousness. Sabrina started to cry, and said \"You don't know what my life was like before... Before I evolved. I was constantly beaten and given high-risk chores with no pay... The day I evolved, my parents started caring. I told them, 'maybe you should have thought of who I was, not what I was'. I then ran away, I've never seen them since. I've only had sex twice in my life, but both of them were rape. How unfortunate that the second time was a female. I never had anyone that truly loved me... Why must I have been cursed with both a tragic life and being a herm?!\" Sabrina said crying rivers if not flowing oceans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTia jumped at this shocking conclusion and asked, \"Wait... you're a herm? If so, where's your dick?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina turned around so that <b><u>shi</u></b> was looking at Tia and said, \"Milotics have them in a weird place. As with any male or herm Milotic, mine is on my tail.\" Sabrina said pointing to the end of hir tail. Tia didn't notice until now, but the end of hir tail looked like the head of a penis. Sabrina turned around and said, \"Why would you wonder? You must hate me for how I've acted to you.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTia came up to hir, hugged hir, and said, \"I don't hate you. You've had a crummy life and thought other Pokemon were the same way... If I hate anything of you, it's that you were misguided your whole life... And I feel that... you deserve the chance to feel how it is to be loved... If you'd like... We could...\". Sabrina turned around to Tia with a look of hope. Shi brought up the courage to ask, \"W-Wait... You're asking me... to have sex with you?\". Tia passionately  kissed Sabrina on the lips. A kiss that Sabrina was willing to return. Tia broke the kiss and said, \"No, I'm asking if you're willing to let me love you for what short time you have. If so, should we go in back?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina wrapped around Tia softly with hir arms and said, \"YES, LOVE ME LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW! BECAUSE THERE IS NO TOMORROW! And I don't care if anyone other than us see this. In fact, I WOULDN'T MIND IF THE WHOLE WORLD SAW THIS! I JUST WANT TO BE LOVED!\". Sabrina started to cry again. Tia hugged hir lightly harder and said, \"Now, now... there's no need to cry, my pretty...\". Sabrina stopped the hug and hir crying. \"So, how are we going to do this?\" Sabrina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTia pondered this for a second before saying, \"How would you like to do it?\". Sabrina had the widest smile on her face, knowing that she finally had a choice on how they got it going. Sabrina had an immediate answer, \"Well, I never liked Anal... And I don't want to risk getting you pregnant... So there's only one choice, Oral.\". Tia got into position, Sabrina's tail between her breasts and going to be in her mouth, and said, \"Let me do the work. You need a rest from your life's woes.\". Sabrina nodded, as she lay down and looked to enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTia started rubbing her breasts along the end of Sabrina's tail. Sabrina blushed heavily, finally getting the feeling of love she wanted and deserved. Tia smiled, seeing the look of blissful joy going across hir face. So Tia advanced, licking the end of Sabrina's tail. Sabrina moaned lustfully and happily in pleasure. after a whole 5 seconds, Sabrina said, \"Suck me! Suck me, Tia!\". Tia happily obliged, and put her mouth around Sabrina's tail. Tia deep throated Sabrina's tail, enjoying hir taste and smell. After 2 minutes of Tia, who's pace gradually got faster, sucking on Sabrina's tail, Sabrina started humping. It was clear to Tia that Sabrina was about to cum. So Tia quickly increased her pace. Their speeds of Sabrina's humping and Tia's sucking soon were of the same speed. Sabrina arched hir back and yelled, \"I'M GONNA CUM!\". Tia lifted her mouth from Sabrina's tail for just long enough to say, \"If you're going to cum, cum hard. Don't hold back.\". Sabrina started to arch her back to an almost painful level, then yelled in ecstasy. Tia saw a buldge go down Sabrina's tail going towards her mouth. Tia decided to let her cum in. Hir cum came out like a garden hose at full power. Tia felt her ass get wet. but it didn't come from her. It was Sabrina's cum, that was shot strong enough to go through her whole digestive system. Tia felt herself fill up from Sabrina's cum as hir cumming slowly turned to a trickle.</span></div></div>",

Sid came up to Tia and pointed to his wrist as if he had a watch and said, \"Time's getting short, either you eat her, or I get someone who will.\". Tia crossed her arms and said, \"I'm not killing the one I love.\". Sabrina got up and hugged Tia, and said, \"Tia... If anyone would eat me... I want it to be you, the one I genuinely love with all of my heart.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTia turned around and looked at her strait in the eyes and said, \"Are you crazy!?\". Sabrina shook her head and said, \"No, I'm not. I don't want some random person I don't love get the benefits of my nutrients, I'd want them to go to someone I love... and that someone... is you...\". Tia started to lose it and said, \"There has to be some way we can save you!\". Sabrina shook Tia and looked strait into her eyes and said, \"Get a hold of yourself! There's no way I can be saved. and I'd rather you get the nutrients from digesting me than anyone! Please... do it for me...\". Tia looked hurt on the inside. But, a few seconds after, Tia opened her mouth and gestured Sabrina to get in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore putting hir head inside Tia's mouth, shi said \"If it makes you feel any better, I got what I wanted out of life. It's time for you to get yours.\". Sabrina pushed herself down Tia's throat, making sure that Tia got a good taste of her. From that point on, it was Tia swallowing Sabrina down. Tia enjoyed the taste of her love, before and after their lovemaking was done. She soon reached the serpentine part of Sabrina's body. She enjoyed how Sabrina's serpent portion tasted. soon, she was down to the end of her tail. Tia stopped in her tracks. Tia thought in her head, <i>This is the final chance to turn back. do I really want to do this?</i>. As soon as she thought that, some of the scales on Sabrina's tail changed color to pink. It formed a picture of a heart and an arrow pointing toward Tia. The arrow soon went down into Tia's mouth. Tia thought this was her final way of saying '<i>I love you</i>'. Tia knew now that in her heart, Sabrina wanted it to end this way. Tia started to swallow Sabrina to the last bit of her tail. She swallowed the rest of hir and now had a huge belly. It almost looked as though she was pregnant with octuplets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTia's belly rumbled as both gasses built and Sabrina got into position. When the rumbling stopped, Tia said, \"I'll miss you Sabrina...\". Tia burps out the last of Sabrina's air, causing hir to drift into unconsciousness. Wille and Safa came running up onto the stage and gave Tia a big hug. Sid got up and presented the infected liquid to Tia as he said, \"Here's your prize...\". Sid threw the jar strait at Tia and said, \"A FACE FULL OF INFECTION!\". Tia grabbed the Jar and set it down gently. \"CRRRAAAAAAAAAAP!\" Sid yelled, trying to run in the other direction. but all 127 of the other not disqualified or eaten contestants were behind him. Sid looked for anyway out, but Wille grabbed onto his head with his upper mouth. Sid started struggling but soon stopped and said, \"Master is going to be so angry at me...\". Wille glared at him angrily and asked, \"Who is your master?\" Sid chuckled and said, \"I'll never tell you! Not even if you kill all of my kind!\". Wille growled and swallowed him with one gulp. \"MASTER WILL INFECT YOU ALL!\" Sid yelled while sliding down Wille's throat. Wille burped what little air Sid had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day... in the 'Hotel'...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTia was constipated, she couldn't push out what had remained of Sabrina. Tia, after another push, said, \"C'mon Sabrina! I know I love you, but I don't want to keep the crap you made in my body!\". after that was said, she gave one final push, and out came what remained of Sabrina. Tia leaves the 'restroom' and says, \"Finally. I had a tummy ache when shi was in me... But, I'll miss her all the same.\".

All we need is a torch or something. and we can light our way through.\". Wille got the grass and a few twigs onto a thick stick and gave it to Tia, who used incinerate to light the fire. They hesitantly enter the forest. after a little bit, they see a white furred figure. he seemed to be a 5' 3'' absol with a pronounced 6 pack. He looked straight at them and said, \"What are you doing?! Are you trying to get yourselves killed?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Absol quickly ran up and blew out the torch. Tia looked around seeing no light and said, \"What was that for? Now we cant see a fucking thing!\".

My father is the elder in the village. he keeps the place lit for travelers. However, because he's a fire type, I have to get back into the light after so long so that I can see.\". David's head hit the door and he said, \"Ah, we made it. now, there's a certain button somewhere on the gate that will let us in. But I don't remember where it is off the top of my head.

The Tyranitar lifted both of his hands in the air and said, \"You call that pathetic move 'ancientPOWER'?! This is an ancientpower!\" A giant boulder shaped ball of energy formed on top of his arms. he threw it at Wille, knocking him down. When Wille tried to get up, he heard a shattering pop sound coming from his left leg. Wille fell down looked up and yelled, \"FUCKING HELL, THAT HURTS!\". The Tyranitar walked over to Wille and stomped on both of his arms at once, breaking both of them in the process. Wille yelled nothing because of the shock it sent down his system. The Tyranitar lifted his foot and ran towards Safa. The Tyranitar bit down on her hard, paralyzing her. Tia looked frantically for the button but the Tyranitar was too quick for them.

She stood up and yawned then said, \"Has it been 1000 years already?\". Torkoal walked up to her and said, \"Edith, long time no see.\". Edith looked at Torkoal in shock and said, \"Abe?! You're still alive?\". Abe, the Torkoal, Looked down and said, \"By a thread...\". Edith looked sad and held her hands towards him and said, \"I can heal your life. you are the-\". Abe interrupted by lowering Edith's arms, and said, \"No... I've decided this a year ago... I'd give it to whoever was next in line... I'm happy with how my life turned out... I don't need it extended...\". Edith looked at him sadly and said, \"Very well... If that's what you truly want...\". Edith then started to look around at the Pokemon that gathered, until her eyes met Tia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdith floated towards Tia and held her hand out and said, \"Hi, my name's Edith.\". Tia looked at her surprised, gave her a hand shake and said, \"Nice to meet you. were you just coming up to see me?\". Edith shook her head and said, \"Not just that... Your aura tells me you've had many tragedies in your life... More than anyone here. I'm here to do my job and grant you one wish.\". David looked at Tia angrily and mumbled, \"Lucky bitch...\". Tia thought about this deeply for a few seconds and said, \"Well, there's only one thing that will make me happy. I want someone to be revived.\". Edith looked at Tia happily and asked, \"Well, do you have a remnant of the Pokemon's physical body?\". Tia looked shocked for a second, until she remembered that she had a single strand of hair of that Pokemon. The took it out of her Backpack and said, \"Here's one hair of them.\". Edith looked at the hair. She smelled it and turned away and said, \"YUCK! Where'd this nasty smelling thing come from?\". Tia blushed in embarrassment and said, \"That's what was leftover from a Pokemon I ate...\". Edith looked at Tia and said, \"No wonder this smells like someone's asshole! I'll do this quick... You may not like it...\" Edith said as the slit on her belly opened up to an eye of the same royal blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA beam of light shot from the eye and hit Tia, along with the hair. Suddenly, Tia's belly began to grow rapidly, until she looked like she was pregnant with octuplets. Tia looked angrily at Edith and said in a calm voice, \"I said to revive someone... not make me fat...\". Edith floated to right in front of Tia's face and said calmly, \"The magic show isn't done yet... Now, watch me pull a Bunneary out of my hat.\". Edith suddenly puts her arm into Tia's mouth and starts to mess with her throat. Edith pulled out of her mouth and said, \"Now, watch as I pull that Bunneary out without using my hands or my psychic powers.\". Before Tia could say anything, She started to kneel and gag heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSafa came running to Edith and asked, \"What the hell did you do?!\". Edith smiled and said, \"Give hir a moment.\". Tia was still gagging and said, \"I'm gonna... *Gag* Puke at this... *Gag* Rate. why... *Gag* did you do that? *GAG*\". Edith just calmly said, \"If you ate hir, shi'd have to be revived in your stomach.\". Tia smiled at the last thing she said before giving the hardest gag everyone had ever heard of. Suddenly, a bulge was going up Tia's neck at the same time her belly was shrinking. Out of Tia's mouth came a Milotic's head. Soon came out hir F cup breasts, then hir serpent body, then that familiar tail. Tia was surprised that Sabrina was in tact through that. Light breathing came from Sabrina.</span></div></div>",

Edith came in and sat on the bed with Sabrina and said, \"Nope, you're alive is all.\". Sabrina dazedly nodded before realizing what Edith said. once shi realized, shi sat straight up and said, \"A-...A-... ALIVE?! HOW? I was sent down the abyss!\". Safa and Wille came into the room at this time. Edith smiled and said, \"Tia made it possible. I just granted her wish.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSabrina looked around the room, dumbfounded. Shi then looked at Tia, with little puppy dog eyes, and said, \"Tia... I can't thank you enough... When we did what we did... I thought you just acted that... but seeing that I'm here now...\".

The Snorunt had small A cup size under the coat she always wore. They were walking out the door of Grepa Grove High School. They stopped at the end of the path to it where it split. Wille looks at the Snorunt girl with a sad face. He finally said, \"Will I ever see you again, my Cold Sweet?\". The Snorunt looked at him, just as sadly, and said, \"Jason... We will meet again. If you ever forget me, I hope you'll remember someday.\". Wille hugged the Snorunt, closed his eyes, and said, \"I love you...

He then said, \"I'm better than okay... My Cold Sweet.\". Tia looked at Wille confused and asked, \"Cold Sweet?\". Safa returned the hug and said, \"JASON! You remember!\". Edith beamed a huge smile and said, \"Well, I guess I fixed four broken hearts with one wish. I'm glad everyone is happy.\". David came into the room and said, \"I guess my instinct saved one and helped four. I'm glad everyone is in high spirits.\". Everyone went for a walk on the village, near the front gate, when three knocks were heard on it. Tia went to go get it, but David stopped her and said, We wait for them to knock three times before they open it. It keeps traffic in here low.\". Tia nodded when the second triple knock was heard.

Globs of sticky cum poured out of her, now she was an infected feral like the others by have the infected's cum in her system. \"Goodbye... world as... I know it...\" Tia said before she passed out. The Growlithe walked away, freshly infecting another innocent soul. But Tia was still alive. She'd just wake up, never being the same...</span></div></div>",

Tia was confused on why he stopped, until the Growlithe started to lick her pussy, delving his tongue inside the sensitive lips that caused Tia to squirm. The Tepig shudders inside the Growlithe's throat while her folds begin to slicken with pre, emitting loud and wet noises to discomfort Tia in her demise. A few seconds later, he took her whole rump roast in and swallowed it, leaving her sexy legs dangling out from his jaws. With a final gulp, soon everything was in the Growlithe's huge belly.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You may have noticed several things about the Dusclops. She was female, for a start. At a glance, perhaps 5'8\", but up close her true height showed; just tipping over into 6'. She was curvy, possibly a bit more than the average female, heck, a <i>lot</i> more than the average female; her chest was quite endowed, well over a size D. She was draped in long, black robes fashioned from strips of cloth, similar to the kind used to bind Egyptian mummies. Strangely, her eye was a brilliant gold; I suppose most of you know that Dusclops have a red eye. Her limbs were slightly disproportionate; longer and a little less muscled than others, but betrayed her true strength. Grey hair, almost comically anime as it reached her waist, flowed out behind her. And though you couldn't tell unless you asked, her name was Glyph.<br>\r\nGlyph was in a predicament. For a start, she was alone. It wasn't a situation anyone wanted to be in, especially in these troubled times. Everyone knew of the infected: the menacing purple eyes, inability to speak coherently. Glyph knew more than others, though. She knew because she had been infected herself. Not completely; the gash from the bite wound had not been enough to infect her spirit flame, but enough to blur the boundaries between herself and insanity. She held on desperately, not wanting to become what so many before her had succumbed to: a ravenous animal craving whole flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo top it off, it was raining. Heavily. Lightning occasionally split the sky like sparks from the weapons of Gods who tore the heavens apart in a battle for supremacy. Glyph believed in Gods; she believed in anything that could maintain herself. The truth was: she didn't know what was safe to think anymore. One false thought, one corrupted vision, and that would be it. The poison crept though her body, making her feel lethargic. Her vision began to blur. She forced herself to focus again. Faithfully had she followed this dirt track, hoping it would lead her to a safe haven. Perhaps she could even be treated. Perhaps she could be saved...<br>\r\nThe lethargy returned, accompanied by a whining noise that made her deaf to all else. She scolded herself. It was this kind of thinking that was going to get her turned. Or worse... Eaten. She was motivated by not only the desire to remain her proud self, but also by fear. Fear that she may just end up as food for another. She had never even dreamt of practicing it herself; she found it abhorrent and sickening. It was cannibalism, to a certain extent. Even though being a ghost did have its advantages, she still had to eat. Therefore, she stuck to herbs she gathered herself in the forest, making special broths thy were nourishing for herself, but useless to other.<br>\r\nAgain, the symptoms returned, stronger this time. She cried out in terror and desperation. She was <i>not</i> going to lose it today, not after... Not after... All... This...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe collapsed in the mud. As she lay there, another bolt of light illuminated her sorry form, with a foreboding shape looming over her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(<i>The story will take place with a first-person point of view from now on.</i>)</span></div></div>",

You took it and risked a small nibble. It was sweet, but had a bitter tang, yet you ate it anyway.

Light filters through the leafy canopy above, casting splotches of illumination across the forest floor. You stayed alert and looked for any infected that might lurk in the shadows or in the branches above, but you seem to be alone. You reached the dirt track only a few minutes later, where Scorch turned right. You stop, worried.<br>\r\n\"Scorch, that's where I came from,\" you say. He looks over his shoulder.<br>\r\n\"It's also the direction we have to go to get to the Hardrock Mountains,\" he stated.

He looks at you sympathetically.<br>\r\n\"It's ok. You have me. And the sooner we get those berries, the sooner we can reach, well, wherever you were going. I was sick of staying in that den anyway. It was high time I needed some motivation to do something useful,\" and with that he turned around and walked on. You set off after him, not wanting to get left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both walked for a good few hours, before you decided to ask the question.<br>\r\n\"How far is it to these mountains of yours anyway? I've never been to them before,\" Scorch keeps walking, but answers nonetheless.<br>\r\n\"I'd say about 120 pokemiles from here,\" you acknowledge his statement and quicken your pace; he's a lot faster then you. You regret it as you walk straight into his outstretched arm, his ears pricked up and a low growl emitting from his throat.<br>\r\n\"Infected?\" you ask timidly. He stops growling for a moment to whisper something from the side of his mouth.<br>\r\n\"Hide. In the bushes, down the slope,\" he motions the drop to the left. Before you can move, Scorch is tackled by a slavering Zangoose. You sprinted down the hill out of harm's way and skidded to a halt at the base. This was stupid.

You finally make a decision and gather what strength and courage you have left, before running back up the hill and focusing on an orb, cradling it in your arms. You rise over the incline just in time to see Scorch unleash one of the hottest Fire Blasts you've ever seen, before following up with your own attack, throwing the orb with every ounce of force you can muster in your aching arms. It had it's intended effect; slamming the Zangoose into a tree, pulping the wood to splinters and knocking the Zangoose unconscious, if not dead.

I didn't know... I thought you'd be fine with it, y'know, with all the infected around...\" the last statement causes you to sob slightly. He reaches across to you, and to his immense surprise, you hugged him tightly. He pauses for a second, unsure of what to do, but then he returns the hug. The two of you remain that way for a minute or so, and when you finally let go, Scorch's fur is wet and matted from your tears.<br>\r\n\"I guess the saying isn't true then,\" he says. You look up at him, your face still wet. He smiles.<br>\r\n\"My mother always told me that ghost types couldn't cry. 'They're hollow', she said. It's not true at all: you've probably got more emotion than any of us,\" you warm a little on the inside, his kind words soothing you a little.

It had been a peaceful trip most of the way, except in the first two minute when the Zangoose had woken up and had begun struggling. It had make you sick slightly, but you resisted the urge to vomit and waited until the struggles subsided. That was almost as sickening as when it was trying to get out.<br>\r\nScorch had collected some wood, including a nearby tree he had cut down using his claws.<br>\r\n\"Isn't that a bit overkill?\" you said. Scorch shrugged.<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" he replied, before beginning to slice it into logs. You had given up at that point, tired and hungry. By now, Scorch had removed a few berries from his pack for you to eat, and you were just finishing the second one off when something in the fire caught your eye. It shone a brilliant cyan, and you instantly called out to Scorch, who was a little way off breaking up a few more branches.<br>\r\n\"Scorch, do you think you can get that?\" you ask. He looks at the stone.<br>\r\n\"They don't call us fire-types for nothing, you know,\" he plunged his arm in and quickly grabbed it, before pulling it out and leaving it on the log he was using as a chopping block to cool. Though you had the sense not to touch it, you examined it from afar. It was smooth, yet rough, and a light glowed faintly from within.<br>\r\n\"A Dawn Stone...\" you whisper. No-one hears. No-one but you. They were incredibly rare, so had one ended up in a pile of branches in a fire?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was some time later, the moon only just visible over the treeline, when Scorch suggested you both bed down.

A town, it's silhouette the dominant sight on the horizon, lay peacefully on the plains, its inhabitants going about their business like they always did.</i><br>\r\n\"No! Not that! Anything but that!\" you whisper frantically.<br>\r\n<i>The Dusknoir picked the young girl up, cuddling her close.<br>\r\n\"Daddy, can we play hide and seek?\" the Duskull asked eagerly. Her father nodded, smiling.<br>\r\n\"Of course we can, sweetheart,\" he tickled the girl under the chin, making her giggle. \"But... You have to find me first!\" he put the girl down and dived off into the grass, making a trail for her to follow.<br>\r\n\"Daddy! That's not fair!\" the girl pouted in mock annoyance, before setting off after him, laughing. The Dusknoir led her on a merry chase around the meadow for a good 10 minutes, before finally letting her catch up.<br>\r\n\"Tag! You're it!\" she smiled gleefully, before running off. The father stood up and let out a deep laugh.<br>\r\n\"Oh, no you don't!\" he began to chase after the trail of giggles that drifted through the air, the girl all but invisible in the reeds and wild grass.</i><br>\r\n\"No!\" you shake your head furiously, trying to rid yourself of the memory.<br>\r\n<i>The Dusknoir stopped next to a small pile of grass cuttings, from which a suspicious laughter emanated.<br>\r\n\"Hmm. I seem to have lost her! Where </i>could<i> she have gone?\" another giggle came from under the cuttings.<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!\" he shouted as he pulled the girl out from under the cuttings.<br>\r\n\"Now...\" he said. \"I think it's time to go home,\" he hefted the Duskull onto his shoulders. She struggled a little, but he tutted.<br>\r\n\"Come on, it's past your bedtime,\" he said. The Duskull sighed.<br>\r\n\"Yes Daddy,\"</i><br>\r\nYou clamp your hands over your ears to shut out the voices, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<i>\"You must face the past... If you are to move into the future...\"</i><br>\r\nYou hardly register the second voice, yet it echoes around your head.<br>\r\n<i>The sun had finally set, and the two ghost types were now resting inside their humble abode; a single-floored house, crafted from nothing but lime, wood, metal and a great deal of heavy-handedness. The Duskull's mother, also a Dusknoir, was in the kitchen preparing supper. The Duskull girl sat in her room, playing with a Banette doll.<br>\r\n\"Sweetie?\" the girl looked up to see her mother at the door.<br>\r\n\"Yes mummy?\"<br>\r\n\"I need to talk to you about something,\" she sat down next to the girl. The Duskull shifted a little, hugging her doll close.<br>\r\n\"You know you got your gold eye from me, right?\" she said. The girl nodded, but said nothing. The mother continued:<br>\r\n\"Recently, I had a message from the Spirit World. They told me it was to do with you,\" she said.<br>\r\n\"What did they say, mummy?\" she asked quietly. The mother leaned in, as if afraid someone was eavesdropping on them.<br>\r\n\"They said you were... special,\" she said. The girl continued to stare.<br>\r\n\"They told me you were going to change the world,\" the mother said, before sitting back up. \"Now you mustn't tell anyone else about this. It's a family matter, ok?\" the Duskull nodded.<br>\r\n\"I promise I won't tell anyone,\" she whispered. The mother smiled.<br>\r\n\"Ok. Now I'm going to finish off supper...\" she was stopped abruptly by the Duskull's father, who burst into the room, a panicked look on his face.<br>\r\n\"Angela, you need to go,\" he said. Angela stood up.<br>\r\n\"Janus? What ever is the matter?\" Janus shook his head.<br>\r\n\"I can't explain it. Pokemon... They've gone nuts! And their eyes... they're not normal. Violet! I can't say any more; you must go. I have to stay behind to fight them off,\" The Duskull kept holding her doll tight against her chest. A tear fell from Angela's eye.<br>\r\n\"I can't go. You know I can't leave you...\" she sobbed. Janus shook his head slowly.<br>\r\n\"Anglea, dear... You must. They've already killed two townsfolk, and I'm not planning on you two being the next ones on their list,\" he said. \"Now go!\" he thrust the door open wide. Angela quickly swept the Duskull up, making her yelp in fright. Janus ushered them outside with haste.<br>\r\n\"Now you must run. Run as far as you possibly can. I'll catch up with you,\" he smiled.</i><br>\r\n<i>No... Not smiled... Lied...</i> you thought, curled up against the wall, tears running down your face.<br>\r\n<i>The young Duskull began to cry as an explosion caused the earth to shift underneath the trio. A nearby house exploded into shards of flaming stone and burning wood.<br>\r\n\"Shush, Glyph. It's ok,\" Angela cooed to the weeping Duskull. \"It's ok...\" Another building disintegrated, water-types fighting to extinguish it whilst the other, still-sane townspeople fought off the attackers.<br>\r\n\"Angela, please,\" Janus begged. She looked at him hard, before sobbing. She took off, leapt the fence, into the meadow grass and just like that...</i><br>\r\n\"My father was gone from my life...\" you weep quietly, Scorch still gently snoring away on the other side of the den.

You had to make a decent impression on him after all, and you had to learn to steel yourself against those flashbacks in order to do so. Speaking of flashbacks, they seem to be occurring more commonly lately...<br>\r\n\"It's ok. I understand. Lost my uncle a few months ago to an infected. Stuffed down a Leafeon's throa-\" he stops himself as you wince and apologises.<br>\r\n\"Forgot you didn't like vore,\" he says, before beginning to collect the remainder of the items hidden in a small crevice dug into the wall. You pick up your newly acquired Dawn Stone and examine it a bit more closely. The second voice in your flashback... It seemed to have come from the stone itself. You doubted your own sanity for a moment; rocks don't just start talking for no apparent reason... Or maybe the reason wasn't exactly apparent...<br>\r\n\"Glyph,\" Scorch snaps his fingers under your nose. You lean back, startled.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I...\" how do you explain you heard a talking rock without it sounding incredibly stupid?<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter why. Try and stop yourself from doing it if possible: it makes you vulnerable,\" he says. You nod, relieved you don't have to elaborate anything for him. Scorch hefts the contents of his pack over his shoulder, before starting to claw at the entrance you both made last night to stop the infected from tracking you. You concentrate for a minute, willing the Dawn Stone to repeat what it said earlier. Nothing happens at first, but then you hear a faint whisper.<br>\r\n<i>\"Glyph...\"</i> it was definitely not Scorch; the tone was too mellow and soft for him. Perhaps there was something else going on here...<br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * *</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\nBack on the dirt track again. You kicked a stone absent-mindedly, still thinking about this morning. What had that voice said again? Something along the lines of: <i>\"You need to face your past, to live your future\"</i>? What was that supposed to mean? You shook your head and focused. Scorch had said not to lose it like that. You pushed the thought to one side, resolving to deal with it later. Now was the time to stay alert.<br>\r\n<i>\"Pain... Sorrow... Guilt...\"</i> you freeze and look around, scanning the surroundings. Nothing. Was it that bloody rock again? You huff and run to catch up with Scorch. It was a little while before either of you spoke.<br>\r\n\"So how does a Dusclops learn Psycho Boost?\" Scorch asked. The question surprises you.<br>\r\n\"How did you know?\" you ask, curious as to his reasoning.<br>\r\n\"A lot of Pokemon have been trying out any sort of move thy can find lately, what with all the infected, even if it's hopeless. Caught a Wartortle the other day trying to learn something like Bullet Seed. Quite comical to watch actually; he was spitting seeds at a tree for practice...\" he muses. The last part makes you laugh. The corner of Scorch's mouth twitches upwards in what you presume was a smile.<br>\r\n\"So I'm guessing you saw a psychic-type use it first?\" you say. He thinks about it for a second, before shaking his head.<br>\r\n\"No. A Tropius, as a matter of fact,\" he states. You laugh again, and this time he chuckles.<br>\r\n\"Anyway, it backfired on him; got blown into a bloody lake a couple of hundred metres away,\" you wince at the thought; it must've been a damn powerful attack to send him tha far back. \"But I got a pretty good idea of what it looked like: pink, glowing, looked a bit like a miniature sun,\" he says. You nod in agreement.<br>\r\n\"Where did you learn it?\" he asks. You look back at him.<br>\r\n\"I learnt it after experimenting around with Shadow Ball, I guess,\" you lie. You knew it wasn't true: you'd learnt it a long time before that.<br>\r\n\"Ah, ok,\" Scorch says, obviously losing interest. You shrug and continue walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about half an hour later when the attack occurred. Scorch pricked his ears up again and assumed a fighting stance, building up a salvo of fire deep within his body. You could feel him get hotter as the temperature rises, and you prepare in turn. <i>Nothing too stressful this time...</i> you think, remembering your lethargy after knocking out the Zangoose.<br>\r\nThe forest on the right had slowly dropped away to reveal rolling plains, and the cliff on your right had disappeared as well, mirroring the landscape on your left. You knew the track was a well-known highway (if that was was applicable to such a poor excuse for a path), but couldn't help wondering why you were using it; it wasn't exactly inconspicuous. The thought was cut off by a rustle in the grass. You turn towards the sound and ready yourself, charging up a Shadow Ball that cast an eerie light across the floor. Seemingly realising their stealth approach had failed, your attackers stand up and show their full height. A Lilligant and a Scyther, both of them shorter than you but no less menacing. You knew they could and most definitely would eat you given half a chance.<br>\r\nIt was the Scyther who made the first move, springing at you with a speed you could only describe as supernatural, assuming you were the weaker target. That was it's first mistake. Instead of throwing the orb you hel, a futile endeavour as you had hardly any room to throw it by the time you registered the Scyther's attack, you forced it to assume a large, rectangular shape, form an unyielding. <i>Try breaking through a Reflect, bastard,</i> you think as the Scyther collides with your hastily-constructed barrier, earning itself a broken nose for it's troubles. The Scyther scrabbled back up and eyed you curiously, as if deciding whether to eat you or use you as a toy. Meanwhile, Scorch was dealing with an infected of his own as the Lilligant dodged his attacks with supreme agility, teasing him. He growled in frustration and sent another jet of flame it's way. The (decidedly female, you thought to yourself) slid out the way with almost contemptuous ease.<br>\r\nUnfortunately, focusing on your partner's well being left you wide open to attack, which the Scyther promptly takes advantage of, leaping towards you from the right.</span></div></div>",

You slammed the barrier into the floor, trapping the Scyther underneath, causing it to writhe and squirm in pain as you begin to increase the pressure. The keratin on one of the blades cracks, then shatters entirely as you continue to exert even more force on the hapless pokemon. Eventually you can see the hard exoskeleton crumple slightly, and the Scyther begins to choke as you suffocate it with the immense pressure on it's lungs. Fortunately, being merciful was one of your traits, and you dispel the shield, leaving a broken, paralysed and near-unconscious Scyther to cough and splutter on the hard earth.<br>\r\nYou turn to see Scorch, his foot clamped over the Lilligant's throat to stop it from escaping.<br>\r\n\"Bloody quick, this one. I hate it when they're quick,\" he grumbles, before removing his paw. The Lilligant is in a sorry state; retching slightly as she struggles to get her breath back. Scorch picks her up none too gently, before lifting her into the air above his wide-open maw.<br>\r\n\"Scorch...\" you warn. He lowers her down again.<br>\r\n\"Fine. Turn away and try not to listen,\" he says, before continuing with his meal. You do as he says and clamp your hands over your ears to block out everything that goes on behind you, staring at the floor. He taps you on the shoulder a few seconds later.<br>\r\n\"Finished,\" he says. You nod and swallow nervously. He sighs.<br>\r\n\"You're going to have to get over that phobia, and soon. Fear's not a good thing to show when fighting these infected,\" he preaches. You hear a gurgle from his stomach, and can't resist looking down. His stomach hangs down beneath him, a good deal larger than it was a minute a go. You can see the faint struggles of the Lilligant inside, and you look away, sickened. Scorch sighs.<br>\r\n\"Don't like, don't look,\" he states bluntly before setting off down the path again. You recover from your ill feeling and run to catch up with him, before matching his pace.<br>\r\n<i>\"Glyph...\"</i> the voice again. You pull out the Dawn Stone from one of the pockets in your robe and look at it. Still that same fluorescent cyan. Wait. Not just that: there's an outline of something in there. You hold it up to your eye, but the image had disappeared. Perhaps it was just your imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She still can't hear us,\"<br>\r\n\"I know, but we have to keep trying,\"<br>\r\n\"We may not have enough power to do so...\"<br>\r\n\"No. If necessary, we can borrow some of hers. We'll need it if we're going to carry out our task,\"<br>\r\n\"That's going to take a lot of energy. Way more than we can muster, at least,\"<br>\r\n\"I have my ways,\"<br>\r\n\"Which are?\"<br>\r\n\"To put it simply; we're going to meet her face-to-face, very soon indeed...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">* * *</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glyph. Wake up: it's daytime. By the sun I'd say 8 in the morning, and we can make the mountains by this evening if we're quick,\" Scorch says. You yawn and stretch, opening your eye. You had had a good sleep that night: no dreams, no nightmares. Just long, blissful darkness. The way it's supposed to be. You heft yourself to your feet and exit the cave Scorch had found last night. He'd used a technique he called 'Nightwatch' to get his sleep, yet be completely aware of his surroundings. When you asked how, he simply smiled and said:<br>\r\n\"Practice,\"<br>\r\nYou shake off the numbness in your injured arm; the berry's effects were beginning to wear off, and Scorch had warned you had little time left before you started to deteriorate again, before setting off after him. He seems unsettled slightly.<br>\r\n\"Scorch?\" you ask. He looks down at you.<br>\r\n\"This isn't right. There should be a lot more infected here. I expected a fight as soon as I crawled outside, but...\" he leaves the sentence hanging, and you nod in acknowledgement. You had anticipated an increased presence of infected as well, but this was entirely unexpected. Still, you had to keep your guard up; they might just be planning an ambush. Or they might be oblivious to your presence. Either way, nothing good would come if you lost focus.</span></div></div>",

The creature must have thought that dinner was serving itself, as it dropped its aggressive stance and let you advance on your own. Within moments you were right before the beast, circling around him to turn its view away from Kerchief. \"Hey there~\" He probably didn't understand what you were saying, but what the heck; you were sure that he could sense the wanton tone in your voice.

Still, you were in a precarious situation--especially as the croc suddenly and unexpectedly stopped tasting you. You seized up with fear at what this could mean, but your captor didn't bring his maw down upon you just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, you felt your feetpaws bump against something warm and slimy.

The smell of musk permeated your senses in a way that nearly made you dizzy. Closing your eyes, you tried to brace and calm yourself to conserve your strength.

His tongue lulled out, a claw scratching over his plump belly, eyes rolled back in bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt yourself splat to the ground in a heap next to your comrade. Suffering from a different kind of exhaustion than the predator, you tried to lift yourself up with shaky arms. Wiping your face and paws off with a leaf, you heard a noise that deeply unsettled you. It was the Charmander, coughing as though he were gagging on something. Turning to look at him, your blood turned cold as you saw some of the croc's thick cum dribbling from his hacking lips. Jumping to a start, you quickly took him and pulled his lower jaw down, digging your semi-cleanish paws into his mouth to scrape off as much cum from his tongue as you could. The muscle was slimy and tried to stick to your paw, but some awkward discomfort wasn't as important as getting that stuff out of him. After all, being slathered in croc spunk was much more embarrassing than shoving your paws into someone's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I hope I'm not too late...</i> You weren't even sure if the infection was spread by semen, but you couldn't chance it. One more thing you couldn't chance--something that you nearly forgot about--was ignoring the Croconaw. Quickly shooting a glance at the scum, you saw a peculiar site. He was just sitting there, watching, a wicked grin playing over his face. You tilted your head in confusion just before you felt Charmander grab onto your wrists. Spinning your head around to see if something was wrong, a shiver ran down your spine as your eyes met his. They were glittering with renewed ferocity and aggression, something you couldn't have even imagined from the timid Charmander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that something wasn't right, even before he tugged your hands back into his mouth. You yelped as his lips clamped down, a powerful suction on your paws as the fire lizard slurped over them. Trying to yank away, it was no use; the Charmander seemed significantly more powerful than before, hardly even budging against your actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The infection...? It can't possibly take effect that quickly!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut apparently, it did. The Charmander kept feeding your arms into his mouth, chomping down on each new portion that slid over his tongue, never tearing his eyes away from yours. He paused once you were nose-and-nose with him, releasing a teasing huff of hot breath into your face. You knew there was no reasoning with him; Charmander was gone. The beast had taken over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a dastardly grin and a quick slurp over your face, your could-have-been ally stretched his mouth open wide. You caught a quick glimpse of his throat pulsing around your paws before he shoved your head inside. You felt your face squish against that sticky tongue of his, your head becoming flushed with the lizard's drool. His hot Charmander breath was tinged with the musky scent of croc cum--he must have swallowed more than you thought. Cringing as a swallow resounded around you, you weakly struggled as your head was taken into the gullet. This only made the Charmander murrl out in pleasure as he grabbed a hold of your kicking legs, your movements only serving to make his meal all the more savory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis definitely wasn't the way that you expected things to end. You were hoping to end your days sitting on a mound of gold (or perhaps something more comfortable, like yarn balls). Not sliding down into the fire-breather's stomach, where your head was now fitting itself into. You felt his sticky tongue slather over your waist, sliming up your legs as they, too, filled his maw. The pink muscle was soon licking over your hindpaws, his lips sealing around the tip of your tail. You felt him chuckle around you as he watched it flick outside of his lips. Slurping it up like a tasty noodle, the Charmander swallowed the rest of you down to fill his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurling up within, the stomach groaned and throbbed around its first living meal. You tried to push and kick to cause enough discomfort that maybe he'd gag you out, but the walls were too elastic and surprisingly powerful. Each time you moved, it seemed like the stomach pushed back to put you in your place. You soon tired out from exhaustion and lack of breathable air. Slumping against the pulsing, slimy walls of the stomach, you mewled pathetically in defeat. Dizziness came over you, clouding your mind as the gurgles of the Charmander's belly became all you knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Charmander let out a heavy sigh of satisfaction as he rubbed over his gut, leaning against his new Croconaw pal. For his first feeding as an infected Pokemon, it was truly satisfying... Even though that Purrloin was pretty weak, he gave such delicious struggles and flavor! He was the perfect meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he couldn't wait for more. </span></div></div>",

You felt yourself lifted into the air, level with the beast's muzzle, hot air huffing into your face from his reptilian nostrils. That's when you were unceremoniously tossed up into the air with a shocked yeowl, flipping backward as the Pokemon grasped a hand around both your ankles. His other hand took a firm hold on your neck and lowered you down, smooshing your face against the drooling slit of his cock. <i>Ngh, gross...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's more, those slimy cocklips began to stretch over your face as the Croconaw shoved you forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face was suddenly released with a wet <i>shlurk</i> as the Croconaw plopped on his butt, seeming to have been hit.

Did he use a skull bash or something in an effort to help you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever happened, the Charmander was clearly dazed from his attack and Croconaw was none too happy about being smacked around. He lifted the smaller lizard up with a growl, tossing you to the ground and stomping a hefty foot down on you to hold you in place. The force left you gasping for breath, too dizzy to even attempt escape. All you could do was watch as the Charmander was held in the same fashion as you previously were, all prepped for the same treatment.</span></div></div>",

Seems like the little guy finally got his energy back too, as he began squirming and yelling like crazy. The Croconaw's tongue lolled out of his mouth with moans of pleasure, your could-have-been friend being slowly but ravenously stuffed into that beastly member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat cock may have been huge but you could still see the form of the Charmander bulging with his struggles, desperate to escape. Even though the sight chilled you to the bone, you couldn't look away--your eyes were glued to the voracious display as the little lizard slipped deeper. The Croconaw let go once the lizard's legs and tail were the only parts kicking free, grasping his bulging cock instead as he let gravity handle the rest. In slipped those little paws and finally the tail with a slurp. Those wet cocklips extinguished the flame as they closed with a spurt of sticky cum, which splattered over your already-wet face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bulge slowly disappeared as the Croconaw's sac filled up with the weight of the still-struggling lizard.

You could feel the Charmander squirming inside, whimpering as he tried to escape. It was no use, though, and you could tell that his struggles were dying down. The croc was not going to stand for a still sac when he had another little morsel right in front of him, though. You were lifted up again and you waited for the moment to be flipped around, but it seemed like he was going to do something a little different. He guided your feet into his cock slit this time, and you couldn't help but wince as you felt precum oozing between your digits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the Croconaw leaned in and began ravenously huffing and slurping over your face, slobbering all over you as his cock suckled its way farther up your calves. You could only whimper as he had his way with you, and in no time at all your small frame was devoured up to your neck. The croc's tongue was still relentlessly slapping over your face as those cock lips suckled around your neck, oozing pre out beneath your chin... But then he took his cock's head--and yours--fully into his mouth, suckling and slurping like it was some kind of delicious popsicle. Well, you're nothing but food, so you can't blame him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently he had his fill because that tongue stopped slurping, instead pausing to preeeeess against your face. It shoved you the rest of the way into his musky cock, which clenched and suckled around you tighter than any throat probably could. You could feel that god-awful Croconaw stroking around your form as you sunk deeper, your feetpaws dipping into a very slimy and viscous substance. You knew what it was, though: a deadly cum bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were forced to curl up against the fainted Charmander in that churning sac, the lack of air already sending your brain into a tizzy. It was incredibly warm, too. To add insult to injury, the croc started pushing into his sac, intentionally sloshing the two of you around and absolutely drenching you in cum. You knew no one was coming to your rescue. You knew that you'd end up as nothing more than spunk. Your predator was just rubbing your face in it.</span></div></div>",

He lifted its tip to his muzzle and slid it inside his mouth, your fur bristling as he slowly and deliberately sucked on it. <i>\"Mmm...

Opening his mouth, he easily slid your hindpaws inside, slathering them with hot drool as his lips closed around your ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it, y-you freak!\" You tried to kick away from him, but you were just too exhausted. This had to be some method of sick torture... Did these guys molest their inmates or something? That'd certainly explain why he tied you up.

Stop sucking on my paws!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kadabra merely grinned around your ankles, slurping your pads in response, causing you a pained giggle. <i>\"Hmhmhm... You still don't get it, my deliciously clueless cat.\"</i> You heard a smooth gulp and felt something tug at your toes, pulling them into a snug embrace. Stuffing your legs in further, the psychic pokemon moaned as he swallowed up to your knees. <i>\"I'm not merely fondling these exquisite limbs of yours... I'm making them my dinner.\"</i> Another swallow brought you in up to your hips, his tongue lecherously slathering over your rump as it was pulled inside. Apparently, those wide cheeks of his weren't just for show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... This is just some twisted joke!\" You glared at him, halting your squirms as you now allowed him to manhandle you. You wouldn't let him have his fun anymore. \"I'm not going to let you fool me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kadabra stared deep into your eyes, huffing a steamy breath of air over you as he took another deep swallow. His lips were now stretching over your belly, tongue slurping at your back as you felt drool slowly dribble down the length of your tail. <i>\"I assure you this is no joke, my little morsel.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat gaze pierced right through your doubts and hit home; the next resounding gulp jolted you back into action. This was crazy, unbelievable--yet there was no denying the reality anymore. Not with his wet jaws clenching around your chest, teeth gently grinding against your skin. The sensation sent a sudden wave of fright through your being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Don't chew, please!\" You weakly struggled as his tongue lapped at your arms, sending your paws into his hungry gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why not? You told me to bite.\"</i> It seemed as though the Kadabra was not above playing with his food. With another wet <i>shlurk</i>, you found your chin bumping against his nose. Shuddering, you squinted your eyes as he moaned around you again, his steamy breath washing over your face. <i>\"Ohhh, such a delectable slice of meat... I've always wanted Purrloin.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...\" You whimpered, your squirming but a mere wriggle now. \"I'll do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Then get into my belly, where food belongs.\"</i> With a smirk, the Kadabra pushed the rest of you into his slobbery maw, tongue reaching around to slather over your face before stuffing it into his throat. With a deep <i>mmm</i>, your body was sent downward to curl inside his hot gut. The walls gurgled and squeezed around you, forcing you into a ball of fur. You tried to push his stomach away, fighting your fate, but it was no good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Mmmmmm, yes! Keep fighting, you incredible creature! I love savoring everything about you...\"</i> Mewling weakly in defeat as your struggling died down, you were a pathetic mess of bruises and slobber. To make things worse, you knew this fiend would keep taunting you until the end. He only proved this fact by jabbing his fingers into his gut, squishing you around in his stomach. <i>\"Don't stop yet, you tasty thing! <b>Squirm for me.</b>\"</i> His jostling caused you unwilling struggles, unable to resist his invasive prodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon tired out, though, the fight left in you gone for good.

Slipping the hair between his lips, he let out a moan as he gave it a long suckle. <i>Faint, but still delicious...</i> He slurped the last trace of you down into his gut to digest with the rest of his meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I hope more Purrloins come across our fort...</i> He smiled, absently petting his belly bulge. <i>Though, I will have to humbly request that the other guards leave them for me to handle.</i></span></div></div>",

Your eyes darted forward, the site before you sending your fur straight up.

The shock nearly knocked you off the ledge, but you sighed in relief as you managed to keep your balance. You sighed too soon though, because the next thing you knew, a Seismitoad slammed its body against the shaky wall and sent you falling to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you landed outside of the village. Cringing as you lifted yourself up, your heart sank as you saw beady eyes all around...focused on you. The teeming mass of hungry beasts was momentarily still, as if they were silently deciding who got to devour you. It didn't take long for the Seismitoad to step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one is <i>mine,</i> boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toad peered down at you with aggressive, hungry eyes, his tongue sliding out to teasingly lap over his curled lips. The gesture sent a shiver down your spine. \"Please, I-I..!\" You didn't have the chance to say anything more before the Seismitoad lunged, clutching its massively hefty hands around your entire torso, pinning your arms to your sides. A soft whimper left your lips just as his open maw dropped down upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquirm and writhe as you might, your predator was just too powerful. He suckled you in between his drooling lips like a fuzzy noodle, moaning around you as you slid over his sticky tongue. Considering the way he was slathering you up with his thick tongue, coating you in heavy and slimy frog slobber, you must have tasted pretty damn good. It wasn't long before your head was lodged into his throat, the tunnel pulsing and sucking you in deeper. You felt his hands leave you as his lips closed over your ankles... This was it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a few more thick <i>glucks</i>, the rest of your body slid over his tongue and into his throbbing gullet. The passage squeezed and tugged before depositing you into his steamy gut. The chamber gurgled and sloshed you about, compressing around your feeble body. Nothing but food now, cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Seismitoad belched and smacked his gut, the jostling stomach being the last thing you felt before you fell unconsciousness.</span></div></div>",

It's the vault of the mayor, the one you snuck into a few days ago. The greedy Honchkrow stockpiled loads of food and other goods in there as if he were preparing for the apocalypse (maybe he was...but rather, the frogocalypse). It was risky, though, because the mayor may have already locked himself up in there and barred it from the inside.

You barged through the double-doors, not particularly caring who heard--now was not necessarily the time for secrecy. A look behind you was enough to light a fire beneath your rear. The infected Pokemon already broke through the main gates and were ravaging the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed as though not a single soul was in the house. It was eerily quiet within, the only sounds coming from the shrieking commotion outside. The silence put you on edge, even as you reached the vault. The door was massive, imposing; not something you could ever even dream of smashing down without blowing up the entire tree. <i>Well, time to get to work.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vault required a combination and a key to get inside. You knew the combination (unless the mayor changed it since your break-in) but you didn't have the key. Additionally, the key had to be twisted a particular way each time you hit a combination number on the dial. The mayor sure was thorough when it came to locking up his own goods... Much more secure than he kept the city walls, apparently.<i>I mean, seriously. Wooden walls? That's</i> asking <i>for trouble.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your distracting thoughts aside, you pulled your lockpick out of your satchel and stuck it into the keyhole. Putting your ear to the door, you carefully spun the dial until you heard the click of a successful number. Wriggling your lockpick in the right direction was more difficult, though, proving the whole operation to be quite time consuming.</span></div></div>",

While you'd obviously never worked together before, surely numbers had to count for something.

The Croagunk slithered its tongue out of its mouth, curling the sticky appendage around your face as it began to taste you. It slowly rolled over your fur, slathering you with slimy drool, the frog pokemon taking all the time in the world to savor you. And why not, for you were completely at its mercy. You'd been trying to struggle but your limbs refused to move--you couldn't even twitch a finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Croagunk let you fall to the ground as the poison set in deeper. This allowed it to explore more of your body, not just your head. His tongue slopped down your back and around your tail, reaching around to wetly caress your rump. Barely managing a whimper as he lifted your waist up by the tail, you felt the slimy thing push between your cheeks to sample that sensitive little pucker of yours. With the venom muddling your mind, it was easy for your body to override your fear and become aroused by the slimy sensation sneaking between your legs. Croagunk's toxins apparently didn't stop your blood from rushing to your cock, the little member hardening as it was coated in warm saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frog didn't mind what was going on against its tongue--in fact, it was enjoying the musky flavor rising from this particular spot on its meal. Grabbing your waist and clamping its lips over your rear like a cat sandwich, it let your member nestle into the soft, slimy folds of its tongue. The gooey mass throbbed against you as it worked against your cock, simultaneously smooshing and rubbing against your tailhole. Thick saliva was soon dripping from your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou completely forgot the situation in your senseless bliss. Blood seemed to pump through your cock just as intensely as the poison pulsing through your veins, though you couldn't even smile as you enjoyed yourself. But that didn't matter--all you knew was the powerful suction on your rear and that pleasurable, wet feeling at your crotch. You didn't have to beg for release too long, though, as another minute sent your cum spilling out over your chest and the frog's sticky tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning from the flavor exploding over its talented licker, the Croagunk was finally satisfied. With its food now dolloped with a helping of cream, it set to work with wrapping its lips further around you. A thick <i>shlop</i> could be heard as its drooling maw reached around your waist. You were still too overcome by pleasure to remember what was happening, though, and the steamy breath only made you feel all the cozier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before your head was the only thing sticking out of the Croagunk's slimy mouth. It gave one more snigger as its tongue lathered your face in sticky frog drool, the tip pushing that delectable little head of yours inside. Lips sealed your fate as darkness consumed you, though the dancing colors behind your eyelids where the only thing you could see anyway. With another swallow your head was lodged in its throat, sliding down to fill up that hungry gut below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThick gurgles and groans filled your senses as the Croagunk's belly surged around you. Dazed and confused, you still had no idea what had happened as your consciousness swam away in the belly of the beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a heavy belch, the frog smiled as its breath smelled of bird and cat.

You were sure that you could actually fit in those, but then there'd be nothing to conceal you--without cover, a frog would easily slurp you out of there. Your eyes finally came to rest on a large pile of berries. It wasn't the optimal hiding spot, but it would have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dove into the pile and burrowed your way inside. You were thankful that there were enough berries to topple in over the path you burrowed, effectively covering your tracks. You hit the corner between ground and wall and stopped.

Hot breath rolled out as it opened its maw; you were given a detailed looked inside as it hovered over you, the egotistical bastard wanting to show off where you were headed. Its palate drizzled thick strands of drool over the tongue that began to slip beneath you, the slimy muscle rubbing against your fur.

As the lips closed you fell flat on your face, your cheeks cushioned by the grimy tongue of your predator.

You were thankful that you didn't pop yourself, but your gratitude was smothered as the Venusaur continued to \"chew.\" You were sloshed around its maw as the berries were crushed into a fruity paste, creating a thick, chunky soup to accompany you. The pokemon seemed to want you in one piece, though; while its maw was handling you roughly, you were merely slopped and squished around as it savored its meal. Venusaur was taking its time mashing up its food, tasting every ounce of its Purloin-soup. Bits of light would occasionally shine inside with its mastication, briefly giving its insides a brighter appearance. </span></div></div>",

The sticky stew drained down, sloshing into the gullet before you did. Nothing could stop gravity as you slid down to follow, the throat playfully squeezing around you as you entered. Even though the Venusaur didn't need to swallow, it seemed as though he wanted to feel your struggles press against the sensitive but powerful muscles. They rippled and pulsed as they squeezed you down, dragging your wet body into the frog leader's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Venusaur's belly was quite roomy despite its other contents--you noticed that you weren't the only one to fall prey to this beast. You were pressed between a Pidgeot and two Noctowls, all of whom were unconscious. You whimpered and huddled into yourself as your personal bubble was invaded by the toad's other meals. The stomach contracted and squished around you guys, stirring the fruity broth that was quickly heating up. The Venusaur didn't have to be a fire type to have a boiling heat rise within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slimy gut stewed around its food, contracting tighter and tighter with powerful force. You could do nothing but accept your fate as you began to lose your consciousness, submitting to the bowels of the beast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your deranged stupor, you bitterly laughed at the thought of being a fruit cocktail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe belly of the Venusaur gurgled and groaned with its meal, but no one seemed to pay attention.

For now. </span></div></div>",

No!\" You weren't paying attention to what was behind you. Tripping over God-knows-what, you crashed back into a pile of food and other junk with a wailing grunt. Your paws slipped on this and that as you tried to scramble up, but your attempts were useless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mayor was already upon you, air rushing around your body as his wings cupped around the pile you were struggling in. Things became darker as the Honchkrow leaned in, his face a mere inch from your own, wings blocking your escape. \"You don't have to be infected to feed on other Pokemon, you know. Sometimes you'll encounter someone who develops such...desires. Like moi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your personal bubble rapidly shrink as his wings further encroached upon you, the small space suddenly becoming much warmer. \"Ahhhh...\" His hot breath washed over your chest as he stared into your eyes, practically paralyzing you with his gaze. \"What to do now, hmmmm?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, he's just trying to scare me. Pokemon don't normally eat other Pokemon--he's lying to get back at me! He has to be!</i> Your eyes darted around you, but they could only return to one thing: those overpowering, trance-like set of eyes. They told you that you were wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to bid life adieu, my dear thief.\" The Honchkrow's massive beak opened wide, revealing a thick, drool-coated tongue and a quivering gullet. Hot bird breath washed over you, smelling of crushed seeds tinged with a sort of muskiness, causing your fur to cling to your skin from the damp air. This, you realized, was the mouth of a predator. A predator there was no escape from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Honchkrow slowly pressed his maw over your head, squishing your face against his slimy tongue. The bird cooed in pleasure at your taste, tongue writhing against you, slathering you down as the world became impossibly darker. His beak then clamped over your torso with a gentle sort of strength. The powerful muscle beneath you curled your back into the curve of his upper-beak so that it could graze without you moving all over the place. You tried to struggle despite the hopelessness of it all, but this only seemed to pleasure the bird as he suckled on your apparently-delicious body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eventually had enough of that, though--his belly rumbled, demanding your filling presence. The mayor grinned as he stuffed the rest of you into his ravenous beak, shutting it with a soft <i>clack.</i> Your struggles could be seen in his throat after a hefty gulp, your feline form being squeezed by the peristaltic muscles as gravity helped them suck you down deeper. In only a few short moments, you plopped into the Honchkrow's gut, surrounded by the slimy walls and what you presumed to be the mush of some half-digested seeds. You were already short of breath. The steamy air surrounding you certainly wasn't helping...especially since a great deal of it vanished as the mayor let out an uncharacteristic wet belch. Your vision became dizzy, your mind hazy... Your struggles died down as the throbbing walls of the stomach stole your consciousness away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...\" The Honchkrow reclined against a wall, rubbing his feathered gut in appreciation of his meal. \"Too bad you won't live to learn from this valuable lesson.\"</span></div></div>",

His foggy mind couldn't get a grasp on why he felt so bad, or why he had even been thrown out in the first place, but one basic need fought its way to the front of his mind. <i>I'm so tired...</i> The Luxray dragged his body against the side of a building and curled up, falling asleep quickly despite the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Luxray woke with a start.

He remembered the events of last night only vaguely, although he realized he was in someone's house.

Despite himself, the Luxray almost automatically sized up her attractive body. Her breasts and ass weren't large by his standards, but that left her with a pure, simple beauty. She clearly noticed how his gaze wandered, because when he looked into her hazel-colored eyes, they displayed a slight annoyance. \"What the hell happened last night?\" she asked him. \"Who was that guy?\" Her voice sounded young and smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I have no idea...\" the Luxray stated truthfully. \"He just kind of... jumped me.\" His guardian didn't seem to fully believe him. \"Well... You're lucky I had just gotten home. He seemed pretty dangerous.\" \"Yeah... Thanks for opening that door. I probably would have been screwed if you didn't. What... What happened after I fainted?\" The Absol crossed her arms in a way that he thought made her look cute. \"He tried to break down the door... It was really freaky. Didn't say anything, just pounded on the door. He left after a while...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Luxray noticed that the Absol had left a small bowl of berries by his bed, and he took a bite of one, finding it refreshing. It tasted so natural... It must have been weeks since he had eaten any real food. \"Thank you.. Uhh... What's your name?\" he asked. The Absol hesitated for a moment before telling him. \"Silva,\" she replied. \"Okay,\" he said. \"I'm-\" \"Oh, I know who you are,\" she interrupted him. \"What? Seriously?\" he asked, incredulous. \"Yeah,\" she said. \"I work at a bar a few buildings down... All of the employees are told not to let you in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Luxray couldn't help but laugh at that, almost choking on the bits of berry in his mouth. \"I didn't know I was so popular!\" he exclaimed, still chuckling. Silva's face stayed straight, causing him to feel awkward. \"Do you think you can stand up?\" she asked, shifting the subject off of her previous knowledge of him. \"Uhh, maybe,\" he replied, honestly unsure of his ability to stay upright.</span></div></div>",

In fact, he doubted he could have survived another week if this turn of events hadn't landed him a temporary home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He had no memories of his parents, which might be a result of his excessive use of drugs and alcohol. He had a name, but it wasn't given to him by his parents... A long time ago, before he was ten years old, he had been caught stealing from a restaurant. The nice old Kangaskhan who found him didn't turn him in, though. Instead, she gave him leftovers from the kitchen. She took to calling him Vole because of his ragged appearance and diet of table scraps. <i>Vole... That's my name</i>. It wasn't elegant and certainly not noble, but he kept it because it was given to him by the woman who saved his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One day, she didn't appear at their normal meeting place. Vole searched through the restaurant, but he couldn't find her. He waited behind the building for days, but she didn't come. After that, he never went back to that place. He never learned what happened to her- he didn't even ask anyone because he was afraid to know. Since then, life had only gotten harder, until now, when Silva rescued him. Looking into her eyes, he felt like he had a reason to live again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When his attention finally snapped back to the present, Vole realized he must have been standing here staring at her for a <i>while</i>. \"Oh, uhh, sorry,\" he stuttered, glancing away. \"Are you okay?\" she asked him, although she didn't sound genuinely worried. \"Yeah, just hung-over, I guess,\" he replied honestly. Silva looked slightly more annoyed than she was before. \"Well, I have to go to work. You can stay here as long as you don't trash anything,\" she said. \"What, seriously?\" he asked in disbelief. \"Thanks, but I mean, I don't really have anything...\" Silva had already turned to leave. \"I know you don't.

The bulge moved from her throat down her body, and joined the rest of the Mightyena in her distended stomach. \"You have some <i>serious</i> explaining to do,\" he said, slowly calming down after what he had just witnessed. \"Okay,\" she said, lugging her huge belly over to the bed he had slept in last night. She sat down heavily, then let out a loud belch. Immediately, she covered her mouth and blushed, although Vole also thought he heard her giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright,\" she started, \"I don't really work at a bar.\" Vole sat and waited for her to continue. \"Well, I do, but I work as a prostitute.\" Vole couldn't hide the surprise on his face. He guessed it made sense, but... she just seemed so <i>innocent</i>. \"People have paid me to do some... pretty weird shit,\" she continued. \"Wait, you don't mean...\" Vole started. \"Yeah,\" Silva replied. \"People get off on this.\" After thinking about it for a second, Vole realized he found it arousing too... how the dog was still struggling inside her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Anyway,\" Silva continued, \"I can't show up at work like this. I'm just gonna sleep this guy off... You can do whatever.\" He could hear the drowsiness in her voice. With that, she lay down, her stomach gurgling as it began to break down her meal. Vole got up and walked into the room where he had seen Silva for the first time. He sat against a wall, realizing the room was her bedroom. He didn't want to upset her, <i>especially after what she just did to that guy</i>, so he stayed out of her bed, lying on the floor instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole still hadn't decided whether he approved of Silva's method of disposing of the Mightyena. She <i>ate</i> him... She was going to kill him by <i>digesting</i> him, slowly and painfully... It seemed so wrong, but at the same time, it probably was the best option. Before he could put any more thought into it, he drifted off to sleep again, still tired from his ordeal last night...</span></div></div>",

He got up and stretched, feeling infinitely better than earlier. Walking into the main room of the house, he noticed Silva wasn't there anymore. \"Silva?\" he called, slightly worried. \"Sil-\" Just then, the front door opened and the Absol he was looking for walked in, her belly much flatter, although there was a layer of fat where she was perfectly thin before. It was probably his imagination, but Vole also thought her breasts looked a little bigger. \"What were you doing?\" he questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What do you think? I had to let that jerk back out eventually,\" she said plainly. \"Oh,\" Vole replied awkwardly. \"He... digested pretty fast...\" Silva walked past him into her room, seeming focused on something else. \"Fast as they usually do,\" she responded, reappearing with a backpack on. \"Is something happening?\" Vole asked. \"Yeah,\" she said, \"Get ready, we're leaving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What? Why?\" Vole asked, not wanting to leave the comfort of Silva's house. \"Because I can't keep you safe here anymore,\" she replied. That statement made Vole realize just how much he depended on her right now. For food, safety, shelter... he felt like a terrible leech. \"Why... Why are you helping me?\" At that, Silva stopped what she was doing and looked him right in the eyes. \"Honestly.. I don't know. You're a weak, filthy bum. But I just feel like...\" She looked away. \"I don't know. Just follow me, we're going to the city hall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her words had hurt Vole at first, but he began to realize that she had to feel <i>something</i> for him, which made him feel much better. He finally had a friend in the world. As the two left Silva's house for the center of town, she began to explain the situation to him. \"That Mightyena wasn't alone. There have been many attacks throughout the city, savage Pokemon with no conscience and purple eyes.\" \"Why? What do they hope to accomplish?\" Vole wondered. \"Their only motives seem to be food and pleasure,\" Silva replied. \"Food?\" Vole asked, worried. \"You don't mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, they're eating people,\" Silva confirmed. The thought of it made Vole shiver, mostly with fear but partly with dark excitement. \"We need to get to the center of town because that's where everyone else is going for shelter,\" she continued. \"It's our best chance to get through this mess, and to find a solution.\" As she finished that sentence, the two heard a cry for help coming from somewhere to their right. Vole looked at Silva for a course of action, adrenaline beginning to pump through his veins.</span></div></div>",

That got his attention. Vole followed her as she broke into a jog. Silva tried to keep a slow pace, but Vole still found himself panting quickly. He tried to push himself- he had realized that the situation was serious- but his body wouldn't listen to him anymore. At what felt like about the halfway point, Silva slowed to a stop. \"You can rest for a couple minutes,\" she said, \"But we need to get out of here fast.\" Vole leaned against a nearby house, grateful for the break but unable to thank Silva due to his shortness of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two hadn't rested for longer than a minute when they heard a scuffling from above them.

The Absol recovered quickly, however, pushing the fox off of her and springing to her feet, ready for a fight. Vole roused himself, too, getting into his best guess at a good battle stance. Silva turned to him in a momentary opening as the Ninetales picked herself up. \"Vole!\" she yelled, pointing in the direction of their destination. \"Go!

The Sawsbuck grabbed the Luxray's feet and pulled him back, inserting the cat's paws into the tip of his length. Realizing what was happening, the still-panting Luxray tried to clutch at the ground to pull himself out, but he only ended up ripping up grass as the Sawsbuck's cock pulled him in up to his knees. The Sawsbuck moaned in pleasure as Vole struggled weakly to escape. He shoved the cat's tail into his dick before contracting his muscles again, fully enveloping his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole felt too weak to fight back at all now, giving in as he felt the Sawsbuck play with his ass a bit before pulling it in. He could feel his feet inside the deer's balls, soaked in cum. What kind of twisted disease made Pokemon do something so wrong for pleasure? The Sawsbuck pinned Vole's arms to his side as his cock slowly crept up his chest, forcing more of him into his sack. \"Nuh... No...\" the Luxray panted as the Sawsbuck's cock reached his neck. He had abandoned Silva, his savior and guardian, and for what? Now he was just going to be turned into deer cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Sawsbuck let out a drawn-out growl as his length pulled in the last of his prey. The buck stood up and felt the lump travel down his cock, depositing in his now-bulging ballsack. He began to stroke himself as the Luxray's final struggles ceased and the cat began to dissolve into cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Silva fell to the ground, beaten and panting. The Ninetales had bested her fairly, and now stood in front of her triumphantly. With an evil sneer spread across her face, the fox knelt down and spread her legs, showing Silva her damp pussy. She grabbed the exhausted Absol's head and lifted it right in front of her nethers. Realizing what the Ninetales was planning, Silva tried to escape from her grip. \"Gah... N-\" She was cut off when the fox shoved her face into her pussy, letting out a loud grunt. Silva grabbed the Ninetales's legs, trying to pull herself out, but the fox's muscles still pulled her deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Slowly, more of the Absol disappeared within her predator while the lustful fox groaned in pleasure. Her shoulders were sucked in, then her breasts were compressed as the Ninetales worked in her chest. Silva thrashed her body and kicked her legs, refusing to give up to this... this sick bitch. Her efforts were in vain, however, as the Ninetales simply continued to let her pussy devour the Absol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Silva felt her ass pulled into the warm wetness of her predator's sex tunnels, she gave up struggling, instead wondering what happened to her friend. <i>You'd better be okay, Vole...</i> she thought, fearing the worst. <i>I don't want to die for nothing.</i> The last of Silva left outside were her lower legs and clawed paws, which twitched in discomfort as her upper body entered the womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Ninetales let out a loud bark of ecstasy as her pussy closed around the feet of hear meal. She rubbed her distended midsection, feeling the Absol curl up in her womb. She waited for her prey's struggles to cease before standing, fingering her dripping nethers as she began to walk in a random direction. Silva's body began to break down within the fox, reducing to sex juices, as the Ninetales wandered off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before long, the Ninetales noticed another Pokemon standing ahead of her. As she approached, she realized it was a Sawsbuck who had obviously just fed someone to his cock, judging by his gigantic sack. She approached him from behind as he fapped vigorously, unaware of his watcher...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----------</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Sawsbuck turned in surprise when he heard an enticing growl from behind him, followed by an embrace. His eyes met those of the Ninetales, and he knew what she wanted. Her abdomen still had a medium-sized lump from a recent unbirth victim, and her pussy was literally dripping cum. Excited to have a partner, the Sawsbuck lay on the ground with her and wasted no time in inserting his throbbing dick. Both of the ferals roared in intense pleasure as they fucked ferociously, the last of their respective victims dissolving into sex juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It wasn't long before the Sawsbuck stopped thrusting, holding the Ninetales tight as his cock began to pump the remains of the Luxray into her, gallon after gallon. With this, the Ninetales cam too, releasing her Absol juices onto the deer's dick and the ground. The two predators' orgasm lasted for nearly a minute; the Ninetales's womb overflowing with deer cum. Eventually, the two separated and stood up. Vole and Silva were reunited... as cum dripping out of a fox's pussy. The Ninetales rested against a wall, enjoying the feeling of a full womb, while the Sawsbuck left to find another victim.</span></div></div>",

Looking back at the fight scene, he saw the Ninetales deliver a powerful kick into Silva's abdomen, stunning the Absol and sending her reeling backwards. The Luxray focused his mind and extended his arms toward his target, bracing himself... He hadn't done this in years, but if there was ever a time to try, it was now. Vole watched as blue lightning arced from the tips of his claws into the Ninetales, shocking her for the few seconds that he channeled. After he stopped, the fox's body stiffened and she fell to the ground. Vole looked at his hands with an excited grin on his face. He hadn't been able to control electricity in years, and it didn't even tire him out. In fact, he felt more energized than before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Remembering the current situation, Vole approached the prone Ninetales. Silva was resting against a building, recovering from being winded. \"The shock must have paralyzed her muscles,\" the Absol said weakly. Sure enough, the Ninetales seemed only to be able to glare and growl at her opponent, the majority of her body not responding to her commands. \"We have to get rid of her,\" Silva said, recovering her breath. Vole knew exactly what she meant, and he didn't even feel that reluctant. This bitch had attacked his only friend, and now she was going to get what was coming to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Luxray leaned down and awkwardly opened his mouth around the Ninetales's face, licking the fur on her muzzle a bit to get a feel for her taste. It surprised him how pleasant the flavor was, and that only made him want her more. The fox's growls increased in intensity, but she was unable to do anything else as Vole took her entire head inside his mouth, slathering her fur in saliva. The Luxray took his first swallow, muffling the Ninetales in his throat. He found himself becoming aroused as he pulled the fox's neck into his mouth- what he was doing felt wrong, but it was just so <i>sexy</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Vole reached the Ninetales's ample breasts, he stopped to explore them with his tongue. He knew Silva was watching, but he didn't care. He sucked all the flavor he could out of those tits before pulling them into his throat, creating an attractive-looking bulge. Vole stood up as he gulped in the Ninetales's belly, leaving her rear end hanging out of his mouth. He could feel her nose forcing open the entrance to his stomach as her ass arrived in his mouth. He was pleasantly surprised when he felt her pussy leaking juices into his mouth, which he eagerly lapped up. The Luxray couldn't help playing with his dick a bit as he worked in the fox's legs and fluffy tails, which had begun to move weakly. Apparently the paralysis was wearing off, not that it mattered at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole put his hands on his expanding belly, feeling the Ninetales curl up as he swallowed her feet and tail tips down his throat, the bulge slowly moving down into his belly. It was the best feeling he could remember, even better than sex. The Luxray let out a triumphant belch as he felt his stomach begin to fill with acid, starting to digest the weakly struggling fox anthro. \"Not bad for your first time,\" he heard Silva say from behind him as she suddenly slapped him on the back. \"Come on, let's get out of here,\" she said as she passed him, walking at a leisurely pace now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With luck, the two Pokemon managed to avoid any more encounters before they reached a makeshift fence with two guards stationed at the entrance. \"Let me do the talking,\" Silva said, walking ahead. \"We're clean!\" she yelled as the guards eyed Vole's bulging stomach suspiciously. \"Just had to deal with a feral on the way here!\" The Pokemon at the gate seemed to accept her explanation, as they opened the gate for the two to walk through. \"You should go see the Chief for your bunk assignments,\" one said. \"He's in the barracks, over there,\" he continued, pointing to a large building. \"Thanks,\" Silva said as she passed by. Vole continued to receive awkward stares from the guards and from citizens inside the compound as the two headed for the Barracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You wait out here,\" Silva said, noticing his discomfort as they reached the entrance. \"I'll find a room for both of us.\" Vole happily backed into the shadows of a nearby alley, sitting down to enjoy the gurgles of his stomach. The Ninetales had stopped struggling a while ago, but the bulge was hardly any smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A good half hour later, Vole saw Silva re-emerge from the building. He went to meet her in the open, and noticed she held a slip of paper. \"We got #359,\" she said, leading him in the direction of the house. \"Who was the chief?\" Vole asked, curious. Silva grunted disinterestedly before responding. \"He's a Samurott with a pole up his ass,\" she said as she changed direction towards a row of houses. \"Come on, it's this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When the two entered their assigned home, they realized it was a simple one-room building with a pile of dried grass on either side, and a pantry in the back. Vole sat down heavily on one of the grass-beds, beginning to feel tired despite it only being the afternoon. \"Had a hard day, huh?\" he heard Silva say from the pantry area. \"Yeah,\" he sighed, lying down on the bed. \"Think I deserve a reward.\" Silva turned toward him and giggled cutely, realizing what he was implying. \"Lose some weight first, sweetie,\" he heard her say before he nodded off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole woke up slowly, stretching his arms and back before opening his eyes. He felt that his stomach had fully digested his earlier meal, and he felt full of energy, although now he had to relieve himself badly. Looking around the room, he noticed...</span></div></div>",

Deciding it would be impossible to get up without waking her, he began to whisper her name. \"Silva...\" She didn't respond, so he tried a little louder. \"Silva?\" This time the Absol's eyes fluttered open. The distant, sleepy look in her eyes quickly faded- now she looked as surprised as Vole was. Silva broke the embrace and practically sprang to her feet, her mind rapidly searching for an explanation. \"Uhh...\" was all she could come up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole moved to a sitting position, shifting around the remains of the Ninetales in his bowels. \"Did we...?\" He asked hesitantly, letting Silva infer the rest of the question. \"...No!\" she asserted, \"I, uhh, was cold, that's all.\" As if it wasn't obvious already, the blush appearing on her face betrayed her true feelings. As Vole stood up, he felt a renewed pressure in his rear. \"I gotta go take care of this,\" he told Silva, gesturing toward the lump in his midsection. \"Do it outside the gates,\" she replied as he opened the door. \"We can't leave a skeleton in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>I guess bones don't digest</i>, Vole thought as he nearly sprinted toward the nearest gate. It made sense, he just hadn't thought about it before. The running Luxray got a few weird looks, but not nearly as many as he did yesterday, and he managed to sneak out of the gates by tagging along with a food-gathering party. A few houses down, Vole split off from the group and ran to the end of an alley between two buildings. Besides turning and squatting, he didn't have to work at all to get the first of the crap to come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole let out a sigh of relief as the remains of the Ninetales flowed freely from his system, collecting in a large pile under him. He had to work his muscles to push a few of the larger bones out, but for the most part he just relaxed. <i>That must have been the skull</i>, he thought after a particularly large lump. Eventually Vole let the last of yesterday's meal drop from his ass, wiping himself off with some leaves as he admired his work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What was once an attractive fox anthro was now a foot-high mound of reeking cat crap, with some bones visible. Vole could see the skull protruding from the pile, and the eye-holes seemed to look pained. The Luxray felt proud, in a kind of sick and disgusting way. <i>I ate that bitch</i>, he thought, looking down at his belly. Sure enough, the Ninetales had left him a layer of fat where he was disconcertingly thin before. Thinking through the entire process turned him on, occupying his thoughts as he turned to leave the alley...</span></div></div>",

He felt legitimately content for the first time in a long time. Despite the enormous threat on his life as well as the city as a whole, he had met someone who cared for him. Today was the first day when the symptoms of his withdrawal weren't as severe as the day before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          Vole put on a lame short-of-breath act for the guard of the gates, claiming he had gotten tired and come back without the food-gathering group he was supposed to be with. The guard was obviously suspicious, but he let the Luxray in regardless. Once he was back inside the walls, Vole immediately went to seek out Silva. He had resolved himself to tell her how he felt about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          He found her looking through the pantry in the shack that was their temporary home. She must have heard him open the door, because she greeted him with a friendly joke. \"How did it go?\" Vole responded by walking up and hugging her from behind. She was obviously surprised, but she didn't try to pull away. Vole put his head on her shoulder and started to talk into her ear. \"I love you, Silva. You saved my life and took care of me for no good reason, and I haven't even thanked you until now. You're the best thing that's ever happened to me.\" Vole could feel the blushing Absol start to move in his embrace.</span></div></div>",

The Luxray was caught off guard, but soon he was returning the kiss. The perfect moment seemed to last forever until it was interrupted by Vole's arousal poking up from his crotch. Silva smiled, then reached down with one hand and gripped it tight, causing the Luxray to grunt loudly as she pulled him over to her hay pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Absol practically threw him down on the dry grass before climbing on top of him. \"Sorry, was that too hard?\" Vole couldn't tell if she was being sarcastic or not. It didn't matter, his response was the same. \"Never.\" With that, she started lowering her pussy down onto his fully erect cock. The two moaned together as she slowly went farther, wiggling around a bit to add to their stimulation. When her waist reached his, she leaned down and took the Luxray into another kiss. He wrapped his arms around her back, pressing her body against his own as they slowly began to hump in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The newfound lovers fucked each other vigorously, panting and groaning loud enough to be heard outside. They kept their lips locked together, blending their saliva with their tongues, taking breaks only to catch their breath. Vole started driving in deeper, bouncing Silva into the air with each pump. He felt her body tense, then shiver as she released a flood of femcum onto his cock. The feeling of her juices spilling over his length sent the Luxray over the top. He pulled her close, then let loose a torrent of cum into her pussy, listening to her moans of ecstasy with each jet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The lovers rolled onto their sides as their orgasms died down, remaining linked together, panting in afterglow. Vole gave his partner a lick on the forehead, then the two rolled apart, staring up at the wooden ceiling. They lay there, cuddled together for a while, remaining silent. They probably would have fallen asleep if it hadn't been so early in the day. Eventually, Vole rose to his feet, feeling Silva grasp teasingly at his tail to try to pull him back down. He looked through the pantry, pretty much the only furnishing it the house, finding only a few berries. Silva approached and leaned on him from the side, following his gaze to the scarce food. \"We need to get some food,\" she said hazily.</span></div></div>",

They looked like they hadn't bathed in weeks, their hair ruffled and their crotch fur still matted down with sex juices, but they didn't care. The lady at the counter of the food bank greeted them with a worried expression. \"I can't give out any more food right now,\" she said. \"We're dangerously low and none of the gathering parties have returned.\" Vole and Silva exchanged a hesitant look, then thanked the clerk and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wanna go do some gathering?\" Silva asked as soon as they were outside. \"Should we tell someone?\" Vole wondered. \"Nah, they'd probably stick us with a group.\" Vole was anxious about going outside the gates of the town, but Silva was obviously restless and there wasn't really anything else to do. After borrowing some bags to carry the berries, the two decided to jump the fence from a corner of the town to avoid provoking the guards any more than they already had. Vole watched Silva leap gracefully from the roof they were on, clearing the wooden barricade easily and landing with a roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole looked hesitantly at the ground. It was a big leap and a long fall. This would have been nothing for him in his prime, but now he wasn't so sure of himself. Silva was looking up at him with a combination of impatience and concern. Gathering his nerves, Vole took a deep breath and leapt forward. He felt one of his feet scrape against the wood, but he managed to keep his balance, landing heavily on all fours beside Silva. She watched as he dusted himself off, then she pointed down a long road. \"We should go straight so we know how to get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Silva led the way past the eerily quiet rows of houses. The abandoned part of the town looked almost the same as the walled-in section, the only major difference being residents. The space between the houses slowly increased until eventually the city ended, and a sparse forest began. \"This is a great place to find berries,\" Silva commented. \"Let's split up, but not lose sight of each other, okay?\" Vole nodded and Silva trotted off to search for food. The Luxray was already uneasy about being this far from town, so he took Silva's advice literally. He moved cautiously from bush to bush, never looking away from Silva for more than a couple seconds.</span></div></div>",

He noticed as he approached her that she was kneeling at the edge of a small lake. The water was still and unnaturally clear. \"Isn't this awesome?\" the Absol asked. \"We should clean ourselves off before we go,\" she said, setting her bag on the ground next to her.

He watched Silva dive underwater, then emerge near the center of the lake. She was playfully splashing water in his direction. He submerged himself, then surfaced right next to her.

He could see disappointment in her eyes, but he could also tell she knew he was right. \"We can do this somewhere we won't get eaten by animals.\" That made her giggle a bit, and she allowed him to lead her back to the shore. They picked up their berry-filled bags and started walking back towards Haven, letting their fur air-dry in the midday sun. They made it back to the inner city without a problem, but upon realizing that the wooden barrier was distanced from all the houses outside, they decided it would be impossible to sneak in like they got out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Reluctantly, Vole and Silva approached a guarded set of gates once again, still damp from their brief swim. This time, the two on-duty guards ran out to meet them, seeming hostile. \"You two are being taken into custody,\" one said as he stopped in front of them. \"What?\" Vole asked, dismayed. \"Why? What did we do?\" The other guard stepped forward and began to speak. \"We've been keeping an eye on you, sneaking in and out of the gates. If you come willingly, your punishment will be less severe.\" Vole and Silva exchanged worried glances, then followed the guards into the barracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Awaiting them with his hands clasped behind his back was a straight-faced Samurott, a blue-skinned otter Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon with shell-like armor. Vole guessed that he was the chief that Silva had complained about before. He began to speak in a serious tone as the gate guards retreated back to their posts. \"I've been keeping track of you two since you made your entrance with a feral in your stomach,\" he said, gesturing to Vole. \"You've been running in and out of the city without permission, doing who-knows-what out in the woods.\" Silva spoke up and interrupted him. \"We were gathering food! We have it right here!\" she said, pulling a berry out of her bag. \"And I bet you were going to keep it all to yourself,\" he said, waving the guards in the building over. They confiscated Vole and Silva's bags, then walked off into a different room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Those berries will feed my troops quite well,\" the chief commented smugly. Silva crossed her arms, clearly pissed off, but holding her tongue. \"You two think you're above the law, and that won't go unpunished in my city. You will not be allowed outside the city gates again until you prove your allegiance. If you sneak out, you will not be allowed back inside. Is that clear?\" They nodded her heads, Silva barely containing her anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When they returned to their house, Silva let out an annoyed sigh. \"I can't believe that asshole!\" she said, starting to pace across the floor. \"What do we do now?\" Vole asked her cautiously. \"We don't go outside, I guess,\" she replied. The two spent the rest of the day lazing around the house. Vole asked Silva if she wanted to continue what she started earlier, but she said that the chief had ruined her mood. She eventually fell asleep on her grass bed, and Vole did the same, dozing off even before the sun set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole awoke slowly, then recoiled in shock as he realized a stranger was leaning over him.

Vole slowly regained his composure, realizing that if this trespasser wanted to hurt him, he or she would have done it already. The Liepard gave him a questioning glance, then Vole nodded, and the intruder allowed him to speak. \"Who are you?\" he whispered. \"Saving your asses,\" the Liepard replied sarcastically, and rose to his feet before offering Vole a hand to help him up. The Liepard's voice was clearly male, despite his body appearing incredibly feminine. He helped the Luxray to his feet, then resumed speaking in a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You two will be in danger if you stay here any longer. We need to leave before the chief has you killed.\" Vole started to ask a question, but the Liepard silenced him again. \"I'll explain later. For now, we need to get the hell out of here.\" The two turned to face Silva as she rolled over in her sleep. \"I'm guessing she won't be as calm as you if I wake her up,\" the Liepard said. \"Probably not,\" Vole replied. \"Alright, you do it,\" the intruder said, turning to walk towards the door. \"I'll be outside.

He gently shook her from her shoulders, calling her name as she slowly opened her eyes. \"Vole? What's going on?\" she asked drowsily. \"A stranger woke me up, he says we're in danger.\" Silva sat up and turned toward him. \"Does he seem trustworthy?\" she asked apprehensively. Vole thought a bit before responding. \"No, but he seems serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Vole and Silva emerged from their house, the Liepard was nowhere to be seen. \"Where is he?\" Silva asked quietly. \"Up here,\" came the whispered response.

He pulled himself towards the edge, tumbling forward as he slipped off and landing on his feet without a sound. \"Follow me, we're leaving.\" Silva stopped him before he could move. \"Why should we trust you?\" she asked skeptically. \"Honestly, I don't have a good reason,\" he replied. \"But I'm not trying to force you or anything. You guys can stay here and get killed if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With that, the Liepard started running towards the east gate of the town.

A few times, Vole almost lost track of the Liepard's dark-colored body in the shadows between houses. The skinny feline suddenly slowed to a stop, peering around a corner of a building. \"The gate's right there,\" he said, turning back to Vole and Silva. \"But there are at least four guards.\" \"That's more than usual,\" Silva observed. \"It's no coincidence,\" the Liepard responded. \"They're trying to keep people in.\" Silva looked like she was about to ask something, but the Liepard motioned for silence, as seemed to be his response for all questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Stay here,\" the Liepard said briskly, then began to climb the wall of the house they were hiding behind. He scaled the two-story vertical surface swiftly and elegantly using cracks between the boards. He quickly reached the edge of the roof, which overhung the wall by about two feet. He reached and grabbed it with one hand, then the other, then he walked his feet up the wall and pulled the rest of his body onto the roof. And just like everything else he did, he did it completely silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Damn,\" Silva commented under her breath. \"Even I can't do that.\" Vole looked around for a roof that they might be able to use to jump the fence, but he couldn't see any nearby. His attention was drawn back to the gate when one of the guards suddenly collapsed. Before the guard's partner could even kneel down to examine him, he was on the ground too. The guardsmen on the other side of the gate had taken notice and began to look around nervously. One of them seemed to reach toward his neck before collapsing, and the last guard barely managed to begin a shout before he joined his colleagues in the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Liepard landed in front of Vole and Silva holding a slim metal tube. \"What did you do?\" Silva asked, astonished. \"Darts,\" he said, stowing the tube in his small backpack. \"Come on, they won't be out for long.\" The three escapees rushed over to the gate, closing it behind them as they dashed away from the walled-in city. All of this running was wearing Vole out, but he managed to keep up with the others. A few days ago, he wouldn't have been able to run even a few blocks. \"There are going to be a lot of ferals around,\" the Liepard spoke up, \"Especially when we get to the forest. Stay alert and don't slow down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Indeed, after the trio passed the treeline, Vole could hear leaves rustling and low vocal noises emanating from the murky shadows. \"How much farther is it?\" Silva asked, ignoring subtlety because the group had obviously been noticed. \"Not far,\" replied the Liepard replied, fear audible in his voice for the first time.</span></div></div>",

Vole and Silva looked at each other anxiously, hearing the sounds of approaching ferals getting louder. Then, a faint voice originated from the other side of the wall. \"Us?\" The Liepard let out an exasperated sigh. \"If you don't let us in <i>right</i> now, I'm gonna die, and then who's gonna bring you food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Moments later, some noises could be heard from behind the rock, like some sort of mechanism.

Silva and the Liepard were nowhere to be seen, a thought which started to stir up a little worry in the Luxray's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gathering his nerves, Vole approached the door mechanism where they had entered the cave the night before. He had no idea what was on the other side, but he had no other ideas of what to do. He took a few minutes to figure out how the lock worked, then proceeded to slowly open the door. The Luxray scanned the outer cave for danger, then carefully followed the weak light to the exit.</span></div></div>",

As he emerged from the dark tunnel, he realized that it was early in the morning since the sun hadn't risen yet. He soon spotted two familiar figures standing on a nearby hill overlooking Haven. As he approached them, he could hear that they were having a serious conversation, judging by the tone of their voices. Silva was standing with her typical crossed arms, looking pensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Liepard heard Vole before the Luxray was close enough to make out any words. \"About time you woke up,\" the purple cat commented, causing Silva to notice him as well. \"I tried to pull you out of bed,\" she said, a small grin slipping into her expression. \"But you were in some sort of coma. I would have thought you were dead if you weren't snoring so loudly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Uh, sorry,\" the Luxray said absentmindedly. \"What were you guys talking about?\" Silva glanced at the Liepard, who remained silent, before proceeding. \"<i>Kaden</i> here was just telling me about the corruption in Haven's leadership.\" \"It's pretty bad,\" the Liepard spoke up. \"The Chief basically runs everything. He has guards everywhere making sure nobody leaves, and anyone who argues with him goes missing.\" Kaden paused for a moment to look between the expressions of the two lovers. \"You two are on his hit list. I took you out of the city before he got rid of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Got rid of us?\" Vole questioned. \"Does he really just kill people?\" Kaden seemed to hesitate a moment. \"I don't know,\" he replied, \"But he does something. And they disappear.\" There was a brief silence between the three. \"I want to stop him,\" Kaden said. \"I want Haven to stay a haven. If we can keep the city healthy and strong, we can survive against the ferals.\" He locked eyes with each of the two in turn. \"I want you two to help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole and Silva glanced at each other. \"I guess we're already involved in this now,\" the Luxray said plainly. Silva gave a slight nod. \"Alright then,\" Kaden declared. \"Today we need to restock our food supplies. There's a thicket nearby where many berries grow. Follow me.\" And with that, he turned around and jogged into the woods. \"He's certainly a character,\" Vole said as Silva turned to follow the cryptic Liepard. \"Come on, I'm hungry,\" she said.</span></div></div>",

On the way, he described the berries that the group needed to bring back. The foliage grew thicker around the trio until Kaden suddenly stopped in his tracks, almost causing Silva to bump into him from behind. \"We're here,\" he declared, although there appeared to be nothing that would differentiate this spot from any other place in the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You two head in that direction,\" the Liepard said, pointing off into the trees. \"Pick all the berries you see that match my description. I'll be searching on my own to find a few of the more rare types.\" Silva's expression shifted, obviously uncomfortable. \"Are you sure it's a good idea to split up in a place like this?\" she asked. Kaden, who had already started to walk away, looked back over his shoulder and said, \"I know this place very well. If you need anything, you can call me and I'll be able to find you.\" With that, he continued into the dense foliage, quickly disappearing behind a screen of leaves and vines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole and Silva were left alone in a small clearing with nothing but the bag that the Liepard had given them earlier. \"I don't like this one bit,\" Silva said, and Vole grunted in reply. \"The faster we do this, the faster he takes us out of here,\" the Luxray commented. Silva sighed and reluctantly started walking in the direction Kaden had assigned them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before long, the two started to come across numerous berries, more than either of them had seen before in one place. The plentiful harvest helped to relieve their worry, and the space in the bag quickly began to fill up. \"I guess that guy does know what he's talking ab-\" Vole started to say, stopping suddenly before he finished his sentence. Silva turned around to see him standing very still, apparently frightened. \"What is it?\" she asked. \"I thought I heard something,\" the Luxray replied in a hushed tone. The two stood silently for a moment before a flash of orange fur erupted from the leaves, crashing into Vole and carrying him out of Silva's vision. \"Vole!\" she cried, dropping the bag to follow him into the thick foliage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Vole, where are you?!\" Silva called, having easily lost her sense of direction. Standing quietly, she could barely make out some muffled cries originating from a few yards away. The Absol dashed towards the source of the noise, coming to a sudden stop as she stumbled across the Luxray and his assailant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole was prone on the ground, pinned beneath a chubby Flareon, who was happily grinding her ass against his face. The feral noticed Silva's presence, but apparently didn't feel threatened enough to leave her new toy. The Absol charged toward the unperturbed fire-type, aiming to knock her from her perch. To Silva's surprise, her tackle didn't seem to move the Flareon at all, the force apparently absorbed by the feral's weighty physique. Silva realized her mistake too late, as the Flareon's arms wrapped around her in a tight bear hug, squeezing her against the fire-type's cushy breasts and belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Silva tried to struggle free, but the Flareon's grip was surprisingly strong, keeping her held tight as Vole continued to struggle under the feral's weight. \"KADEN!!\" Silva shouted with all her might, starting to panic due to the dangerous situation. \"Help!\" The Absol's yells quieted down quickly as the Flareon's firm embrace crushed the air out of her lungs. The feral began licking around Silva's face, delighting in her double catch.</span></div></div>",

As she turned her head, the Liepard loosed a sharp kick which connected with her muzzle, sending her sprawling onto the grassy forest floor. The Flareon kept her grip on Silva as she fell, bringing the Absol down with her as she tumbled onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole, now free from the Flareon's vile domination, rolled onto his side and coughed a few times. \"Fuck, this is gross!\" he managed to wheeze out, the overpowering scent of the Flareon's tailhole still clinging to his fur. Kaden stood and watched as Silva squirmed out of the dazed fire-type's grasp, then climbed on top of her to keep her pinned down. The Flareon lay prone on her back, with Silva straddling over her midsection. \"This is what you get, bitch,\" the Absol taunted as she leaned closer to the Flareon's face. \"Wait,\" Kaden started to say, but he was interrupted when the Flareon opened her mouth to release a stream of fire right at Silva's face. The Absol managed to push the Flareon's head aside just in time, causing the flamethrower to shoot harmlessly off to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You sure you want to eat that, Silva?\" Vole asked teasingly as his breathing returned to normal. The Absol briefly considered the risk involved in devouring a fire type. \"Fuck it, I'm hungry,\" she replied, then quickly opened her mouth and stuffed the Flareon's muzzle inside. \"Ugh,\" Kaden grunted and turned away from the two females. \"Do you have to do that?\" he asked distastefully as Silva forced the Flareon's head into her mouth. Silva, unable to respond, simply glanced at him before continuing to gulp down her prey. Vole turned to the perturbed Liepard and said, \"What do you have against it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Without turning around, Kaden replied, \"It's perverted and disgusting.\" Silva pulled the Flareon's head into her throat as the Liepard continued his explanation. \"It's never right to eat someone alive, even if they're feral.\" Vole thought for a moment, then retorted, \"You obviously haven't tried it.\" Kaden shivered visibly. \"No, and I never will.\" He looked back at Silva, then quickly turned around and started walking into the woods. \"I'm going to find more berries. Call for me when you're\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 <i>done.</i>\" The Liepard made no effort to hide the disgust in his voice. As he disappeared into the trees, Vole and Silva shared a hesitant glance. Vole shrugged, and after a moment Silva continued with her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Absol had reached the fire-type's juicy breasts, and the Flareon's head was bulging her neck nicely. The powerful constriction prevented the Flareon from opening her mouth to release another fire attack. After few more swallows the Flareon's head bulge sank into Silva's chest, and the fire-type's generous bust landed in her mouth. The Absol started licking vigorously across the Flareon's tits, delighting in the cushy texture. She took a while to savor the feeling of the fire-type's body heat warming her from the inside before engulfing the Flareon's upper body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole raised an eyebrow as he noticed one of Silva's hands sliding between her legs to play with herself. The last time he had seen her do this, she was obviously uncomfortable, but now she was totally letting loose. The Luxray couldn't help but stroke himself slowly as he became aroused from the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Silva lifted her meal off of the ground as she gradually worked in the Flareon's pudgy belly. She moaned at the feeling of the fat squishing against the inside of her mouth. As she reached the Flareon's padded hips, the fire-type's head was forced into her eager stomach. The feral tried to conjure up another fireball, but the lack of oxygen and the tight compression on her body had drained too much of her energy. Her face was forced into a shallow pool of Silva's acids as the Absol pulled in her plump ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Vole watched Silva on all fours lapping up the fluids leaking from the Flareon's pussy, he realized that he couldn't help himself anymore. He crawled up behind her and leaned over her body, poking his stiff cock in between her legs. Silva felt it with the hand she was using to finger herself, and gladly stroked it a few times before pushing the tip against her dripping snatch. She gulped the Flareon's thick rear into her throat as Vole moaned in pleasure behind her. The Luxray slowly pushed his cock into Silva's folds, nearly overwhelmed by the slick flesh clenching around his shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Silva swallowed the legs of the doomed Flareon bit by bit as Vole gently pumped in and out of her. She laid a hand on her now-expanding belly as more of her meal curled up inside. Vole reached around and placed his hand next to hers, gaining some speed as he felt the Flareon struggle from within. Silva slowly engulfed the last of her prey, licking the Flareon's footpads as they entered her mouth. She finally sent them down her throat, sealing the feral's fate, and then started to move back and forth in time with Vole's thrusting. As the last of the Flareon was crammed into her stomach, she let out a cry of ecstasy, and fluids started flooding from her snatch. At the same time, Vole's cock stiffened and began shooting thick, creamy loads into her pussy. The two clung to each other, moaning in unison as their orgasms ran their course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole and Silva fell onto their sides unceremoniously as their orgasms slowly passed. Silva rubbed her gurgling stomach as Vole slowly pulled out of her. The two lay there panting for a few minutes before Vole staggered to his feet. \"We probably shouldn't keep Kaden waiting,\" he said, and Silva grumbled in response. He helped her to her feet, and she let out a long \"Mmmmmph\" as the mass in her overstuffed belly shifted around. The Flareon was unconscious now, her weighty body soon to be melted down by Silva's acids into nutrients and waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The two met up with Kaden, who had nothing to say to them as they walked back toward the cave. He kept his gaze fixed on the path ahead, doing his best not to look at Silva and her massively distended stomach. Eventually, the group made it back the hidden base in the cave. Syrus opened the door for them, more promptly this time, and the three silently shuffled inside. It was still the middle of the day outside, although the inside of the cavern remained as dim as it was before.</span></div></div>",

Kaden, without saying a word, took the bag and walked out of the room, with Syrus close behind him. The Flygon glanced back at Vole apprehensively before following Kaden out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Luxray leaned against a wall and considered his options. As much as he would enjoy lying next to Silva and listening to her stomach digest, he also really wanted to question the two cave-dwellers about their mysterious behavior. Careful to stay quiet, he slowly crept towards where Kaden and Syrus had disappeared, noticing as he passed Silva that she was already asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Glancing around a corner, Vole could see Syrus leaning over a table with various vials and glasses, which contained various brightly-colored fluids. Kaden was standing in the corner of the room with his arms crossed. He looked up to see Vole watching them, but remained silent. After a moment, he gestured for Vole to come in. The Luxray cautiously stepped around the corner and entered the room. There were shelves along the walls with more vibrant liquids, and a cabinet in the back with the berries the group had collected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I was wondering when one of you was going to come back here,\" Kaden said as Vole looked around. Syrus glanced at the Luxray briefly, then returned to his work. \"Syrus here is an accomplished alchemist. This is where he does his experiments.\" Syrus stood up and backed away from the table a bit. \"You're overstating my competence,\" he interjected. \"I have very little to show for all the time I spend back here.\" Vole turned to the Flygon, confused. \"Alchemist? I'm sorry, what is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Syrus met gazes with the Luxray. \"The flora of this world have various curative and therapeutic properties. By distilling and combining them, I aim to create useful remedial substances.\" Vole continued staring at the Flygon blankly. \"He makes berries into medicine,\" Kaden explained with an amused smile. \"Mainly to find a cure for ferality.\" Syrus nodded in agreement, then returned to glaring at the fluids in the glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"...Oh,\" Vole said, finally understanding. \"So the berries we gathered weren't for food?\" Kaden nodded. \"Most of them, anyways. Some will also be set aside for us to eat.\" He started walking towards the exit of the room. \"The supply we have now will sustain us for a while. In a few days, we will make our move on Haven. I expect you two to be prepared by then.\" With that, he left Vole and Syrus in the alchemy lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Where's he going?\" Vole asked the Flygon, who looked lost in thought. \"Most likely on patrol,\" he responded. \"There isn't much for him to do here, so he often wanders about during the day.\" The Flygon seemed remarkably calm now compared to when Vole had seen him before. \"Is it okay if I stay here and watch?\" he asked hesitantly. \"Oh, certainly,\" Syrus responded to his surprise. \"In fact, perhaps I can explain some things while you're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wow, alright,\" Vole replied. \"I don't mean this in a bad way, but you're much more chill now then you were before.\" Syrus chuckled a bit. \"Yes, alchemy soothes my mind. But ferality, as you may expect, has proven a difficult adversary.\" He glanced between the substances in front of him, looking thoughtful. \"None of the chemicals that typically help with infections have had any effect in our trials. The best result we've had so far was pacifying a feral for a few moments. I might as well have administered a weak sedative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Flygon was silent for a few moments, still studying his concoctions while Vole listened expectantly. \"Given the conclusions from our tests so far, I have begun to think that ferality is not caused by a physical contagion at all, but is instead a state of mind that may be triggered by overindulgence in pleasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole took a minute to process that statement. \"So you're saying that someone could become feral just by indulging in sex?\" Syrus nodded grimly. \"When one's lust overcomes their morality and sensibility, that is when ferality will trigger. At least, that is my current theory.\" There was a long silence between the two. \"That's pretty heavy,\" Vole finally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Indeed,\" the Flygon replied. \"You can be assured that such a condition cannot easily be reversed. However, I believe there is still hope, and I will not stop until every possible cure has been tried.\" Vole looked at Syrus with a newfound respect as the Flygon began to move the vials around, mixing some together, putting others off to the side. There was much more to this guy than he had seen at first.</span></div></div>",

Vole in particular had a hard time keeping up with the exercise, but he kept at it regardless. In his free time, he sat in on Syrus's alchemical experiments. It was interesting to learn how the naturally occurring chemicals could be extracted and used for various purposes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Early in the morning, before the move on Haven, Kaden gathered the crew around a table and went over the plan. \"We will enter by climbing over the outer wall. The whole city will be watching for us, so we need to move quickly and keep a low profile until we reach the barracks,\" he said, leaning over one side of the table. \"Hold on,\" Silva interrupted. \"How the hell are we supposed to take on the entire city watch by ourselves? There have to be at least a hundred guards around the place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kaden nodded in response. \"We won't have to fight all of them. The citizens are unhappy with Samurott's authoritarian government. Even the majority of the city watch would oppose him, if given the chance.\" The Liepard stood up, his voice firm. \"Once we reach the entrance to the barracks, I will make an open challenge to the chief's leadership. Based on what I've seen from my reconnaissance, most of his soldiers will step aside rather than defend him. The only ones we will have to worry about are his three lieutenants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Wait, wait,\" Silva interrupted again. \"You want me and Vole to believe that all of the chief's guards are going to let us walk by? Just because you said so?\" Kaden grunted, acknowledging her concern. \"If this doesn't work, I will be in just as much trouble as you two. After all my waiting and watching, this is the best plan I have come up with to reclaim Haven. And if we do not act, it will remain under the rule of that avaricious bastard.\" The Liepard looked between Vole and Silva in turn. \"I understand if you two feel that this is too dangerous. But, there is no way I can challenge Samurott's lieutenants alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Silva thought for a few moments, then shrugged. \"I guess I need somewhere to live anyways.\" Kaden glanced at Vole, who nodded, then the Liepard bowed his head. \"Thank you both for your help. I will not forget it, nor will the city of Haven.\" He picked up his small backpack, then said \"If you have no other concerns, we will leave shortly.\" Vole and Silva both stood up as Kaden started towards the door to the outside. Vole turned to follow him, but stopped when he heard a voice behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hold on a moment, Vole,\" the voice called. The Luxray turned around to see Syrus, who he realized must have been standing in the corner the entire time. The Flygon handed him a small satchel with a shoulder strap. \"There are various potions and berries in here that may be of aid to you. You should know what all of them do, having watched me working.\" Vole took the bag and nodded. \"Thank you, Syrus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Flygon then turned to Kaden. \"You had better return in one piece,\" he said with concern in his voice. \"You can count on it,\" the Liepard replied. He unlocked the door, pushed it open, and stepped outside. \"Be safe, friends,\" Syrus said as Vole and Silva filed out. Vole gave the Flygon a nod, then shut the door from the outside. Syrus let out a long sigh as he slumped back onto a wall. \"Please, <i>please</i> be safe...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After about an hour of walking and sneaking through the abandoned part of Haven, the party arrived at the great wooden wall that kept the inner city safe. Kaden took a few minutes to search for a good spot, then started climbing. As always, the Liepard moved with speed and grace, swiftly ascending by utilizing the small gaps between logs. Upon reaching the top, he looked around quickly, then threw down a rope which Vole and Silva used to climb up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"There it is,\" Kaden said, pointing towards a large, rectangular building in the center of town. \"We'll stay in between houses up until the plaza, then make a dash for the entrance.\" He glanced at the others to make sure they were ready. \"Alright then, follow me!\" The Liepard slid off the top of the wall, rolling as he landed. Silva followed him, then Vole after her. The Luxray tried to roll the same way Kaden did, but he ended up sliding across the ground on his rear. Luckily, the others were too preoccupied to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After dusting himself off, Vole chased after Kaden and Silva as they dashed through the alleys between residences. Slowly, the spaces grew larger and more populated, until the group broke into an open field with the barracks at the other side. They sprinted at full speed, dodging past the people who were walking about. Vole noticed movement through the open windows of the barracks, then watched as guards started to flow out of the main entrance. Kaden skidded to a halt in front of the growing mob, the others close behind him, and caught his breath. Citizens gasped and mumbled amongst themselves as the guards surrounded the trio, brandishing spears at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"We are here to challenge the leadership to this city!\" Kaden yelled to the crowd. \"The man who claims authority over this community is a greedy and heartless dictator! We would see him removed from power!\" The Liepard turned to the guards, his voice slightly softer. \"All among you who believe that your people deserve better, I ask that you step aside and allow us to confront him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The guards looked around and whispered to each other, but none of them moved to put down their weapons. Vole's mind started racing as a feeling of uneasiness built inside him. He glanced at Silva, who didn't look any better than he did. Suddenly, a voice from the back of the crowd called out. \"He's right!\" the guard exclaimed. He was shortly echoed by a few more on the other side of the circle. Slowly, the guards began to drop their weapons and file into the crowd of civilians. At first there were five or so, then a few more, and then suddenly the entire company was stepping aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What's going on out here?!\" a booming voice called from the entrance to the barracks. It was the chief, his imposing frame nearly too large for the doorway. His hands gripped the swords that hung at his sides, and a look of disdain was written on his face. \"We're here to remove you from office,\" Kaden stated, pointing towards the intimidating Samurott. The chief took a few moments to look around at his guards, then at the three Pokemon standing in the center of the commotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Very well, I see what's happening here,\" the Samurott replied in a deep, guttural voice. \"You three may come inside, so that we can... discuss your demands.\" A disconcerting grin spread across the tyrant's features. Silva gave Kaden a worried look, but the Liepard still seemed confident. \"There is no way to avoid this conflict,\" he explained in a hushed tone. \"He will likely pit us against his three lieutenants. If we remain focused and work together, we will be victorious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kaden then turned back to the chief, and said \"Very well. We will follow you inside.\" Without another word, the Samurott turned and walked back into the building, and the challengers followed behind him. The chief led the group until they reached a room with several branching hallways, then turned around to speak to them. \"To settle this dispute, the three of you shall face three of my finest soldiers in single combat. The side that wins the majority of the battles will be granted dominion over Haven.\" The chief's unnerving smirk remained from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kaden looked like he was about to respond, but Silva cut him off. \"I don't like this,\" she said. \"They might have prepared for us. We shouldn't split up and make ourselves vulnerable.\" Kaden turned around and faced her. \"It's best this way. We have a better chance of winning <i>two</i> of these fights than facing all of them at once.\" The Liepard glanced at Vole briefly, and the Luxray felt his heart sink. \"We agree to your terms,\" Kaden said to the chief before Silva could object again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Very good,\" the Samurott replied. \"I will be waiting farther inside the building to hear the results.\" With that, he turned and walked down one of the hallways branching off of the room. \"I still don't like this,\" Silva said as he turned a corner. Kaden looked around at the different paths out of the room, then turned to Silva. \"We don't have another choice. They would easily overpower us if we fought them all at once,\" he replied. Silva grunted in grudging agreement, and the three each chose a hallway. \"Good luck,\" Kaden said, then turned and started walking. Silva and Vole shared a worried glance, then went their separate ways.</span></div></div>",

He planned on taking his opponent down quickly by stabbing them with one of his darts, which were covered in a sleep-inducing toxin that Syrus had created. The Liepard reached the entrance to a room and stepped inside. It was large and empty, with several holes in the ceiling that allowed light to come through. At the opposite end sat a large, muscular canine with crimson fur and black stripes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Arcanine smiled as he watched the Liepard enter the room, then stood up from his seat. As he did, the hallways at either end of the room were suddenly sealed shut by a door that slid down from above. Kaden looked around the room and quickly realized that it existed solely for the purpose of fights such as this. The Liepard shuddered as he wondered how many other Pokemon were led to this room before, and never heard from again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Arcanine saluted him from across the room, and said \"Well this is a pleasant surprise! I don't get to meet lovely pussycats like you very often.\" Kaden ignored the remark and called back, \"Let me through or die.\" The fire dog seemed confused for a moment after hearing Kaden's masculine voice, but he quickly returned to his mocking grin. \"Ooh, and she's a feisty one, too. I like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kaden reached into his backpack with both hands as the Arcanine took up a fighting stance. He palmed a sleep dart in one of his hands, and drew a knife with the other, hoping the latter would distract his adversary and prevent him from noticing the former. \"Oh, so you're not going to play fair?\" the Arcanine teased. \"Well, that's fine by me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The hulking fire dog slowly approached Kaden's end of the room as the Liepard waited cautiously for his opponent to make his move. The Arcanine took in a deep breath, and Kaden dodged backwards as the canine exhaled a huge blast of flame. The Arcanine continued to channel the stream of fire as he advanced one the Liepard, and Kaden realized that he had backed himself into a corner. There was nowhere to run to as the Arcanine moved closer and the heat became more harsh. Kaden had to think of something quickly, or he might end up as a crispy piece of dog food!</span></div></div>",

The fire suddenly stopped, and Kaden opened his eyes to see the the knife lodged into the Arcanine's upper chest. It looked like a solid hit at first, but the canine's dense muscle had prevented the weapon from going deep enough to cause any major harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The tiger-dog reached down and grabbed the knife, pulled it free, and tossed it behind him before grinning maliciously. \"Glad that's over with,\" he said, then continued advancing on the now-unarmed Liepard. Kaden dashed forward in an attempt to duck around his opponent into the open, but the Arcanine grabbed his leg as he passed, causing the Liepard to tumble forward onto the floor. Kaden lost his grip on the sleep dart as he collided with the hard wood, helplessly watching it roll away as the Arcanine chuckled behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nice try, kitty-kat,\" he said, his voice low and smooth, \"But there's no getting away from me.\"</span></div></div>",

Looking back, the Liepard saw to his horror that the canine was stroking his thick cock, coaxing it out to its full size. The Arcanine smirked nastily as he leaned forward over the feline. Kaden looked away and squeezed his eyes shut as he felt the Arcanine's length nudging his tailhole. The fire dog slowly forced his way inside, grunting as the Liepard's tight ass constricted his cock pleasurably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Arcanine slowly began to push in and out as Kaden did his best not to think about his current situation. The tiger-dog moved gently at first, then picked up speed as his pre began to spill out, smearing over the Liepard's innards to allow his length to slide more easily. Kaden covered his ears and pushed his head against the ground as the Arcanine's thrusts became larger and more deliberate, the dog beginning to drool and pant as he neared his peak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Arcanine shoved himself in one last time, then held himself there, even grabbing the feline's shoulders to keep himself as deep as possible. Kaden felt the warm slime spurt from the lewd canine's shaft, covering his insides and filling him with disgust. The Arcanine held himself for as long as his orgasm lasted, making sure to fill the Liepard with as much dog spunk as possible. After what felt like an eternity for Kaden, the canine slowly withdrew, keeping the beaten feline pinned under him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Arcanine let out a low growl as he removed himself, then gripped his cock to squeeze out the last of his cum. Kaden lay there motionless, embarrassed and utterly defeated. He didn't even know if he wanted to escape at this point. He felt the weight of the dog lift off of him, but he didn't attempt to get up, figuring it was pointless to even try. He heard his dominator laugh darkly behind him. \"Good. You know your place.\" The Arcanine knelt down behind the Liepard and lifted his footpaws off of the ground. \"Now let me show you where you belong...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kaden felt something warm and slimy engulf his feet. <i>Fine,</i> he thought, <i>Save me the embarrassment of making it out of here alive.</i> When he turned around, however, he realized that the Arcanine was stuffing him into his now- soft and bulging cock! \"Fuck!\" the Liepard exclaimed in surprise, as his new master slowly pushed the feline's legs down his length. \"Yes,\" the Arcanine growled, \"Your one and true place, to become one with the most animalistic part of myself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kaden tried to struggle and break free of the fire dog's grip, but the Arcanine easily kept him held still as his cock worked its way over the Liepard's ass. \"You do have a very pleasant body... And it will make such a wonderful contribution to my supply of cum... Doesn't that sound nice?\" Kaden tried pushing against his predator's cock with his hands in a halfhearted attempt to escape, but deep down he knew he wasn't getting out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Arcanine gently pressed Kaden's arms against his body and allowed his cock to slide over them, ending the Liepard's attempts to dislodge himself. Kaden felt the Arcanine's ball sack stretching around his legs as they were forced inside. <i>Fuck, no, I don't want this to happen! Please don't let this happen!</i> the Liepard cried out internally. <i>I don't want to be made into this pervert's cum!</i> The Arcanine lifted his prey up to press the Liepard against his fluffy chest fur as his cock enveloped the feline's midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Don't worry, cutie... It'll all be over soon.\" Kaden watched in terror as the fire dog's bulky cock pulled his chest inside. He closed his eyes as the Arcanine placed a hand on his head to push him the rest of the way. \"Thank you, kitty kat~\" He heard the beast say before he was pushed down into the slimy embrace of his member. Kaden kept still and waited for merciful unconsciousness to come. His body was forced into the dog's overstuffed balls, as outside the perverse canine stroked his cock slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Arcanine remained kneeling on the ground, now partially sitting on the weighty bulge between his legs. He felt with one hand as the body of his prey began to soften and break down, melting into more of his spunk. The lustful canine started to lose himself as he felt his balls squishing down under his weight, their contents becoming less and less solid. He pawed himself vigorously, quickly approaching his second orgasm with his latest acquisition- although this time, the Liepard was a little less cohesive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Arcanine leaned back as his cock expelled the remains of the unfortunate Liepard, spewing the rich cum across the floor of the room and all over the Arcanine's chest. The satiated canine murred as his balls shrank, spurting the last of the cum out onto his red- and black- furred body. The Arcanine fell backwards, lying on the floor covered in his cum. He smeared the goo around in his chest fur, then brought his paw up to his mouth to lick it off. \"Nice kitty,\" he cooed to himself, then chuckled softly. Thanks to the Liepard, his debauched urges were satisfied. At least, for today.</span></div></div>",

Acting out of panic could easily put him in a vulnerable position, and he was confident that he could bear whatever fire the Arcanine had left in him. As the heat became more intense and began to singe the Liepard's fur, a bit of self-doubt entered his mind. But, sure enough, the heat died down just before it became unbearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kaden opened his eyes to see the Arcanine, out of breath, looking a bit surprised to see the Liepard alive. Kaden immediately rushed forward to take advantage of his opponent's vulnerability. He brandished his knife in his right hand, which drew the fire dog's attention away from his other hand. Kaden feigned a stab, allowing the Arcanine to catch his arm using both of his own. A vicious smile appeared on the canine's face, which lasted right up until Kaden jabbed the sleep dart into his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Caught off guard, the Arcanine let go of Kaden and stumbled backward, clutching at where the small object was stuck into his skin. As he realized what had just occurred, the Arcanine scowled down at the frail purple feline who had outsmarted him, and stuttered, \"Y-you little... b...\" The Arcanine's eyes lost their focus and he stumbled backwards, slamming into the floor with a loud crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kaden stood over the unconscious beast and considered his options. The obvious thing to do would be to use his knife to end the Arcanine here and now. Kaden, however, was averse to killing unless it was absolutely necessary. He didn't know for sure whether the Arcanine would continue to be an issue if he was allowed to live. If Kaden and his allies managed to unseat the chief, perhaps the Arcanine would surrender, or maybe even agree to help them. That sleep serum would only last a few moments, so he had to think quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kaden glanced at the exits to the room. They were still sealed, and he had no idea how to open them, so that ruled out trapping the Arcanine inside and leaving. The tiger-dog was beginning to stir now- Kaden was out of time. The Liepard straddled over the Arcanine's chest and sat down, holding his blade against the canine's throat. As his adversary slowly awoke, Kaden explained his demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You have caused me a problem, dastard, but I will give you another chance.\" The Arcanine's eyes refocused on the Liepard, but he remained silent and motionless. \"I am going to leave this room. You can choose to help me or not. If you tell me how to open these doors, I will let you live on the condition that you never mistreat the citizens of Haven again.\" Kaden narrowed his eyes and leaned a bit closer to emphasize his point. \"If you cross me, I will not hesitate to put you to sleep a second time. And be assured that if that happens, you will not wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Liepard scanned the Arcanine's expression as the dog stared intently back at him. \"If you refuse to help me, I will kill you now and find out how to leave on my own.\" The Arcanine's mouth opened, but it took him a few moments to actually produce words. \"Ah... alright. There's a panel in the wall... back where I was standing.\" The Arcanine pointed to a place on the wall, and Kaden cautiously stepped off of him. \"Stay there and do not stand up,\" he said as he backed away from the fire dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kaden felt along the surface of the wooden plank wall, and quickly found a square that was separate from the rest. He removed the panel, revealing a small space that fit between the walls of this room and an adjacent one. A rope dangled down from above, and at the end was a crude wooden handle. Kaden glanced over his shoulder to see the Arcanine sitting in the same place, not making any moves to resist him. \"Pull it. Hard,\" the fire dog said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kaden gripped the handle and walked backwards, and sure enough the doors began to lift up, opening the way through the exits on either side of the room. Kaden slowly lifted the doors until they returned to their original positions above the hallways, at which point he felt them lock into place. <i>This is an interesting contraption,</i> the Liepard thought to himself. He figured there was a switch on the floor that the Arcanine had stepped on to release the doors earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kaden turned to the muscular canine before leaving the room. \"You may go, but if you do commit any misdeeds, you will have me to answer to.\" The Arcanine nodded and Kaden turned to continue on his way. After a short walk, he reached an intersection where three hallways converged into one. He guessed that this is where he would meet with the others, but neither of them were here yet. Kaden considered going down one of the other hallways to help his friends, but the other rooms probably had devices to lock them down as well. Besides, the chief could claim that they cheated if he found out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kaden decided to scout ahead instead of simply waiting for the others. There were several branching hallways ahead, and he had wanted to explore this building regardless. The Liepard stalked forward silently and turned down the first hallway on his right.</span></div></div>",

Silva and Kaden had already gone ahead and left him lingering in this intersection of hallways. The Luxray was nervous to go ahead, given that he was going up against a mighty warrior with his feeble muscles and meager combat skills. There was no way he was going to win legitimately, so he figured he was going to try to stun them with electricity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ugh...\" Vole groaned, then rubbed his eyes with one of his hands. Even with that advantage, he felt like his chances of victory were slim. He was seriously considering just running away instead of walking into probable death. But he couldn't abandon his friends like that... without them, he'd probably just go back to being the fuckup that he was before. The Luxray cursed himself as he belatedly recalled that he was carrying a satchel filled with some of Syrus's concoctions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Opening the bag, Vole recognized a few potions intended for curing infections and easing pain. There were a few medicinal berries in there as well, and one potion that he didn't recognize right off. He held the vial up to inspect it, and a vague memory began to form in his mind. <i>This one... Syrus showed it to me... What the hell was it? Helps with... uh... Helps with digestion.</i> The Luxray promptly placed the vial back into the bag and closed it. Not only was that unhelpful, but it was also a bit disturbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole sighed deeply and hit himself in the head out of frustration. <i>Of course none of these potions are going to save my ass. I just need to stop being a pussy and go in there.</i> The Luxray stood up straight and hesitantly started down the hallway. Before long, he entered a medium-sized and dimly lit room. At the opposite end stood a feminine figure. As Vole's eyes adjusted to the dark, he recognized her as a well-figured and busty Lucario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey there, hon,\" she called from across the room. Her voice was smooth and sexy. Vole was caught completely off guard, having expected a heavily-muscled male to be his opponent. He heard her giggle as she started walking towards him. \"You look a bit flustered. Don't worry, I get that a lot. Hehe...\" Vole dropped his satchel and steeled himself for a fight, raising his fists a bit in an attempt to look at least slightly competent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh, calm down, kitty boy,\" the Lucario said, stopping a few meters in front of him. From here her seductive body became even more evident. Her breasts were large and firm, her belly was slim, and her ass was pleasantly plump. \"You don't have to fight me,\" she continued in her sensual tone. \"Here, let me make you a <i>proposal</i>...\" Vole was trying to resist the arousal growing in his body, but it wasn't going very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I can see you're a bit of a stud, so I'll give you a choice. You let me <i>play</i> with you for a bit, and I'll let you walk out of here without a fight. You can even say you won.\" The Lucario put a hand on her hip and grinned as Vole considered his options. It seemed obvious that she didn't actually plan on letting him go after having her fun. Even so, she might let her guard down enough for him to take her by surprise. And even with the way she looked, he was pretty sure he would lose to this Lucario in a fair fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Lucario chuckled again in her suggestive manner. \"C'mon, handsome. I know you want to, I can see it in your eyes. And, uh, somewhere else too. Hehe...\"</span></div></div>",

I'll, uh...\" The Lucario immediately advanced on him and wrapped her arms around his chest, then squeezed him against her luscious body. \"<i>Wonderful,</i>\" she cooed, gazing up at his face with her eyes half-lidded. <i>Even if this ends badly,</i> Vole thought to himself, <i>I think I made a good choice.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Lucario turned around, guiding Vole with an arm behind his back as she led him towards her side of the room. \"You won't regret this, kitty boy. I guarantee it...\" She stopped in front of a large cloth cushion and threw the Luxray down onto it roughly. Vole landed on his back, the soft cushion absorbing the impact quite well. <i>Cloth is very hard to come by,</i> he noted, and it became obvious that this room wasn't designed for fighting at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Lucario stood over him and slowly, tantalizingly, dropped onto all fours above his legs. \"Hope you're ready for me, kitty,\" she said lustily, her tongue beginning to loll out of her mouth. She leaned down and slowly dragged it up the feline's fully-hard shaft. Vole couldn't help but groan out of pleasure as the Lucario teased his arousal. She started lapping at his cock, licking it in different places and then quickly pulling away. The attention caused Vole's shaft to begin drooling pre as the Lucario covered it in her own slime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She wrapped her mouth around his tip and pushed against it forcefully with her tongue, taking in the first of the Luxray's seed as he bucked his hips gently. \"You're tasty, catboy,\" she said before suddenly taking his entire length into her mouth. Vole grunted loudly as the Lucario moulded his cock around with her tongue, pressing it against the sides of her mouth and thoroughly coating it in saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Lucario withdrew and gave Vole's arousal a short break. \"Mmm, but as tasty as you are, I want something different today.\" She turned around and hovered her rear over the Luxray's shaft, letting him draw the obvious conclusion. He guided his length into her with one hand as she slowly sat onto him, the Luxray's slippery cock easily sliding into her tailhole. \"Haaaa, there it is,\" she sighed blissfully, beginning to move up and down. Vole fondled the Lucario's firm ass and hips as she rode him, her breasts bouncing pleasantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Lucario wrapped her legs backwards around the Luxray's rear, beginning to push him upwards along with her as she moved. She slipped a hand between her legs to finger her nethers, which leaked generous amounts of fluid onto the cloth cushion. Vole moaned as his cock spilled out more pre, compressed wonderfully between the Lucario's perfect ass cheeks. She looked back over her shoulder at him, her expression one of pure ecstasy. They were both blushing heavily, their pleasure far beyond words at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole moaned loudly as he approached his peak. His cock stiffened, then spurted his cream up the Lucario's ass, pushing her to her own orgasm. She cried out in ecstasy as cum spilled from her pussy, and her ass tightened around the feline's excited shaft. His cum slowly filled her up as his cock pumped forcefully to overcome the pressure of her own muscles. The two sat there panting as their orgasms gradually calmed down, still squeezing each other's bodies as much as was possible. \"Aaahh... Ooh, yeah... You're a good kitty,\" the Lucario cooed, looking over her shoulder at her willing toy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As his pleasure died down, Vole quickly started to think about how he was going to gain the advantage over the Lucario. He was sure she wouldn't be letting him go willingly. She slowly lifted off of him, facing in the opposite direction now. He considered trying to shock her and topple her over, but part of him said that he was acting too hastily.</span></div></div>",

The female gave a little yelp before falling forwards onto the soft bed, leaving the Luxray half-buried under her. He struggled out, scooting himself backwards, and briefly looked her over. She was unconscious, although he couldn't guess for how long, but still appeared to be breathing normally. Vole's mind raced as he thought through his plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He couldn't just leave the Lucario here, as she was one of the Chief's lieutenants, and probably wouldn't be very happy about him knocking her out. There didn't appear to be any way to restrain her or trap her here. That meant that his only option was to get rid of her, and he only really had one way to do that. Although, deep down Vole realized that all of this rationalization was just to make him feel better about following his erotic impulses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Luxray picked up the Lucario's black-furred footpaws and placed them into his mouth. He ran his tongue over her smooth, pink pads, and murred as the pleasure of the act filled his mind. He pushed the paws farther inside and started to work in the rest of the Lucario's feet. Staring down her shapely legs at her sexy ass was quickly causing his cock to perk up again. Vole worked down the Lucario's legs, her feet slipping into his throat, as she slowly started to squirm around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"H-hey...\" she said drowsily, \"Hey, stop that...\" The Luxray continued swallowing down the Lucario's legs as she lazily tried to wriggle away. \"Aww... oh well,\" she said after ceasing her half-hearted struggles. \"Looks like you got me, kitty boy.\" The Lucario slipped a hand between her legs as the Luxray approached her thighs. \"Mmm, got me good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole's arousal quickly started to build as he watched the Lucario pleasuring herself, her legs slipping down his slick throat. He gulped in the tip of her cute little tail, then slowly enveloped her wide hips. Vole licked over the Lucario's wet paw as she slid it in and out of her pussy, her tangy sex juices dripping onto his tongue. \"Oh, I was wrong, you're a <i>bad</i> kitty... hehe...\" She started gently thrusting against her paw as her hips slid into her predator's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Bad kitty's gonna gulp me down and stuff me into his skinny little belly...\" Vole could feel the Lucario gaining speed as her nethers slipped farther down his tight throat. \"Ah... then he's gonna melt me down into goo... <i>Mmmh</i>, and turn me into fat for his body...\" She rubbed her breasts with her free hand as the Luxray worked in her upper body. He licked over her curved midsection thoroughly as her feet started to stretch his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I can't wait, kitty boy... send me down and digest me... make me into more of you...\" Vole had thought the Lucario's speech was sensual before, but now she was pushing the limits of his arousal. His rod twitched anxiously as he swallowed over her thin belly. He gently began to stroke himself as the Lucario's breasts entered his maw and his tongue slathered them in saliva. \"Yes... that's it... I want to be one with you... forever...\" She let out a hushed, drawn-out sigh as Vole took in the last of her body, gently closing his mouth around her head. The Luxray carefully took his last swallow, pulling the Lucario's head into the slimy tightness of his throat as her body slowly slid down to his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole leaned back as the large weight in his body gradually collected itself into his midsection. The Lucario continued to writhe rhythmically as she pleasured herself inside the cat's stomach. Vole just sat there staring at the bulge, amazed and incredibly aroused from the events which had just occurred. He scooted back to lean against a wall, continuing to play with his cock as the Lucario squirmed in his gut.</span></div></div>",

He didn't have time to sit here and digest the Lucario, as much as he wanted to, and apparently how much she wanted him to as well. But... she was already thoroughly crammed into his stomach. Was there even a way to get her out at this point?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Luxray tentatively reached a clawed hand into his mouth and poked at the back of his throat. He hit a sensitive spot, and his body convulsed. His stomach muscles clamped down on the Lucario, who kicked out in response. The event lasted only a moment, and then Vole was back to where he was before, albeit with a bit more discomfort in his gut. What the hell was he going to do? He couldn't afford to be lugging around this extra weight while he was supposed to be overthrowing a corrupt leader. Maybe if he shoved his entire fist into his throat he could really get himself to gag, but that didn't sound pleasant in the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole suddenly remembered the satchel of medicines that Syrus had given him before he left, and struggled to his feet, having trouble lifting the weight of the Lucario with the exhausted state his body was in. He lumbered across the room back to where he had first entered and dropped the satchel. Seeing the place empty and remembering just where that Lucario had gone made his cock twitch eagerly. That wouldn't be going away anytime soon. He reached the spot where he had left the bag of medicines and sat down heavily, causing gurgles to rumble from his stomach. If he wanted to save her, he would have to do it quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole opened up the satchel and instantly froze as he remembered what he had found rummaging through here before. A potion that Syrus told him would <i>help with digestion</i>. He found the glass bottle, a sinister green liquid swirling around inside. Just how much faster would this make it go? Alternatively, there was a pain-killing medicine that Vole remembered had quite a nasty taste, which he could use to try to make himself vomit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Lucario's squirms had stopped just a few moments ago. If he got her out now she would probably still be okay. But then again, what would stop her from turning on him if he let her go? She was one of the Chief's agents, after all, even with all of those things she had said while he was swallowing her. That willingness might have just been an act to get him to let his guard down... <i>But shit, that doesn't make sense! She could have tried to get away, but she just let me eat her.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole sighed heavily and looked down at the glass vials he held in each of his hands, as well as the furry protrusion which sat between them, which wouldn't be a Lucario for long if he refused to act. <i>There really isn't a right decision here, is there?</i></span></div></div>",

He glanced down at the motionless bulge in his midsection before lifting the vial up to his mouth. \"Fuck... Arceus, I'm sorry...\" He tilted his head back and poured the liquid inside, swiftly gulping it down. Then he shifted backwards to lean against a wall and waited for something to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before long he could feel his digestive system starting to work frantically. The Lucario writhed around a bit, temporarily roused by the sting of acids melting her body. Vole grabbed his overstimulated cock and stroked it gently as his stomach groaned and churned. <i>I'm going to hell for this. If I wasn't already.</i> The Lucario's struggles died down, and shortly after Vole hit his orgasm. He moaned loudly, then his cock tightened and sprayed thick ropes of cum across his chest and belly. The Luxray panted sensually as he watched the white pooling on the already-softening bulge. The pulses gradually got smaller until the cum was simply drooling out and dripping onto his crotch area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole relaxed his muscles and slumped back against the wall, letting his firm rod flop to the side. The tension and the gurgles from his stomach were really starting to pick up now. He closed his eyes and rested for a while, cradling his belly with one hand. The intense work his body was doing was starting to cause him discomfort, and he let out a belch as a pocket of air was forced out of his stomach. Pushing at it with his hands, he could feel the bulge slowly getting softer as the Lucario's body was broken down within. \"Ugh... she deserved better... <i>uuuuurrrp...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Luxray was plagued by sensual thoughts of the mysterious and sexy woman as he felt her partially-melted body through the walls of his stomach. She was well on her way to becoming mush in his belly, just like she wanted. As he pushed from the outside, the lump gave way a little instead of firmly resisting him. Her curvy body, that plump ass, those cushy breasts, all of that would be his... and none of this was helping his raging hard-on go away. As his stomach let out a particularly loud groan, Vole shrugged to himself, grabbed his cock, and started pumping.</span></div></div>",

The green reptile seemed content simply to stand there and look at her. Silva nearly gagged when she saw his cock beginning to grow out of its sheath. The Sceptile's stare never flickered as she struggled to think of a reply. \"...That's disgusting.\" She thought she saw a smirk appear on the Sceptile's face, but his body remained motionless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Silva wondered what she should to do as her opponent glared at her lewdly, letting his arousal hang out in the open.

The Sceptile stopped, still grinning wickedly, and readied himself in a similar fashion. Silva flinched inwardly as she noted the razor-sharp leaf blades attached to his arms.

The Sceptile easily deflected the blow, and went in for a swipe with his bladed arm, which Silva managed to catch with some difficulty, sliding back a short distance as the momentum of the blow was absorbed. The Absol wasted no time, slashing across the Sceptile's face with her free arm and causing him to reel backwards a short distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The grass-type appeared surprised for a moment, but then his dark grin widened even more. He felt the claw marks along the side of his face, then licked the blood off of his hand, staring Silva right in the eye as he did so. She swore she could hear him moaning under his breath. The lizard advanced on her once again with renewed fervor, taking multiple swipes with his blades which she barely managed to sidestep. One of the strikes grazed her side, and she lost her focus for a moment, which was all the Sceptile needed. He lashed out the moment her guard went down, leaving a long but shallow gash across her midsection.

She cried out in sudden pain, and when she returned to her senses she saw the Sceptile greedily shoving his bloodied hand into his maw, savoring the warm trickling of the Absol's blood. He slowly removed his clawed hand from his mouth, a strand of drool stretching between the two. Silva shivered as he ran the slimy appendage down her face, then slowly dragged it down her body. His piercing yellow eyes seemed to stare right into her soul, and she could smell the heavy musk drifting up from his crotch. He had her now, but what did he want from her?</span></div></div>",

The Sceptile bit down on the flesh between her neck and her shoulder to anchor himself as he began to pound her, meanwhile his clawed hands went down to explore her body, occasionally leaving scratch marks as he gripped her tightly. Silva was completely overwhelmed by the assault, letting out brief cries at the sharp pricks of pain, in addition to the aching pain from the Sceptile biting her neck and the undeniable pleasure from his cock slamming into her. The Sceptile, on the other hand, was enjoying himself beyond belief, smiling as he got a taste of the Absol's warm blood from the place he was biting her. His shaft had been left anxious and swollen from the anticipation, so it didn't take long for the pleasure to build up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Silva could feel the Sceptile's thrusts getting stronger. He wrapped his arms around her and squeezed, compressing her body tightly against his own scaly hide with enough pressure to force the air out of her lungs. Just then, with her body pressed so close to his, the buildup in his groin erupted into her, eliciting a gasp from the Absol as she felt his cum blasting deep into her, filling her up. The Sceptile held her in his crushing embrace while his orgasm ran its course, making her feel each and every pulse of his muscles. He began humping her along with them, making sure to milk out every last drop of cum into his wonderful prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When the orgasm finally ended, the Sceptile let go of Silva abruptly, dropping her onto the floor as she began desperately gasping for air. He leaned down and slowly dragged his tongue along the side of her face, taking in the musky and sweaty flavor that filled the air. Silva panted softly as she slowly recovered, lying still under the weight of her dominator, resigning herself to whatever fate he had in store for her. His rod still lodged in her pussy, a stream of cum leaking out around it, both his and her own. Her body was bruised and battered, with the wounds from her battle being joined with a plethora of smaller cuts, plus a giant bite mark on her neck with the skin broken in a few places. She was too weak to put up any resistance as the Sceptile...</span></div></div>",

She felt him lean down and begin to lick her footpads. Agonizingly slowly, as if he did it not for his own pleasure, but merely to torment her further. The wet, slimy contact sent shivers up her body. The Sceptile wrapped both feet up in his tongue before engulfing them with his maw, letting his drool trickle through Silva's fur as he gradually inched up her ankles. She screwed her eyes shut and tried to tune out her surroundings, but it was difficult with the way he moved so slowly, taunting her. She was his food now, and he wanted her to know that. For every single moment as he devoured her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Sceptile moved up Silva's legs, padding down her fur with his tongue before gulping her a bit further. Her feet were in the tight, slimy embrace of his throat now. Her whole body would be sucked down that tube, inch by delectable inch, to be packed away in his belly... The Absol quivered. She couldn't help these images flooding her mind, not when the Sceptile kept reminding her. He moved methodically, rhythmically, as a snake would... knowing that his prey's ingestion was inevitable. He took extra time savoring her fine hips, enjoying the feeling of his maw stretched perfectly around them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After working his mouth around Silva's ass, the Sceptile lifted her above himself as he moved into a kneeling position. Silva looked down at his still-thin belly as he slowly choked down her plump rear. She would just be a stomach bulge before long... It would gradually shrink as she was digested... And then eventually, out the other end... This was terrible. She didn't want her life to end like this, as nothing but food. Was this how... was this how her prey felt, when she ate them? She had forced this fate on several before... and despite herself, she felt like she deserved this. <i>Fine, just let it be over...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Sceptile was nearing her breasts now. As they nested into his mouth, he flexed his jaws and squished them around, playing with them. Her body was his now, and he could do whatever he pleased with it... Eventually he had his fun and gulped them into his throat, the slick flesh squelching around the firm bulges. The Absol's legs had slipped into his stomach and began folding up as more of her slid inside. Silva couldn't stand to look down after seeing the throat claim her breasts, and her legs pushing out from his midsection- instead she looked up toward the ceiling. Her arms were splayed out above her, they would be the last things to go... She could feel the slimy flesh of the Sceptile's maw beginning to engulf her neck. His tongue slid up to greedily lap at her face, slathering her with copious amounts of drool. It was obvious how excited he was to claim her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Silva could see the pink of the lizard's mouth creeping around the edges of her vision. As she slid down, the wet flesh engulfed more of her view, slowly blocking out the outside world, until <i>clack-</i> his jaws closed around her, and <i>glick-</i> her head slipped down into the tight embrace of his throat. Her view faded from dark pink to black as she sunk deeper, farther down into her predator's body. Her arms were still outside, but they too slowly sunk down into the warm, wet embrace of his throat. The Sceptile watched with a smirk as his meal's slender arms slowly disappeared into his maw until only her hands were left outside. He allowed them to slide in, licking them tenderly with a hand on his belly to feel it expanding with the Absol's form. With a head tilt and a triumphant <i>*gulp,*</i> she was lizard meat. The last bulges slid down his neck and added to the round, sagging bulge of his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Silva's head slipped out of the tight throat tunnel into the stomach, she gasped in a mouthful of air to refresh her deprived lungs, only to gag at the rancid stench. The smell of rotten meat and digestion seeped into her senses, reminding her of the fate which was quickly approaching for her as well. There was already a significant pool of acids, a representation of how eager the Sceptile and his body were to absorb her. The volatile fluid stung all of the little cuts he had made in her skin, causing her to squirm and writhe, but it was only getting worse. She could feel his clawed fingers gripping her from the outside, squeezing her as she struggled. The Absol realized that he had done this on purpose, it was his plan to cut her up so he could feel her squirm in his gut. He had likely done it with many before, it was a routine, and she was next on the list to melt away in his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The acid pool gradually rose until it submerged her pussy, and the harsh stinging on the sensitive flesh caused the Absol to cry out, kicking hopelessly against the tight walls of her prison. The Sceptile could probably hear her whining, he probably loved it, loved hearing her agony as his body began to break her down. All her squirming only managed to make him happy, as well as splash and stir the acids around herself, speeding up her inevitable digestion. <i>Fine,</i> she thought, <i>let him digest me, melt me down, make me into fat, I don't care, anything to end this torture.</i> But the Sceptile didn't want it to end, no, he swallowed more air just so she would last longer, he wanted her alive as his acids dissolved her. The pool was up to her breasts now, stinging at her nipples, but at this point more pain could hardly make it worse for her. The stench of digestion was getting worse by the moment, and this time she knew it was her own bloodied meat she was smelling. Her struggles slowly died out, and tears dripped down into the rancid pool. Her mind became foggy and her body grew numb as her consciousness faded, bringing a slight comfort. She was food for a lizard, meat in his belly, soon she would be fat on his thighs, but at least she could relax...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Sceptile, he had stayed standing the entire time, not wanting to miss a moment of his prey's slow demise. He relished that final moment when the movement stopped, he could feel her life drifting away, her body left behind for him to absorb. He knew that in that last moment, she was happy, grateful to be embraced by his flesh so the pain could end. As a part of himself, she would have no more worries, no struggles, every aspect of her was entrusted to him. The lizard gripped his belly tightly with his clawed hands and squished it around a bit. Yes, he would take good care of her...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Looking at the Sceptile up close was giving Silva second and third thoughts about fighting him. With that lean muscled body and dangerously sharp arm blades, it was going to be a risky proposition no matter how she went about it. <i>Oh, who am I kidding? No way in hell I could take this guy down.</i> The Absol reached out her arms in the least threatening way she could manage. The Sceptile cautiously allowed her to grab both of his arms, then she suddenly pulled herself against him with an enticing growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Silva pressed her body against the lizard, almost flinching when she caught a whiff of his musk. No way she could take him in hand-to-hand combat, so she had no choice but to try this approach. The grass-type seemed to be taking the bait, judging by the way he moved his hand down to grope her ass. Now she had him, but where to go from here? The only surefire way to get rid of him would be eating him, but she doubted she could simply overpower him. A memory from her dark years surfaced in the Absol's mind, and it seemed like the only way this would be remotely possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Silva ran her tongue up the Sceptile's scaly neck, then locked gazes with him, feigning a lusty expression perfectly. She stepped back, giving him a good view of her curves before pulling him down with her. She climbed on top of him and positioned her pussy in front of his face, making sure to assert herself before the Sceptile had a chance to. \"<i>Wanna taste?</i>\" She whispered, inching herself a little closer. The lizard hesitated for a moment, but then his tongue slid out to lap at the Absol's slit. She did her best to make her grunts of discomfort sound like pleasured moaning as the Sceptile got braver with his movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Silva let her arousal build up as the green lizard probed deep into her snatch, which began to leak fluids onto his face. She would need to be thoroughly wet for what would happen next. She carefully wrapped her hands around the back of his head and gave him a gentle shove, nudging his snout between her nether lips. This was the critical moment. Hopefully he really, <i>really</i> liked her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a brief moment of stillness, the Sceptile suddenly lunged forward and buried his face into Silva's slit, and she yelped in surprise. The lizard continued to work his way deeper, and Silva, regaining her composure, shoved hard to force the rest of his head inside. The Sceptile gripped Silva's ass hard with one of his claws, and she shifted into a squatting position over his shoulders, moving quickly to work him inside before he fully realized what was going on. She had done this only once before, in a situation surprisingly similar to this one, back in her days as a waitress in an erotic bar. Apparently an effective way to make a horny and hungry predator disappear quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Absol pushed herself down onto the Sceptile's shoulders, and they slipped into her pussy with a groan and a stretch. She slowly slid down his chest, and the lizard finally caught on to what was happening. He struggled and writhed, but the tight constraint kept him from doing anything meaningful. Silva gradually worked her way down the green-scaled reptile until she was sitting on his hips, the bulge of his head now moving into her midsection. The Sceptile's hot pillar of meat poked at her underside. She roughly pressed it against the lizard's body as it was sucked inside, and felt him squirming in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Silva relaxed and slid backwards to lean against a wall, her legs splayed out with the Sceptile's own legs still protruding from her sex. The Absol looked down as she felt a sudden warmth, and noticed a pool of cum forming between her legs. <i>Arceus, I hope that doesn't get me pregnant,</i> she thought idly as the kicking, green legs slowly vanished inside of her. The bulk of the Sceptile slowly and pleasurably moved up her tunnels and collected in her womb, bulging out her belly a good bit as the lizard struggled inside. Besides the ecstasy of taking a live body up her snatch, she was overwhelmingly relieved that her ploy had worked and allowed her to escape unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Yeah, how do you like that?\" Silva taunted to the writhing bulge, which had begun moving in a rapid and panicked way. Probably realizing that he was being melted into femcum, or just jacking off, or both. \"More than you bargained for, I bet,\" she said, followed by a loud moan as the movement slowed down. The Absol was overcome with drowsiness as her energy was diverted to breaking down the lizard in her womb. <i>Just a little nap,</i> she thought to herself as her eyes drifted shut. Before she nodded off, she crossed her legs tightly, sealing off the Sceptile's only hope to escape. It was silly and unnecessary, but she got a little kick out of the feeling of dominance. He would be escaping from there before long anyways. Just in a different form.</span></div></div>",

Metal bars lined the walls on either side, and behind them were several small rooms, each separate from each other... Cages. The Liepard shivered as he walked between the rows of empty cells. This was most likely an old jail, but what the twisted Samurott was using it for now was another matter entirely. Kaden reached the end of the hall, a dead end, and turned back the way he came, but suddenly a feeble voice called out from behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"E-excuse me... miss...\" The Liepard whirled around, unsure of where the voice came from, until he noticed a young Eevee curled in the corner of one of the cells. She was so silent and still that he had walked right past her. \"You're not... one of them, are you?\" she whispered as the Liepard approached the door to the cell. \"No,\" he replied before testing the door, but it was locked shut. \"O-oh... I... I'm sorry, I...\" the Eevee stuttered, obviously caught off guard by the Liepard's low-pitched, male voice. \"Forget it,\" he said as he knelt down to look her in the eye. She crawled forward a few feet, but she was restrained by some chains which prevented her from moving too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do you know where the keys are to your cell?\" Kaden asked. \"I-I think... the Chief has them,\" the Eevee replied, hesitating before she spoke his name. \"I will find him, and then I will return to free you. Are there any others here?\" The Eevee's expression became more solemn as she answered, \"Th-there... there used to be a few... my sisters... b-but...\" Here she sobbed and began crying, \"Th-the Chief... took them... a-and I don't... I don't know...\" Kaden stood up and backed away from the cell. \"Hold on. I will be back before long.\" Then he turned and walked away, leaving the weeping Eevee behind. She weakly reached out a hand, as if to make him stay, but the Liepard was already out of sight. She sat up and wiped the tears off her face, her mind overflowing with emotion. The brief encounter had left her breathless, and her savior had left before she could even thank him. She could only hope that he would be successful...</span></div></div>",

After a long while of sitting and waiting for that Lucario to digest, his body had finally finished her off, and indeed the Luxray had finished himself off several times during the process. After getting rid of the waste that was left from the Lucario femme, a process which was neither quick nor pretty, he left the room which he assumed to be her living quarters to look for his comrades. Hopefully taking that hour or so of downtime hadn't gotten them killed or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Luxray glanced down at himself and decided he was presentable enough, despite the fur on his belly being matted together with dried cum. What really worried him was the pudge he'd gained from his meal. <i>How does Silva stay so thin?</i> he wondered as he pawed around the squishy layer of fat. After a short walk he reached an intersection of hallways where the Absol in question was already waiting. She greeted him with a warm smile, then hugged him tightly. \"For Arceus's sake, you little furball, I thought you got eaten or something!\" Vole couldn't help his still-firm cock brushing up against her leg. \"Come on Silva, you don't trust me to handle myself?\" he teased as the two separated. The Absol giggled a bit before replying, \"No.\" Vole figured she realized that he'd been up to some sort of surreptitious activities, but she didn't say anything, and he noticed she was similarly musk-covered and disheveled. He would have to ask her about that later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Right on time, a furtive-looking Liepard emerged from one of the branching hallways and hailed the lovers. \"Ah, you two. Glad to see you are alright,\" he said before gesturing back the way he came. \"Follow me, I believe I know where the Chief is hiding.\" Either Kaden hadn't noticed the heavy musk wafting off of the other two, or he simply hadn't mentioned it. Vole and Silva shared a brief glance, then followed him until they arrived at an important-looking pair of double doors. \"Here we are,\" the Liepard said before turning to the others. \"Thank you both greatly for helping me with this. All that is left is to unseat this man and Haven will be safe once again. Are you ready?\" He got a small nod from both of them, then turned back to the entrance. Tensity filled the air as Kaden slowly pushed the doors to each side...</span></div></div>",

I'd like to keep you around...\" Vole was caught off guard when the Lucario sat back down onto him, this time with her rear uncomfortably close to his face. \"However... I'm afraid my butt isn't quite satisfied yet... hehe...\" Vole started squirming as he realized his mistake, but the Lucario easily kept him pinned as she shifted backwards, inching her ass towards the Luxray's snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole tried desperately to pry the eager predator off of his face, but he made no pleas for mercy, kept silent by an odd combination of fear and embarrassment at his situation. The Lucario lifted her tail and spread her cheeks with her hands, showing Vole her cum-leaking tailhole before she slipped it over his muzzle. Vole's body convulsed at the sudden lack of air, and the Lucario slowly slid herself backwards, squeezing his head in between her rump cheeks. The Luxray could feel her wrapping her hind paws around the back of his head, using them to shove her ass-meal deeper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole was now able to take in small breaths of air, which carried the powerful scent of the Lucario's bowels combined with the heavy musk of his own seed. His face was coated in the slime, which was now ironically lubricating the way for more than just his cock. The Lucario shoved herself downwards, taking in the rest of the Luxray's head as his struggles slowed down from the lack of air. She leaned back to lie flat on the cushion, to better allow the Luxray's shoulders to slide into her depths. She moaned loudly at the strain it put on her ass, then fell back limply as her muscles began to pull her prey deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Lucario could feel the Luxray's head beginning to emerge into her stomach. She rubbed the small bulge from the outside, feeling it push out farther with each pulse of her muscles. She teased her pussy with one hand, noticing that her victim was sporting a re-awoken hard-on. \"Hee hee... Silly kitty boy,\" she cooed softly, then reached down to stroke his anxious cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole grunted as he felt the Lucario pleasuring him from the outside. At least she was giving him the best time of his life before devouring him. And besides, vanishing up a sexy girl's ass was not the worst way he could have gone. The Lucario pushed his shaft against his belly before letting her ravenous tailhole pull it inside. She rolled over and got onto all fours, lifting her ass in the air to help the Luxray's legs slide into her. She let out lustful cries as she felt the bulge in her midsection expand from her meal's body slowly sliding in. The Luxray's legs gradually disappeared between her plump cheeks, reappearing as part of the squirming bulge that sagged beneath her. Eventually his footpaws and curled toes slipped inside, and the Lucario rolled onto her back to feel her prey settling in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Ah... That's a <i>good</i> kitty... mmnhh...\" She stroked the bulge with one hand, and fingered her snatch with the other, satisfied and exhausted from the ordeal. Inside, Vole was writhing around in an attempt to get himself off, rubbing his cock against his legs and the walls of the stomach since the tight constriction prevented much else. He began to feel the sting of the Lucario's acids on his fur, and thoughts flooded his mind of what would happen to his body. The Lucario would digest him, as she would with any piece of food. He would be melted down and made into pudge on her belly, bulk on her breasts, fat on her ass... It was arousing beyond belief, and in the dark and twisted state of mind he was in right now, it didn't seem like such a bad fate after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Luxray's body convulsed one last time as he blew his load inside the Lucario's stomach, adding his seed to the acidic mixture pooling inside. He went limp as his consciousness slowly faded, accepting of his fate to be a part of the Lucario's body, for her to use however she saw fit. The only thing missing was... <i>Silva...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Lucario sighed contentedly as the squirming settled down and her stomach started to work on her meal. He was the most fun she'd had in a while... A nice, sexy, willing, and totally harmless catboy... She would have to find more of those. Before long, she nodded off to sleep, as satisfied with her latest acquisition as he was with her.</span></div></div>",

Silva quickly became exhausted struggling in the feral's grasp, losing her breath from the tight embrace. She could feel the fire-type's intense body heat flowing into her, sapping her strength and causing her to sweat. The Flareon opened her mouth and slowly drew Silva towards it, obviously in no hurry to devour her meals. \"Shit,\" the Absol cursed weakly, realizing the irony that she would soon become just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Flareon pulled Silva's head into her waiting maw, drenching the Absol in her copious saliva. She pushed until Silva's face was at the entrance to her throat, then took her first swallow, pulling it inside. The Flareon grabbed Silva's sides and shoved her in deeper, starting to work the Absol's head down her throat. The round bulge traveled down the Flareon's neck, disappearing behind her scarf-like fluff as she forced the Absol's shoulders into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Silva laid her hands on the Flareon's shoulders, but she was unable to generate any significant force to pull herself out. The Absol's arms were gradually forced back to her sides as the feral engulfed her shapely chest. The Flareon excitedly ran her tongue across Silva's breasts, delighting in feeling the weight that would soon be added to her own. She loosened her grip on the Absol's body, confident that her prey wasn't leaving anytime soon, and worked Silva's thin body into her mouth gradually, swallow by swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Silva had either fainted or given up by now, her struggles having ceased completely. Her head entered the Flareon's steamy stomach as the fire-type swallowed over her abdomen, lifting her head to aid in devouring the Absol's ass and legs. Silva's body slowly filled the Flareon's stomach, visually increasing the size of her already-prominent belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Flareon had almost forgotten about her Luxray ass-toy, and used the calm moment to resume abusing him. She rode back and forth and bounced up and down, lodging the unfortunate lion's muzzle even deeper between her cheeks. He was all but unconscious now, smothered under the Flareon's plump rear.</span></div></div>",

The Absol's elegant legs slowly slipped down her throat as the top half of her prey was crammed into her stomach. The Flareon licked over the Absol's footpaws thoroughly, then took another swallow, sending them down her throat to land in her stomach with the rest of her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After taking a moment to rub her pleasantly curved belly, the Flareon dismounted her second victim and stood over him for a moment. He was completely knocked out now, although apparently some part of him was enjoying himself judging by his stiff cock. The Flareon moved over to his feet and got on her hands and knees. Her tongue lashed out and licked across his footpads, causing the Luxray to twitch and groan a bit during his brief hibernation. The Flareon held his ankles still and explored between the feline's toes as his unconscious struggles intensified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a while of teasing the Luxray's sensitive paws, the Flareon opened her mouth and took them inside, continuing her tongue treatment as she pulled her next meal's feet towards her throat. Her stomach had already started working on the motionless Absol, coating her fur in digestive juices and beginning to eat away at her body. The Luxray remained half-conscious as the Flareon slowly worked her way up his legs. She took her time to savor every inch of his furry flesh, slowly approaching his still-firm cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Flareon started stroking the Luxray's shaft with her tongue as she pulled his hips into her maw. The drowsy feline grunted pleasurably at her treatment, bucking gently as the Flareon slathered his rod with saliva. Before long, the Luxray's muscles tensed and his cock started to pump, spurting his creamy seed all over himself and coating the roof of the Flareon's mouth. He let out a blissful sigh as his unperceived predator swallowed past his rump and happily licked the cum off of his belly. His feet had entered her stomach, being stuffed in alongside his former companion. His legs slowly wrapped around the outside of her tightly-curled body as the Flareon swallowed up to his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Realizing that her submissive meal was finally regaining his consciousness, the Flareon took his arms and placed them into her mouth, then pulled them into her tight throat. She swiftly gulped down the last parts of her prey as his lower half was crammed into her overstuffed stomach. By the time the Luxray came to his senses, he was already neck-deep in the Flareon's throat, his head still tainted with the musty scent of her own tailhole. As he realized his predicament, the doomed Luxray began to squirm in the slimy confines of his predator's gullet. She swallowed again and closed her mouth around his head, sealing him into her body for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Luxray struggled with what little energy he had left as the Flareon gulped him down her throat, feeling the bulges travel down her body. The unfortunate feline's body was wrapped around his lover's in the crushing embrace of the Flareon's stomach. He quickly lost his consciousness again, for good this time, as the fire-type's acids soaked into his fur. The Flareon affectionately massaged her enormous gut, finding a place to nap as her meals slowly digested. Their bodies were broken down and melted together as she slept, soon becoming a thick, uniform soup in her stomach. Their mass would be added to her own considerable stores of fat, built up over time by her countless other victims.</span></div></div>",

She moved a hand down and grabbed the Luxray's firm cock, causing him to grunt into her mouth. The Liepard backed off a bit, positioning her waist over Vole's shaft. She broke the kiss as she began her slow descent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0First the tip of the Luxray's cock entered her wet folds, followed by the meat of it as the Liepard slowly lay down on top of him. The two simultaneously moaned as ecstasy flooded their minds. The Liepard pressed her body against Vole as his entire length entered her pussy. She wrapped her arms around his shoulders, her breasts resting on his chest. The Luxray laid a hand on The Liepard's firm ass, pushing her down as he thrust upward and causing her to gasp as he penetrated her depths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Liepard started moving in rhythm with Vole, the Luxray massaging her pleasantly curved rear. He reached between her cheeks and teased her tailhole, enticing a moan from her. The two increased their speed and grew louder as the pleasure built up. Vole slowly forced two of his fingers into the Liepard's asshole as she rode him passionately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Luxray soon felt a pressure building up in his cock, his orgasm growing near. He shoved his fingers into the Liepard's ass as he hit his peak, setting her off as well. Her pussy clamped down on his length as it pumped his seed into her, the Liepard's juices flooding over Vole's waist. His cock continued to fill her with his cum, slowing down as the orgasm began to fade. The two relaxed their bodies against each other, sex juices dripping from the Liepard's snatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole's mind remained cloudy in the afterglow as the Liepard slid off of him. He felt like he should be remembering something, but the thoughts didn't quite make it into his consciousness. Instead of clearing up, his mind became foggier, his intelligent thoughts being replaced with a desire for more pleasure. He closed his eyes to rest, and when he opened them a few minutes later, they had changed from yellow to a deep purple. The newly feral Luxray felt a sudden hunger come over him. He glanced at the motionless Liepard, considering his options.</span></div></div>",

The lion opened his mouth and dragged his tongue across the Absol's face, leaving her fur matted with his saliva.

The Absol heard an excited yip from the Liepard behind her, anticipating the Luxray's next move. Silva would meet her end in...</span></div></div>",

She turned around on her hands and knees, and promptly shoved Silva's feet in between her plush ass cheeks. The Luxray gulped the Absol's head into his throat in an attempt to keep her for himself, but the Liepard already had her prey in up to her ankles. The purple feline held Silva's legs and gradually pushed her deeper, mewling pleasurably as her tailhole was spread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Irritated, but unable to regain his catch, the Luxray gagged to force Silva out of his throat, letting her fall to the ground roughly as her head emerged from his unsated maw. The saliva-drenched Absol coughed a few times, then looked up at her would-be predator. He glanced briefly at his lost meal, then turned to leave the cabin in search of a replacement. Silva watched him go, confused, until she realized he was leaving her to her fate with the Liepard. \"Vole\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\" she called softly, but he had already dashed off into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Liepard continued her ass-meal uninterrupted, Silva's upper legs now vanishing into her ravenous tailhole, and her feet entering the feline's waiting stomach. The Absol laid there despondently, not putting up any resistance despite being disgusted by her current situation. She couldn't stop thinking about Vole, how she had saved him and he had loved her in return, and how he was now nothing more than a wild, perverted animal. She was roused from her stupor when she felt her hips being compressed into the Liepard's rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a suddenly renewed will to survive, Silva planted her hands on her predator's rump and pushed with all her might in an attempt to save herself from becoming ass food. She made some progress at first, but the Liepard's tunnel constricted her body tightly, making it very difficult to dislodge herself. The Liepard, in no hurry to finish her meal, simply relaxed and enjoyed the feeling of the Absol resisting her muscles' contractions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Silva did her best to keep from being pulled in, but her strength was quickly running out. The Liepard's tail twitched as she felt her prey start to sink in deeper once again. She reached down and began fingering her nethers, letting a pleasured yip escape from her mouth. Silva began to panic as her hips slipped into the Liepard's tailhole, followed by her abdomen as her arms finally gave out. The Liepard intensified her self-stimulation as she felt the wide section of her prey enter her tight tunnel, as well as the Absol's legs beginning to stretch her slender belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cursing to herself, Silva realized that there were other houses nearby and that she could have been calling for help this whole time. \"Help!\" she cried desperately. \"I don't want to die!\" The Liepard's rear had enveloped her mid-body and begun to squeeze her breasts in between the feline's ass cheeks. The Absol tried futilely to prevent her revolting fate by pushing against her predator's rump with her elbows, but the Liepard's muscles had made far too much progress for her to resist now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Silva let out one last scream for help as her breasts were compressed into the Liepard's tailhole. Her arms were forced out in front of her as her head was drawn closer. The rotten smell of her predator's bowels invaded the Absol's senses as her head was pulled inside. The Liepard moaned loudly as her victim was slowly pushed up into her expanding stomach. The Absol's arms gradually sank into the Liepard's rear as the feline continued to pleasure herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't want to die\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\" Silva thought, continuing her pleas from before. \"I don't want to be sucked into this bitch's ass\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\" Her limp hands were finally pulled inside, and the Liepard sat up to feel her prey travel up her body. \"I don't want to be crammed into her stomach and digested into\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\" Silva totally lost it after that thought, and used her remaining energy to struggle uselessly inside of her predator. The Liepard held her belly with one hand as it expanded to contain her latest victim, fingering her wet pussy with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Silva thought she could hear some voices coming from outside. She desperately tried to cry for help, but her voice was muffled severely by the flesh surrounding her. The Liepard hit her orgasm, mewling loudly as her cum spilled all over the floor of the cabin. Her acids started flooding into her stomach to deal with the huge piece of meat within. Someone started knocking at the door and yelling something, but by the time they came inside, the Liepard had left via one of the windows. Silva sobbed to herself as the world shook around her, realizing that she was being carried away from her only hope at survival. She slowly lost consciousness as the Liepard's digestive acids soaked her fur and stung her skin.</span></div></div>",

The Absol was jarred back to her senses, and took hold of her predator's legs in an attempt to resist his force. The lion's hold remained strong, however, and gradually the Absol's head was pulled into his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Liepard wrapped her arms around Silva's waist and eagerly pushed her forward into her partner's shaft, hoping to receive the cum that the Absol would generate. The Luxray relaxed his grip, letting his cock and the Liepard work his prey's shoulders inside. The intense strain it put on his shaft caused him to murr happily. The lion's rod slowly crept over the Absol's breasts as her head was pushed into his sack. Silva had given up at this point, the hot cum-covered inside of the Luxray's balls causing her to become lightheaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Liepard planted her hands on the Absol's ass and pushed, gradually forcing her deeper into the Luxray's shaft. Slowly the lion's cock enveloped the Absol's midsection and arms, working its way towards her shapely hips. Silva's legs began to kick weakly as the Liepard shoved her rear into the Luxray's bulging shaft. The purple leopard then positioned the Absol's legs vertically, letting them slowly slide down to join the rest of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Silva lost consciousness as her body was crammed into her former lover's balls, soon to be churned into his seed. The Liepard massaged the pleasant bulges of the Absol's feet as they traveled down the Luxray's cock, then began kneading his overstuffed sack to help speed up digestion. The Luxray laid back and enjoyed the service, along with the pleasurable feeling of the Absol slowly melting into his cum. The lion's balls lost some bulk as the solid form inside was converted into a thick broth of semen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the digestion neared completion, the restless Liepard turned around and presented her rear to the Luxray, letting out a soft mewl to voice her desire. Ready to relieve himself of his load, the lion crawled forward and took up a kneeling position behind his partner. The Liepard lifted her long tail, allowing the Luxray to access her eager tailhole. He gradually worked his cock into the Liepard's tight ass, gripping the cat's shoulders to give himself better leverage. The Liepard let out a silent screech as the Luxray neared his full length, her vocal cords failing due to the pleasure overwhelming her senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once he was fully inside, the Luxray took a moment to bask in the feeling of the Liepard's anal tunnel constricting his engorged member, then slowly began to pump in and out. It took a lot of force to move through the skinny feline's ass, but soon precum began to lubricate her walls, letting the lion's cock slide through more easily. The pair gradually gained speed, the Luxray's sack sloshing as it swayed beneath them, until the lion reached his orgasm. The thick seed began to flow up his shaft and into the Liepard's rear, coating her innards with the slimy ex-Absol. The Liepard hit her peak as the cum filled her insides, causing her muscles to contract on the Luxray's shaft. The lion grunted loudly, holding his position as the seed was slowly transferred through the Liepard's tight tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Liepard's body stayed stiff as the cum gradually flowed towards her stomach. The thick fluid flooded into the small organ, causing the cat's belly to visually expand as her stomach stretched to contain the huge volume of seed. Eventually, the Luxray's supply neared its end, his balls having retracted close to normal. He slowly pulled out of the Liepard's rear, and the lusty cat let out a long moan as the bulge was removed from her system. A bit of seed leaked from the Liepard's hole as the Luxray withdrew himself, gripping his cock to squeeze out the remaining cum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Liepard lay sprawled out on the floor, happily mewling and groping her sloshy belly. Silva had been digested into her lover's cum, and resigned to boil away in the stomach of a slutty catgirl. The creature who used to be Vole would escape into the forest, followed by the Liepard some time later. The two would each become dangerous predators, capturing countless prey to help them satisfy their dark urges.</span></div></div>",

Realizing his situation, the Luxray tried to push away from the Liepard's body, but she kept her grip and engulfed his face, blinding him with her hot drool. The Liepard continued her teasing body rubs as she pulled Vole's entire head inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole could feel the Liepard's tongue assaulting his face as she gulped his neck into her mouth, matting down the Luxray's fur with her saliva. His head was forced into her throat, creating a large bulge as she stretched her mouth around his wide shoulders. The Liepard sat back onto her legs, forcing the Luxray into a kneeling position and giving her better leverage to swallow his chest. Vole gave up on his halfhearted struggles and instead started stroking his cock, resigning himself to his fate as food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Liepard slowly worked her way over the Luxray's chest as he pounded himself furiously. His head bulge was pushed past her throat and disappeared behind her breasts. The Liepard began to lift Vole's body into the air as he reached his orgasm, spraying his thick cum all over her chest and belly fur. The Luxray's self-stimulation regressed into twitching as the Liepard swallowed his midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole heard the Liepard's purring resonating around him as his head was pushed into her stomach. He was overwhelmed by the harsh smell of her acids as more of him was forced inside, quickly filling up the small chamber and creating a bulge on the outside. The Liepard happily lapped up the excess seed dripping from his cock as his waist was pulled into her mouth. She took another swallow, compressing his rod against his belly in her tight throat. Vole was forced to curl up as his body was crammed into the Liepard's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole's legs and tail were the only visible parts of him left. The Liepard used one arm to shove them in, and the other to feel her expanding midsection. She gradually worked her way down his legs until his footpaws and tail tip vanished between her lips. She licked them over slowly, causing the Luxray to squirm in her stomach as she went between his toes. Eventually, she took her final swallow, sending his feet down her throat and into her waiting belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Liepard sprawled out on Vole's bed and purred contentedly, rubbing her full stomach. The Luxray inside soon passed out from the lack of oxygen in the hot chamber, acids starting to work on turning him into nutrients for the Liepard. She drifted off to sleep on the soft grass bed, her fur still sticky from the Luxray's orgasm, letting her body digest her victim overnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0By the middle of the next day, Vole was nothing more than a layer of fat under the Liepard's fur, accentuating her breasts and butt, and a pile of excrement she left rotting by a tree in the woods. His additions to the Liepard's body would allow her to lure in and devour even more victims in the coming future.</span></div></div>",

His cock was growing hard, rubbing up against the Liepard's thigh. She took notice and rubbed it back, pressing down on it with her furred body, eliciting a soft moan from the Luxray. She pulled out of the kiss to reposition herself, and Vole, still drowsy from having just woken up, simply fell back and waited for whatever the Liepard had planned. He wasn't quite expecting what happened next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole opened his eyes and found himself staring at the Liepard's shapely ass, which she was hovering directly above his face. The Luxray had enough time to widen his eyes before she sat down on him, squishing his muzzle in between her plush cheeks. The female let out a lusty <i>mmrrowl</i> as she felt the Luxray's nose pressing into her tailhole. With his supply of air suddenly cut off, Vole reached up to attempt to pry the Liepard off of him, but all he managed to do was push weakly against her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Liepard purred at the massage he was giving her, slowly sinking lower as the Luxray's muzzle slid into her depths. Before long she had engulfed his entire head, and she moved up into a crouching position as she prepared to take his shoulders. At this point, Vole realized completely what was going on. <i>She's really shoving me up her asshole. To eat me. And then digest me. Damn, alright... ...I can get off on this.</i> And with that, the Luxray ceased his pointless struggles and instead started pounding his cock. The Liepard pressed herself down against his shoulders, slowly spreading her hole wider, until with a sudden <i>shlorrp</i> they were completely sucked inside. She let out a wordless cry as her tailhole was stretched to its limit, the Luxray's arms sliding in easily as she let her weight onto him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole's chest quickly disappeared into the Liepard's ravenous tailhole, and his head reemerged as a bulge in her lower abdomen. The Liepard teasingly rubbed the ascending bulge as the Luxray's stroking became more frantic. His midsection gradually slipped into her rear, and his arms became immobilized, putting his self-stimulation to an end prematurely. Amused, the Liepard reached down to flatten his cock against his belly as her ass slid over him, forcing his head up into her waiting stomach. Vole writhed in his tight confinement as the volatile acids stung his flesh. However, the same muscles that were dragging him up to his doom were also tightly massaging his shaft, granting him one last pleasure before he was melted into kitty goo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Liepard stood and let the rhythmic flexing of her muscles take over, the Luxray's legs and tail still hanging from her rear. Slowly, pulse after pulse, they were dragged up into her rump to join the mass collecting in her belly. A small dribble of cum escaped from the tunnel and dripped down the female's thighs, symbolizing the Luxray's complete surrender. A few more minutes in her boiling stomach and he would pass out, doomed to be absorbed by her body and carried around by her for eternity. The Luxray's twitching toes and tail-tip were the last of him that could be seen, before they too were sucked into the feline's rump, sealing his fate as food for her ass and consuming all of the potential deeds and events in his future along with him. Right up into her asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Liepard exhaled contentedly as the Luxray settled into her stomach, his movements slowly dying down. She massaged the bulge lovingly as her acids went to work. After a few moments she nonchalantly strode out of the house, lugging her meal to somewhere quiet where she could digest him in peace. Vole would be slowly reduced to a few pounds of fat distributed across her body, especially contributing to her bosom and her rump, and a mound of waste which she disposed of without a second thought. He hadn't been the first horny male to vanish up her ass, and he wouldn't be the last.</span></div></div>",

He could feel her start to knead the fur on his back with her hands. He knew where this was going, but there was no stopping it now, not that he really even wanted to. The two started making out excitedly, rubbing their bodies together under the water. Vole's eyes drifted shut as Silva massaged his chest and back, then shot open again when she reached down to fondle his shaft. What he saw across the lake made him freeze in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Standing on the far shore of the lake, Vole could make out a blue-skinned figure looking him straight in the eye. Silva noticed something was wrong and turned around to follow his gaze, letting out a small gasp as the newcomer began to approach them. Female given her appearance, she walked slowly and deliberately, striding atop the water instead of sinking down. She continued until she was standing right in front of them, looking down at the lovers with crossed arms and an irritated expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her skin was smooth and light blue, with spots of white here and there. Her face was canine in appearance with menacing red eyes. Flowing purple hair billowed out behind her, accentuating her pleasantly curved body. \"I am a Suicune, guardian of the lakes,\" she said, her voice surprisingly deep. \"You two are contaminating my waters with your filthy practices, and you must be punished.\" With that, she leaned over and plucked Silva out of the water, lifting her entire body as if it weighed nothing. Silva struggled and lashed out, but the Suicune kept a firm grip as Vole started to charge up an electrical attack.</span></div></div>",

Silva struggled and let out muffled cries, but the water guardian continued to swallow her down, quickly taking in her slim torso. The Suicune grabbed Silva's legs as she reached the Absol's hips, using the leverage to shove her ass past the tight opening to her throat.

She picked him up and immediately shoved his face into her mouth, causing him to gasp and sputter from the continued lack of air.

His head was forced into the cramped chamber, rubbing up against the wet fur of Silva as the Suicune reached his still-firm rod. She ignored it, squeezing his rump into her throat and beginning to work on his legs and tail. They flailed weakly as she swiftly swallowed them down, pulling his footpaws into her mouth.

She sighed contentedly as she retreated back into the forest, churning about the inanimate remains of the two lovers, digesting them into filth for the Aurora Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon to dispose of later.</span></div></div>",

Silva struggled frantically and let out a few unintelligible words, but her captor kept her grip tight. The Suicune shoved Silva's face into her rear, slowly stretching her ass over the Absol's head, causing her to cough from the foul air. Holding Silva by her shoulders, the Suicune gave another strong push, forcing the Absol's entire head into her anal tunnel and letting out a moan of naughty pleasure. Silva's breasts were flattened against her body as the Suicune began to work on her torso. The Absol's lean body proved simple for the Suicune to suck in, her arms pinned uselessly to her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Silva was now visible as a squirming bulge in the Suicune's midsection, which she kneaded and massaged. The Absol's head had entered her stomach, giving her more room to scream and struggle, but the chamber wouldn't stay empty for long. The Suicune gave a huge pull as she took the Absol's ass inside her own, then relaxed as she let her muscles work in her kicking legs. Just as the Suicune sucked Silva in up to her knees, Vole surfaced in front of her and began gasping for air, wincing as he noticed the Suicune's struggling stomach. The Suicune wasted no time in grabbing him and positioning him to follow his lover, even though the Absol's paws still hung from her rear. Before they were pulled in completely, the Suicune shoved the exhausted Luxray upward, using his head to force the Absol's feet inside and keeping her ass spread the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole's head and neck were quickly engulfed by the Suicune's ravenous asshole, but his wide shoulders required her to push him in using her arms. The Suicune took her time in pulling in the Luxray's chest, enjoying the strain it put on her rear. When she reached his waist, she could feel his rock-hard cock poking at her nethers. She flattened it against his body, then gave a huge pull, taking in the Luxray's rear. The Suicune stood up straight, letting her muscles pull in the Luxray's legs and tail, taking pleasure in every moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Suicune slowly sucked in the Luxray's footpaws and star-shaped tail tip, enjoying the feeling of them sliding up her intestines to meet the Absol in her stomach. She rubbed her enormous belly with both hands, caressing her distended midsection as her victims struggled within. After a few moments, the Suicune could feel their movements become larger and more constant. <i>Do they really think they can escape?</i> she thought to herself. Then she realized: <i>Oh, they must be fucking each other in there.</i> She hadn't been expecting it, but she wasn't upset- the rhythmic motion made digesting them all the more pleasurable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After a few minutes, the two Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon's movements stopped, having finished their fun in the hot confines of the Suicune's stomach. She went to lie down on the shore of the lake, sprawled out on her side with her belly bulging out in front of her. It wasn't long before she was fast asleep, letting her acids work on her prey during her slumber.</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile, she pulled him into a deep kiss, licking across his face a few times as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole could feel his cock stretch to contain the Suicune's ample breasts as Silva made out with him furiously. At the same time, the Suicune's head began to enter his hot balls, coating her face in his slimy cum. Her chest was slowly forced inside as his shaft crept over her stomach, pinning her arms to her body. Silva pulled away from Vole's face, returning her attention to forcing the Suicune down his length. She planted her hands on the Suicune's ass cheeks and shoved firmly, pushing in the Suicune's abdomen, followed by her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Silva returned to massaging and licking Vole's fur as the Suicune's legs slowly sank into his shaft. The Luxray sighed, basking in the glorious feeling. Slowly, the lake guardian was forced to curl up in his balls as the last of her disappeared into his cock. Vole stood and massaged his bulging sack, beginning to wonder if this was even real. Silva continued to stimulate his body as the Suicune struggled in his balls. Slowly, her movements started to slow down and Vole could feel his sack begin to constrict her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Is she\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 digesting?\" he asked between breaths. Silva calmed a bit, wrapping her arms around the Luxray and nodding. \"Melting into more of your cum.\" Vole took a moment to consider that statement. \"Fuck, that's sexy.\" The two stood there holding each other, feeling the form of the Suicune begin to dissolve.</span></div></div>",

Silva knelt down and kneaded the bulging sack, breaking apart what little remained of the lake guardian's body. \"What happens now?\" the Luxray asked, partially knowing the answer. \"We give her a permanent home,\" Silva replied, positioning her head in front of Vole's cock. That was exactly what the Luxray wanted to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Silva slowly dragged her tongue up Vole's shaft, lapping up the cum that had been leaking out. She licked the Luxray's cock tip a few times, causing him to grunt loudly, before wrapping her mouth around it. Vole placed his hands on Silva's shoulders as the last of his cock meal was digested into seed. He began to thrust gently, slowly pushing his shaft farther into Silva's mouth. The Absol massaged him vigorously with her rough tongue, swallowing the precum as it began to flow out faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole started moaning loudly as the pleasure built up. Silva sucked his rod deeper into her mouth, moving her hands to rub his sack as well. Suddenly, the Absol forced her head forward, lodging Vole's tip in the entrance to her throat. The Luxray reached his peak, and quickly the Suicune-seed started pumping from his cock, flowing down Silva's throat and into her stomach. The sensation of the ex-Suicune filling her belly as Vole's balls shrank put her over the edge as well, and cum began to spill from between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The lovers held their positions as the Suicune was gradually transferred, Silva's stomach bulging as Vole's balls returned to an almost-normal size. As the flow tapered away, Silva slowly let Vole's cock slide from between her lips. She lay down on the grass and kneaded her gurgling belly as Vole sat down nearby, cum still drooling from his tip. \"That was awesome,\" he said in a daze. \"Yeah,\" Silva replied. \"We should do it again sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole sprawled out on the ground and dozed off as Silva's stomach worked on redigesting the cummified lake guardian. A while later, the Luxray was awakened by the sound of Silva getting up to wash off in the lake, followed by her shouting \"Hey, look at this!\" Vole opened his eyes lazily, and directing his gaze toward the lake, noticed Silva <i>standing</i> on the surface of the water. \"Whoa!\" he exclaimed, suddenly awake. \"How are you doing that?\" Silva looked back at him, her belly almost flat and an excited look on her face. \"I don't know, but it's really cool! Come out here and try it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Luxray got to his feet and took a hesitant step onto the water, finding to his surprise that it held his weight perfectly. He walked out to join Silva near the middle. \"That\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 whoever she was\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 was a lake god or something, right?\" he asked. \"Yeah,\" Silva replied. \"I guess we absorbed her power somehow.\" The two stood together for a while before Vole broke the silence. \"What do we do now?\" Silva got a wicked grin on her face. \"Let's go eat some ferals.\"</span></div></div>",

But as Silva teasingly circled her fingertips around his cumslit, a dark urge struck him in the deepest part of his psyche. The feeling of that Suicune sliding down his shaft was so incredible, he wanted more, desperately. Silva continued to tease his overstimulated rod and rubbed his bulging sack which contained the softening form of the Suicune. He loved her, he really did, but she had essentially brought this upon herself by showing him this disturbingly arousing act in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole gently gripped his lover's wrist and pushed her hand into the tight softness of his shaft. After a moment she looked up at him in surprise, only to see his eyes glazed over with lust. \"...Vole? Vole, stop!\" A muscle pulse from his cock sucked in the Absol's wrist. \"Vole, wait! You can't do this to me! I'm your mate!\" The Luxray blushed deeply as he was simultaneously filled with guilt and pleasure. \"I-I'm sorry, Silva... ah... but this feels... too good.\" Silva started to panic, pushing against her lover's thigh with her free hand, but the Luxray kept her shoulders held tight as her arm sank into his manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Vole! V-vole, think about this! You're going to kill me! I'll be gone forever!\" The Luxray hesitated a moment, but then promptly continued pushing his lover down his cock. \"Sorry... I still love you. But this is better.\" Silva writhed frantically as the feline's cock started to wrap around her shoulder. Her hand was forced into his hot and messy ball sack, and she could feel the smooth, slimy form of the Suicune that she would soon be joining. \"No, Vole! N-mmmmpphh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Luxray's cock enveloped her head and quickly began to slide over her breasts, eager to claim its second victim. Vole stood and slowly fed her inside, feeling very conflicted about the whole thing. One part of him, the rational part, was screaming at him to let Silva go. She was his lover, his savior, the reason he was alive. Was he really going to sacrifice her life her for a few moments of ecstasy? The other part of him, the dark and twisted pleasure addict, wanted nothing more than to stuff this slut down his cock and watch her melt into cum. Hell, he didn't need her, not with something as intensely gratifying as this to keep him going. It went against every moral fiber in his body, and yet somehow the predatory urge was winning out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole grabbed Silva's legs and lifted them off the ground, causing her midsection to suddenly sink in. Her head entered his balls and was forced down into the sticky mess of Suicune and cat cum. The powerful musk in the soft and malleable chamber invaded her senses, causing her arousal to perk up at the familiar scent of her mate. <i>Is this really happening?</i> Silva wondered to herself. <i>Am I really going to be turned into Vole's cum?</i> A feeling of betrayal poked at the edges of her mind, but it was drowned out by sheer astonishment at the sudden turn of events. Up above, she could feel her hips sliding into the warm and slimy embrace of her lover's member. <i>I guess I'm dead, then. Fuck.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole reached down to squeeze Silva's ass cheeks as they slowly slipped into his cock. The thought that he was taking in her body, the one that he loved and that he was so familiar with, to melt her down into his own seed, was erotic beyond belief. The Absol's legs hung limply as they sunk down into the Luxray's ravenous shaft. Her upper body was crammed into his hugely stretched sack, rubbing against the slimy remains of the Suicune. Vole lifted Silva's footpaws up to his mouth and gave them a few affectionate licks, causing the Absol's toes to curl and twitch. He wanted her to know that he still loved her, despite having consumed her body to pleasure himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Vole watched those cute black footpads disappear down his shaft, a pang of regret echoed in his mind. Maybe Silva meant more to him than he thought she did. The lump of her feet traveled down his cock and deposited into his bulging balls. He considered trying to cum now and get her out before his body did its work on her. But no, what's done is done, and he had already made his decision. Silva had shown him the way to pure sexual bliss, and then she herself had fallen prey to his desires. He would use her gift to the best of his ability to make his own life happy and pleasurable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Luxray relaxed his muscles, practically sitting on the huge bulge between his legs. He could occasionally feel Silva moving within, but she wasn't flailing around violently. That was good. He didn't want her last moments to be a panicked struggle for life. Eventually her movements grew weaker and stopped as she fainted from the thick and humid air inside his balls. He rubbed his sack gently as the form within began to soften, leaving his anxious cock alone to avoid loosing his load too early. The bulge gradually lost its shape and became more gooey, and Vole fell onto his back to look at the sky while the last of Silva the Absol melted away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole gently massaged his over-engorged cock, moulding his awaiting orgasm around with his feet. The bodies of two lovely females were pent up in there, just waiting to be released back into the world. Vole didn't keep them waiting too long, as his casual stroking quickly pushed him past the breaking point. He moaned loudly as thick ropes of rich cum spurted from his manhood, splattering all over himself and the surrounding greenery. The Luxray even opened his mouth and let several globs land inside, happily swishing the musky mixture around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The climax lasted for a generous amount of time as the cum spilled out over the pleasure-crazed feline, his sack shrinking as its contents were expelled. Eventually the flood slowed to a gradual leak as the Luxray's exhausted muscles pumped out the last of his prey. He lay still for a while, panting in the glorious aftermath of his best orgasm ever. His furred body was still covered in a thick layer of creamy white, and a large pool of the stuff collected beneath him. He casually scooped up a glob and looked at it closely. This musky slime coating his body and dripping down his arm, that was Silva, or at least some of it was. The thought turned him on to no end, and oddly, he felt a closer bond with her now than he ever had before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Vole slowly stood up and let the goo slide off of him, glancing around at what remained of the two others who used to be here with him. He felt good now, wonderful even, and he knew he would have to find more to keep himself satisfied. He briefly washed off in the lake before walking back towards Haven, wondering about what new experiences awaited him. He was not a feral, not yet, but in essence he was no better than they were. Driven completely by physical pleasure, and heedless of the lives of others. He would enjoy himself very much in the coming future, but through all of the lives he claimed, the Luxray knew he would never love anyone as much as he did Silva.</span></div></div>",

The Luxray flinched as the big dog panted excitedly in his face, his erect cock brushing up against his own waist. The Mightyena rolled him over, exposing the drowsy cat's asshole, then positioned himself above his prey. The Luxray realized what was happening a moment before his attacker shoved his dick into his ass, causing him to yell out in sudden pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Mightyena began to pump in and out of him, slowly at first, then picking up speed as his pleasure increased. \"Gah! H-help! Somebody!\" The Luxray's sore throat limited how loud he could yell, and either nobody heard him, or they didn't care. The Mightyena continued his rough treatment, gripping the Luxray's shoulders for added leverage. The Luxray felt the flesh inside his anal tunnel begin to heat up from the unexpected intrusion, when the Mightyena stopped pumping suddenly. The Luxray closed his eyes and gritted his teeth, preparing for the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As expected, cum began to erupt from the dog's cock, coating the Luxray's insides and giving him the most disgusting feeling of his life. After what seemed like minutes of orgasm, the Mightyena finally pulled out, leaving the cum-filled cat lying exhausted on the ground. \"Ugh... alright... just... leave. You got what you wanted.\" But the Luxray didn't hear any footsteps walking away. Instead, he noticed a strange, wet feeling on his hind paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Looking back, the Luxray gasped in horror as he realized his rapist was now swallowing him, feet-first! \"Ahh! Arceus, no!\" He had heard this was possible, but even his dirty mind hadn't considered doing it for pleasure. Pleasure was obviously the reason of this Mightyena, as his face was stretched into a sick grin as he worked his way up to the Luxray's knees. The Luxray clawed at the ground, doing his best to escape his fate, but the throat muscles of the Mightyena continued to pull him in. The dog grabbed the Luxray's tail and shoved it into his maw before continuing to engulf the lion's legs, reaching his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Luxray felt a disturbing pleasure from between his legs as the Mightyena began to lick his genitals, exciting his cock. This momentary distraction only left the Luxray more hopeless when the Mightyena pulled him in up to his chest. He had given up on calling for help. Was this his fate? To be devoured by some pervert in a street? <i>I guess I deserve it</i>... he thought. <i>I've lived a pretty shitty life</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Luxray watched with empty eyes as he was devoured up to his neck, and the Mightyena stood up to let gravity do the last of the work. As the Luxray's head sunk into his predator's throat, the cat pulled his arms in instead of forcing the Mightyena to swallow them. All he wanted to do now was curl up and fall asleep... He tried not to think about what would happen to him as the last of his body was deposited in the Mightyena's stomach. Tried not to think about his limbs dissolving... becoming fat to fuel this disgusting predator. Soon, the cat's misery was mercifully ended as the lack of oxygen caused him to pass out for the last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The newly fat Mightyena smacked his licks while rubbing his huge belly, which was already beginning to digest his unlucky meal. The gluttonous dog started to waddle back into the forest he had come from, happy with the results of his first hunt. He was one of the first of the infected, but certainly not one of the last. Many more victims from this city, from everywhere, would be eaten and digested just like that Luxray, and the world would be thrown into chaos...</span></div></div>",

The smell of fire and smoke choke your senses, even though this is just a memory, this one is vivid enough to cause you physical pain every time you recall it.  You remember running with your mother, a sweet Espeon, away from the village you called home.  Suddenly, something wet and slimy shoots out from behind, and wraps around her ankle, pulling you both to the ground.  You turn around, desperately trying to pull her away, and look up as you see what is dragging her, an extremely large Politoed, and now that you think about it, his large shaft sliding out of the slit between his legs told you what was going to happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour being so young meant that your mother was jerked away from you pretty easily, and she looked up to you, giving you the object she was holding in her other hand and trying to push you away.  \"Koyuki, you have to take this, and you have to run! I...I'll be right behind you!\" That falter in your mother's voice as her lithe body is dragged into the frog's reach told you that she wasn't about to be able to follow up on that promise, and you fell back, crying out, and landed right on your butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed burned an image into your mind that would remain until the day you die.  Which could unfortunately be sooner rather than later.  Regardless, you could do nothing but watch as your mother was brought up in his hold, her C cup breasts bouncing, and he moved his tongue from her ankle up to her chest, licking them over, and tearing off her slightly singed clothes.  It was a beautiful lavender dress, designed to accentuate her fur color and stunning amethyst eyes, eyes that were now closed shut, but a tiny moan escaped from her lips as the mindless toad took advantage of it, shoving his tongue into her mouth, which made her scream into the flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swear that he looked up to you with his soulless purple eyes with a smirk, a small whimper coming from you as you tried to crawl back.  Then he thrust his throbbing, disgusting looking cock into your mother's slit, making her scream even louder as he pounded her relentlessly.  With his tongue already wrapped around her stomach and boobs, it made it really easy to open his huge, toothless mouth, and wrap it over her head, as she writhed and tried to fight back, but the best she could do were some weak kicks with her back legs, and pointless thrashing with her tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like an eternity, but in reality, it only took the male a couple of minutes to groan loudly, and pour his seed right into your mother's womb, and then tilt his head back, slurping down what was left of your mother.  You looked on as she slid down his throat, and became nothing more than a lump inside of his stomach, squirming inside, which was making you sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't really have time to think of that though, because he has now turned his attention to you, and opened his mouth wide, showing you where you'd end up as well as his tongue fired out at you and-!</span></div></div>",

You've been on a journey this last year, trying to find the source of this infection to do what you could to stop it.

Taking a swallow to gather your thoughts, you stand back up to your full height.

He seems like he can hardly believe what he was seeing.  \"That's-! It's one of the Relic Weapons!\" Without warning, he reaches forward and snatches it up, observing it closer, turning it over in his paws a few times.  \"This crest...you're a Kaiser.  What happened to your mother and father child?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a pain you hadn't felt in quite a while, and the images of your mother in her...final moments flashes in your eyes once again.  \"Mom...she got...eaten...I dunno what happened to dad though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your name?\" He continued, while you felt a soft paw on your shoulder, glancing to see that it was Kenshi's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a breath before responding, \"Koyuki.  Koyuki Kaiser, mister Milo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Milo will be fine.  So...Alfwin is gone hm? I heard he'd gotten married, but I didn't know he had a child.  I lost touch with him 12 years ago...which must make you about that old, right Koyuki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded in response, \"11.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have much to tell you child, of a time long before this accursed infection.\"  You watch as he kneels down and reaches into an old bookcase, \"now where is that dusty old thing...ah! Here it is.\"  He pulls out what seems to be an old, and very dusty book, which he blows off and sets on the table, taking the last chair, opposite yours.  \"Listen well Koyuki, because while this has nothing to do with the infection, I believe that the key to beating it lies in here.\"  When you gave him a nod and he thought you were ready to pay attention, he began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long ago, Arceus, of course, created the world as we know it, everyone knows this story.  What most Pokemon don't know is that not all of us were as we look today.\"  He shows a few pictures of what seem to be more feral versions of the ancient Pokemon, and then something...odd.  It looked kind of frail, and naked, furless Pokemon.  But they also wore garbs, like some Pokemon will.  There was also a picture of a...ball? \"We were once all feral Pokemon, and ruled over by humans.  Eventually, Arceus descended, and exterminated the humans, by melding our DNA together.  However, this didn't quite solve everything, in fact, in some ways, things got worse, with some inherently evil Pokemon using their newfound powers for...well...evil.\"  He turns the page, \"so Arceus chose 8 bloodlines that he found pure, and entrusted each with what is known as a Relic Weapon.  A bow with a never-ending quiver, a sword and shield, a battleaxe, a pair of gauntlets, a magical staff, a spear, an ancient katana, and finally, a scythe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pauses and looks to you meaningfully, \"the Kaiser family is in charge of the scythe, which is what this is.  And basically, the story ends with the 8 using their weapons to subdue evil, and this was thousands of years ago.  Now, I believe that you were destined to come and meet me, and you must go and find the other users.\"  The Swampert pulls out a map, placing it on the table, \"it will be a long, arduous, and dangerous journey, and I can only point out their last known locations.  Ever since this all started four years ago, I haven't been able to keep in touch with all of them, and some, like your father, I haven't talked to in even more years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he finished, one question kept nagging at you, \"are you one of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilo laughs good-naturedly, shaking his head, \"oh heavens no.  I'm of the bloodline that wrote this book, so I'm more of a...historian, as it were.  I can show you how I remembered your father using this though.\"  He handed you back the...scythe you guessed, and then opened a trapdoor.  \"Go right down there, I'll join you in a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you said, staring down into the slightly dark basement, and climbed down the ladder, with Kenshi above you.

The first thing, you noticed, is that it was pitch black in here, until a pair of lights on both sides suddenly activated, making you yelp and cover your  eyes for a moment.  When you opened them, you looked back to notice Kenshi had flicked on a switch with a sheepish smile.  \u201cWhoops, sorry Koyuki.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d you reply, walking out into the room and then hearing some large and heavy descending the ladder next, the Swampert joining the two of you as promised.  \u201cSo\u2026I guess the first thing I need to know is how you use this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilo regarded that for a moment before shaking his head, \u201cunfortunately, I don\u2019t know any of the details, because as I said, I\u2019m not one of the chosen.

I\u2019m sure with a girl as pure as you; your scythe will be quite different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tilted your head, scratching the back before shrugging, \u201cokay\u2026I\u2026think that makes sense.\u201d  Holding the rod aloft, you close your eyes, thinking of a basic scythe.  Then, as if coming from your heart, a ripple washed over that image, blurring and changing it in ways that felt natural, as if you had always known what this would look like.  And perhaps you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in your hands, the rod was extending, as if by magic, and when you opened your eyes, the top shot out into a curved blade.  The wind around you swirled with snow, which turned into white rose petals, and almost instantly, the weapon\u2019s color flashed to white, and a light blue blade, but a very light gradient instead of a harsh contrast like your father\u2019s apparently was.  Looking around, you wondered where the petals came from, until you realized that the scythe wasn\u2019t heavy like you thought it would be.  On the contrary, it was nearly like a feather.  \u201cWow\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilo couldn\u2019t contain his smile, \u201camazing, simply amazing.  You\u2019re even more of a natural than your father was young lady.  Well, you have a bit of hard training ahead of you, and I\u2019m sad to say, we don\u2019t have a lot of time.

You blush and turn away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell are you thinking? You chastise yourself, shaking your head roughly, now isn\u2019t the time for this!

Closing your eyes and concentrating, you could hear something that sounded like light splashing, accompanied by low grunts and...moans?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed nervously, gripping your scythe's handle and circling slowly, ready to leap in if Kenshi was in trouble.  What you saw was surprising, and it took a moment to process.  Kenshi snapped your dumbfounded staring, of him sitting at the edge of the pool and jacking himself off.  At least, you think that's what he was doing, evidence of this being what he was moaning.  \"Nngh...Yuki...I can still go faster...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning away, you meant to slip away before he could notice, until your nose collided with the hard crystal, eliciting a short and pained yelp.  \"Who's there?! Y-YUKI?!\" A splash drew your eyes back to him, the young boy stuttering as he turned to you, \"what're you doing here?\" You could tell he was trying to act calm, though his voice was cracking.  He was probably hoping you didn't see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Um...you were taking a long time so I came looking for you...\" You answered, gripping your arm and averting your gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hot blush on your cheeks must have been noticeable, because Kenshi moved on to trying to explain himself.  \"I-It\u2019s not what it looks like, I was just...um...sorry...I'll head back to camp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" That shout surprised him as much as it did you, because he froze instantly.

He nodded, slowly, dumbfoundedly, barely murmuring an 'okay' in response.  Before you disrobed though, you spun your finger in the air, \"that doesn't man you can watch pervert!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden outburst caught him off guard, but you could tell it made him relax, since he was giggling as he turned around.  Unable to stop from smiling yourself, you pulled, well, it felt more like peeled, off the dirty shirt, and then took off your pants and filthy panties.  You made a note to yourself that these needed to be washed somehow, probably when you get to the next town, and slipped into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shock of the cold was very pleasant to you, being an ice type, though your body was warming up when you said, \"okay, you can turn around now.\"  You were fully submerged to your neck, and everything below would be lost in the shining water thanks to the gentle waves.  \"This is really nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour remark was met with a shy nod, even with your body hidden, he was having a hard time making eye contact.  You giggled and poked him on the nose, the sudden motion making him squeak and fall back, flailing and splashing wildly before he was able to right himself.  Retaliation wasn't expected, but he jumped at you and took you both down into the water while you were laughing.  \"Kya! Kenshi! Get offa me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just laughed in response, \"no way, this is my reve-...\" Both of you froze when you gelt something...stiff...and hard poke your inner thigh.  Kenshi cried out and quickly pushed away, blushing and averting his eyes.  \"Ah! I'm really sorry Yuki!\" You could feel the blush on your own cheeks, and it only heated up as you drifted over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy froze when you took his hand, \"I-it's okay Kenshi...\" You swallowed, despite the fact that your throat was getting really dry, and leaned forward until your lips were planted on his.  His eyes widened, but you both closed them simultaneously, heightening your awareness of his tongue, stroking along yours gently, and moving to explore your mouth while your saliva mixed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft squeak escaped your lips when you felt him squeeze your ass, though he immediately withdrew and pulled back.  \"Ah, s-sorry, I'm moving too fast aren't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and pressed a finger to his lips, \"I just wasn't expecting it.  Go ahead Kenshi, I'm all yours, I love you...I wanted to tell you that, but I was scared...until that incident at the swamp.  Even though I'm chosen, that doesn't mean something couldn't happen to us, so I wanted to tell you while I still could.\"  It was as if someone opened a floodgate, once you started speaking, you just went along with whatever came to your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gripped your sides and pushed you against the back of the pool, before pushing you up.  \"W-We shouldn't do this in the water.\"  You only nodded numbly, watching him climb out of the water, and you could tell he was trying not to stare at you.  But you couldn't blame him, considering your eyes became nearly glued to his wet, and stiff, cock.  You could feel his eyes scanning over you, as if he was actually feeling along your dripping wet naked body with his hands.  Looking down, you saw that the fur on your small breasts was clinging to them, and your bluish nipples were poking straight out.  Even lower and you could see that your virgin slit was on display, but before you could think much more about that, he grabbed you again and shoved you a little roughly against the crystal, but still gentle enough to make sure that you weren't hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slides his paws down until he could hook them under your thighs, and pulled you up.  Getting the hint, you wrapped your legs around his waist, feeling the tip of his cock brush against your pussy while he leaned forward and started giving you another passionate kiss.  You realized why, as he started pushing forward, stretching your tight tunnel with his actually fairly thick cock, until he poked against something inside of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nipped your bottom lip before thrusting forward, until his growing knot slapped against your entrance.  A mixture of pain and pleasure, fueled by your ecstasy, coursed through your entire body, but after a minute or so, you began to adjust to his girth, and nodded while he just played with your tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenshi must have noticed your nod, because he started thrusting, quite hard and fast, your moans mixing together inside your mouths.  Without the pain, the pleasure was all you could feel, and it was hazing your mind with pure lust.  He started groaning, and his knot was going into you more and more, stretching you out until it fully slammed in with a loud wet pop.  Both of you screamed, muffled by each other's lips, and a hot liquid filled you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour kiss was finally broken, and you were both so tired that you just stared into his eyes, both of you unable to do much but pant.  You just now noticed that your arms were around his shoulders, until he pulled you off the crystal and laid you both on your sides on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll have to wait a bit,\" he whispered, to which you answered by simply nodding.</span></div></div>",

He also seemed to linger longer than any other part when he started massaging your small breasts, making it difficult to bite back a moan.  After a few minutes of that, you both climbed out, got dressed, and headed back to your camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenshi must have been getting comfortable with the idea of you being a couple, considering he laid down and gestured for you to join him.  There was a moment of hesitation, but it melted away when you set your head on his firm chest, lulled to sleep by exhaustion and the sense of protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night passed peacefully, though besides your internal clocks waking you both, you had no way to tell if it was morning from inside the cave.  \"Morning Yuki,\" Kenshi says after you both sit up and stretch, then surprises you with a sudden kiss.  You giggled, before getting to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, ready to get going?\"  He gives the thumbs up, and takes your hand before taking the lead.  Kenshi sure is seeming more confident lately, not that you minded.  You walked for what you believed to be about thirty minutes before you could see the literal light at the end of the tunnel.  When you stepped out, you were showered with bright sunlight, an indication that you overslept and it was at least noon.  You pointed to a small village, fortified with a high wood wall, \"that must be it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approached, an arrow suddenly whizzed past your head, which you responded to by whipping out your scythe.  A voice that was too ambiguous to tell if it was male or female called to you from behind the closed gate.  \"What are your names?! Answer or I'll take you both out as infected!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey must have seen you from a distance, so they couldn't see your eyes.  You set the scythe to a more casual position at your side and placed a hand on Kenshi's tensed up shoulder.  \"Our names are Kenshi and Koyuki! We came to your village to look for someone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of tense silence followed, before the gate suddenly started raising, and you could finally see the source of the voice.  It was actually kind of confusing, he was a black fox, that you knew was a Zorua, about your age, but aimed straight at you was a folding bow that emitted a soft glittering emerald light.  \"Who are you looking for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held up your own relic, \"I was sent to find a Zoroark that had a bow described to be a lot like the one you're holding...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bit his lip, with a twitch of his tail, the flicked his head, \"come inside then.  Dad told me you'd probably be coming.\"  Tilting your head, and shooting a sideways glance to Kenshi, you sheathed your scythe, took his hand, and followed the mysterious boy inside.</span></div></div>",

A couple more and it will probably be splinters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause, probably the Baron letting that sink in before he continued.  \u201cSo here\u2019s the deal.  Hand over the bowman and his offspring, and I\u2019ll bring the lot of you into my personal protection.  Refuse, and you this town becomes a buffet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no say in this choice, and was only able to look to Tanuki to see what he\u2019d say.</span></div></div>",

And he was unable to keep that smirk off his face  as he looked over the villagers.  Most of them were using shoddy, repurposed weapons, like pitchforks and hunting bows, with the exception of the two chosen children, you and Natsu, Kenshi, who used his fists, and Tanuki, who, though not wielding a relic, his bow still had exquisite craftsmanship and was obviously designed with combat in mind.  \u201cNow, you lot, throw down your weapons...and have the Godsbow and his kid step forward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps Natsu should have gotten rid of the bow earlier, since it identified him as Tanuki\u2019s son too easily.  Well, the fact that he was a Zorua was probably a bit of a giveaway.  Tanuki looks at him and sighs, nodding slowly, \u201calright, just leave the village alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both drop their bows, prompting everyone else to do the same with their own weapons, and with some hesitation, you followed suit.  The Baron seemed to give you a look, but it was gone by the time you noticed, and decided it was simply your imagination.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry, was that an order? You think \u2018cuz you\u2019re the self-proclaimed \u2018chief\u2019 of some backwater village that it gives you some power?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clicks his tongue with a scowl, \u201cyou need to learn your place...but that\u2019s alright, I just thought of a way for you to do so.\u201d  His scowl transforms into a haughty smirk as he lifts up his little, almost feminine footpaw.  \u201cLick it, peasant, and make it snappy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanuki growls, stepping forward and kneeling down to take it into his hands.  If it was you, you may have bitten it, but the Zoroark seemed to have more self control as he just licks the pad on the bottom.  The look on his face told you it really wasn\u2019t that bad, which made you wonder about this squirrel.  Just what kind of old-world conveniences did he have access to anyway? And for that matter, why were the ferals listening to him in the first place?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough.\u201d  He says suddenly, before landing a kick right into Tanuki\u2019s nose, and regretting it immediately when he realized the sound of bone breaking wasn\u2019t his nose, holding his foot and hopping around quite comically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to keep the sneer out of his voice, the fox just says, \u201csorry.  Was always told I had a hard head.\u201d  However, the Baron turns on him with the angriest glare his cute, pampered squirrel face could manage, and in a pained, high-pitched voice, screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think that\u2019s funny?! I see the other relic-wielder back there, and I was going to give you a chance to give her up too, but then you had to say something!\u201d A snap, and the docile ferals sprung into action, \u201cslaughter them all and WIPE THIS PIECE OF SHIT OFF MY LAND!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone tried to lunge forward for their weapons again, but with the foxes out of position, and everyone else not trained for real combat, only you and Kenshi were quick enough to react.  It was a flurry around you, villagers getting grabbed and eaten quicker than you thought possible, even for them, and you could only catch bits and pieces as you dove and grabbed your scythe before rolling to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large feral Pidgeot swooped in and grabs Tanuki by his shoulders, and pulls him to a nearby roof, never to be seen again, at least without being able to see through the avian.  \u201cDAD!! Hold on, I\u2019ll-!\u201d Was all Natsu could say, before a sinkhole opened beneath his feet, and a few seconds later, out jumped an Excadrill with a full, squirming gut.  The young and old men gathered to fight all went down even easier, calling for mercy for their wives and babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenshi was doing his best, punching off a Galvantula as it had lunged for you at the same time, trying to snatch you out of the air.  You gave him a quick nod in thanks, before springing over him and slashing through the closest feral, only now realizing this was your first real kill.  It was majestic, and beautiful, very different from the image you had in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour scythe impacts with the beast\u2019s chest, and makes a clean slice, its power activating and freezing the Grovyle solid before he shatters, leaving behind only powdery snow.  Not that you had time to think about it, since that was just one down, and turning to press your back against Kenshi\u2019s to face down the small army, only realizing now how hopeless your odds were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Baron steps forward, nearly reaching you before an Aura Sphere get shot past his head.  \u201cBravo kids, you\u2019ve done well thus far...but I\u2019m afraid this is where the curtain closes for you.\u201d  His fanged smile glints in the dying light of sunset, as he holds out his cane.  \u201cHow about another deal? If you throw down your weapons and grovel to me here and now, I\u2019ll let that boy go...but not you, my dear.  No, you\u2019ve been deemed too dangerous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t even make the choice before you feel a rush of wind, the Riolu blowing past you with charged fist raised for the squirrel.  \u201cI won\u2019t let you hurt her!!\u201d There wasn\u2019t even time to react, to try and help, to do something before the Baron deftly sidesteps him and jams the cane right into his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I gave you a chance, now you both die.\u201d  With a laugh, he sends electricity through the weapon, which you realized must have just been made to resemble wood, since the jolt flowed so easily through it, electrocuting Kenshi and sending him flying back to the feet of a drooling Rhydon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, your body caught up with your eyes, but rushing at the Pachirisu only seemed to be accelerating your doom, now that you could feel first-hand how wide your gap in experience was.  A Thunderbolt crackled through the air, making your fur stand on end, shooting out of the end of his cane and paralyzing you on impact, stopping just inches short of killing him and you just crumpled to the ground in a twitching heap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother snap, and the Rhydon must have decided to grab Kenshi, using him as the sound of slapping and screaming you\u2019d grown so accustomed to echoed in your ears.  \u201cHe\u2019ll make a good soldier once he\u2019s evolved, but our Lord has decreed you die...and your little toy will make a nice proof of kill for me to collect on your bounty~\u201d  Claws from ferals you couldn\u2019t see tore away your clothes, pulled away your scythe, and held you up in front of him, you could only barely muster the strength to glare at him.  But he just smiles as he walks forward, pulling off his pants to reveal a cock that, while small compared to something like, say, the Rhydon, it was certainly much more than you\u2019ve ever handled before, since it was the soon-to-be infected Riolu that\u2019s been your first and only.  \u201cNothing to say we can\u2019t have a little fun first.\u201d</span></div></div>",

However, that was nothing, compared to the impossibly wide, gaping maw in front of you that your head was quickly crammed into.  You\u2019re reminded of how you once saw a squirrel stuff its mouth full of nuts, with its cute, puffy cheeks.  This was certainly a hell of a lot less cute as he just abuses you to get off like a toy, more concerned with using his tongue to taste you, and stuff more of your body into his mouth.  In the darkness, all you could see was how this must have looked to a bystander as an anthro Glaceon girl disappears into the Baron\u2019s mouth, cheeks bulging out with your form pressing against the thin skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince all he wanted was to get off as quick as possible, you were at least relieved when the cream shot into you, electricity shooting into your body and making you lose control.  You could feel him laugh as the stream mixed with his cum to become quite a messy puddle on the ground, before you\u2019re stuffed in completely.  This was probably what a stomach felt like without the burning...and it\u2019d almost be relaxing if it wasn\u2019t for the circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t much longer, though felt like an eternity, of him using his tongue to wrap around you, tasting you, rolling you around in the tight space, before a swallow reverberated around your body and drags you into his throat with one motion.  You cry and whine weakly in your short trip down, the muscles of his gullet contracting and squeezing your body the entire way, making you wonder if perhaps you\u2019d be crushed to death before you\u2019d even get there.  No such luck though, but at least you were close to passing out as you emerged with a loud squelch i to a pool of burning acid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, even the pain would dull, and you\u2019d fall into a final sleep\u2026.your eyes closing, or maybe they were already closed.  It was so dark that it made it impossible to tell.  Not that you really believed in such things, after the coming of this world, but some part of you still hoped you would get to see your mom and dad in the afterlife.  Yes...you could feel yourself drifting as your fur probably dissolved\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a literal jolt fired off from the stomach lining and into you through the hyperconductive acid, forcing you back awake.  You were still able to scream, much to the Baron\u2019s delight.  \u201cOh no no no, the sweet release of a quick death is too good for you babe.  This will be slow, and I\u2019m going to make sure you feel all of it.  That\u2019s just the price of your defiance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he meant that, the electricity kept your heart and mind working even after you were mostly gone, until finally, not even that could keep you alive.  Outside, Kenshi's infection was complete, the dazed, violet-eyed Riolu standing up with cum dripping out of his asshole, and all of the ferals worked together to clear out the small village until nothing but splinters and tattered clothes remained.  A content squirrel rubbed his fat gut and laughed, \u201cmaybe I can finally get that promotion now, getting rid of two of those pests...but better safe than sorry, we march on the next location at dawn!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Once turned, you could see both Tanuki and Natsu pulling back on their bowstrings, letting their arrows fly into the Zweilous.  Judging by its shriek, it must have been a direct hit, but you didn\u2019t have time to look back and see the damage with the Shiftry barreling down at you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenshi kicked off at the same time, fists glowing with aura energy as you whip your scythe out.  The Shiftry shot a Razor Leaf at you, but your recent training and experience kicked in, letting you dig your heel in and pivot, spinning around them to dodge.  Before he had a chance to retaliate, you twirled once more, utilizing the built momentum to strike him clean in the side.  The feral\u2019s eyes widened in...fear? An expression you\u2019d never seen the beasts make before, but before you could contemplate the implications of that, ice began forming in the wound, creeping over his entire wooden body before it shatters in a flurry of snow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hardly had time to take it in as a cry from behind caught your attention, turning back to see Kenshi holding one of the dragon\u2019s jaws back with only his paws, but as strong as they were, they\u2019d be no match for the other one closing in! With a deep breath, energy concentrates in your mouth, firing out to strike the head square in the eye before it has a chance to bite the Riolu, and distracted him enough to turn the tables, slamming the jaw shut and then delivering a wicked uppercut!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zweilous roars at Kenshi, while you run up on his flank, forcing him to split his attention between the two of you.  Kenshi hops from foot to foot, holding up his fists and ready to strike once again.  You both exchange a look, tense and waiting for the dragon to make a move.  The feral seemed to be unsure of what to do with two opponents, before finally barreling full tilt at Kenshi with mouths open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you created a blind spot for him, and the second he rushed past you, another Ice Beam fired out of your mouth before you had time to think, hitting his legs and making him slip just before he could hit Kenshi.  This gave the boy enough time to swiftly maneuver around him, and with a couple of well-placed Force Palms, the dragon crumples.  You sigh with relief, eyes trailing over to see the Pachirisu fending off the Zoroark\u2019s bow strikes with his cane, apparently electrified judging by the sparks shooting off with each strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn\u2019t prepared for Natsu to sneak around behind him, and deal the finishing blow as an arrow whizzed past and dug right into his arm, making the Pachirisu scream in agony.  But it was cut short as Tanuki landed a wicked strike to his skull, making him fall unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the square looks around at each other, before triumphant shouts echoed throughout.  The villagers held up their pitchforks, tools, and some even had brooms! You smile and join in the revelry, thrusting your scythe up, while Kenshi just pumped his fist.</span></div></div>",

You, Kenshi, and Natsuki were seated at a large table, with Tanuki of course being at the head.  What food the village could spare was laid out before you all in a mouth-watering spread.  You licked your lips, the smell of wild game filling the air, arrayed out on serving dishes with bright fruits and vegetables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of this reminded you of your old life as the daughter of a noble, though the tastes were more...untamed than you remembered.  It helped you keep the tears in check, and bury the memories of your father and mother under the mountain of food.  ...It did strike you as odd though, as you scarfed down that Tanuki hadn\u2019t so much as lifted a finger.  He just sat there, watching you all...no, his eyes were more distant...like he was looking at something far off in the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis concentration was broken when a couple of villagers set a large platter in front of him, and you swore a wicked smirk crossed his lips for a moment.  The music that some of the villagers were singing and dancing to got noticeably quieter.  You could now hear the muffled noises from under the cloche, and the slight clattering, alerting you to the fact there was definitely something <i>alive</i> in there! The chef, you presumed, was an Emolga, wearing a stained white apron, and she pulls off the cloche to reveal a familiar face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Baron, now trussed up and naked, surrounded by various berries and vegetables, and as much as you didn\u2019t want to look, you were pretty sure there were some stuffed into his ass as well.  It was impossible to ignore the apple forced into his jaws though, since he was trying to say something around it, and you were sure it wouldn\u2019t be very appropriate.  Tanuki stood and clapped his hands, bringing the din of chatter to a stop, clearing his throat.  \u201cMy people, we managed to survive another ordeal this savage world has thrown at us.\u201d  The crowd cheers, before he waves to silence them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd now, we embrace the new law of the wild.  I will consume this stuck-up prick.\u201d  You were taken aback for a second as everyone watched in stunned silence as the Zoroark gripped the now screaming Pachirisu\u2019s head, and pulled him up into his gaping jaws.  His tongue splattered drool all over the squirrel\u2019s face, but though his expression was full of anger, you just realized his cheeks sparking! However, his discharge of electricity seemed to do nothing to deter Tanuki from shoving his head into the back of his throat, making you stare in confusion for a moment before you realized he\u2019d transformed himself! Sparks danced off his own body, blue lightning bolts traced along his sides and nullifying any attacks the Pachirisu tried.  Hell, you could swear you heard the fox <i>moaning</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Baron was a small morsel compared to the tall Zoroark, slipping easily into his gullet with rapid gulps, his body restrained cleverly by edible leaves so everything could digest without any trouble.  His squirming body disappeared down Tanuki\u2019s gullet in minutes, the last part of him being that thrashing, sparking tail, before he could no longer be seen.  Except for that bulge in the Zoroark\u2019s gut, which got noticeably less forceful after he belched from his large meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone, including you, slowly returned to their own meals, but it killed a lot of appetites it seemed.  After the feast was done, you were pulled aside by Natsu, with Kenshi, while the fox boy spoke in a hushed tone.  You only just realized he was carrying a few robes in his arms, \u201chey, as thanks from the village, and because my dad said so...we\u2019re gonna head up into the mountains to the hot spring for...a bath.  We\u2019ll also be making you two some new clothes, yours...um\u2026\u201d He glanced from you, to Kenshi, and back.  \u201cOne could barely be considered clothing and...yours probably haven\u2019t been washed in a while, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush hotly, looking away and nodding begrudgingly.  \u201cHey, it\u2019s fine! It\u2019s not like there are many good places around for laundry anymore.  C\u2019mon, a bath in these is great for the spirit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nV - V - V<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you walked away from the village, up the mountain path, towards where you came from originally, before splitting off to head deeper.  It was a bit treacherous in the dark, but you did have to agree that this was safer from any ferals wandering the area, because while you couldn\u2019t see them, they couldn\u2019t you either.  And with Kenshi\u2019s aura sight and Natsu\u2019s dark vision, you were able to navigate with them leading, gripping tight onto you boyfriend\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you made it, Natsu supposedly transforming into some kind of a fire type and shooting a nearby torch to help light the area.  By the time you looked back though, he was still in Zorua form.  You shrugged, and stepped towards the pool, glancing back at the boys, \u201cum...can you both turn around?\u201d They exchanged a look, Kenshi nodding, though the Zorua gave you a puzzled look before complying as well.  You sigh, and strip out of you old, musty clothes, only now conscious of the fact that they indeed reeked...especially your panties, as old and torn-up as they were.  You discarded everything onto a rock off to the side, and dipped your toes into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hot temperature took your breath away for a moment, before you eventually plunged your entire body into the spring to let it envelop your body.  \u201cOkay...you both can come in now.\u201d  From the sounds of clothes shuffling, you could tell they were stripping as well.  Or at least, Natsu was, since Kenshi just had his loincloth.  He joined you soon after, leaving just the fox.  Kenshi glanced back, before gasping and looking away quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh geez, you\u2019re-!\u201d You tilt your head in confusion, looking back before your eyes took in his full, naked, black-furred body.  The gentle bump on the chest, and the small hood of a vulva between their legs though...told you that you\u2019ve had QUITE the wrong idea about him! Or rather, <i>her</i>!!</span></div></div>",

And especially after...the infection..or whatever it was.  It\u2019s not really much safer though, we\u2019ve watched the ferals.  They\u2019re...indiscriminate\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you sat in silence for a long time, only the sounds of the gently lapping water on the sides to keep you company.  But as the hot water seeps through your fur, and into your skin, you could feel more relaxed as the dirt and grime is washed away.  \u201cIt\u2019s okay Natsu.  I mean, I\u2019m a girl, and we\u2019ve seen you fight, so we\u2019d still love to have you on the team.\u201d  You finally say, getting an affirmative nod from Kenshi as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu smiled and bowed her head gratefully, \u201cthank you, I won\u2019t let you guys down! ...Oh, and in case you were wondering, Natsu is short for Natsuki.\u201d  She added as what seemed like an afterthought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just giggled and then held your hand out, the others catching on and placing theirs on yours.  \u201cFrom here on out, we\u2019re a team.  We\u2019ll watch each other\u2019s backs, and no ferals will ever beat us!\u201d With a splash, you all lift up your arms, and smile to your partners.  Your friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter drying out and dressing in the robes provided, you carried your clothes back down to town with Natsu and Kenshi following behind, handing it to someone for washing so you could head to Tanuki\u2019s and finally get a good night\u2019s rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nV - V - V<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later, you and Kenshi got up, sharing a bed as the Riolu\u2019s surprisingly strong arms did help you get to sleep easier.  There was an attack the day before, but you were able to confidently kill or drive away the pack of ferals with an emboldened crew of villagers, with Tanuki leading the defense.  You stretch and roll out of bed, smoothing the wrinkles of your new sleeping gown out, before disrobing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was another thing you\u2019d noticed, being even more comfortable than before around Kenshi.  The villagers gave you both clothes to sleep in, as well as some new travelling clothes.  You pulled on the tanned, colored cloth and leather tunic on, noting that it certainly offered you more protection than before, while still maintaining a light quality.  The cloth areas were dyed a brilliant sky blue, with matching pants.  Kenshi had something similar, getting up and pulling off his light cloth sleeping pants, and tossing on the dark blue tunic and pants.  \u201cIt still feels a little weird wearing clothes like this\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just giggled and headed downstairs to meet up with Natsu, and eat a quick breakfast while making final checks on your supplies.  Eventually, you\u2019re standing at the gates, with what feels like the entire village out there to see the three of you off! A twinge of jealousy plucks at your heart as you watch the Zoroark and Zorua exchange goodbyes with a long, tight hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all turn to face the outside world, setting back off on the path to the next destination, a castle town about a day and a half journey that you were informed about by Tanuki.  It was ruled by a family of Delphox and their line, a monarchy that shared the name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaldimer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~ <b>END PART 1</b> ~</span></div></div>",

This was the name of the Kingdom Koyuki and her friends were now heading towards, not realizing the danger, the all-out war that they\u2019d be walking into.  But much like any rebellion, uprising, there is a beginning to this story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs mentioned, Galdimer was ruled by a monarchy, the king and queen both being Delphoxes.  They had three children, the oldest a Braixen girl, another Braixen son, and finally Lucy, a precocious young Fennekin.  Because her siblings Gina and Julien were the first-born, they were tasked with the more heavy-handed tutoring about how they would one day become the rulers.  This left the third-born in an interesting situation, she still received the tutoring, as she was still a princess, but she was also free to pursue other things.  And after meeting the court mage, an apparent descendant of a hero, decided she wanted to study under him.  This wasn\u2019t for completely unselfish reasons, however.  When she was younger, she came across the Captain of the guard and his son, a Raichu and Pikachu respectively.  The boy was around her age, and they hit it off almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis name was Zach, and he was his father\u2019s squire.  Much like Antonidas, his father Gilliad was a descendant of the heroes as well, possessing the sword Caladbolg.  For much of their childhood, the pair were inseparable, but when teased about Zach\u2019s possible future as royalty, they would both just blush and wave it away.  They were both devoted to their respective studies, young Zach learning the sword from his father, and Lucy the ways of magic from the older Luxray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued pretty much uninterrupted, until a few days after she turned 13\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Six Months Ago from Present Day</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a day much like any other, or at least, it was supposed to be.  But the princess was awoken earlier than normal by a very flustered looking Greninja.  One of the oldest and most trusted butlers...she sat up, rubbing her eyes in confusion.  \u201cWalter, what-?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo time princess,\u201d he interjected rudely, but before she could say anything, he was already rushing back to the door.  His grandson was there as well, a Murkrow through breeding later down the line, thanks to the boy\u2019s father.  \u201cHurry and dress, we\u2019ll be just outside.\u201d  He takes Kelan and pushes him back out, closing the door behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill very much puzzled, but sensing the urgency, the Fennekin rolls out of her large bed, slipping out of her silk nightgown and running over to the wardrobe.  Inside was some princess robes, as well as mage robes, which she pulled out along with her small birch wand.  Thanks to her upbringing, they were of top quality of course, and she runs over to the door.  \u201cOkay, what\u2019s going-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain she was cut off, this time by a scream from down the hall\u2026before it appeared.  A Nidoking rounded the corner, more massive than any she\u2019d seen before...and there were a pair of legs sticking out of its mouth! She only noticed its shining violet eyes when he turns his hungry gaze to them, slurping down what could be assumed to be a maid since she could catch some black cloth near their ankles before it disappeared.  \u201cA...A f-feral...here...in the castle\u2026?\u201d She asked in a whimper, stepping back with her ears laying flat against her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes princess.  We don\u2019t know how, but they\u2019ve infiltrated the castle...they\u2019re running amok in the town...there might not be anything left soon, but I will at least get you out.\u201d  The Greninja states, holding out his arms and forming twin water shurikens.  \u201cKelan, you know the way to the cellar.\u201d  Kelan\u2019s eyes widen, about to protest, but the Nidoking was now barreling down on them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yes grandfather!\u201d He shouts before turning and grabbing Lucy to pull her out of the way, while Walter leaps over the Nidoking to throw them down, causing the feral to roar as the shuriken smash into his back, throwing him off-balance and plowing into the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGO!!\u201d The shout electrified the children, who both take off down the hallways! As they run past different rooms, they could see all kinds of scenes in the corners of their eyes.  An infected knight raping and eating another of the maids, another knight being swallowed up into a feral\u2019s cock, and unfortunately this causes some hesitation in Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Wait! What about my family?!\u201d Kelan stops and turns with a frown, shaking his head and grabbing her wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrincess Lucy...they were in the throne room together, and the invaders stormed in there almost immediately.  The only reason you were overlooked is because you slept in and no one could say anything about it before the attack began.\u201d  He explained, as calmly as he could, but all of those words were just crushing the poor girl\u2019s heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as much as the Feraligatr that just smashed Kelan in the head, sending him crashing into the wall and reeling for a good few moments.  In her weakened and frightened state, Lucy turned to the beast, drool dripping from its fangs as the small foxy morsel quivered before him, weakly holding out her wand and shooting out an Ember from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flames did nothing to slow it down, hell, it wasn\u2019t even fazed in the slightest as it smacks the wand out of her handpaw, the force of it knocking her flat on her ass, the young mage staring up in horror as she was sure her life would end in those slavering jaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLightning Sword Flash!\u201d There were two voices, and all she could feel was the static that made her fur stand on end, a literal flash of something crossing her eyes before the massive feral fell over backwards.  A familiar paw crossed her vision, and a voice that made her heart flutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucy! Are you okay?!\u201d Zach! She gripped his hand tight, pulling herself up with his help, and embraces the young boy...though he was slightly older than her, by a couple of months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZach! Oh Mew, I\u2019m so glad to see you!\u201d Lucy was basically crying at this point, before she looks around and notices a couple of faces that gave her hope.  \u201cGilliad! Master Antonidas!\u201d The latter Raichu gave her a terse nod and ran past them, to see if anything was still in the area, or at least, any immediate threats, while Antonidas was assisting Kelan back to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Lucy.  I wish circumstances were better, but unfortunately, we don\u2019t have that luxury,\u201d he explains quickly.  \u201cLet\u2019s get you kids out of here.\u201d  The aging Luxray picks up Lucy\u2019s wand, now splintered, frowning at it a bit, before shaking his head and handing it to her.  \u201cIt won\u2019t do much as a magical focus now, but it\u2019s probably better than nothing.\u201d  Now reunited, the five set off on their path to the cellar, dispatching ferals with the combined might of the Captain and the Archmage.  Lucy, Zach, then Kelan all descended into the cellar, with the adults following behind.  Antonidas was bringing up the rear, and wasn\u2019t ready when something suddenly whipped around his ankle, causing him to fall forward on the stairs, his staff flying out to the rest of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one could process what was happening before the elder Luxray was dragged out of the doorway! \u201cGilliad, keep the kids sa-!\u201d And he was gone...leaving only silence...before something could be heard slithering against the floor, a massive shadow clouding the dooway.  Gilliad growls and turns to face it, whipping his head around to the teens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe wine bottle on the third shelf, fourth from the left.  Pull it and run through the secret tunnel.\u201d  Zach wasn\u2019t even able to call out for his father, before the Raichu charged forth, obscuring their vision with a shower of lightning.  Lucy picked up her master\u2019s staff, feeling a surge of energy through her paws...but...it was only a little more powerful than her old wand.  Something was off about this, it was supposed to be one of the legendary weapons! Especially when she watched her master use some truly powerful magic once\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelan, following Gilliad\u2019s instruction, hurriedly pulls on the bottle with a resounding click and whir as the hidden mechanism sprang to life.  The shelf swung open on a hinge, while the sounds of a fierce battle raged outside.  Zach was about to run in with his wooden practice sword, but Lucy grabbed his wrist and shook her head.  \u201cZach...I know how you feel but\u2026\u201d She paused, choking on her words as tears shined in her eyes.  \u201cWe\u2019d only...get in the way...and I need you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused and sighs heavily before nodding, running into the tunnel with her just as heavy footsteps clomped about outside! Together, the three pulled it shut, but they would probably need to get moving quickly, before they burst in with pure force! Lucy took a deep breath, grabbing a torch from the wall and lighting it up with a quick puff of flame.  Her, Kelan, and Zach all exchanged a look, before taking off down the secret escape route.<br>\r\n</i></span></div></div>",

With ferals about, it was incredibly dangerous to be sprinting headlong into the darkness like this, but they couldn\u2019t be sure that they hadn\u2019t been spotted on their way in.  So they had to risk it...until eventually, they reached the end.  The Pikachu looked around and found a sconce mounted to the wall, which had transitioned to wood a few meters back.  A ladder reached upward into yet more darkness, but they had little choice.  \u201cI\u2019ll head up first.  I can see in the dark.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach and Lucy turned to look at Kelan, but before either could protest or say anything about it, the bird was already a few rungs up.  The squire sighs, drawing his iron sword, thankful that he\u2019d earned it just a month ago, and pointed towards the direction they came from.  The air was tense, before Kelan\u2019s voice called down.  \u201cCoast is clear guys!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy\u2019s ears perked up, and she ran straight over to the ladder, gripping onto it and climbing up a couple of rungs.  \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be right behind you.\u201d  The Pikachu said from below her, giving her a smile before turning back to face any oncoming threats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut none appeared, and soon all three were sitting inside of an abandoned house.  All things considered, it was pretty well furnished, and quite spacious.  Lucy started to walk around, running a finger along everything to find that they were also kept clean, only a thin layer of dust settled on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA scream from outside caught their attention, Lucy running back downstairs while the boys shielded her.  But instead of the usual noises, the voice yelled, \u201coi! Where do you think you\u2019re takin\u2019 me?! Mitts off you ugly fucker!\u201d They were...female? It was hard to tell, since their tone was so harsh, but Kelan opens the door to see a Skuntank feral pushing along a Ponyta towards the town square.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three exchanged confused looks, \u201cwasn\u2019t that a feral? They eat first and never ask questions, right?\u201d Lucy questions, closing the door behind her.  \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly one way to find out,\u201d the young squire replied, taking her paw and walking after the feral and the probably girl, with the Murkrow trailing behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they approached, a grand, but hissing voice could be heard.  \u201cMy dear sssubjects...well, I guess I should first introduce myself.\u201d It was a bit hard to see over the heads of the giant crowd gathered already, with more streaming in, but one could just make out the one on the stage.  It was a Serperior naga, and a ridiculously huge one as well, at least 15 feet long from his head to the tip of his tail.  That stage though...it used to be used for executions before Lucy\u2019s father outlawed the practice.  It left an ominous pit in her stomach though, as she watched the naga slither back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Ssarlin, your new king.  Or at least, I will be soon enough.\u201d  He chuckles darkly, flicking out his tongue, smirking as he tasted their collective fear and confusion.  \u201cAlright men.  Bring out the prisoners!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of larger Pokemon, both clad in darkened armor, one a Dragonite, the other a Luxray, led four cloaked figures onto the stage.  The heavy iron of manacles could be heard, before Ssarlin laughs, slithering over to one of them, cupping their chin and tilting their head up to meet his eyes.  \u201cStill got some fire there...good, that makes it all the more fun to snuff it out.\u201d  He grabs the cloak and whips it off, revealing a bruised and battered Delphox, with a crown perched upon his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king.  Lucy\u2019s father.  She cried out, but so did others in the crowd, so it was masked by them, \u201cI care not what you do to me.  But let my family, and my people, go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSsarlin just blinks, before throwing his head back in a raucous laugh.  \u201cOh! That\u2019s rich!\u201d He turns away, before his tail whips around and strikes him right in the gut, leaving him to gag and fall to his knees, drooling in pain from the thick muscle.  \u201cYou have no idea what\u2019s about to happen, do you? But allow me to demonstrate.\u201d  The serpent now goes over to the next in line, pulling the cloak to reveal another Delphox.  She was in even worse shape than the king, and Ssarlin made it clear why as he grabs her by the ear, lifting her up off her feet.  \u201cThis bitch had already taken my cocks, but she seemed to enjoy it quite a bit! So how about another round, your majesssty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put extra emphasis behind the last word, literally spitting in her face as he tears away the last bits of clothing from her body.  The crowd could only look on in horror as he pulls her down, pressing her face against his slit, and using her snout to get him off, before his twin cocks emerged.  Switching his grip to under her armpits, he lifts her up, leaning in to get another taste of her face with a quick flicker of his tongue, before his jaws suddenly widen and clamp down on her head!! Her tail fluffs out from the shock and suddenness of the action, while he thrust his coil upwards to spread apart both of her holes in one fell swoop! The other two on the stage, still with their hoods drawn, were confused as to what was going on, but it was easy enough to tell they they were the prince and princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSsarlin faced the audience, most watching on in disgust, but none brave and/or stupid enough to do anything about it.  Most of those who would have had already been devoured, or turned into more ferals.  So he continued with the show, pounding the queen\u2019s ass and vulva, right down his throat as he took small, but powerful gulps.  Her regal body was drawn further down, reduced to little more than a barely visible bulge squirming down his throat, before the snake hissed sharply and unloaded his cream into her.  He wrapped his lips around the tips of his dicks, literally sucking her hips off of them, before her legs and tail share the same fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, the king was quite distraught by this, crying out for his wife even as she disappeared into the naga\u2019s gaping maw.  \u201cELARA!! YOU MONSTER, I\u2019LL ROAST YOU ALIVE!!\u201d  He smacks his lips, sliding up to the king and striking his hand out...only to snatch away the crown and place it on his own head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSuch violent words, that\u2019s basically treason.\u201d  He chuckles, tongue sliding out and rubbing at his gut.  \u201cAnd we all know the penalty for treason.\u201d  His stomach groans as if in response, before he finally pulls the cloaks off of Julien and Gina.  \u201cAnd I\u2019ll change it slightly...not only will you die...so will your entire pathetic family, until there are no others to stand in the way of my rightful rule~\u201d The serpent places a hand on the Braixen boy\u2019s cheek.  \u201cMaybe they\u2019ll even make me one of the Shitennou.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe takes Julien\u2019s paw and presses it against the small mound just above his still-very hard cocks.  \u201cFeel that boy? It\u2019s the former queen.\u201d  It took a moment for that to sink in, but just as his face contorted in pain and sorrow, his hands were pushed into something else.  Those penises, pulsing before gaping open to swallow up his arms! Everyone was stunned, but before he could scream, he was already being slurped in by the head!! The prince didn\u2019t last nearly as long as his mother, swallowed down to his chest in seconds by the ravenous shaft.  Using a couple of vines, he pushed up on the boy\u2019s legs, pressing his feet around the lower one for some pleasure.  But it wasn\u2019t meant to last, as the boy was swallowed into the shaft, resting somewhere at the base of his dicks to be digested into more cum.  He needed the refill after all.<br>\r\n</i></span></div></div>",

Before she hit the ground though, a vine caught her...right around the throat.  \u201cOhh no.  I have a special treat planned for you my dear.\u201d  Gina whimpers hoarsely as she was drawn closer to his engorged meat.  Anything could have happened.  She could be forced into the other cock to join her quickly softening brother, whose cries could still be heard through the thinner flesh.  \u201cSay ahhh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft with no choice, she opens her lips as wide as she could, but that didn\u2019t stop her jaw from getting broken as the same shaft that swallowed her brother was now being shoved down her throat! Everyone was so wrapped up in this, they didn\u2019t even notice a feral Quagsire sneak up behind the king until he was pushed down on the stage.  There wasn\u2019t even foreplay or anything, the older male not used to anal play screaming out in pain as he was stretched out.  \u201cOh, how the mighty have fallen...and you\u2019d better not eat him.\u201d  Ssarlin commanded, proving he had some kind of a power over these...creatures.  Both master and mind slave continued to pound into their respective targets, the girl gagging and crying as pre that would remind her of her brother\u2019s scent continued to leak onto her tongue and down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they both finished simultaneously, the Luxray approaching and breaking the bonds on the king with his sword before the naga does the same for Gina.  \u201cThere.  As long as neither of you commits another crime...I\u2019ll let you live.\u201d  He tosses the bloated, sputtering girl, filled with her brother\u2019s essence, away from himself, turning his attention to the Delphox.  Gina clearly wasn\u2019t thinking straight, trying to crawl over to her father, unable to even speak from how much cum was spilling out of her throat.  But then she froze suddenly, as he got up, as also leaking seed, glaring down at her.  With hungry, purple eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer scream was gargled as he pounces on her, the feralization renewing his stamina and increasing his power, holding his daughter down to ruthlessly tear into her virginity.  This display made Lucy sick to her stomach, and gave her a very real look at what it meant to be a feral.  This wasn\u2019t her father anymore, this was a wild beast.  No longer the kind man who loved his friends.  His family.  His people.  All he desired now was to sate his lust and his hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take very long, stopping in his pounding of the young cunt to fill it with his hot, royal seed.  Just when she\u2019d think the worst of it over though, she quickly realized the horror was only just beginning.  The king grabbed her ankles and pressed them together, dragging his long canine tongue over her soft, pampered pads.  Especially with one of her upbringing, they were supple, and delicious, if the former king\u2019s growls were amy indication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally managed to cough up enough of the snake\u2019s goop to whimper and beg to him.  \u201cF-Father...please...come to your senses!\u201d He didn\u2019t even hesitate, wrapping his maw around her feet and swallowing rapidly, already working down his precious daughter\u2019s legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy just continued to watch on, stones in her stomach while she watched her father fill his own with her sister.  Sure, they didn\u2019t always get along, or see eye-to-eye, but in the end she was still family! This incident, as the Braixen presses her paws futilely to the Delphox\u2019s snout, taught Lucy a valuable lesson.  A feral was no longer the same person.  They were just a beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo wrapped up in her thoughts, she hadn\u2019t even realized that he finished his meal until he belched loud enough for everyone gathered to hear.  \u201cBWAAARP!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, how unsightly your majesssty.\u201d  Ssarlin interjected with a laughing hiss as the fox\u2019s stomach bulged, the girl inside obviously trying to kick and struggle her way out.  But the groans and motions fell quieter as the snake continued.  \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know about you all, but that was clearly rape and murder.\u201d  He leans in, flicking his tongue on the king\u2019s face, before he strikes suddenly, swiftly.  The bulge was a bit of a challenge, but eventually the entire royal family padded the serpent out in various ways.  \u201cAnd now everyone knows their place.  Get to work, my loyal \u2018subjectssss\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns to slither his way to the castle, before pausing and turning back.  \u201cOh, and if a feral is hungry...I decree that the life of the one nearest is forfeit.  Have a good day.\u201d  Laughing, he ignored, or rather reveled in, the screams as some ferals grabbed people on the edge of the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy was just pulled along by the Pikachu, numb to the world.  But this was the spark.  A revolution was born, and over the next few months, they would gather a couple more allies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the turning point would come in the approaching cold, dark winds, six months later...<br>\r\n</i></span></div></div>",

There was something curious, ominous about the way that the level of destruction seemed to rise the close you got to the castle town.  Surely, that was backwards, but it definitely wasn\u2019t your imagination.  An increased frequency in ferals accompanied it, making your journey more perilous than it should have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, your band of three came to the town nearest to the castle, known as Ymir.  The signs of the reinforced gate and stone walls being blown open by some kind of a great force.  You exchanged a look with them, then brandished your weapon, alone with Natsu, while Kenshi\u2019s fists glowed with aura.  Whatever did this could still have been here, even though this doesn\u2019t look recent.  But you had to investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you ran to the edges of what remained of the heavy iron gate, the stones on either sides held up only by lucky placement.  With you and Kenshi on one side, and Natsu on the other, you swivel your ear towards the town.  It twitches from the thrumming of your heartbeat, having to take a couple of deep breaths to calm it before you could fully concentrate.  It was...quiet.  A deathly silence hung over like a cloud, revealing no signs of life.  This meant no ferals...but the chances there were any survivors was...slim at best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a heavy sigh, you motion to Natsu that the coast was clear, before, on a silent count, you and Kenshi roll in front of the entrance.  What your eyes beheld, your mind almost couldn\u2019t comprehend.  Ruins, not a town, stood before you.  Carefully, you and your companions pick your way over the rubble into the destroyed village.  No.  It used to be a city, some of the buildings apparently stood taller than any that you\u2019d seen to this point, some even reminding you of the mansion you used to live in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dull throb pinged in your chest, but you quickly shake it off.  Now wasn\u2019t the time to think of home, just like this town, it was gone.  You all froze when you heard a noise, a low, deep rumble, from behind the wall of one particularly destroyed home.  Luckily, the wall that was there had windows, and you all slide over to it, to look at the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was impossible to tell if this thing was a feral or not, but the size of the Flygon on the other side, slumbering away, was a pretty clear indication.  You were faced with a dilemma now.  Do you just leave it alone, for it to continue on its probable warpath? No.  Your morals wouldn\u2019t allow it, and especially not after meeting the people of the last town.  Images of them fleeing, screaming in fear as it swoops over with other ferals to devour and defile the populace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour grip tightens as your resolve hardens, but now it was just a matter of what to do.  You could probably dispatch it with a single good blow, but if you messed it up it might be too late to get Kenshi and Natsu\u2019s help before something happened\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you can\u2019t mount a surprise attack with all three of you, but maybe Natsu could lead it into an ambush if it were awake and chasing her.</span></div></div>",

Kenshi, you follow-up in case something happens, and Natsu will provide support from the rear.\u201d  As you quietly approach the sleeping beast, you whip out your scythe, your ears perked and listening closely for any signs of the Flygon waking up or stirring.  When it seemed like the coast was clear, you gripped tight before leaping into the air, the blade swung back behind your head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe position was a vulnerable one, as you found out, when the Flygon suddenly spun its massive body to smash into your gut with its tail!! All of the air was driven out at once, and you could feel a couple of ribs crack as you were driven into the ground, the dragon now standing to its full height to cast a looming shadow over your broken body.  Your ears rang from the intense pain you were in, only barely able to make out the shouting of the Riolu nearby that seemed to grab his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wheezed, trying to tell him to run, before you saw a sphere of energy collide with the Flygon, who used his wing to block and dissipate the attack with ease, before he opened his mouth to charge up his own blast.  Arrows whizzed by, some sticking shallowly into his hide, but otherwise having very little effect on the dragon as he continued to charge up.  With an intense pressure, the torrent streamed out, much wider than any of you could have anticipated, turning your head just enough to witness the Riolu and Zorua get blown away.  \u201cKENSHI!! NATSU!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got your second wind back, sucking in air desperately, before a claw gripped around your back.  He easily lifted you from the ground, dangling as you could hardly move your limbs before you\u2019re tossed up into the air.  The world spun around you, but one thing that stuck out was the side, gaping maw, that lunged and snapped up your entire body, enclosing it inside the dark, hot, humid space.  It was already hard enough to breathe, but getting tossed around by his tongue, which wormed its way under your clothes to make you blush and whine, was making your efforts nearly impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he must have tilted his head back, to swallow your body, folding it in on itself to nearly break your spine as you slid backwards down his throat.  There was some kind of movement outside, as you could see some light peeking through before the throat muscles swallowed up your vision as well as your body, but the voice was unmistakable.  \u201cLET ME GO!! I\u2019LL RIP YOU OPEN AND GET KOYUKI BA-Gmmph?!\u201d The voice became more muffled as the archer was probably chomped down upon as well, but you could hardly think about that as you finally landed in the unforgiving draconic stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nV - V - V<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nThe small morsel hardly lasted more than a few minutes it seemed, but the Flygon was uncaring as he plucks up the last of the little band.  The Riolu certainly had more fight in him left than the other two, but it did him little good as he was whipped into the ground a couple of times, and then swallowed like the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby, a silhouette perched on the wall of one of the destroyed buildings, having caught only the tail end of the conflict.  \u201cWhat a horrible way to go.  If only I\u2019d gotten here sooner\u2026\u201d The figure sighs, shaking his head, and flies off while the dragon curls back up to rest off the small feast.<br>\r\n</i></span></div></div>",

As soon as he\u2019s in range, we\u2019ll surround him and take him out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed unsure for a moment, before nodding and pulling out her bow.  While she positioned herself, you and Kenshi took back off down the empty street towards the chosen ambush site, stopping on either side of the door as you pull off your rod from your belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick nod to him, he pushes open the door and dives in first, with you close on his heels, tumbling and extending the scythe, ready for battle if there were still some stray ferals.  Much to your relief, it was just as empty as it seemed, so you could both take your time making your way up the stairs.  \u201cDo you think this\u2019ll work Yuki?\u201d The voice came from behind you, still hushed as a precaution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt has to,\u201d you replied, a bit more bluntly than you originally intended.  \u201cThat beast will kill so many others if we don\u2019t do something about it...I can\u2019t just leave this be...you\u2019ve seen what it\u2019s done here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYuki...I unders-\u201d He started, before the horrid sound of a dragon\u2019s roar sounded out, so powerful it shook the very building you were both hiding in! A look was exchanged between you, before you bolted up the stairs.  From the sound of it, Kenshi was close on your heels as you both tromped up the rest of the way, before stopping at two different windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown in the street, Natsuki had taken off in a dead sprint, but the only indication of the dragon were the powerful wingbeats and the shadow that felt as if it nearly engulfed the entire town.  She stops and does a quick turn on her heel, nocking back a few arrows and screaming at the top of her lungs.  \u201cCOME AND GET ME DIRTBAG!!\u201d  Whether it understood her or not, she let them fly, sheathed in dark energy to the point where the force of it pulsed out at you as it flew by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must have made contact, since the next thing you heard was a shriek of anguish, and the massive green dragon swoop down in a blur, nearly knocking you off your feet as it passed!!  The Zorua tried to leap back, but it fired out a Dragon Breath that she must not have been expecting, since it grazed her as she tried to change trajectory, causing her to fall back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon\u2019s intentions were clear, closing in on the girl now with maw open wide! \u201cNATSU!!!\u201d You scream, jumping without thinking, aiming for the dragon\u2019s back with your scythe held over your head!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A black shape flitted past the corner of your vision past you and the dragon, grabbing Natsuki and pulling her to safety in the nick of time.  Flygon was s only able to scoop up a mouthful of earth, angrily spitting it out and roaring just as your blade connected with his wing! He shrieked in pain, beating them a couple of times to shake you off, sending you flying back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat same shape flew behind you to catch you, a few black feathers fluttering before you.  Kenshi dove down after you had, slamming his flaming aura palm right into the top of the dragon\u2019s head, sending him reeling for a few moments before a few more arrows hit his chest.  Eventually, he manages to shake the Riolu off, prompting the mysterious flier to stop his descent, while the Flygon finally takes off into the air, unsteady because of ripped wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d You shout, charging energy in your mouth, firing it with the stranger holding you from behind, the recoil making you both slide back a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?!\u201d They shout, the voice pretty clearly male, but he didn\u2019t let go.  The attack connected with his other wing, the creature uttering an otherworldly shriek as he plummeted to the ground.  A cloud of dust billowed up upon the impact, the Flygon unable to do anything to slow its descent.  A few tense moments passed, but the corpse just laid there, motionless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of you exchanged looks and sighs of relief, allowing you to see that your rescuer was a Murkrow boy, probably around your age.  He was dressed in light, black leather clothes, with a pair of daggers strapped to his belt.  You bow, the others following suite, and Natsu adds a quick \u2018thanks\u2019 in there for good measure.  \u201cThank you for your assistance\u2026um?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKelan, and it was no problem.  But what were you all doing trying to take on that massive dragon?!\u201d He exclaims, making you shrink back a bit with ears folded.  \u201cYou three have a death wish or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bite your lip, shuffling uncomfortably on your feet.  Hearing a growl from your right, you hold up your arm in front of Kenshi, shooting a glare at the avian.  \u201cWe wanted to make sure that beast wasn\u2019t free to cause anymore havoc.  Like he did in this village.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raises a brow at that, crossing his arms with a click of his tongue.  \u201cSo it was justice? Alright...come with me.\u201d  As he turns to walk away back to the entrance, you follow uncertainly, making a point of staying between him and Kenshi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere?\u201d You ask after you pass by the fallen gate.  He just chuckles, looking back over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGaldimer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nV - V - V<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was just beginning to sink into the horizon behind you as the great stone walls came into view.  However, before you could see what was happening at the gates however, Kelan veered you all off to the side.  He came up to what looked like a boarded up sewer entrance, stopping and looking around with a hum.  \u201cCoast\u2019s clear,\u201d the Murkrow mumbles under his breath, before pulling aside a couple of the loose boards.  \u201cAlright, everyone in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimace, looking inside the dark, damp tunnel, \u201care you serious?\u201d He just stares at you, and after exchanging a look with Kenshi and Natsu, you crouch down a bit and crawl inside.  You pull the hood over your head to keep your ears from brushing against the roof of it, covered in Arceus knew what.  You were thankful for your pretty thick leather boots as they splashed in the shallow\u2026\u2019river\u2019, before you came to a split in the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Kelan guided you all from the rear, instructing with quick, sharp \u201cgo left.  Now right.\u201d  And other such instruction as you made your way through the labyrinth, before a sudden, \u201calright stop.\u201d  You hadn\u2019t even noticed that you\u2019d passed under a grate, before the bird reaches up and pushes the loosened cover off and hops up out of the sewer, leaving you all to follow up after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally get pulled up thanks to the help of your two friends, he slips it back over, and looks around.  You were in a back alley behind a few houses, completely shrouded in darkness and out of sight.  This was all really strange...why were you all skulking around anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat train of thought was interrupted when you heard something lumbering at the entrance of the alley.  It came into view, and you grab your scythe, ready to whip it out, when you saw the glowing violet eyes of a Croconaw!</span></div></div>",

Before Kelan could even give the signal to run, the black armored knights surrounded you all, trapping you in the alley.  \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA more decorated guard, a Poliwrath displaying his higher rank, stepped forward and brandished his sword to you.  \u201cPut your weapons down.\u201d  At the command, you all had no choice but to throw down your weapons.  However, Kelan had different plans it seemed as he threw his daggers at the knights and spread his wings for take-off.  The head guard knocked them down easily with two slashes of his sword, pointing the blade at the ascending avian.  \u201cArchers!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo arrows whizzed over your heads, slamming into his winged arms and pinning him to the building with a cry of pain.  \u201cNow.  In accordance with the laws passed by King Ssarlin, you have been found guilty of murder and..attempted evasion of the guards.  You and your accomplices are sentenced to death.\u201d  His smirk became cruel when he glances up at Kelan upon saying \u2018attempted\u2019, before he and the other guards close in on your group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, that was a feral! We\u2019re here to save the city!\u201d You protested, but it fell on deaf ears as the captain pressed the tip of his blade to your throat, drawing a bead of blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSave it.  Your sentencing has been made and will be carried out.\u201d  He replied coldly, before he makes a practised swing, slicing your clothes apart from the front to expose your body, a thin red line forming where metal met flesh.  You almost couldn\u2019t process what just happened, even as the searing heat of pain bloomed from your chest, and you tried to cover yourself up before he grabs your arms and slams you into the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYuki!!\u201d Kenshi screams, rushing in past a couple of approaching guards to land a solid punch on the Poliwrath, knocking off his helmet in the process.  He didn\u2019t need weapons to fight after all! But when he makes the grab for your scythe, reverted back to its compact form, he\u2019s knocked away by a couple of guards using their shields to crush his body between.  \u201cGah-ck!\u201d You could almost hear the bones crunch from the impact before he falls over, wheezing with a trickle of blood leaking from his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the other guards had already put his weapon away, and was busy stripping Kenshi when the Poliwrath picks you back up by your throat, holding you high enough that your toes only barely reached the ground, and you could only whimper and make horrible choking sounds as you look down at him through tear-filled eyes.  \u201cWe can add resisting arrest to your list of charges.\u201d  He growls, wiping at his mouth, staining his gauntlet red before he slugs you in the stomach, driving more of your precious air out before he drops you to leave you a crumpled heap on the ground, choking and hacking desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly crushing your ear, he picks you back up, sitting you against the wall before he pulls your clothes off from the front.  You dazedly look down at your stomach with a groan of pain, noticing the darkening purple spot from the bruise he inflicted.  He grips your hair and pulls back to make you look up at him, before he sticks his mouth over yours! \u201cMPPH! MGH~?!\u201d You screamed, unable to even bute as the thick muscle pushed back your tongue, and slid down your throat.  His undoing of his belt went unnoticed until he was sticking his thick cock up against your exposed slit.  You tried to kick your legs, but his thighs were far too strong for even your boots to make much of a difference, while he continued to passionately kiss you, unwilling as you may be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby, Natsu and Kenshi were already stripped, one of the guards even shouting, \u201chey! This one\u2019s a girl!\u201d Almost instantly, she was pressed between two large males, ramming their juicy dicks into both of her lower holes, while she moans and screams from pain and undesired pleasure.  The one who pulled off Kenshi\u2019s clothes was a Nidoqueen, apparently one of the few females in the guard, but it was obvious from the way no one stopped her that she wasn\u2019t to be trifled with.  She rode the poor Riolu\u2019s smaller shaft, while another of the guard\u2019s raped his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all of that was unseen to you, and you could barely even hear it with your head already shoved down the Poliwrath\u2019s gullet, when he suddenly widened the kiss to engulf your muzzle!  \u201cMRRRPH?!\u201d His esophagus was so tight that you couldn\u2019t even form words, while his large rod tore open your slit, your naked body quickly vanishing into his body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some deliberation, the two slamming Natsuki came to a decision, letting the Electabuzz start swallowing her while his partner came in her ass.  After wringing a couple of orgasms from the Riolu, he was eaten feet first, while the Nidoqueen took the one fucking his face instead, finding him far more pleasurable.  But at least the young boy tasted good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Poliwrath finishes by pumping your womb full of his slightly watery, but still very thick and very voluminous jizz, before you finished the trip into his stomach! Your face burns, still unable to say anything as opening your mouth only filled it with his vile acids.  You cough and sputter, trying to spit it back up, but it was already burning away the inside of your mouth and throat, eating away at your tongue! You hardly registered him licking over your bare feet, the boots having been slipped off at some point, before closing his mouth over them to end with a final gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenshi was ingested quickly, thanks to the Nidoqueen\u2019s size, and while it took a bit longer for Natsu, it wasn\u2019t much more as the Magmar shot her down into the Electabuzz\u2019s gullet, wiping his scalding cock on the bottoms of her feet.  As the captain stood back up, gut filled with a weakly squirming Glaceon, he looks and smiles at Kelan.  \u201cWell well.  the king\u2019s going to want a word with this one.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i><br>\r\nThis was too easy.  That was the only thought running through the Braixen\u2019s mind as the small group of teens made their way through the familiar walls of the castle.  Ever since Kelan disappeared a couple of weeks ago, you all had to get a bit more daring, and while you had a couple of close calls, you finally managed to enter Ssarlin\u2019s stronghold!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasy or not...this was it.  You were going to take back your family\u2019s throne! A quick glance at the Pikachu running at your side, exchanging determined nods, when you all stopped at the door to the throne room.  You took a deep breath, gripping tight to your master\u2019s staff, before you all worked together to push open the large, heavy doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, there you all are.  Right on schedule.\u201d  That voice, it was unmistakable, especially the way he hissed his \u2018s\u2019es.  \u201cI was ready to eat your little friend here just from how bored I was getting.\u201d  The naga stood tall, someone wrapped in his vines as he looked over the group.  \u201cYou all have been such a thorn in my side, but thanks to Kelan, I\u2019ve learned everything I needed to.  How shocked I was, to learn the leader of the so-called \u2018Resistance\u2019 was actually the sole surviving heiress to the Galdimer line!  Lucy, correct?\u201d You just growl at him, your eyes flitting to the trapped avian, showing signs of having been tortured, and toyed with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet him go!\u201d You shout at him, looking back over your shoulder to a hooded Leafeon boy.  \u201cRansel, heal him when we get him down!\u201d He nods, nervously gulping and clutching his wooden staff.  \u201cEveryone else, I\u2019ll back you up with magic.  CHARGE!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach, the female Ponyta, and the male Lairon rushed forward at the \u2018king\u2019, before they were stopped short by the Dragonite and Luxray from before, when your family was executed.  They slashed at the Lairon and Ponyta, while the Pikachu continued to run at the serpent!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLiz! Seth!\u201d You concentrate flames at the tip of your wand, the red jewel on the top shimmering as flames shot out of it.  Liz parried the Luxray\u2019s blade with her small blacksmith hammer, while the dragonited slammed his greatsword into Seth\u2019s shield.  The Luxray leapt back to dodge the fire, shooting electricity at the Ponyta, striking and pumping volts through her body that made her scream and fall.  The dragon, however, shrugged off the attack easily, forcing the Lairon onto his knee with a grunt of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Leafeon boy took off, reaching his hand out to the Ponyta, before the hilt of a sword was viciously slammed into the back of his skull as the Luxray rounded on him.  In the ensuing chaos, you didn\u2019t even realize that Zach had gotten locked in combat with a fully armored black knight, sparking as he swung his steel blade angrily.  \u201cWhere did you get that sword?! THAT WAS MY FATHER\u2019S!!!\u201d  You needed to calm him down, get this situation under control somehow, summoning flame into the jewel adorning your staff and blasting it at the Luxray! \u201cLiz, we need to take him out quick to help Seth!\u201d She groans, nodding as she unsteadily took a fighting stance, while the lion simply slashes through your magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run up towards her, brandishing her hammer once again as she glares at your enemy, twirling the heavy weapon in her fingers with ease.  With a subtle nod, she leaps forward, using it to smash into the lightning bolt he fired, before crossing it with his blade, while you charged more fire, sending out four wisps of it around her to strike at his back! However, he proved too much of a match, sliding out of the lock and then spin-slashing your flames and knocking Liz back off her feet once again.  You hardly had time to react, as another arc of electricity shot forth from his free hand, striking you dead-on in the chest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything around you exploded as whiteness filled your vision, flying back a couple of feet as your body seared with pain, before your head collided with the cold marble floor! You didn\u2019t know how long you were out, but you groan and sit up, sight restoring slowly as the blurs around you took shape...into your worst nightmare come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz was lying flat on her back, obviously twitching as electricity coursed through her body, her legs already down the lion\u2019s throat, her thick thighs creating some distinct bulges in it.  He was kneeling, with his dick\u2019s tip rubbing up all the way up her warm back.  Had you been out long enough for him to have his way with her? She was already disrobed, her breasts hanging free and sagging down onto her chin as he rapidly swallowed past her wide hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething caught your attention to your left, seeing the Dragonite with half of the Lairon sticking out of his maw, and quickly vanishing into it.  However, the thing that really caused alarm was what you could see right down the middle, the naga sitting on the throne with a bulge in his throat, and a familiar yellow tail twitching wildly just outside his closed lips.  The black knight stood motionless next to him, with Zach\u2019s sword laying on the ground in pieces, before he gulps to finish him off.  \u201cN-No\u2026\u201d You weakly whimper, tears blurring your eyes as you stood up, grabbing your staff and sprinting head-long at the serpent at full tilt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing mattered anymore, you could no longer think of strategy, or tactics, your actions fueled, clouded by little more than raw emotion.  Vines shot out at you, knocking away your staff and completely dissipating the magic you were building up! They wrapped around your wrists and yanked you forward off your feet, smashing your body into the floor, before he whips and repeats a couple more times, then lifts you up to look him in the eye, your body bruised and broken as it dangled before him.<br>\r\n</i></span></div></div>",

He grabs your ankles, a vine pulling up your robe to reveal your underwear, spreading your legs apart as he slowly leans in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No! Stop! I\u2019ll kill you!!\u201d You shout at him, to no avail, doing your best to squirm and get away, to conjure some flames to finally roast him once and for all! But without the staff, you could emit little more than sparks out of your fingertips, before he bites and tears away your covering, leaving your furry slit totally exposed! \u201cNOOO!!\u201d Your cry reverberated through the room as his tongue slithered into you, making you curl your toes and moan despite yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm\u2026\u201d He churrs before pulling back a little, a strand of saliva and your fem juice connecting to his tongue.  \u201cI see you\u2019ve already felt the touch of a male.  Was it the Lairon over there? The Leafeon passed out on the floor? ...The Pikachu I just dined on?\u201d He snickers as you flinch upon the mention of Zach, getting a wicked smirk on his face before he suddenly stands more, and pulls you into his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis scaly, clammy body chafed against your fur, before you felt something more...solid in there.  Your eyes widen when he says, \u201cgive him a kiss goodbye.\u201d You couldn\u2019t take anymore, tears falling freely now while he forced you up against the lump as it slid down.  You didn\u2019t even realize that he was actually lowering you onto his twin cock the entire time before they were digging against both your lower holes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black knight finally made a move at an unspoken command, shifting to grab his king\u2019s massive shafts and position them as you were forced down onto the spires, jolting you back into reality with a harsh tearing pain as neither your ass nor your slit could take his girth! As you open your mouth to scream, a vine slams in, pushing down your throat so that the only noises you could make were horrible gagging chokes, unable to even bite into the thick appendage.  He toyed with your body well past the point of breaking, permanently damaging your internal organs, shoving them about in ways they clearly weren\u2019t meant to, all for his own sick pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sense of time fractured, along with what you could only assume were your hips since your legs dangled and flopped about like a doll\u2019s with each thrust the snake forced into you.  But it was honestly hard to tell, with how numb you were getting, only registering any feelings again when seed filled up your womb and stomach! And it was coming up out of your throat, making it feel like his cock had been impaled all the way through!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpecting him to toss you away, your consciousness began to fade, vision going blurry as he hissed...something at you.  Something wet, and tight closed in around your toes as the realization hit you.  You were being eaten.  At least I\u2019ll be rejoining Zach...you thought, your mind dulled as the shaft slithered up your legs.  You could hear the snake moaning from all around you as-wait, that wasn\u2019t right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking, you forced your eyes to readjust, looking up to see the serpent as he flicked his tongue in your face, and a memory started to surface.  What happened to your brother? You couldn\u2019t bear to look, you knew exactly what was happening as you were squeezed around the hips now, and your belly quickly descended.  \u201cN-No\u2026\u201d You whimpered, before a vine wraps around your back and smooshes you against the lump of your dissolving boyfriend.  Hell, from the lack of movement, you had to assume the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get to have a tearful reunion my dear.  You\u2019re better off as nothing but my cum...honestly, that may still be too high an honor.  Be grateful.\u201d  He hisses, opening his mouth in front of your face to wrap up your head, tugging at your fur as he suckled while his tongue lashed against your face.  Your budding breasts were swallowed up by one of his dicks, the compression on your chest and his humid maw making it nearly impossible to breathe, but still you slipped away, until your head was pulled out, giving you a scarce moment of relief before it was lost into the shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nV - V - V<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of Leafeon feet kicked weakly outside the Dragonite\u2019s maw, while the Luxray licked over them before they were gulped up.  The remains of the princess were being processed in the snake\u2019s hidden balls, smirking as his servants seemed to enjoy themselves too.  \u201cHe has to make me a deva now.\u201d  He hisses with a laugh, looking over their spoils and seeing the ornate wooden staff.  \u201cOnce I send him this, and the sword.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then glances at the hanging bird, wondering what to do with him, before shrugging and letting him down.  \u201cYou deserve a reward, for helping make this all possible.  Take him to the dungeons, if he\u2019s lucky the ferals will,add him to their ranks and if he\u2019s not...well at least they\u2019ll get a nice chicken dinner~\u201d<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But it was just as it was flapping upwards, smacking you upwards, spiraling in the air a couple of times before landing hard on your back.  The air rushes out of you all at once, but a second thud nearby told you all you needed to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenshi had been slammed by his tail, while the Flygon scoops Natsuki off the ground along with a bit of the dirt road, trapping her in its maw before its wings beat again.  You watched helplessly as it lifted into the air, despite the tattered wing, and take off, the figure becoming smaller quickly as it flew away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly work you way up to your feet, staring after him dumbstruck, before tears started to stream out of your eyes.  Just like that, your friend was gone, most likely stewing away in the dragon\u2019s gut to fuel its flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nV - V - V<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was in the dead of night when you and Kenshi finally reached your destination.  As you approached the castle gates, a voice called out, \u201chalt! Who goes there?!\u201d The guards positioned on either side pointed their spears at the pair of you, prompting you both to put up your hands defensively, their dark armor glowing ominously in the torchlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found your voice after a few minutes, cracked with weariness and creeping despair, the first time you said anything since Natsuki\u2019s...disappearance.  \u201cW-We\u2019re here to see the king.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both look at each other, and even in your dazed state, you could tell something was off about the exchange.  \u201cSorry kiddies.\u201d  One of them finally said, pulling his helmet off to reveal the Herdier beneath.  And the other was a Girafarig, both wearing some indiscernible expressions.  \u201cHis highness ain\u2019t taking too many visitors, but you both happened by at a perfect time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you had a chance to ask, the canine lunged at you, grabbing you by your neck and forcing you onto the ground, while Kenshi took a kick to the head from the cloven hoof of the giraffe, sending him flying and knocking him out instantly.  What was happening?! Sure, the world was dangerous, you\u2019d seen that first-hand more times than you could count...but that didn\u2019t mean the guards of a supposed safe haven should be abusing travelers like this! His claws tore at your new clothes, leaving them in shreds, while the other guard more casually pulled off Kenshi\u2019s, turning him around in his hands like a ragdoll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attention was brought back to the dog though, working on undoing his trousers to free his hard, throbbing erection.  The shape reminded you of your boyfriend\u2019s, but far larger, and thicker, which was especially apparent when his tip was shoved against your slit, forcing them open far more than they\u2019d ever been! You thrashed and screamed, but even if anyone could hear, no one showed as he just presses harder on your throat, choking out the sound while forcing himself in further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby, a <i>PLAP PLAP PLAP</i> could be heard, as clearly the Girafarig cared little for their partner\u2019s gender as long as he could stick his dick in it and feel good.  But there was another sound, one you\u2019d become sickeningly familiar with.  A kind of slurping mixed with swallowing as it was clear the guard was looking for more than a good time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019d thought your tears had dried completely, but between the obvious peril Kenshi was facing, and the searing pain from the tearing of your pussy, you\u2019d found just enough.  \u201cAww man~ Don\u2019t cry girl, you feel real good.  But maybe I\u2019ll give you something to <i>really</i> cry about!\u201d He gnashes his fangs in front of your face, making you yelp and try to pull back away as best you could while he continued to bury himself so deep that his tip pushed against your womb and his knot kept forcing open your lower lips.  His jaws widen, flecks of drool falling on your face, mixing with the tears before he lunges down and forces your entire head into his distended jowls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt smelled <i>horrible</i> in there, something like old meat and decay, matting down your fur with both his humid breath and his tongue.  The muscle forced its way into your mouth to wrestle with your own, though easily overpowering it as he drank your cool, sweet saliva.  Moans leaked out of your throat, while his hot pre coated your tunnel, before your head is suddenly shoved back with an incredibly loud <b>GL-GLLLRP</b>.  His throat was so tight, it felt like the pressure was going to crack your skull!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision was just complete darkness, but you could feel your senses getting hazy, until his knot nearly popped inside! You could hardly get your jaws open in the confines of his gullet, only managing a \u201cMMMMH~!!?\u201d His thick, virile seed poured out into your womb, while he started swallowing more, dragging you along the dirt and upwards into his jaws, pricking at your young body with the points of his fangs, but careful not to cause too much unnecessary damage to his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before his cock popped out, and a torrent of cum pouring out with it.  He didn\u2019t seem to mind or care though, pressing his hands onto your hips to force you in ever faster.  Your face splashed into an already active stomach, the acids licking and burning at your fur and skin, while the rest of you was forced to curl up.  And you were sure that nearby, Kenshi was sharing a similar fate...but maybe he was at least knocked out.  Some part of you resented him for that, but it didn\u2019t lost long, replaced instead by an ernest wish that, if there were an after-life, you could both be happy there at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn\u2019t take long to find out with you choking and gagging on the foul liquids inside his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nV - V - V<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Somewhere on a far off mountain range, a massive feral Flygon landed on a shelf near the peak.  He looks around to make sure nothing would interrupt his meal, before poking and prodding at the little fox in his mouth, making sure she was squirming first in the dirt pile she\u2019d passed out in, before tilting his head back and swallowing.  Her screams were easily the best part of the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut maybe he could find the other two that tried to hurt him too, later.  They seemed to harbor a misguided sense of revenge when something like that happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is...unless something else got to them first.</i></span></div></div>",

But they were fast, a <i>swarm</i> of Primeape and Mankey ferals descending on the three of you all at once!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Natsu had no chance, as you both left your weapons next to your clothes, grabbed by no less than three of the monkeys a piece with large dicks and hands pressing against your body, your face.  You try to jerk away in vain, before a Mankey is propelled into the Primeape trying to force himself into your mouth with his tainted pre smearing on your lips.  \u201cHANDS OFF!!!\u201d Kenshi shouts, his hands glowing with his aura.  But while your tried to reach for your weapon, a Mankey grabbing onto your hips pulled hard, thrusting his cock right into your slit, the scream you made an invitation for the earlier Primeape to plug the opening with his dick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYuki!!\u201d The Riolu took a step towards you, before an uppercut right between his legs brought him crumpling to the ground, whining in pain before he was grabbed from behind.  They seemed not to care about male or female.  All they wanted was pure, carnal pleasure, to satisfy their beastly lust, as they plunged into both his mouth and asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsu was the least lucky, pulled up out of the water by her shoulders only to get a rod stuffed up her ass, and then another one in the front.  But your mind was already clouding over, the corruption creeping in and taking hold, maximizing the pleasure of all three of you!  The last thing you could remember was the feeling of the hot, sticky cum shooting into your womb and down your throat before the world started to wash out in a violet hue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nV - V - V<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The morning sun rose over the mountains, bathing the town in its light, with a Zoroark standing at the gate, tapping his foot worriedly.  \u201cWhere are they\u2026?\u201d He muttered, before the horn overhead blew.  Tanuki looks up, eyes wide, before seeing a sizeable group of feral Mankey and Primeape barreling down on their village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he raises his bow though, he catches a glimpse of who was leading the charge, and hesitated at just the wrong moment.  There was a Zorua, a Riolu, and a Glaceon, all with purple eyes, and the last one firing out an Ice Beam to freeze his hands to his bow, leaving him completely defenseless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey\u2019d just survived an assault yesterday, but that was the nature of this new world.

Before either of you could make a move though, arrows were fired from his other side, digging right into his scaly hide.  He shrieks in pain, prompting you to boldly rush in, holding your scythe behind you and ready to swing before a stream of energy barrels right into your chest and knocks you back off your feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed he was far more angry than hurt, and you were seeing stars for a second as you tried to work your way to your feet.  Your ears flinch at the sound of clashing wood, glancing sideways to see Tanuki and the Baron locked in combat.  The Pachirisu jabbed swiftly with his electrified cane, with the fox only just managing to deflect with his bow.  This distracted Natsu to try and line up a shot from behind the Baron, the bow in his paws flaring with the green glow.  A shadow loomed over him though, and you rushed forward to try and save him, not even realizing you\u2019d dropped your weapon as you try to stop the dragon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick swipe of his head crashed into your chest, knocking the wind out of you as his other clamped down over the Zorua\u2019s shoulders.  His screams were muffled by the thick, rippling flesh of the Zweilous\u2019 gullet, tossing the bow to try and smack at his face with an ineffective Ghost attack of Shadow Claw.  Another scream grabbed your attention, rolling with a groan to see Kenshi, his head buried in the Shiftry\u2019s massive cock!! \u201cKenshi!!\u201d Your cry was hoarse, before something wet and slimy wrapped around your boots, and you knew what it was before you even looked back over your shoulder.  \u201cN-NOOO!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t even kick at the strong tongue as it jerks you back, dulling your claws as they dug into the dirt, your feet getting crushed inside his throat as the boots were pulled off and slid into his powerful throat.  An array of sparks flew from your side, making you look at the horrifying sight of the Zoroark, the cane pressed to his torso, twitching and sparking as he fell over.  The muscle working its way up your legs and into your pants to slurp them right off, leaving your exposed hips to his mercy as he took his time to taste you in his maw! Unwilling, pleasured growls escaped your throat as the dragon continued to toy with you, until a climax rocked your young body, spilling sweet, cold juices all over his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feral almost seemed to <i>purr</i> in satisfaction before he gulped it, and you down.  Even though they weren\u2019t supposed to be intelligent in any way, this one seemed to know exactly what it was doing, as that tongue now worked its way under your shirt, splaying over your breasts and slipping it right off with continued gulps.  \u201cHold on.\u201d  A voice said, you only recognizing it as the Baron from what he said earlier thanks to your clothes now obstructing your vision.  After a hard tug, the Pachirisu pulls them off of you, but before you could say anything to try to beg for your life, he jabbed a finger to the side of your skull, sending an electric shock that scrambled your thoughts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s more like it, we don\u2019t want the feisty bitch to bite now, do we?\u201d He seemed to ask the feral, but all it did was continue to suckle on your chest and compress tighter on your body.  \u201cRight.  \u2018Tis a real shame I can\u2019t keep you, I have a feeling you would make for better conversation than this lot.\u201d  With a shrug, he grabs your stunned jaw, forcing it open before ramming his salty, jolting dick in your mouth, and started to relentlessly hump your face!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long, or at least you thought it wasn\u2019t, when he finished off, pouring his virile cream into you, pulling out with a quick wipe on your face.

His sac swayed extremely heavily between his legs, only the slightest lumps showing the Riolu within.

He yelped when she ran her tongue up the underside, making him shiver, falling back onto his ass and gripping at the edge of the pool.  Her expert techniques and the fact that besides his hand, he was a total virgin, meant that he came quickly, with a loud cry.  Her hand covered his mouth, not wanting to tip any other prey off as she crawls onto him, the Riolu's eyes gaining a tinge of violet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe positioned herself on him cowgirl style, and with a feral growl, went down on him.  Just as his cock was swallowed by the surprisingly tight slit, his mind was being overtaken with lust, panting and even reaching up to paw at her breasts, coming close to his second climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time he knew to keep himself quiet for her, managing to keep his moans low until he grunted and shot off into her again, as her juices leaked back down onto him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were walking up to the lake just as you notice a brilliant white glow, blinking as you knew precisely what this was, as you had gone through it yourself.

While he was quite a bit taller, and now had a spike in the middle of his chest that was poking at your shirt, and some small part of your mind told you that something else grew as well from when you\u2019d caught a glimpse of it before, this had to be Kenshi.  And he was infected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKenshi, it\u2019s me! Let go, snap out of it!\u201d Your shouts fell on deaf ears, as he grabbed your clothes in his powerful arm and started tearing it away until you were naked, besides your boots.

You cried out, trying to get him back to his senses, but that was quickly silenced when he shoved his tongue into your mouth.  There was a metallic tang to the taste of his saliva, but you had to admit it wasn't unpleasant, but you wished your first kiss could have been under much better circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis train of thought was interrupted when he pushed his cock upward into your exposed slit, causing you now to cry out in a mixture of pain and pleasure, writhing against his iron grip as he just continued to fuck you like a ragdoll.  It was so rough, and you chastised yourself for it, maybe because you were still hoping some part of him was Kenshi, but you knew your body craved more and more as he thrust.  You think you were even begging for it, but you mind was clouded, and you were being gagged by his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was careful not to fit his knot into you when he howled out around your head, the pitch making your ears ring, and he finally started taking his first gulps.  But the canine was nowhere near done, when you felt him pull out, you knew he was still hard, because his tip was pressing on your pucker.  You would have pleaded with him not to continue, but the intense pressure on your head was scrambling your thoughts, and making it hard to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn some ways though, this was a blessing, as he pushed in, inch by inch, it didn't hurt as much as you thought, because your senses were dulled by lust and the crushing muscles firmly wrapped around your head.  With each pump into your once virgin asshole, you think you could feel yourself slipping further down, a suspicion that was confirmed when he started slurping and licking at your small breasts, an indication that your chest was now sitting inside of his maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all really disorienting, especially when your feet left the ground, and his knot slammed as hard as it could into.  This feral Kenshi probably knew it would only fit partway in, so he came as hard he could, filling both of your holes now, and swallowing until your ass came off his knot with a wet pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that you could hear it, and you could really barely feel it, fighting to stay conscious as someone else grabbed your ankles and held you upside-down to feed you to your former crush easier, though you don't know to whom the hands belonged to.  Your head popped out into the gassy chamber, the acrid smell of gastroacids assaulting your nose until your head was dunked into a pool of them.  The pain was unlike anytjing you could imagine, and some part of your mind wondered if this was what it was like for your mother when she was devoured by that toad over a year ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps your pain was made worse by the fact that you knew the predator so intimately, and the acids eating into your face and flooding your lungs meant that, while your death was pretty quick, it was painful even until the last moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour footpaws disappeared into the Lucario, who had grabbed the Gardevoir and mounted her like the feral dog he now was, ramming into her ass with loud moans and squelches.  After this, the two would go on to raid the village, and with Kenshi's power adding to the might of a clan of ferals, they didn't stand a chance, even with the child of a legendary hero.

You grab and whip out your scythe, and you see Kenshi drop into a fighting stance at your side, but then next to the beast, a few more rock and ground types emerged, causing a moment of hesitation in your actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all he needed, hopping down from his perch to crash to the ground, sending a tremor outwards that threw you and Kenshi off your feet.  The rest of the ferals descended upon you both, most seeming to go after Kenshi, and fighting each other.  Most likely to see who gets the rights of either screwing him and/or eating him you realize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it did concern you that none seemed to look your way, maybe they were so busy with your partner that you could take the chance to get away? It left a sour taste in your mouth to think about, but it was important that you survived, falling her just wasn't an option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you heard Kenshi's scream, you felt something grab your ankle and hoist you into the air.  Your eyes widened when a huge cock slapped you in the face, and the hard green scales around it told you something.  The Tyranitar claimed you, and no one was going to fight him for the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou forced yourself not to open your mouth, since he was going to just silence you with the meat against your lips.  With his unsuccessful attempts obviously angering him, he changed tactics, grabbing and viciously tearing away your pants, revealing your dirty underwear that was cute at the point you bought it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA glance over to Kenshi told you what kind of deal they had worked out.  There were two, both flying types, now working away at their little trophy.  An Archeops was pounding him from behind, but outside of that first cry out, his screams became hard to hear.  And that was because he was getting fed into the gaping maw of a Gliscor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyranitar was quick to interrupt your line of thought though, shoving his thick, fat tongue into your tight, virgin slit, right through your panties, making you scream.  And that was the opening he needed, thrusting forward and forcing your throat open with his massive shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taste was highly unpleasant, like that of a salty rock, and tremors of pain were shooting through your body when the tip of his tongue pushed past your cervix.  Or at least, that's what you think was happening from how painful this was.  His throbbing dick was signaling his coming climax, something that up until now you had been lucky enough to not be on the receiving end of.  But you'd certainly seen it happen to enough others, male and female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't even realized his tongue was pulled out of you, until you felt it wrap around your exposed bare feet.  A shiver pulsed through your body, your mind screaming in protest that you should not be getting pleasure from this in any way.  Those feeling dissolved once you felt him slap his hips into your face, and cum jettisoned straight into your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thud and a dull pain in your head made you think he dropped you, groaning as you fell onto your stomach.  He grabbed you and flipped you over, a smirk on his face and a glint in those devious violet eyes.  The beast grabs your feet again and places them in his mouth, using his claws to tear away what little remained of your clothes, and when he swallowed, you realized why he did this.  He wanted you to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hands tried to push away from him, but in your weakened state, you were no match for his strength, and the first swallow sent your feet into the tight tunnel of his throat.  It felt like your ankles were going to break from this awkward position, but he didn't care, it was obvious he was savoring your flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlavor.  You were supposed to be the heroine, to save the world, but now all you were was a piece of meat, fattened and seasoned by cum and now your only destiny was to be swallowed and dissolved.  Tears fell from your face, not noticing that you had been swallowed down to your hips until he forced his tongue back inside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, you couldn't bute back your moans, something about him having already done this must have made you...used to it in a way.  And now you could get pleasure from it, a part of your mind wishing this was some mercy he was showing.  But he probably just liked how your pussy tasted and wanted some more of it.  Either way, it only took a half a minute for you to squirt your juices onto his tongue, making him moan as well and swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were gulped in the process to your flat chest.  He swiped over your nipples but showed little interest, continuing until your whole head was inside of his lips, and his jaws shut with a clack, sealing you in complete darkness.  His tongue wanted entrance into your own mouth, and at this.point, you just obliged him, the last hope you had of escaping swallowed just like you were about to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe saliva tasted absolutely horrid, but then you were pulled into his throat, a burning sensation now touching against your sensitive paws.  This was it, your final journey, into the black stomach of a Tyranitar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby, a fat Gliscor sat on her back, being fucked by her partner in crime as per their agreement.  She didn't mind, she might have him for dessert later.  The rest of the ambush party moved on to attack the village instead, and a pair of black footpaws vanished into the maw of a Krokorok.</span></div></div>",

You grunted, about to start screaming at him until you started doing so for a different reason.  \"KENSHI!!!\" A Yanmega anthro with the same violet eyes that resonated with your memory had his head clamped in its jaws, and didn't even so much as flinch when he tried to punch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you couldn't help him, as you had your own worries, the dirty pants around your legs dissolving before your eyes, but your exposed fur wasn't being affected at all.  Minus the fact that there was slime all over them.  Your panties underneath your legs survived for only a second before leaving your bottom completely exposed, and you moaned despite the disgusting feeling, the slime starting to seep into both your slit and your pucker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to Kenshi showed that his situation wasn't much better than yours, the insect fluttering its wings like mad and lifting him off of the air, the Riolu kicking his legs furiously though it got him no closer to escape.  It swallowed his shoulders, and then chest, until your thoughts were forced back to the Muk with a scream of pain when it suddenly fired tentacles straight through into both of your holes.  Your hymen was torn apart mercilessly, and you felt it start bloating your stomach to a breaking point, crying out.  \"NO, STOP, I'M GONNA BREAK!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature didn't stop, in fact, it seemed to pick up in pace as now your shirt was getting dissolved and it was slurping on your nearly flat breasts.  It was like two very abrasive tongues, and against your will, your nipples became hard though you were crying in immense pain, wracking your nerves and scrambling your thoughts.  Or perhaps that was why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long before the slime had engulfed your entire body, leaving you as a vulnerable, naked young girl floating in the violet cocoon that quickly forced itself down your maw and connecting the tentacle in your ass with it.  Your tears floated in the slime, and somehow, you could still breathe through it, but looking down, horror struck seeing that now your fur was being dissolved too.  If the penetrations hurt, this was torture, as when you became furless, your skin started to tingle, and then burned as red mixed with purple.  Your consciousness didn't last long enough for Kenshi's feet paws to disappear into the Yanmega, to the point where he could only kick weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere away from the two of you, the ones you were sent to find were suffering similar fates, and the world fell to chaos and ruin, the ferals having to turn on each other to stay fed until one unifying force brought them together...to eat them.</span></div></div>",

The climb was taken in total silence, until finally, your paw pressed down on something more solid than the rungs of the wooden ladder you had been descending.  But it wasn\u2019t the hard earthy ground you expected.  In fact, it felt warm\u2026and moist\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you realized what it was, you could barely cry out before you were slung off the ladder, and all you saw of your attacker was a blur of blue and red before you impacted into the ground.  Then your world was cast into darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn odd scent greeted you by the time you regained consciousness, and a strange wet noise accompanied by a muffled panicky screaming.  Your eyes snap open and you see the strangest thing of all.  Four pairs of legs, one you could identify as Kenshi\u2019s, but the other didn\u2019t make any sense to your mind, until you struggled up onto your hands and knees.  That\u2019s when you noticed it was a Garchomp that had attacked you, and she was very much female, since Kenshi\u2019s legs were rapidly disappearing into her cunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dove forward, grabbing the two feet and trying to pull him out, but your efforts were quickly ended with a strong backhand that sent you sprawling to the floor.  When you recovered, the last of your friend was disappearing into the dragon, and she stood up, looming over you.  Desperately, you held your hand out and fired an Ice Beam from it, but despite her huge size and the fact that she was now carrying a boy inside of her womb, she dodged easily, and grabbed your arms to force you into the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point you noticed she must have stripped you and Kenshi, not that he was wearing much, but squirming underneath her was not doing you any good, and she simply had her way with your body, her tongue lapping over your face and coating it with a good amount of her drool.  Appearing quite satisfied, she then opened wide, giving you a very good view of that endless cavern before it crashed down over your head and cast your world into pure darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you couldn\u2019t see anything, that didn\u2019t mean you couldn\u2019t feel it.  In fact, your sight getting cut off might have made your other senses more sensitive, feeling her tongue explore every inch of your head.  Ears, nose, into your mouth, and then suddenly, the loudest GULP you ever heard pulled you forcefully into her throat for it to squeeze down on your head.  The splitting headache it gave you was unfortunately the least of your worries, and it seemed her tasting was pretty much down as you felt her take a few more hard swallows until your shoulders were impossibly fit into her maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother pause came, with your feet getting lifted off the ground, and her tilting her head back, and teasingly scratching at your skin with her fangs while her tongue ran across your sensitive young nipples.  You shouldn\u2019t have moaned, everything in your mind screamed at you to stop, because you knew you were pretty much done for.  The day you learned what your true mission was and that you were one of the few hopes of the world, you now found yourself sliding down into the stomach of an infected dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of that stomach, you felt your head pop into it, and you gasped, fighting for air that you knew you wouldn\u2019t find here.  Even if you could see anything, you knew your vision would be getting blurry at this point, and the tips of your ears started burning with a sharp hissing noise, dipping into the acids.  Pleasure and pain were fighting themselves in your mind when she paused again, this time to force tongue and claw into your slit and ass respectively.  Your hymen breaking from her tongue didn\u2019t stop her, in fact, that blood just seemed to make her hungrier, and then your feet were given one final lick before getting curled into the stomach with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew it was impossible, but you thought you felt your digesting companion through the stomach walls in her womb, as your fur was starting to get eaten away, along with your consciousness.  The last thing you felt was what must have been the dragoness making her escape, digging into another tunnel.  And all Milo would find would be some fluids and your clothes and scythe left on the floor along with two holes.  He mourned the loss of the world\u2019s last hope, and though he fought valiantly, he too would become nothing more than another infected.  Which was probably a better alternative than your situation, stewing away in some random predator\u2019s belly as she curled up in her den to sleep again.</span></div></div>",

And from the way he slammed you against the wall, with his huge near-foot long cock pressing against your slit, he was plenty of both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat made the experience even worse was the fact that you could hear your former companion through the beast's stomach, crying out in pain and fear as he was most likely dissolving away inside.  That thought didn't linger on your mind too much longer though, since his cock was now parting your folds, and you just barely had enough time to look down before he slammed it inside your virgin entrance, tearing your hymen before he even reached it with his long cock.  You barely had the time to give a scream of pain before your world went dark, his maw snapping shut around your head, and he shoved his tongue right down your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGagging at the taste was what you wanted to do, but you couldn't even really do that, and your own tongue was forced down easily by his, as you could hear and feel the contractions around you, your stomach turning when you realized he was drinking your cool saliva.  Honestly, it would be a treat for any male, the taste and texture reminiscent of a blueberry popsicle that was in the fridge rather than the freezer.  Not that you really thought of any of that since it was your own spit though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, in fact, your mind was on that rough treatment your poor formerly unused pussy was getting, and the fact that your muzzle was now travelling down his throat.  The force of his muscles was keeping your mouth clamped shut as he pulled his tongue back out, and started slathering it all over your head, while still abusing your now bleeding cunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sense of time was completely lost at this point, but you're pretty sure a couple of minutes pass before you feel him pulsing inside of you, and the force of his cum rockets you further down his throat, and you can feel him start swallowing harder as his cum oozes out of your pussy, and his throat's muscles nearly crushing you as it forces you further down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour legs are the only thing hanging out of his mouth by the time your head pops out into his stomach, with some unidentifiable but disgusting stench hitting your nose hard.  That thought only stayed in your head for a few more seconds before you felt that meaty tongue slide into your abused slit, and then into your virgin ass.  With your mouth able to open again, you started screaming in pain and fear.

He was revealed to be a Kricketune, stroking his luxurious mustache with a dark chuckle.  \"Ah, you're awake, I was starting to think I put you into a coma.\"  The male laughed at his own joke, but your retort just came out as a muffle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you came to realize that you were tied up, and there was tape over your mouth.  \"Don't bother trying to escape.  You can't.  At least until whatever comes to...\" He smirked and licked his lips, taking his cigarette out, \"fuck and eat you will probably free you.  They love to have their prey struggle and scream before they are devoured.\"  The thought was obviously arousing to this sick bug, because you could see his shelled cock sliding out from between his legs.  \"Mmm, it seems I'll have to go back into town to use a girl to satisfy my own sexual urges.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put the cigarette back in, and then picked up something that looked like a pot and a large wooden spoon.

Before you could cry out in disgust or anything though, you watched in horror as the slit suddenly opened and wrapped around your head.  That musk scent grew a hundred times more powerful the second your head was inside the thing that was in your ass just a few minutes ago.  The powerful muscles drew you in deeper, even as your tailhole continued to leak out cum, dripping down your legs and onto the grass.  You realized that would be the final traces of your existence, and you started to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn't stop the Blastoise at all, easily slipping in your small breasts next, and squeezing your arms hard to your sides as your feet stopped touching the ground.  In a last act of defiance, you tried to kick at his cock, but he held your legs steady, and you could feel him shifting his weight to sit down, holding you up as you squirmed uselessly, which just sped up your journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of minutes, you suddenly felt those odd muscles around your abused ass and pressing up against your virgin slit, until something wet and slimy entered it, and you gasped and moaned, feeling extremely sensitive from all of the musk and the leftover globs of cum that you could feel matting down your fur.  You do realize that he must have stuck his tongue into you, and once you started bleeding, he started sucking out the mixture of it and your juices.  The foreign feeling brought you to a climax quickly, and even though you were disgusted, you were a little thankful that he had at least given you that final liberty, and that you wouldn't die without finding some sexual satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe licked up your legs, and played with your feet paws as you continued to slide in, but before you reached his sac, you could feel everything crush you even tighter, to the point where you swore your bones would break, and then his foul, hot, sticky cum washed over your entire body.  You figured it was getting ejected onto the forest floor, but you didn't budge even an inch against the torrent thanks to the turtle's cock muscles, and then you started sliding faster.  You were forcefully ejected into the sac with a splash, landing in a pool of his cum, having to swim a little.  You were surprised by just how big the space was, for your feet to touch the bottom, you'd have to completely submerge yourself in cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you weakly paddled in the dark chamber, trying to beat on the walls of flesh, you could feel something, and then a wave of cum splashed over your face, temporarily submerging you.  Swimming back up for air, you realized that all of the fur on your body had just fallen off, leaving you completely exposed, naked, and you could feel your skin start to soften.  \"No...\" You whimpered, tears falling down your cheek, mixing with the pool around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, your legs dissolved, and you dipped into the pool.  Unable to breathe or swim, you succumb to your fate, drowning before you could be completely converted into cum, most likely for the monster to ram it up another girl's ass, and the cycle would be destined to repeat forever while the rod you had brought would just be tossed like trash from back where you were abducted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least you could have taken comfort if you had known the Kricketune who grabbed you had just been eaten by an infected Noctowl.</span></div></div>",

However, instead of landing in his maw as you expected, he caught you and slammed your back into the ground, showing you his large member.  You screamed and struggled, but to no effect under the much larger and stronger predator, hearing the ripping as he easily tore off the rest of your clothes, even down to your cute white panties.  At this distance, you could hear your mother inside of his belly, screaming in pain and fear as she was most likely being dissolved inside, turned into nutrients and power for the frog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne croak was all the warning you had before he snapped your attention back to him by prodding at your virgin entrance, and you shrieked, \"NO!! NOT THERE, PLEASE!!!\" Of course, he didn't care to listen, and started pushing his extremely large cock into you, spreading you wide and making you feel like he was going to tear you in half.  From that point, you can only remember the intense pain, his tongue slathering over your flat chest and then into your mouth as he had done with your mother, and his croaking, which sped up as he got closer to his climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never did reach your own, since the pain overtook any pleasure you may have felt, even as you felt his hot seed fill you up, and made your flat stomach quite distended.  Suddenly, he lifts you off of the ground, using nothing but his tongue, that is now wrapped around your entire body, and lowering you in feet first.  You tried to curl up as your digitigrade feet paws touched his wet mouth, but the effort was pointless, and he closed his mouth over your hips, and then took a swallow, loosening his tongue so you could slide in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe experience was disgusting, feeling his throat muscles close around your feet, and looking down into his purple eyes, until he had swallowed up to your head, opening his mouth one more time before snapping it closed and taking a few final swallows.  Your trip into his stomach was short, but painful, with his crushing gullet squeezing down onto your body, and then you slid into his stomach.  You couldn't see anything, but you could feel the dead lump that was slowly dissolving away, and cried as you realized it was your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- + - + -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so here you are, realizing you left that odd object your mother had given to you outside before you were dragged in, and feeling as your body softens and dissolves, quickly losing consciousness.

Without either, the denizens of the world would either become infected themselves, or share a similar fate to yourself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Author's note: I actually intended to tell you about Rai and Kate's personality and backstory. So I'm putting the story scene in the next chapter. I'm sorry for the sudden changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rai is a strong-minded anthro Raichu who just turned 17. He's 4.6 ft. tall. He and his family grew up in the town of Aurora.  His father had another name for him, but the mother like the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rai\" in raichu, so they decided to give it to him. He is covered in dark orange fur with a white and slightly pudgy belly. His arms and feet have patches of brown fur at the end, has toes and fingers at the ends of them, and the soles of his big feet are tan with a circular orange pad. His bifurcated ears are brown on the outside and yellow on the insides and ends in a distinctive curl. His eyes are a sapphire blue color. The electric sacs on his cheeks are yellow. He has two horizontal brown stripes on its back. His long, thin tail has a lightning bolt shaped end. The lightning bolt is smaller on females and theirs have a blunt end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Normally, Rai is a calm, kindhearted, spirited pokemon. He's doesn't like to fight, but he will if he needs to defend himself or others. Still, there are times, especially if he stored too much electricity within himself, he will become aggressive and hard to deal with. (But that's normal in raichus) He can be naive and cautious at time, but he wields a strong sense of justice and loyalty to the ones he trust. He loves his little sister deeply and would do anything to protect her, though not too strict on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir parents are a male raichu and a female pachirisu. The father is the captain of the town guards. The forces were greatly respected and admired by everyone in Aurora. The mother works at the hospital as a nurse. Her caring and understanding were well-known in Aurora. When Rai turned 10, he was taught how to fight. (Any pokemon must be at least 10 years old to be taught moves.) While his father taught him how to fight, his mother taught him why should he fight. <u>Defeat the strong and defend the ones who are weak and innocent</u> was your mothers well-known motto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With him is his little sister Katherine, though most people call her Kate for short. She'll be turning 7 in less than 2 weeks. Her fur is white with a faint blueish tint and have a light blue stripe which starts from their forehead and goes all the way down to the tip of the tail. A large white tooth grows out of her mouth. Her eyes are bright orange. She has a yellow circle on each cheek. Pachirisus have tails that are almost twice as big as they are, with three spikes at the top of the curl, which it can shoot charges from. Her arms and legs are very short. Still, she can run incredibly fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kate is a caring and playful pokemon. She likes to share with her friends and very polite. Although, she is very shy and tends to lose herself in her daydreams which can get her in trouble, but she always mean well and would never cause any harm to anyone or anything. She loves flowers, especially white ones. One time she came home with a whole bouquet of different kinds of flowers, of different varieties. Big, small, tall, short, thick stem, thin stem, you name it. She'll bring it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Luckily nothing happened along the way like the scene with the semipour. When the two of you arrived, you couldn't believe what you are seeing. Aurora, your hometown, is in chaos. Some homes are on fire, pokemon are attacking each other, and you see some of the houses are barricaded. <i>What is this, some kind of riot?</i> you thought as you see what is happening. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rai, what's going on?\" Kate asked, terrified at the scene. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I wish I knew, but I don't, but it can't be good.\" You quickly look at your house to see it's not too badly damaged, but there are some pokemon around it. <i>Oh please let my parents be OK.</i> You plead in your mind. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Come on, we have to find our parents.\" You say grabbing her hand and preparing to run to the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You reached the entrance, but quickly hid in a nearby bush. You don't want to risk a fight with your sister nearby and draw any attention towards you two. As the two of you made your way in cover,  you stopped and looked around to make sure the coast is clear. Before you moved, you saw a female Persian fighting a male flareon. The normal type overpowered the fire type, but what she did next shocked you. The cat started swallowing its head. You couldn't believe it despite seeing it with your own eyes, the cat was consuming the fire dog. You caught the cats eyes in time to see their purple as well. <i>Another Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon going crazy? This can't be of coincidence</i> <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\u00e2\u20ac\u0153What is it? What's happening?\"</font> A familiar voice snapped you back to reality. You look and see the pachirisu began pushing to see, but you push her back in time. <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Stay down!\"</font> you order quietly. You would try and help, but there are other purple eyed Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon close by. You just have to keep going. You grab your sisters hand and moved on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were able to get to your home without encountering any problems. You approached the door cautiously.. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Kate stay close to me.\" She nods and you open the door. What you saw next horrified the both of you. Your parents are on the ground, covered in bandages, caked with blood. You two ran to them. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mom! Dad! Are you alright?\" Your mother awaken, her eyes blue like yours thank Arceus. You see the injuries are not serious. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rai? Thank goodness you're all right.\" She says weakly. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But what about-\" \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Little Katherine.\" The both of you looked to see your father hugging your sister. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were so worried about you two. Are you okay? Anything happened?\" \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Thanks to my big brother I'm fine. He too   He turns to you with pride in his eyes as he says: well now, looks like your training has paid off.\" He quickly became stern as he adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rai, this semipour, has his eyes were a different color when you saw him?\" You explain everything to him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes. His eyes were yellow before he lost consciousness, but when he woke back up moments later, they were purple. I also saw some other pokemon acting crazy with purple eyes as well. Do you know what's going on around here?\" \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It's must be that virus that I read in the paper.\" he says looking down. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A virus?\" You repeated what he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I'll explain everything with you, but first you must close and barricade the door.\" You done what he said and returned. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This'll take time to explain, so let's head to the basement. I can walk, but you mother needs help.\" You and Kate headed to the basement with your parents and waited to listen to what he's about to say.</span></div></div>",

When I picked it up, I noticed an article talking about a town pretty far from here suffering from a strange virus. The residents are becoming aggressive, incidents at hospitals, and attackers all developing purple eyes, even ones who they know don't have em. It mentions that forces are looking into it and they'll come up with a solution to the problem.\" He shook his head before saying. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That was 2 months ago.\" Your ears perked up at that last sentence. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wait, so this whole mess started 2 months ago?\" He just shrugged his shoulders and said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I only know where it occurred. This might've started sooner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You turn towards your mother. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Did anything happened at the hospital?\" She nods and starts to speak. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Two patients, one adult, the other in his early teens, were sent to the hospital. We were sending them to the ER when the youth lost consciousness. While trying to revive him, he soon wakes up and starts to thrash about wildly. We tried to calm him down, but he wasn't listening.\" She pause for a moment before continuing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were forced to use a sleep seed and restrained him and the father when he lost consciousness as well. Afterwards, I went out to get some medicine for them, but when I came back, everyone, including the patients, were gone. The room was a complete mess as well.\" She finishes with tears forming in her eyes. You two go to hug her for comfort. <i>So it seems the rate the Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon turns is based on ones age and size.</i> You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After they finished explaining, your dad starts to speak again \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That's all we know, but there's one place that might have more to offer. The town is called Silverhills. I bought a map of the land that could help you find it. I don't know how this happened, except that this is not normal. You two can rest here for a few minutes, but then you'll have to go.\" You're a little surprise about the firmness in the last part, but you forced it down and said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not without you! I have some berries in my bag that could help you recover faster.\" Your parents looked at both of you with a crestfallen look on their faces as your father says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I'm sorry, but we can't come with you\" You and your sister froze up with a shocked expression as you two say: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What!?\" You then ask: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What do you mean \u00e2\u20ac\u0153can't\" come?\" Your mother answers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can't come because we're infected as well.\" That last sentence slams you hard like you're been dealt with a focus punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAuthor's note: ugh! Doing this on a tablet is a pain in the ass. Especially if something stupid happens and you have to start over. But I'll continue to make more as soon as I can.</span></div></div>",

You can't!\" Your father hugged her back then said softly \"we're sorry, but it's too late.\" he put her down and looked at you, \"There is something you can do about this though, but before that..\" he started coughing before he continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Do you know how others get infected?\" You shake your head.

That's when it hit you: The victims were raped by them before turning That realization made you sick to your stomach, but you simply replied: \"I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Even though they can infect other pokemon and turn them into more of them, physically there's nothing wrong with them. That's where you come in. You must find the source of this infection, stop it, and find a cure for this infection. And keep your sister safe while your at it.\" You start to panic at the thought. \"I don't know. I just found out about this.\" He put his hand on your shoulder. \"You can Rai. Your a Voltaire (their family name) you can do anything.\" Your father then proceeds to take off his medallion and give it to you. <i>His medallion. He told me his father's passed it down to their sons for generations</i> Tears started to form in your eyes. \"You can do this. We believe in you.\" Your parents say in unison.

You smile at that pleasant moment before giving it back to her. \"Don't worry. We may be gone for a while, but we'll be back. Like our father said, the infected are physically all right.

Don't leave until I say so, you understand?\" She nods and proceeds to go into the bush. You go after the Swampert and use quick attack on it. While it didn't do much damage, it provided the distraction for the Buneary to get some distance from it. You then attacked with thundershock, but you then realized that the Swampert was a duel water-ground type and it wouldn't effect it. The Swampert took that opening and used mud shot, hitting you in the face and blinding you. You kneeled down in pain and tried to rub it off. The Swampert then started to charge at you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Author's note: My new chapter after the prologue.

I appreciate it, but-\" She then cut you off by saying: \"I'm sure, and besides, it's going to be tough for you alone, and I'm your friend.\" You blush a bit from her words.

Remembering those orbs you picked up at your last campsite, you say, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh wait you two, I found something I need to show you.\" They stopped and wait until you take out the orbs you found. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I found these at camp. Do you know anything about these things?\" You ask Rachael, but she just shakes her head. You sigh as your sister tugs your shoulder as she ask, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Can I have one of them? They're pretty.\" The pachirisu put on her best puppy dog eyes at you. Unable to resist, you say she could, but only if she's careful not to lose it. She nods and you give her the small one. The two of you put the orbs in your respective bags in continued on into the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As you and your group enter the cave, you pause to generate enough electrical power to provide light for you three to see. Thanks to your dads training, you can keep this up for a whole day and still have enough power to fight. The three of you continued deep into the cave for quite some time. As you enter a room with a circular area and the dark abyss at the bottom, you hear a screech as a swarm of zubats appears out of nowhere. You put your sister back and you and Rachael tensed up, ready to fight. But they just flew past you and out the way you came. The three of took a sigh of relief when...</span></div></div>",

Out of the darkness comes a Scrafty about the same height as you, if you don't count his Mohawk. With him are four Scraggy. His eyes sport a hazel color, but that thought doesn't comfort you. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well, well, well. A Raichu, a Buneary,and a Pachirisu.

You can't go off eating the ones who're still sane!\" You exclaimed while releasing sparks from your cheeks. The Scrafty shakes his head before saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wake up kid!

It's a shame that girl will fall to this, or worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That was your breaking point.

Get em boys!\" The Scraggy then charged at them. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Kate stay back! Rachael let's go!\" The two of you then ran towards them. You started things off with a quick attack at the one closest to you. One Scraggy attacks Rachael with low kick , but she jumped up into the air and landed a hi-jump kick on his head, knocking him out flat. You used thundershock to knock one down in a electric heap, the other took the opportunity and headbutts you. You staggered a bit, but it wasn't enough to stop you from swinging around and using Iron Tail. The Scraggy had no time to react as he was sent spinning to the ground, unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You took a moment to breathe before losing it all of the sudden from the Scrafty using Take-Down.

He doesn't have a chance to react as he was hit in the jaw hard. He staggers back from the impact, which gives you an opening to swing around and smack him with a iron tail attack. the scrafty landed on his back.

I'll find the one who cause this disaster and make him pay for this!\" \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Foolish boy!\" He cried and shot a sludge bomb at you. You dodged, but it caught you off guard and you fell on your back. You look up and see the scrafty charging at you. Panicking, you put your feet up as he lunged at you and you threw him over you.

The three of you sat there for a little while before you get up and tell them it's time to go.

She had two long red fangs hanging from her mouth, sporting violet eyes, her whole body covered with black scales with golden hexagons and purple scar-like patterns save her stomach, arms and hands, chest and breast which shows her black skin.  At her side you see her tail with a blade the same color as her fangs. You recover from the sight and ready yourself for a fight. The seviper naga started moving around in a strange motion. You don't know what she's planning, but you started gathering electricity in your body for a attack. The seviper then brings her tail covering her face, as if one's holding a fan. She lowers it a bit to wink at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Afterwords, you start to feel strange. There's something about this snake that's so...alluring.  <i>Wow.

You just stood there, staring in her eyes as her tail moves to her legs and starts coiling around you. Fully in her coils save your head, she starts licking your face while squeezing you teasingly, getting a moan from you. Satisfied with your flavor, she starts opening her mouth wide, unhinging her jaws. You stare on, not worrying about the consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before the seviper starts dining, a voice spoke out, breaking the spell the snake had on you.

How's it going on yo-whaaa!\" Rachael couldn't finished when she spotted you in a coils of a big snake. Kate hides behind her, horrified at what she's seeing.

You struggle and tried to use a electric attack, but can't concentrate from the pain. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153R..Rachael.

Fighting two enemies, the seviper is at a disadvantage. She gather poison within her tail, and lunge it at the buneary.  You ran and pushed her out of the way, getting hit in your sides instead. She gasped as she saw you hit the ground. While got back up,bleeding at the area you were hit at. You then start to  feel sick and dizzy, you realized that the seviper has poisoned you! \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Guh..Rachael, we need to end this fast.\" She nods and suggest, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Let's attack her at once.\" You nod and at once, you two charge at her at the same time.

You proceeded to wake your sleeping companions. \"Good morning, how you two rested?\" they both nodded their heads. \"OK. I will prepare breakfast, but it's going to be light. Don't want to overindulge.\" They understand and started putting up their sleeping bags and waited. You did so as well as it cooked. A little while later, it was ready and you told them to sit down as you prepare their bowls. You three sat there eating as well as making sure no one disturbs you. After the infected seviper incident last afternoon, you don't want to end up in the same situation twice in a short time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hey Rai, how much further to Silverhills?\" Rachael asks while eating. You thought about it as you bring out your map. Once opening it, you pinpoint the location of Twilight Cave and found a small forest near it. \"We must be here, and Silverhills is quite a distance that way. We made good progress exiting the cave quickly. If we keep moving and if we're lucky, we should arrive before sundown.\" you point out to them. \"Hopefully we'll find out how this happens.\" Rachael says, \"Yeah, me too.\" After finishing up, you three clean up around the camp and put on your packs. \"Is everyone ready?\" Rachael nods, but Kate puts up her hand as she says, \"I got to go to the bathroom.\"  You sigh and tell her to be quick and don't go too far. she nods and dash out of sight a second later. \"Wow she's fast. I'm surprise you can keep up her.\" Rachael comments about your sister. You sigh and say, \"She takes after her mother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When you mentioned your mother, you start to think about them and the others.<i>They had to turn long by now. I hope they're still alive at least. What kind of sick monster would do this?</i> you thought quietly. Rachael took sight of this and pat your back to comfort you. you smile and say thanks, but then you thought about her folks. \"What happen to your family? If you don't mind telling me.\" She saddens and says, \"The same as yours, except they already like them before I arrived home. I was attacked by them before I escaped. I was making my way to an exit before that swampert attacked me. I was tired already, and if it wasn't for you. I might've been that frogs lunch.\" \"I'm sorry, we'll bring them back. I promise.\" She smiles at your words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After Kate returns, The three of you continue on, you hope nothing bad happens as you make your way towards Silverhills.</span></div></div>",

She has a good reason too. While the gate's standing, it's damaged. You place your paw on her shoulder to calm her down. \"We'll need to be careful.\" Her smile becomes more genuine. You hear a gasp from your sister behind you. \"Kate! What happened?!\" You and Rachael turn around to see her not under attack, but busy picking out flowers and putting them in her bag. \"I never seen flowers like these, they're beautiful.\" She says sweetly. You and Rachael breathed out in relief, but you fold your arms and say, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Kate.\" The squirrel stopped and turned to look at you two. \"What's wrong?\" She asked confused. \"Nothing, except that we thought that you were under attack from your gasp.\" Rachael answers for you. The pachirisu realized what you're talking about and bows her head down.  You approach her and pat her head.  \"Hey, we're not mad, just try to be more aware of what you do.\" She looks up at you and nods. \"Okay. Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You approach the door and put both your paws on the wood. \"Be ready to run just in case.\" You tell them both. Kate moves behind Rachael while the buneary braced herself. Taking a deep breath, you start to push the door as hard as you can. You open a crack to see inside to make sure There's no infected nearby. Seeing it's clear, you push the door wide enough to allow the others inside.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Inside, he town was in worser shape. Things scattered everywhere, buildings are damaged, some destroyed, and a feeling of dread fills the air. Kate cups her mouth from the site. \"Rai. What happened here?\" You stand there, looking at the chaos this infection has caused to this town. \"I wish I knew.\" You simply say to her. Rachael turns to you. \"So where do we start?\" You think about it until you bear a scream coming from somewhere. \"We'll start with that! Let's go!\" With that, you three ran toward the direction of the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You heard the scream again not too far. You slowed down to a stop at a corner. You three peek around the corner to see three pokemon fending off 4 pokemon. From what you can tell, the surrounded ones are normal and others are infected. Those pokemon are in trouble.\" Rachael whisperers to you. \"I know. We need a pl-\", you were unable to finish you sentence because of what you're seeing. One of the infecteds, a ursaring, picks up the defeated cranido, but instead of shoving him in his mouth, it starts inserting him into it's penis. The head encircles the non-infecteds feet and reaches its legs before you turn away from it, shocked at what you witness. Thankfully, Rachael was able to turn Kate's head away from them before she saw anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rachael kept your sister in her arms as she ask you with the look of disgust, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What on earth was it doing.\" You are too stunned yourself to answer. You are aware of vore in the world before the infection, but you never expected it to go further than oral. \"What's happening?\" Your sister ask you with fear in her eyes. You just said, \"Their being eaten.\" She cringes hearing you. You brace yourself before peeking again to see the bear swallowing the dinos head in his cock. A ponyta's stomach is sagging and shaking. The only one left is a zoroark fending them off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Realizing there's still a chance, you say, \"Rachael, we can save that zoroark. I'll paralyze the bear while you finish it with hi-jump kick.\" The ursaring is the biggest threat that must be rid of. She looks at you with concern and ask, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Are you sure, we don't know him. What if he's like that scrafty?\" You cringe after hearing that name, but you quickly shake it off and answer, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I know, but it's wrong to leave him to this fate!\" She nods in understanding and wait for your command.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Kate, you stay here! Don't look or come out until I say so or something happens!\" She nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After giving your orders, you watch the situation.

Before it struck the final blow, the bear finds that he's unable to move his arm, let alone his body. Next he felt small electric current moving around his body, coming from his back. He forced his head to turn just to see a bunearys left hindpaw come crashing into his face.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The bear was seeing stars for a moment before recovering before he recovered in time to see a raichu dashing towards him and jumping up and spinning with his tail glowing. It didn't have enough time to react before his iron tail came crashing in the same area the rabbit had hit him. It backed away a brief moment before collapsing on the ground unconscious. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You and Rachael looked at each other and nodded before moving towards the zoroark. You threw a Oran berry at him, telling him to use it. Knowing what berry it is, he eats it without hesitation. He feels his strength returning to him. He gets up off his knee and gets in a fighting stance between the two of you. The fox takes a look at you.  \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You two..\" he starts speaking, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We'll talk about this later. Right now we need to fight!\" You respond quickly, tiny sparks coming from your cheeks. The black fox was shocked that these teens are risking their lives to help him, but he put that thought on hold.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The three of you stand off against the three infecteds in front of you. The ponyta takes the first move by charging at the buneary with fire spin. But the buneary jumps out of the way in time. The firehorse mane erupts in rage before inhailing for a flamethrower. Before it was able to release it, the zoroark charged at it, claws infused with a spectral aura, and slashed it as he passed by. It neighs in pain before Rachael came crashing down on it with bounce. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That's for my comrades you bastard!\" He yells at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You launch a quick attack at a sunflora, connecting it with it. The flower recovers and launches two vines at you. You ran to dodge, but the came too fast and they slam into your gut, knocking you off your feet. You rolled backwards back onto your feet and unleash a thundershock at it. The plant cries out in pain and slumps down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You charge at it to finish it when all of a sudden, you see a side of you getting brighter. You turn to see a grumpig generating light. Seeing this, you turn towards him to stop it, but the obese pig grins and makes it disappear. You briefly wondered where'd it go before it appeared inches in front of your face and exploded, blinding you and forcing you into a stop. You rub your eyes from the pain, but you hear the pig in front on you generating power again. You tried to open your eyes, but that flash makes it hard to keep them open. The grumpig has gained enough power and prepares to fire. You...</span></div></div>",

Hearing a vibrant noise from your right, you jump forward out of the way of it. Feeling less pain at your eyes, you tried opening them again. While the pain still lingers, you are able to pinpoint the grumpig trying to regenerate power again. \"Oh no you don't!' You cried out as you unleash your Thunderbolt attack at him.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The grumpig was unprepared as a strong electric current coursed through his body, forcing him on his knees. It tries to stand, but the paralysis from your last attack has its effect on him. Taking advantage of his inaction, you charged towards him and lashed out your Iron Tail attack, connecting to the side of his head. The pig spun around for a bit before collapsing on the ground, unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You take a quick breath before checking on the sunflora, who just launched some leaves at your way. You moved out of it's way with agility then unleashed a thunderbolt towards it. Being already weak from your previous attacks, the plant type couldn't take it and fell to the ground as well. You make a small arm pump as you say confidently, \"There's nothing a Voltaire can't do!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You check on the others to see that they both gone through their fights well. You proceed towards them. \"Are you two ok?\" The two nod towards you. \"You two risked your lives to save me.\" The zoroark says with confusion in his voice. You were about to speak when a familiar scream interrupts you three. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You turn towards the direction to see your sister being attacked by a poochyena. \"Kate!\" You cry out before dashing with agility, Rachael fallows as well. The wolf pup tackles the squirrel off her hindpaws and would've continued his assault if you haven't knocked him away with quick attack. The pup recovered from your light attack, but when it turned towards you, it also sees a buneary by your side in her fighting stance. Seeing that it's a lost cause, the infected turn tail and ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Seeing the situation has passed, you turn to check on your sister. \"Are you okay?\" You ask concerned. The patchirisu got up and dust herself off, then ran into your arms. \"I was scared.\" she says. You wrap your arms around to comfort her. \"I know, but don't worry. I won't let anything happen to you!\" Kate looks up to you. \"I promise.\" \"Me too!\" Your friend promises too. She smiles from it.<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

You nudge her again, a little firmer this time. \"Sorry, we need to take advantage of this moment.\" She groans again, but starts to move until she's in a sitting position. \"Good job.\" You tell her while getting rid of sleep in her eyes. \"Come on, let's go check on the others.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Walking to the living room, you note that the room Rachael stayed in is closed. \"Rachael, you up in there?\" you ask as you began to open the door. You were suddenly pushed back. \"Don't come in here Rai! I'm a mess!\" Rachael cries out. You then realize what is going on. \"Rachael, this isn't a good time to worry about that.\" You try reasoning with her, but your friend responds back by saying, \"Maybe you can go around looking like that, but I take pride in my look.\" You sigh when you realize that this is a fight you can't win. <i>The infecteds aren't going to mind when you're sliding down their throats</i> \"Is she going to be ok?\" Your sister ask in confusion. You reassure her that she's fine and she'll meet up later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Upon entering, you see Neku leaning with his back on the wall. \"Morning.\" The zoroarks head snaps up from hearing your voice. Apparently, he was deep in thought. \"Oh hey,\" he replies back. \"Is something wrong?\" You ask him. Huh? Oh it's nothing. Don't worry about it.\" You're unconvinced, but you let it go. Noticing there's only two of you the dark fox ask, \"Where's the buneary?\" Not wanting to mention her \"predicament\", you just said. \"She'll be here in a moment.\" Right after you finish, a voice adds, \"And it's Rachael, by the way.\"  You turn to see your friend walking towards you, tying her second ribbon in her left ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Seeing that everyone's present, Neku starts to speak. \"Hope all of you got a good amount of sleep cause we're leaving. We can talk while we move.\" Before he can do anything, you say, Hold on, do you know a place we can refill our bottles with water? We're running out.\" The fox takes a look at you for a moment before replying, \"I saw a small stream close outside of town,but you'll need to be quick.\" You nod and then he opened the door a bit to peek out to check if the coast is clear before opening it completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>((Neku as joined you as a guest 'for now'))</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The four of you walk onwards, you three trailing close behind Neku. You notice that he's slowing his movement so that you three can catch up. He turns his head so that he's looking at you and Rachael. \"You two fought very well yesterday. Who taught you how to fight?\" You thought about it and believe it won't hurt answering. \"My dad was captain of the guards at our home. He was pretty strict with my training.\"  Rachael then speaks, \"Like his dad, my father taught me as well. Figured I might need to protect myself. While he wasn't a member or anything, he taught me a lot about fighting.\" \"I see.\" Neku says while listening. \"What happened to them?\" You were silent for a moment before answering, \"We'll talk about it later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eventually, your group reach the stream he talked about. Flowing water fills your ears as you reach down for a pawful, but as soon as the fluids hit your tongue, you immediately spat out the foul-tasting liquid. You quickly warn the others not to drink it. \"What's wrong?\" Rachael ask about your concern. \"The water! T..there's something wrong with it.\" \"How so?\" Neku ask next. \"I can't describe it, but it has a revolting taste to it. It's not normal.\" There was a moment of silence before Neku saids, \"I guess that means we shouldn't drink this.\" \"Yeah, we'll find something else.\" You answer as you take a apple from your pack and eat it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Neku smirks while watching you eat. \"You know, considering your look, I'm suprise you were able to move that fast to stop that poochyena from yesterday.\" You pause and scowl at him. \"Are you saying l I'm fat?!\" You ask him. \"Rai, you're not exactly the slimmest person I know.\" Rachael answers and confirm this by poking at your stomach.  \"Hey, I'm not fat! This is normal standard for a raichu. You know this.\" You say. There are only two raichus in our town. You and your dad.\" Rachael explains. Your face is red as a tomato berry as you try to prevent yourself from yelling at her. \"Let's just go!\" You say as you start to move on the path. The buneary was shocked from your reaction. <i>Maybe I went to far...</i></span></div></div>",

Kate is struggling to keep up with you three. \"Are we there yet?\" She whines.  Neku groans at the question.<i>That's the fourth time she ask that.</i> He thinks this, but he calmly replies,  \"It's just a little further now.\" The zoroark turns his head towards you.  \"Not much stamina huh?\" he whispers. \"She's just a little girl. Just be patient.\" You answer to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rachael was walking a feet away from you. The rabbit knew you were upset with her and was unsure of how to start her apology. Eventually she inched herself closer to you and starts to speak. \"Hey Rai.\" You turn your head towards her for a moment before looking onwards again. Your friend continues to speak \"Well, uh, about what happened earlier. I, um, want to apologize.\" You turn to her again, this time listening to her. \"It was funny I'll admit, but I should've stopped when you became upset. I didn't and that was wrong. So again, I'm sorry.\" You thought about her words and believe that she's sincere with it, so you say, \"I forgive you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her amber eyes beamed up after you answer. \"Really?! Uh, T-Thank you.\" She gets out, obviously shocked from you forgiving her so soon. \"Don't mention it. It'll take a lot more than that to really piss me off.\" While you are aware of your chubbiness, you just didn't like it when she kept going on with it. \"Rai, you're not mad anymore?\" You turn to see that Kate was able to catch up with you. \"I've forgiven her, so we're cool.\" That brought a smile to your sisters face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With you three together, Neku ask, \"Where you three come from anyway?\" \"We come from the town of Aurora.\" Rachael answers. He nods, but then he realize that their town and Silverhills were pretty close. With that, he ask, \"How long have you been traveling out here?\" \"Well, to be honest, this is actually my fourth day.\" You admit. His eyes widen at your answer. \"And you say you're going to save this world, big words from a kid.\" You got annoyed at that remark. \"I'm not a kid!\" You angrily respond. \"Well, you're not a adult yet either.\" He fires back calmly. \"You have a point there.\" You admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You notice that she's holding the round stone you gave her. \"Don't lose it now.\" You gently, but firmly warn her. Neku wondered what you meant before casting his eyes on Kate's item. \"That's..\" He starts to say before a loud buzzing can be heard, \"Did you hear that?\" Neku ask you. \"Yeah.\" you reply as sparks flicker from your cheeks.  Out from a thicket of trees, two beedrills came charging out, stinger arms aimed out towards you four. You and Neku dodged one while Rachael grabs Kate and jumps out of the second ones way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The beedrills recovered rather quickly and appeared in front of you. They're clearly infected cause of their purple incect-like eyes. You tell your sister to get back, but before she could do anything, two vines appear out of nowhere and wrapped themselves around you and Rachael! Kate scrambled back a bit and watched in horror as you two struggle to escape, but the vines won't budge as it drags them towards a thicket of trees. The source turns out to be a bayleaf hidden within, sporting purple eyes like the two bees. Neku tries to intervene, but the beedrills prevent him from helping.

Your combat training with your dad, medical teachings from your mom, all the way to the promise you made to them. You respond to it by struggling even harder. <i>I haven't come this far just to be plant food!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kate is hidden nearby watching the whole scene. The pachirisu is horrified at seeing her brother and his friend being caught by the feral bayleaf. She's fighting back tears in her eyes and clutching her stone in her paws. She suggesting calling out to Neku, but the fox is busy dealing with the infected hornets to provide assistance. <i>Something, anything, please help them. Please!</i> Your sister pleads as she tightens her grip on her stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All of the sudden, a glow surrounded the small stone. Kate opened her eyes and gasp from the sight. The same glow appeared out of your pack. The bayleaf was so shocked that he let you and Rachael go. You notice this and quickly paralyze him with thunder wave, then you reach into your pack and take out your stone. \"Rai, what's going on?\" Rachael asked you witnessing the scene. \"I-I don't know! I--\" you couldn't finished as the light brightens and envelopes you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Neku, who was fighting off the beedrills, notices the situation and focuses the dark energy within and let it loose around him with the dark pulse attack. afterwards, he dashed towards you and Rachael. \"Rai, are you ok?\" Rachael tries to reach you, but you don't respond. The buneary was about to reach for you, but a fox's paw grabs her. \"Don't! let it finish.\" \"Let it finish? I don't know if he's fine.\" \"He's fine, I seen this before.\" Before she ask how, the light subsides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You finally regain your senses after the light fades. When it brightened, you felt cut off with everything around you. You look at Rachael and Neku, both having a surprise look on them. \"Guys, what's wrong?\" Rachael speaks out, \"Rai! Your body!\" You are confused as to why she mentioned that until you take a look at yourself. Your eyes widen when you notice you look different. While your overall fur hasn't changed, you notice thunderbolt patches on your knees and two on your back. there's black fur on your upper back connected to your shoulders. Your ears colors have switched and the outside appear almost like thunderbolts. The fur on your front and hind paws are yellow instead of brown and have a thunderbolt appearance as well. Lastly, looking back, you notice that you have not one, but two tails behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Here's the website where I got this from and in case you need a idea of what he's supposed to look like.

It's just-\" You were cut off as one of the beedrills swooped in and tackles Rachael, knocking her down. \"Rachael!\" You cry out before the other one goes for Kate. You quickly lash out thundershock towards it. It was unable to outmaneuver your attack and was hit, falling to the ground unconscious. You were surprise that you brought it down in one attack. Your mind turned to the bayleaf who just recovered from his paralysis. You turn to see Rachael gotten up, while sore from the bees attack. Despite your mysterious transformation, you must focus on the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Kate, I need you to stay back! Rachael, take care of the beedrill! Neku, You're with me with the bayleaf!\" You quickly order them. They nod and Rachael heads off to deal the the infected insect while you and Neku faces the plant type. The bayleaf charges towards the black fox. He doesn't seem frighten as he stands there. <i>What's he doing?</i> you wonder, but then he sidestep his take down and strikes him hard. <i>That's feint attack!</i> You thought, impressed by the sight. You launch thundershock at the bayleaf. While it was strong, it's still standing. <i>It's standing? I guess even with this power, type differences still matter.</i> The plant type starts gathering power in its leaf. <i>It's preparing a solar beam attack!</i> You need to attack, so you use...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Author's note: I got this idea from playing Y. In case you didn't play the games or watch the anime, there is no Mega-raichu in the game or anime, the future games, and I don't know if there ever will be one in the future. I just thought it would be cool and got permission from the interactive host to do so.)</span></div></div>",

Even worse, the sunlight through the clear sky help power its solar beam quickly. <i>Oh no..</i> You braced yourself for the imact, but before it could fire, it was dealt with a blow out of nowhere. You realize that Neku has waited for the bayleaf to take it's focus off him and power his strike to hit you then launch night slash at it.

Kate was about to speak, but you shook your head no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach up to Neku. This camp seems pretty enforced, \"How does this work?\" You ask, curious about how things run here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks down at you. \"You got a sharp eye kid. This place was made to help shelter other survivors from the infected. We built that wall to make sure we don't get ambushed, course we still get big attacks now and then, so we need to repair the wall when neccessary. There's guardtowers around some points to let us know of any upcoming threats, so we can get ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you prepare for trouble?\" Rachael ask next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In case of attacks, they'll make calls by having fast runners spread the news, then we gather any pokemon, male or female, who are capable to fight to help the resistance. Children are to move to a safe area and hailed there until further orders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As you were walking, you noticed that Kate was staying close to you, away from Neku. Seems she's nervous about the zoroark, which is weird since she didn't had problems being near him. You are also aware that your friend seems distant from him as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering what this is about, you ask, \"Did anything happened after I lost consciousness?\" Everyone stopped at that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeku takes a deep breath before answering, \"Nothing terrible, but not uneventful.\" You feel a sense of dread at what you'll hear, but you stare at him, intent to know what happened.</span></div></div>",

Ever since the incident, he hasn't regain consciousness for a while. The other two started to panic, especially the pachirisu child. You explained to her that her brother is fine, that he's just resting. That still didn't get her feel better. You understand her concern though, those two are verv fond of each other and Rai has came to her rescue twice. Rachael came to her and calm her down, which seems to work. You're happy at that, you had no idea about how to deal with kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You set the campfire up as Rachael sets her friends sleeping bag on the ground. With that, you place him on it. You can hear his breathing, so nothing's wrong. The buneary places her paw on Rai's forehead, checking for fevers. Kate hugs his neck tightly, silently crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's all right you two..\" You try to reassure them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael looks at you, concern filled in her eyes as she reply, \"I sure hope so.\" She takes another look at Rai, who hasn't made any movements after the strange transformation. One moment he was strong when it happened, but when he reverted back however, he passed out moments after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rai! Wake up! Please wake up!\" Kate keeps shaking his shoulder. His sister has been constantly trying to get her brother up. You shakily place your paw on her shoulder as you try to comfort her. \"He's o-okay! Just sleeping.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you with sad eyes. \"Anybody would wake up when someone shakes them.\" Kate answers, unconvinced by your answer. You flinched, not expecting that, but you thought fast and answer, \"When one's extremely exhausted, they sleep a little longer than usual. He'll wake up soon.\"<i>I hope. He'll wake up, but when?</i> You thought that quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Everyone just hoped you come around soon.(it took some effort to convince Kate to separate from her brother.) Everyone gathered some apples and berries from their packs, since only Rai can cook. Everyone ate in silence. Kate constantly checking up on him to see if he's done anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael looks at you and ask, \"You said you saw what happened to rai before. Where? and What's it called?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou believed it's best to explain it to them. \"Rai has just achieved mega-evolution.\" Rachael ears perked while Kate stares confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mega-evolution?\" Kate ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can answer that.\" Neku turns to Kate. \"Mega-evolution is the ability that allows certain pokemon to evolve further than normally. In order to do so, those who are capable need two types of stones. A mega stone for the pokemon can mega-evolve, and a key stone for the person to use. Two pokemon are required to achieve this. I heard little about this, but I never thought a raichu had one.\" Everyone just shrug their heads.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A noise brakes the silence. You turn your head towards the direction. \"There's someone nearby! I'm going to take a look!\" You say, getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael gets up as well. \"Let me come with you-\" \"No!\" You answer, cutting her off. \"You stay here with Kate. She needs someone she knows with her to comfort her. I'll be back.\" She's hesitant, but doesn't say a word as you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she speaks, \"Why are you-\" she was unable to finish again before you say.\" 'It was the right thing to do.' Your friend said that.\"</span></div></div>",

As he goes, he can't help but recall that battle at the town yesterday. They were searching for anyhing they could bring back to camp then all of the sudden, they were ambushed by the infected. Two of his members were eaten and he would've joined them if it wasn't for those kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It was one thing to defeat them and drive them off, but to also to say it was out of good intentions. Usually when one helps another, usually they want something from you. Trade or robbery, it depends. Also, they intend to save the world. Neku thinks about Rai. You think he's kinda crazy, but he's not stupid that's for certain. He fought very well with the grumpig, despite the blindness and was clever in defeating that ursaring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why,\" He starts off. \"But I think he's got what it takes.\" They'll be a camp soon at this rate, The zoroark ponders what he'll do after they gets there<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A quick snap was heard nearby. Neku reacts and hid by a nearby tree. He looks to see a Mr. Mine nearby. He turned, showing his purple eyes. <i>He's close to the camp!</i> he realized. <i>I need him gone.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With that, he closes his eyes and pictures himself as a mienfoo. The infected sense something and turns to see a small fighting type behind him. seeing a easy prey, it launches a confusion at him, only to flow off him painless. The mime blinked in confusion before he striked him with shadow claw. The infected collapses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After that's over, You dropped the illusion and ponder what to do with him. He's too close to camp and it's not safe to move at night. With that you decided that voring the psychic type is the only option. outside You pick it up and bring his head to your mouth. He tasted good. neku's mouth accommodates to his shoulders as he reach past them. He feels the pokemon shifting inside him as he starts to stir around. You gulp again, getting to his stomach. At this, the infected starts to thrash around, trying to escape. Neku keeps a firm grip, and swallows so he's at his thighs. He kicks and squirms as he makes futile attempts to escape. He gulps down his thighs and legs, leaving his feet dangling inside. with that, he swallows one more time, sealing the infected inside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Neku sighs and licks his lips, clearly enjoying the infected squirming inside his bloated stomach. Now he wonders how to explain this to the others before he turns to find them behind them, with a horrified expression on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit.\" Nekus thought in his head.</span></div></div>",

It's understandable, since your sister born witness something she shouldn't know about until she was older.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You vored someone with them two watching?!?! What's wrong with you?!\" You shout out in anger at Neku. \"I'm not surprise that you're upset.\" Neku said. \"Well of course I'm upset. Kate should not have seen something like that. Although not you're not completely at fault.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to the two watching. \"You shouldn't have followed him! He told you to stay at the camp.\" \"I know, but I heard noise and stuff, then afterwards, so I thought I check up just in case. I didn't mean to!\" Rachael defended herself. The zoroark clears his throat. \"Anyhow , the infected was close by and it was late, and traveling at night is dangerous. What if he stumbled upon the camp and we could've been outnumbered. I didn't want it to come to that Rai, but I didn't really have a choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As much as you don't like it, you know Neku had a point You were unconscious, it was late at night, and it was close to their position. You understand his reason, you just wished poor Kate didn't have to see it. \"You only was thinking about us, so I can see why you did it.\" Neku nods his head. \"Thank you for understanding.\" With that they headed off to the leader's quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The four of them reached a large tent. \"This is where our leader resides. Wait here, I'll let her know you're here.\" Neku prepares to enter, but you said. \"Wait Neku, I have something to ask you.\" He turns to you, waiting for your question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're here at your camp, and you've lost your old group, what will you do? Do you have any plains?\" Neku crosses his arms, he hasn't thought about what he'll do afterwards. You continue, \"Well in that case, will yo join us?\" Neku and your two companions look shocked from your question. \"With your help, we can stop this infection from getting worse.\" You explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeku sighs. \"I appreciate the thought and I hope you succeed, but I can't. I'm not up for a perilous journey.\" You sadden a bit, but you nod your head. \"I understand.\" With that, Neku enters the tent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael looks at you. \"You still wanted him to come with us? Even with what he done?\" She ask. You turn to her. \"It doesn't look like he's lying Rachael. I don't agree with his choice, but there wasn't much time to think.\" Kate pats your arm. \"Um... Rai\" You turn to her. \"Will you ever do the same thing he did?\" You stare at her with horrified eyes for a moment before responding shakily. \"N-No! I wouldn't!\" \"But what if you have to?\" \"I-I mean, he didn't know other ways. I would've had something.\" You say quickly. \"Oh okay.\" Kate says simply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made a mental sigh. You didn't expect her to ask that question. The way she looked at the sight from Neku's discription hit you hard. You clench your paws, vowing to not to vore anyone, infected or not.</span></div></div>",

Not a attack.\" They sigh in relief. Racheal then ask, \"What was it about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh as you say, \"It was..that moment...at the cave.\" Their face lowered a slight. \"Rai-\" \"I know I know, I don't blame myself for what happened, but I can't forget it. I nevered killed anyone before.\" He whispered the last part so Rachael can only hear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand that much, and it looks like a lot to deal with.\" Rachael puts her arms around you in a comforting hug. \"But remember Rai, you're not alone, if you ever need someone to talk to, just tell me.\" You smile at the comforting thought. Rai felt another hug and saw your sister wrapped around his sides. You wrapped your arms around Rachael.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey break the hug as Neku came back out. \"She's ready for you three.\" He told them. With that, they enter the tent. They find that the inside was quite decorated. You felt Rachael huddled behind you. She wouldn't be like this unless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your attention to the pokemon in front of you, who turns out to be a Serperior. \"Welcome newcomers.\" A female voice came out. \"I'm very please to hear you arrived here safe.\" The grass snake turns her head towards Rachael, who was hiding behind you. \"Is something wrong?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael shakes her head. \"N-No it's nothing! It's just..um.\" You sigh as you finish her. \"She had a bad experience with snake pokemon in the past.\" Rachael nods her head as she stayed behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Serperior nods, \"I understand and I apologize for what happened before, but rest assured, I mean you no harm.\" She said calmly. Rachael smiles and moves a bit away from you, but still staying close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So from what Neku has told me, You and your small group came accross his group as they were anbushed, you were unable to save the others but you manage to save him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head. \"Yes. I'm sorry for being unable to save the others.\" You apologize to Neku and the Seperior. She nods. \"Thank you, it's a shame for what happened to them.\" She sighs before continuing. \"So what brings you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Neku wanted us to take us here as payment for saving his life.\" You answered honestly. She turns to him. \"Well, we were actually quite stocked already, but considering what happened. I'm okay with you three staying here, plus I not the kind to let kids out to danger.\" She turned to kate who was next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. \"I appreciate it. We would like a day for rest.\" Her left eye raise a bit. \"Oh? a day? You intend to leave? Why's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look confused at that question, you guess that neku hasn't told her. He sighs as he answered, \"We're looking for the cure for this infection.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe serperior look surprise at the visitor's response. \"You two?\" She ask. The three put up confused. \"We had some in our camp that said they intend to try to stop this, but we haven't heard about them for months.\" She told them. You and Rachael exchanged glances, you're not the only ones who started this. You half expected this though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes a better look at you three,\"How old are you?\" She asked. \"Me and Rachael are 17 while in a week Kate'll be 7.\" You admit. She blinks a couple times to see if this is true. \"You three are so young. Why are you putting yourselfs in danger to do this?\" She ask him that.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I know, and your right, this journey will have danger, but I can't let that stop me. I have a few reasons as to why. One, I made a promise to my parents that I'll stop this and return them to their normal selves.\" Neku blinked at that seeing that this is the first time he heard about anything involving their parents. \"The second reason is because that I can't let us grow up in the world like this. This is something that won't just pass away by waiting. We got to band together and work on stopping this or every normal pokemon will either end up a meal or like the other infecteds out there. I will see things I rather forget, but I can't lose hope just because of that.\" You finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeku and the grass type was at a lost for words from your speech. \"I say, I never heard them say what you said. Well I would wish you well and you three will be welcome here at anytime you need to rest.\" She said, then she also adds, \"Now, Neku told me something interesting about you. Apparently in one of your encounters with a infected, you acheive mega evolution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cross your arms as you recall that moment. \"I never knew I could do that. I know only few can achieve it though, but I don't know much about it though.\" You admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods as she said. \"Well, I don't know much either, but I do know someone who might. There's words of a soothsayer in a town some distance from here who might know something about it, maybe even about this infection. Do you have a map where I can point it out?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and take out your map and show it to her. She smiles and uses her tail to point out the area where you mark it. \"Be warned I haven't heard much about it for a while, so I don't know if she's still there. Do you still want to go?\" You sigh, it's a long shot, but if there's a chance to learn something about those things you should take it. Plus, this is your only lead after the Silverhills clue. \"Yes, we need to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Serperior nods her head. \"I understand. Again, I wish you three a safe journey and best of luck.\" She said that, then the four of you exited the tent.</span></div></div>",

The black fox crosses his arms. 'Hmm, call it a hunch, but I feel like he got what it takes.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking some distance, your small group stopped as you did. You look upwards to see there is still some light out, \"You two like to take a walk around here? Wouldn't hurt to relax now that we have a chance.\" You offered. Rachael looks at her friend for a moment. \"You do have a point. All right then. Let's be back here when it gets dark. Be careful though, we don't know what kind of pokemon are here.\" Rachael nods while saying to be careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point.\" You nod your headn until you felt something nudging your arm. \"Rai, do you mind if I hang out with Rachael?\" Kate asked. \"Oh?\" You asked curious. \"I found she is very nice. I like to hang out with her a little more.\"  You then  thought of somethng. \"Seeing the buneary as a sort of a big sister huh?\" You chuckle as she looks away shyly and your rabbit friend blushing in embarrassment. You rub your sister's head. \"Sure I don't mind if you hang out with her.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nKate smiles as she moved next to Rachael. \"Have fun, and take care of your 'little sister' now.\" You gave her a teasing wink, which rewards you with a playful punch to your elbow. \"Hey!' You  chuckled rubbing your elbow. \"Oh you know we will Rai.\" The two girls giggle as they headed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged your shoulders as you headed off in the different direction. You looked at some pokemon looking at the Raichu, some waved in good manner, others either waved in nervousness or stare, natural for seeing a stranger in tough times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were walking onward when you felt something bump into you from behind. You staggered a bit as you noticed a Purrloin stopping for a moment. \"Sorry, in a hurry.\" it said in a female voice as she runs off. You sighed, \"What's the rush?\" he muttered as he rubs his sore shoulders, when he looked downward he finds this pink bracelet on the ground. You picked it up and wondered did the female cat dropped it. As he looked he noticed his neck felt a bit odd, but when he looked downward, he discovered his medallion's gone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around the ground nearby in a frantic search, <i>I know I had it when I woke up. Where could it-</i> Then your mind wandered to the feline. You!\" He broke off running in her direction. He caught her walking moments later. \"Stop! Thief!\" the dark type turned her head and started running, \"Come back here you sneaky pickpocket!\" The group turn to the sight of the Purrloin being chased by a Raichu. The group resumed their usual stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran as fast as you can, but can't seem to get any distance to the cat. He started to noticed something in the distance, so he moved towards it. The Purrloin looked to see the Raichu gone, she giggles as she made some quick turns on some pathway and enter a large tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe insides contained a lot of barrels and crates, obviously the storage. She sat behind a crate as she takes the Medallion and tossed it up and down, chuckling. \"I was able to lose him.\" \"Lose who?\" a voice said. \"This Raichu kid with this medallion. I bumped into him and swiped it off his surprised form. He chased after me, and I got to say. He was pretty swift considering his chubby look.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brows twitched at the mention of the word. \"That was really fun. I never thought he could keep up.\" She giggled as she tosses it, but then she noticed her arm. \"Shoot, I dropped my bracelet. Better go get it.\" She tossed it up one more time, but didn't felt it drop back. \"Huh?\" she look at her hand to see it's gone. \"Ahem..\" a cough sounded above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up and shocked to see the Raichu from before on top of the crate. \"Oh fuck!\" she jumped up and fell on her rump. You got up and approach her, your paw extending. The cat's eyes widen in fear of getting hurt, but your paw opened to see the familiar bracelet in his paw. \"You dropped this.\" You said to her. \"Huh??\" that was the only thing that got out of her mouth. </span></div></div>",

I would return their stuff to them or the place they were staying in a few hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying that you'll take things for them to chase you around, just for you to have fun, and you would give it back to them even if they lost you? And you expect me to believe you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you didn't, why didn't you try to hurt me, apprehend me or something like that? Also people would've gave chased as well.\" Maggie grinned at the Raichu with a smirk. \"Well you have a point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two smiled and chat a bit until you noticed it was getting dark out. \"It's getting late. While it was a crazy meeting, I was happy to meet you Maggie.\" \"Same he... um name?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Rai.\" You announced. \"Rai... as in.. Rai the Raichu?\" She snickered and started laughing. \"What a odd name. No offence though.\" she said as she shook your hand and headed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh as you pretty much expect that reaction from anybody. Shrugging it off, you head back to the direction you came from, \"Ah shit. I never asked them where would we be staying. I guess I'll head to the leaders tent to ask.\" I pointed out as he headed to the tent.</span></div></div>",

He helped them out when he needed him and they were close to that infected Mr Mine, but it was still disturbing to watch up close. \"I was disturbed by his actions, but Rai explained that he didn't thought of much more ways to help and only tried to keep us safe. So I think he's okay.\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate nod and reached into her bag and took out a apple in her bag and started eating it. \"Hello there.\" A Kirila walked to them and wave. \"Oh... hello.\" Kate waves nudging near to Rachael. \"Sorry for making you nervous.\" The Kirlia bowed in respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. She's like this with new pokemon.\" Rachael pointed out. The Kirlia smiled and sat next to Rachael. \"How did you get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and my friend headed out of Aurora when it was overrun by the infected, we traveled to silverhills as we rescued someone who said they could take us here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" the psychic type said. \"What about your family? Where are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that question, the Pachirisu started to snuffled as she hugs into Rachael closely. The Buneary saddens as she wraps her arms around her. The Kirlia saddens at the scene. \"I'm very sorry for you and your sister. I didn't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not her sister, I'm a friend to her brother.\" Rachael corrects her. \"Her brother? He didn't make it either?\" the Kirlia asked. Rachael shakes her head. \"He's here as well. We're just taking a look around this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kirlia nods. \"I see, well you three are safe here now.\" she said as she look to see that the sun has set. \"I better get going. My mom will get worried if I'm not back. Take care of yourself.\" she said as the psychic type heads off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael and Kate look at the girl leave as they get up as well. \"This place is nice isn't it?\" Kate asked. \"Yeah it is.\" Rachael said as they started to go to the leader's tent to see where'll be able to stay.</span></div></div>",

A Kirlia whos family is here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, this place is pretty nice.\u201d His 6 year old sister said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRai smiles at the words, but look away a bit. \u2018Her family\u2026 I hope ours are okay\u2026 despite being one of the infected.\u2019and Rai said, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s speak to her so we can get our spot to sleep.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three entered the tent and met the Serperior. \u201cPardon me, we would like to know where is a available tent for us to stay in?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, I figured you never asked me about sleeping arrangements. Nikita will escort you.\u201d When the Serperior leader said that, a Meinshao appeared from the left side of the tent. And Rai asked \u201c How could the Meinshao just appear like that huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we have sections of the tent that also go to different rooms.\u201d The Serperior said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIf you three are ready, I can escort you.\u201d she said as she headed towards the entrance and wait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three looked at each other for a moment. \u201cRai, now that we have a moment of peace. We should talk about something.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Raichu looked at his friend. \u201cWhat about?\u201d he asked listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout whether it\u2019s best to leave and go out there again. I know your parents said for you to try to find a cure for this, but when you think about it, there are others who are probably doing the exact same thing. And we\u2019re just kids, we shouldn\u2019t be forcing ourselves through this mess, especially putting little Katherine through this nightmare.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHe Raichu looked at his sister who looked back at him and looked at his medallion. They do have a point that the journey is perilous and they could easily lose their lives for this, but then every day that this world is still suffering is the increased chance they may lose their parents for good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 They did say that, but they would prefer our safety over finding out this mess, but who knows what will happen to us and others.\u201d He said not knowing what is the right thing to do. He recalled what he said to the leader, but now that he thinks about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s been a long day, we\u2019ll decide what to do in the morning.\u201d Rachael said as they looked at the fighting type. They then walked to her and she lead them off to somewhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Meinshao then lead them to a tent. \u201cThere\u2019s 3 beds for you there. I hope you\u2019ll be fine for the night.\u201d Rai nods his head, \u201cThank you for everything.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of them laid down on a makeshift bed and the girls closed their eyes, while the electric type stared up at the tent roof thinking of what to do. \u2018If it comes down to it, I can leave my sister here with someone to look after\u2026 I just\u2026 oh Mom, Dad\u2026 what do I do?\u2019 he thought as he closes his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was being shaken awake by someone, \u201cYou three need to wake up right now!\u201d A voice spoke out being an Machoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?!\u201d Rachael asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInfecteds are attacking the gate!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And with this size, we\u2019ll be in some trouble with some flanks.\u201d The furret responded. \u201cThis is bad, even if we request for help, these pokemon are mostly civilians, we won\u2019t be able to-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll help!\u201d Rai announced to the guards, shocking everyone around them. \u201cRai, wait!

This is no place for a kid to get mixed up in all this, there\u2019s a chance you might have to push even harder than usual.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy father was the captain of my town\u2019s guards. He trained me dilligantly. I can help with the camp\u2019s defenses!\u201d he stated confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook kid-\u201d one said trying to change his mind, \u201cIf those infecteds breach the gates around here, we\u2019ll all be serious trouble. We can\u2019t take that risk!\u201d The Raichu insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group looked at each other and the Raichu for a moment. \u201c... it takes some kind of stones to make it here you three.\u201d The female guard looks at the Buneary. \u201cDo you have any special moves of your own?\u201d \u201cI can use ice beam and charge beam.\u201d Rachael stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure about this?\u201d Rai asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but like you said, we don\u2019t have much choice. It\u2019ll be some time for them to find others.\u201d your friend stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll escort the pachirisu to the underground shelter, we also crafter an escape route through the undergound in case of emergency.\u201d The furret said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrother\u2026\u201d Kate looks at you in worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2026\u201d The Raichu gave her a reasurring pat on the head. \u201cA Voltaire can do anything!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the girl nods and headed with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the gate, Rai and Rachael and a 8 others were gathered. \u201cOkay, we have four pathways some infecteds will be charging from.\u201d A Blaziken said pointing at each of the the different roads that soon intersect into the main road in front of the gate. \u201cWe need to strike at the infecteds that come out to try and breach the gate. If by off chance some get through, we have some ground fighters to deal with them. We only asist if they\u2019re getting overwhelmed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Scyther then passed each pokemon a couple of elixers. \u201cThese will keep you energized and strong, use them only when you absolutely need them! Also if you see infecteds in a group of three or more, try to strike them at the same time! Is that clear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone nods their head and took position. Two pokemon each facing one of the corner. Rai and Rachael was facing one corner together. \u2018Everything will work out.\u2019 Rai thought in his head. \u2018Just keep an eye out for any side that\u2019s getting overwhelmed and attack.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they all saw an pokemon coming towards the gate, from the movement and the intense growling, it was an infected pokemon for sure. The Raichu zapped it with thunderbolt, making it cry out in pain and run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon,  a number of them started walking down different kinds of pathways with every range attacker striking at any ones that were getting close. Some were hitting multiple pokemon at once. \u201cRemember, don\u2019t overexert yourself! Let others attack so you can recollect yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRai was hearing a commotion and noticed a few infecteds fighting some of the guards at the gate. Some having wings like pidgeotto, looking like can climb, etc. The two were slghtly worried, but kept with the gate defense. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of them!\u201d Some speak like that as they started to drink one of the elixirs.

They looked and were shocked to see a couple of flying types entering the area. One of them, a Flygon was carrying a Haxorous as it dropped it into the camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"3 infecteds are entering the camp area!\" One of the guards cried out as he saw some guards heading toward the scene.

They were knocking some of the guards away and consuming a few others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The dragon's bellies are round and moving from the squirming pokemon within, but they don't slow down from the added weight unfortunately. Two dragons, an Altaria and a Flygon, launched themselves towards the teens with said Raichu and Buneary jumping out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragons came together and roared out loudly as Rai and Rachael stood side by side. They quickly looked around the area and realized the remaining guards were knocked away. \"Rai we're the only ones left!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brace yourself, here they come!\" Rai shouted as he saw the dragon's coming to them. Rai dodges an attack with agility and shot a bolt of lightning at it. The Haxorus winced from the attack, but didn't seem really bothered. 'Of course, dragon types are strong against it.' He then yelped when he felt a sonic-boom attack struck him. 'And there's a Flygon in the group too!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Buneary was bouncing to dodge the Alteria's attack, as she uses dizzy punch to try to hit it. The dragon type winces from the blow as it shakes its head. Rachael was going for another one, but was blasted by the dragon's disarming voice, knocking her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRai and Rachael were standing against the dragon types, panting a little, but standing strong as they slowly approached. \"This could be troubling. Any ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well dragon types are strong against my electric attacks, I do have non-electric type moves, but we're outnumbered two to three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then perhaps, I'll even the odds.\" A familiar voice spoke and they saw Neku getting to their side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neku!\" Rachael cried out smiling a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad holding on despite the odds.\" Neku said getting to stance. \"Though can you two keep it up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not done yet!\" Rai announce. \"Let's go!\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He then let out a gasped as he felt one vine wrapped around his member and started stroking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushes as he was turned to see the Bayleef still drooling, but in a mix of hunger and lust in its eyes. Rachael was being molested with some vines rubbing her folds and breast.

He stares in dread as the infected opens his mouth and places his head inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael trembles as she still tries to break free, but the vines kept her limbs pinned together as she\u2019s forced to watch her friend being eaten. Rachael then let out a yelp as she felt something rub under her leg. She looks down and her eyes widen as she saw a vine underneath her thighs and rubbing at her folds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRai\u2019s body was squirming as his body was covered in saliva and some drips from the Bayleef\u2019s mouth, hitting the ground. He shudders in disgust as he felt his body starting to descend down the throat, his lower body still barely out his mouth. His form making a bulge in the grass type\u2019s throat as soon his hind paws and tail slid into his mouth and started to go down his long neck. Eventually the Raichu was settled within the plant\u2019s stomach. It was very warm, and it squeezed around him as he struggled within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bayleef looks at the Buneary as it moves her on her back and walks over her. She can see its belly squirming around as his friend futilely struggles to escape. She whimpers and shakes as she sees the infected grass type\u2019s throbbing member lining up her pussy. \u201cN-No no! Please!\u201d she pleaded, but the grass type plunged his cock inside, making her cry out in a mix of pain and pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bayleef thrust hard and fast, grinding his belly to her body as it gurgles and churns, preparing the digestion process. Rachael grunts and groans as she\u2019s pinned down from the infected\u2019s weight. She blushes and shudders in unwanted pleasure as the Bayleef uses its vines to rub against her chest as pre leaks from the tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael gasped and moans as the thrusting gets more intense as her face was blushing red. Tears formed down her eyes as memories of her friends and families back home rushed to her head, regretfully knowing that she\u2019ll never be able to see them again as she jolted and groaned as she climaxed, the Bayleef crying out as it spills its tainted seed inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shuddered as she passed out from all that as the grass type let itself out and left the rabbit to change alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----I----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\"><i>That\u2019s how it all came to an end.

He stared at the sight with horror, but he also felt something rubbing at his lower area. He looks down to see a vine starting to rub against his groin as another is going towards his butt. \"N-N-No, n-not that.\" He muttered as he looked down and clearly see a drooling member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't faring well for Rachael either as the Bayleef had half her form in his mouth, feeling his salivating tongue moving around as he gulped her down more.

Rai's worst fears have been realized as he felt the member starting to grind against his tailhole, smearing his pre. Before he can try anything, he yelped when he felt the tip started to shove into his rear end. He squirmed from the painful sensation, the pre making it slightly manageable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bayleef was at the buneary's mouth when she whimpered as she slid further in and started to move as the bulge in the throat and into his stomach. As the Bayleef continues to rape the Raichu, he can feel the struggling movements of her friend within trying to escape her fate. 'Raped by an infected.. not a great way to go..' Rai thought shamefully as he felt his own member hardening and moaning in unwanted pleasure. 'At least my sister isn't here to see this.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pants and moans as the grass type continues to use him until he felt him shuddering and a torrent of thick seed begun spilling into his bowels.

'Rachael must be passing out.'

As he enters, the tongue unwinds around you and licks you all over. You wince from the feeling as you sink down deeper into him.

What happened?\" Your little sisters asks you as she clings onto Rachael's leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grunt as you pick out the thin needle from your fur and toss it away, wincing from the ache it put into your shoulder, but thankfully it wasn't anything serious or bleeding. \"Back away! There's something in here!\" You exclaim to them as you increase the light just a bit farther. To your horror, you notice something strange about the walls and ceiling of the cavern once you spot several silk, white strands covering around the rocks. They soon change into more collected patterns until the light shines on a massive spider web littered with several shriveled up cocoons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael eeps at the sight and helps Kate to look away from them, shuddering in place. You glance up to scan around at the web before two purple dots glimmer in the light. Your thin fur spikes up at the sight of a large Ariados spider clutched on the ceiling of the cavern, looking down at the three rodents and hissing at them with drooling jaws. A drop of its hot saliva drips onto your face, making you wince and wipe it off with your arm as you order again, \"Rachael! Take Kate and go! I'll deal with this thing, just make sure she gets somewhere safe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spider unlatches from the web to land on front of you with a heavy, rock crumbling slam, jabbing its sharp appendages into the ground with each step. You gulp a heavy weight down your throat as you power more electricity into your cheeks, ready for a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Buneary holds your sister close, but asks, \"Y-You sure you can take that thing? I can help and fight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance back, \"Did I stutter? Make sure she's far and safe first!\" The Ariados charges forward with its maw open wide, but thankfully you unleash a storm of bolts at it with your Thundershock to send it skittering back a few steps. The rabbit nods and grabs Kate, tugging the squirrel with her as they run away. '<i>It's okay, I got this. I'm a Voltaire. We can do anything</i>!' You reassure yourself in your head as the large spider shakes away the static and hisses at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharging up for another attack, you release another blast of your voltage for the Ariados to see coming, leaping out of the way and charging forward with venom leaking from its fangs. Lashing your tail around in a spin, you quickly retaliate with an Iron Tail attack to smash its end upon the Ariados' head. Whipping it back, you meet its head again to smash against to send the spider toppling over on its side with a loud grunt. You wince after the hit strangely, feeling a sudden moment of weakness, yet you quickly shake your head and retain your focus. You simply brush it off as your body reacting to the intimidating spider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush in for a quick attack to pound the spider's exposed underbelly to have it cough out some of its venom, only then to have it wrap its four appendages around your body. It squeezes you tightly against it for a crushing hug while you squirm and wail, trying to escape its grasp. The spider reveals a happy grin as it drools onto your face to which you retaliate with another Thundershock. The powerful electicity surging through its body forces the spider to let you go and step back again, shuddering in a few spasms from the voltage. You land back on the ground and stand back up, ready to deliver the final blow, all until your head begins to rock inside your head with your vision suddenly become clouded. Feeling a random wave of sickness over you, your body falls onto one knee as you struggle to keep back up and keep your attention to the Ariados. The purple-eyed arachnid hisses dominantly as its slowly creeps closer and closer to you with your body stunned from your drained strength and senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>What? H-How is this happening? I almost had it too</i>!' You try to comprehend in your thoughts, all until you remember that pin needle hitting you earlier. It was a Poison Sting attack, and the spider had leaked poison into your body. You get back onto your feet and continue your efforts to win, but the Ariados simply raises its abdomen and shoots out silk strands from the stinger. Sticky webbings rope out and glue right onto your chest and pudgy belly, causing you to gasp and squirm helplessly having lost the urge to fight and wanting to just survive at this point. The spider then tugs at the strings for you to be pulled forward, twirling from the motion even as you hit the ground on your chest. The act has your arms pinned to their sides with the web strands lassoed around your chest and belly, leaving you to the spider's mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-N-No! I can't lose now!\" You cry out and wriggle like a worm on the ground, however the poison in your system keeps you from making any progress on the sticky rope trapping you. The Ariados seems to almost cackle in its victory and happily approach your down body to roll you over onto your backside with its large form mounting and straddling your firmly down.

Your eyes widened and your cheeks blushed from shock as you see your feet and knees in the spiders nethers. 'What the heck!?\" You exclaimed loud.

When she reached passed your belly, she stopped for a moment. You stopped to wondered for a moment before you fell yourself being lefted upwards, then back down and repeat. <i>She's using me like a dildo.</i> You thought as she continues. Being used as a sextoy severely damages your pride, not to mention the action and warmth from her vagina gave you a erection, but maybe that was all she wanted.  <i>Maybe she just wanted a toy or something. At least no one knows about this.</i> You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All of a sudden you hear a gasp behind you. You strain your head to see a familiar buneary watching the scene. You quickly turn your head away blushing. Rachael just stood there, shocked to see her friend in the spiders clit. <i>Oh crap! Why is she back?</i> You thought, but then you remember that you told her to come back when your sister was safe. 'Rachael! Help me!\" You cried out. Hoping to get out of this awkward situation. The rabbit snapped backed to reality and prepared to attack, but the ariados jumped up back into her web and started climbing. She tried to jump on her, hoping to get the spider down, but it got to high up. 'Rai! No!\" Rachael screamed into the darkness. 'Run! Get out of here! Keep my...\" the buneary couldn't hear anymore. Realizing that staying here is fatal, she turn back before it could come get her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Back to you, you head was swallowed before you can finished saying. The spiders fluids soak in your silk cocoon, getting you drenched in her juice. The warmth and movement as you sink into her rubs around you, adding unwanted pleasure. Your breathing increases, your lenient leaking precum from the cocoon. Eventually, you couldn't hold back any longer as you climax, staining the cocoon as you reached her womb. It tightens around you, sealing any small movements you can make. Your vision starts to blurry from the lack of air. As it darkens you wondered if thing would've ended differently if you let Rachael stayed or not been overconfident and careless and cured the poison. It too late for that now. As you passed out, a tear coming out of you eye as your sister came to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----l----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And that's the end of my story. We were traversing through a cave when we were attacked by an infected Ariados. I told Rachael to get my sister someplace safe while I dealt with it. I was handling the spider very well, but my overconfidence blinded me of the poison that the Ariados had inflicted on me from her first attack. I felt weakened and fell down which it took advantage of. I was swallowed up by her pussy which took me by surprise at first time, especially when Rachael caught us. It was warm and pleasant to be honest and I could've ended with worse, but I would never be able to found out who caused this and stop it. All because my cockiness brought me to the Ariados slit.</i></span></div></div>",

Yelping aloud and falling to your rear on the ground, your shoulders are grabbed and pinned to the trunk of the tree as the Simipour mounts himself over you to prevent any escape. The back of your skull pounds like obnoxious door-knocking as your spine aches from the stressful crash of the impact you had earlier, but all was only to grow worse for you as the water-type uses a Headbutt to pound each other's skulls down, hurting you more than it by the force. You yip another alarming sound again as your battered groaning is joined with the cruel and joyous murring from the Simipour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Get off of me, you fr-freak...! What do you want?!\" You try grumbling out, struggling to find the focus and energy for another electrical shock attack. The purple-eyed anthro appears to ignore your cry and just sits there, breathing over your face oddly with an open and salivating maw, eyeing your slightly chubby body as well that can only terrify you more about this guy. \"Y-You beat me, okay? Now just...let m-me go!\" You can only hope that this weirdo was in it for a fight just to prove some kind of point or just needed to release some anger, and as much as it was humiliating to lose a fight and be some freak's punching bag, at least your sister was alright. Kate stood a few meters away with horrified eyes and forepaws cupped over her open mouth. The squirrel could only stand there and shiver terribly with seeing her brother attacked and corner like this, just waiting for anything to happen to where you could defeat the Simipour. He however begins to sniff randomly at you, nosing around at your face and neck to collect your scent together that just forces you to try and squirm away from underneath the strange monkey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, he quickly intensifies his vice grip against your imprisoned arms with his glowing eyes glaring at you with their satanic violet hue. You feel your thin fur actually prickle some and a heavy weight to drop in your throat as it suddenly opens its mouth and drags its tongue over one of your pudgy cheeks. You gasp as the man licks you, only to have another one smear fatly over your entire face this time around. Wincing and coughing a bit as it went over your own mouth, you thrash even more and attempt to kick him away with your large hindpaws. This guy was obviously bad news, and you knew that poor Kate couldn't do anything about it either. Things take a turn for the worst as you actually look at the Simipour to see it smiling; not just smiling, but has an entirely amused expression on its face seeing you squirm helplessly under him like this propped up against the tree. Kate gasps again before taking a few steps back, making you only worriedly curious as to what she has seen now. You regretfully peer down to spot a throbbing boner pulsating with arousal as it drips with hot pre to the ground in between the Simipour's legs. This only has your wet cheeks glow red and your ears to fold back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Th-this freak is...he's...he's going to rape me</i>!' You stress in your mind as the primate's head lowers a bit down. There, you feel that same, rough tongue of his tuck in between your thighs and drag all the way over your crotch to elicit a surprised \"Mnnnyahhh~!\" from your mouth. The Simipour is only encouraged from your moan to begin lapping away at your groin to involuntarily rouse something dark inside of your. You kick and squirm, yet your muscles just seem to fail you in power, doing nothing for you as you sit their and twitch them at their best. With enough of the Simipour's constant tongue-massaging, your body is unable to hold back from your penis to begin erecting out and pulsing with ashamed arousal as you simply lay on the ground, defeated and molested by this creepy man in the woods in front of your sister. You roll your head over to Kate, groaning, \"Ahhhh...! K-Kate, run and go get help-nyahhh...! Hahhh...!\" You struggle to demand as the Simipour's hungry mouth slurps and smears over the wiggling cock stretching towards the sky. Your sister takes a moment to even respond with tear-filled eyes before nodding and dashing away as fast as she could. Even then, you're still impressed by her speed. Aid would definitely come to you soon, but you just hope it wouldn't be too late. The fear and shame you feel of now being left alone with this molester in the woods piles within your mind, wondering what else this creep was up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, the Primate seems to finish on his binge of licking your member, leaving a thick glaze of warm drool dripping from it as it pre's some onto your belly. Your cheeks resemble more of a Pikachu's now with how much embarrassed blood was burning within them now, and you even catch yourself panting some. \"Pl-please just...stoooop...\" You beg once more. Although the Simipour merely then cups his hands around your hips, making one long and heavy stride of his tongue to snake over your pudgy white belly, over your chest, up your neck, and stops at your heaving lips. There, you feel his hands exploring up your body more that forces you to cringe when all of a sudden his mouth suckles around yours, and your tongues meet each other. His muscles wrestles yours down, sucking and slurping loudly as you wetly gag into the muffling mess of what you think is supposed to be a kiss. Saliva spills out from your ravenous mouths to dribble a bit over your chins some while you do your best to try and shake your head away, but to no avail. You are as good as his now. The Simipour pulls away for a moment, catching his breath with drool watering from his maw hotly to vapor over your blushing face. Whimpering at the moment, maybe this won't be too bad. As scarring as it could be, he showed no more signs of being life-threatening. Perhaps if you let him have his way with you, it could be just left as that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infected, however, had different plans. His hands creep back around your shoulders as his face leans in again with an open mouth. '<i>Uh-oh, h-here it comes...another gross kiss...</i>' You think to yourself as you prepare yourself for another round by shutting your eyes tightly and tilting your head poorly away from the Simipour. As you had planned, his lips meet yours again to pucker over and strangely suckle at like an insatiable hunger at your mouth. That slimy tongue invades your mouth, violating you to taste all of your insides that he could get before his mouth grows a bit wider. To your surprise, your whole face seems to feel his jaws expanding around it and not just your mouth this time. Your entire view is obscured in dark, rippling flesh! You squirm with all of your might again as you panic from what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Is...is he eating me</i>?!' Your thoughts ring out. But alas, the best you can do to pose a fight to the primate are mere fidgets and twitches. His fat tongue rolls over your grunting face and smooshes around at your fat cheeks for a slimy shower that strangely only made your cock wobble harder. You didn't know if it was from the fear or the actual pleasure you seemed to get out of this. The Simipour wastes no time once he had Raichu meat in his mouth, and the monkey begins dining at your hide with loud, heavy gulps. Your head slides into the tightening gullet of your molester as your chest and shoulders enter, rendering your arms useless anyways against your sides. With no need to hold those limbs any longer, the Simipour grapples his hands at your butt cheeks to squeeze and push up on to quicken the time of his lunch, which only entices a loud squeak from your mouth and your hindpaws to scrunch as a reaction. The tongue bathes over your sensitive belly and cock, grinding it on the bed of tastebuds to squirt out pre in his mouth to your displeasure. You pant in the thin, warm air left in the Simipour's system with the gurgling of his stomach reaching ever so closer with each passing swallow. Your rear and thighs enter inside, leaving the primate to simply toss his head back to let your squirming legs and hindpaws to sink into the depths of their doom to leave your long tail just limply hanging from his wet maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are crammed into his gut to where the walls enclose around you and keep you to the point of restraining you from even moving. Your body is forced to curl up in a ball as you lay against your back inside the groaning small chamber, feeling warm liquids pouring inside some to fill half of the stomach with the soup. Whining and thrashing, you can't help but just jiggle about in the slimy walls and sloshing stomach, to where on the outside the Simipour rests down on his rear against the tree to where you previously were, still with your limp tail dangling out from his smiling, fanged mouth. Licking around it as a last taunt to you, he finally slurps it down like a noodle to join you and the rest of your tomb. Losing air and willpower, you struggle to understand how this happened, or if anyone could save you. Yet it wouldn't matter, as you pass out with the memories of all of your training being for nothing and losing to this superior predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And that's the end of my story.

She got startled a bit, but started running in the direction of your home. The houndoom saw her running, but you stopped him from pursuing her by using thunder wave to paralyze him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You won't lay a claw on her!\" You yell out, but then you were knocked down by a hondour's tackle attack. It climbed on top of you and repeatedly tried to bite you, but you managed to keep his teeth away. You threw him off and barely jumped out of the way of a overheat attack, just singeing the tip of your tail. When you get up you notice you're surrounded by them and the houndoom. With no other options, you use your thunder attack that hit all of them around you. Afterwards, you kneeled down, trying to catch your breath. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Huff...huff...huff...  that was.. huff.. close.\" You took a quick look around to see everyone lying down. You let out a sigh of relief. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Okay, I better get home before-Aaugh!\" You felt a stream of intense heat on your back as you were propelled to the ground. You tried to get up, but are unable too. <i>Dammit, I must've used much more power than I expected.</i> You thought as you see the houndoom approaching you. You tried once again to stand up, but fell back down shocked as you felt him...</span></div></div>",

You have no idea what's going on with him, but you have a bad feeling about that liking. As you try to get up for the third time, the houndoom plants his paw firmly on your back. You feel a singeing pain from the burn he made. You fall back down on your stomach, the pain to unbearable for you to take. As he returns to licking, you got another idea and thought: <i>It's the only hope I got left.</i>, so you proceed to kick him in his jaw in hopes he gets knocked out. As you lunged your left foot though, he opens his mouth ridiculously wide to take in your foot and bites down. You scream in pain from his teeth piercing your skin, blood leaking out. He forces your right foot into your mouth and starts swallowing your feet in. <i>He's..he's going eat me?!?! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You struggled and scream for help as loud as you can, but seeing as you're on your stomach and your up to your thighs in his mouth, there's hardly anything you can do right now. When he reached your waist, the houndoom paused and started licking at your groin. You winced when his tongue rubbed around your cock. You soon become erect from his licking and become stiff between your body and his tongue. Blushing madly from the pleasure he's giving you, you yelled \"Hey knock it off! I'm not your toy!\", but the duel type continued to lick around your penis relentlessly. You started panting and moaning from his licking, and in no time you climax, spraying your seed all over in his mouth. He growled lightly, seemingly liking the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After forcing you to climax, the houndoom resumes swallowing you. You picked up from this and try to use thundershock against it, but you don't have enough power to pull it off.<i> No, this can't be! I don't wanna die here!</i> You started to struggle frantically for any hope to escape, but the houndoom keeps a strong grip of his mouth at your shoulders. When he reached your head, he gave you final few licks on your faces as you started forming tears in your eyes. You can smell the scent of your semen in his mouth. Satisfied of your taste, the houndoom gave one last swallow, he sealed your head and your fate, into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As you reach the stomach, you made one last attempt to use any electric attack you can, trying your hardest to pull it off, but all you got was a tiny spark from you. Feeling lightheaded and with tears rolling down your eyes, your final thought before losing consciousness was: <i>I'm sorry Mom, Dad, Kate, I let you all down. Please be safe.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And that's the end of my story.

You then again shake violently in an effort to avoid being raped, but the houndoom held firm and lunged forward, sinking his cock into you. You cried out in pain as he thrusts himself inside you. He started to slide back, just to slam back into you. You gripped the ground tight, tears leaking and teeth barring cause of the painful and humiliating experience. The houndoom started to speed up, bumping faster and faster. Unable to hold back, you orgasm, letting your seed spill out on the ground. Right after you, the houndoom climaxed as well his seed filling and slightly expanding your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter it finished, your rapist slid itself out, knocked you down hard and ran off. You stand up, rubbing your sore ass. \"Shit, I can take losing a fight, but that's just cruel.\" You wiped the excess cum off of you and proceeded to walk home, resolving to clean up before anyone finds out. As you walked a good distance from your campsite, the world around you started to spin, your head in intense pain. \"Augh, I don't feel so good, what's-\" You don't finished as you fall to the ground unconscious.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 You live in a world flourished with anthro pokemon, with villages and beautiful landscapes at every turn. But the world is not as peaceful as it seems. A strange infection has all of a sudden occurred, making pokemon turn violent and hungry for reasons unknown. They become unaware of their actions and lustfully hunt for food and even <i>toys</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimple rules that you should be able to follow as a potential writer for this interactive, hopefully:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- When I say <i>anthro pokemon</i>, what I mean is that they're <i>bipedal</i>, (walks on two legs), and nothing else is changed about the pokemon unless the pokemon is already small. If the pokemon is small, let's say, a Minun or Meowth, than their height must be raised to at least average of short human height. (4'6\" or something like that.) The only thing human about these pokemon is <i>how they stand</i>, and their human <i>emotions</i>. (Possibly their fore paws can become hands if need, for example, a Bulbasaur would need its forepaws changed since they're merely circular stubs.) I'm sorry for people who are confused about that. :[<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- There are <b>NO HUMANS</b> in this story. <b>NO HUMANS</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Originally infected Pokemon couldn't speak nor act normally, but I'm just gonna say fuck it and you can do what you like as author. Go crazy with what the infection of a ravenous, arousing apocalypse is to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Not all Pokemon have to be an anthro since there are strange exceptions for you to use normal pokemon if they have no bipedal form such as a Weepinbell, or Horsea. There are plenty of these types of Pokemon, but please, focus on bipedal stable Pokemon. <b>If you want, all the pokemon in your story <i>can</i> be normal</b>. Just be sure you note that when starting your story. Thanks. You rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- This story is to be told in 2nd person or 3rd person, (2nd POV Example: You dig into your bag to find a berry that you can feed yourself with.) (3rd POV Example: Mary digs into her bag to find a berry that she can feed herself with.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- This is a vore interactive, which means, all types of vore are allowed, <b>EXCEPT FOR HARD VORE</b>. That kind of vore is more disturbing to others than appealing. Oh, by the way, for authors who write unbirthing options. Unbirthing in this story means once the victim is slid up into the predator's vagina, they slowly dissolve away inside the womb into cum, basically like cock vore. The whole 'reborn as a child' thing is just dumb and wouldn't fit in this story. Then again, being devoured by a vagina is also a little stupid, but still! No rebirth, just cum-digestion. Cool beans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- The kind of world in Viral is is set in kind of like a feudal-esque time, where houses were just tents/cabins/small buildings of stone or clay and electronics didn't exist. No cars, skyscrapers, advanced technology, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Sex is allowed, M/M, M/F, F/F, take your pick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- All generations of Pokemon are allowed. Go nuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- <b>NO GROWING, TRANSFORMING, OR SHRINKING</b>. Please don't use this fetish for this story. Most of the other interactives on this site have it, so please, add there and all. Not here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- I will allow <i>large-ish</i> pokemon, but not like, \"The Pikachu was 500 ft. tall!\" And crap like that. If the pokemon is already a large pokemon, like a Snorlax, Lugia, etc., then they can be twice to triple the size of your character, but no giants! Like the first rule states, you can't have super small pokemon either. This ain't that kind of freak-show interactive. It's a different kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Please have a good grasp on the English language and use correct grammar. Spelling, punctuation, capitalization, sentence structure, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- No few sentence chapters, (Example: Then the Golduck ate you and you were delicious. <b>THE END</b>. *claps frantically to self for a job well done.*)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Infected anthro Pokemon cannot talk. They can growl, moan, etc. but they are incapable of speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Digestion persists in this world so endosoma isn't really the gimmick here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Your character can also eat others. Having your character as both predator and prey is highly encouraged to give some variety, but I certainly won't force you to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Specific kinks that aren't banned such as pawplay, watersports, bondage, etc. are allowed and welcomed too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Death is allowed, and injuries are okay for your character, but try not to write an entire page about the pain and agony of characters' bones breaking or something along those gory lines. Just keep it vague or keep it quick. I'd rather not make this into a full snuff story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Scat is allowed. So yeah. Just try to keep your story focused on vore though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- If you notice that there are empty chapter options that the author of the storyline had left for whatever reason and you have the urge to add to it, then you MUST ask the author of that storyline for permission to write it. Only their approval can allow you to write the chapter, otherwise, it will be deleted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- The first chapter will explain how the infected work. Take whatever liberties as you may with such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Enjoy reading the story! Please do!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----|----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n- <i>December 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2019: Viral has reached over <b>1,000,000</b> chapter views! Props to all who have read, added, rated, reviewed, and pleasured themselves to this story. Seriously, holy crap. To think I spontaneously made this interactive years ago without ever thinking I'd get far into it. While I wish I worked at a faster rate, I'm still happy with how large of an interactive Viral has become, and that goes for all of the other storylines fellow authors have written.
