They came in to the hotel lobby where you were waiting for an elevator and kidnapped a small group of international politicians. There was gunfire and the power went out and everyone was running around screaming. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nIn all the confusion, you are hit in the head from behind. When you wake up, you are in the back of a van with your hands tied behind you. There are others in the van with you. Some are unconscious and all have their hands tied. One of the prisoners offers to untie you if you help untie him.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nWhat will you do?\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",
