None of her colleagues at the school were interested in taking over management of the center. The center didn't generate any revenue, so the town council left it empty. Mrs. Richardson had spent many years looking after the local youths in this building, so it wasn't a surprise to anyone that she wanted her funeral services and reception to take place here. It wasn't clear who, if anyone, owned the property at this point, but no one objected to opening it back up one last time for a beloved town figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The teacher, Mrs. Richardson, was loved by most current and former residents of West Lancoal, but the community center had never received as much attention. It was perched on a hill visible from the town's central square opposite the school where Mary Richardson taught. In the building's prime, it had been a hot spot for the town. There was a field for sports in the back, and a gymnasium inside. The basement had pool tables and other games kids could entertain themselves with after getting out of school. Parents knew their children would be safe playing at the center. However, as time passed, fewer kids seemed interested in the building. Parents were becoming more paranoid about letting their children run free as the world appeared to become more dangerous. Several new restaurants with event halls moved into the town, so few people booked the center for functions. Mrs. Richardson still kept opening the community center for as long as she was able, but the town cut her funding as fewer and fewer people took advantage of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Becca loved the building in its empty state, and spent so much time here as a kid. Crowds were her bane, but being at home in the Stewart household was nearly as stressful. The community center was a safe, quiet space for her to be herself, and Mrs. Richardson was a calming presence within. As much as she loathed to return to her hometown, Becca was absolutely going to pay her respects to the woman she sometimes regarded as something like a mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Many other citizens from Langcoal, current and former, held the same adoration for Mrs. Richardson. The quiet gymnasium of Becca's youth was crowded and noisy. Old men crowded around the the outside doorway as they chatted about sports. Women she had avoided in High School were still gossiping in the bathroom. Becca wondered if their entire lives had been spent making lavatories miserable for everyone trying to hide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her heart was thumping out of control, and the bright lights were giving the young woman a headache, but there were people everywhere. She couldn't find any place to collect herself. With its guardian angel gone, the cherished sanctuary from her youth had been invaded by all of the demons it had protected her against. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0If Becca didn't find some place to catch her breath, alone, the anxiety would certainly cause her to explode.</span></div></div>",

She listened for any sounds, but her racing heartbeat made it difficult to concentrate. Becca meekly stepped around the corner and let loose a sigh of sweet, sweet relief. It was empty in the basement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Strolling past the water bubbler, between the broken air hockey tables and the empty pool table, Becca recalled memories or this place from her youth. Before she could get too lost in her memories, the sound of voices started to approach from the second staircase, which lead up to the gymnasium. Becca dashed to the corner and ducked down behind the air hockey table, dropping her butt straight on the dusty floor. She pulled her head down with her arms, and tried to make herself as small as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The voices came closer, and stopped in the doorway. An older voice said, \"Yeah, you're right. The sticks and pool balls are gone. Maybe there are keys to the storage room in the office.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Please, honey. \" a second man's voice replied. \"We are here for a funeral. You are not spending the night shooting pool in a gross basement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"You're right, I'm sorry. Let's go.\" The voices continued, but finally moving away. Becca knew they probably wouldn't be the last curious visitors to the basement tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why did I hide,\" Becca asked herself. She was shaking intensely. \"How would I explain myself if someone saw me hiding like this? What's wrong with-\" Becca opened her purse and started digging through it quickly, searching for something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The invaders' conversation sparked a repressed memory from when Becca was a teenager hiding out at the center. In order to avoid going home, she would often stick around as late as she possibly could. When closing time came around, Becca would help Mrs. Richardson clean up the center to buy another ten minutes. It had become such a regular occurrence... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0... That Mrs. Richardson had given her a key to the storage closet. Becca's hand emerged with her keyring, which had too many keys which no longer unlocked anything. She darted through it until she spotted it. An old duplicate padlock key with the word \"Storage\" engraved on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0On the far wall of the dimly lit basement, a there was a large wooden door with a metal latch and a padlock. The padlock was surprisingly less dusty than the surrounding area. \"Ugh. Someone probably changed the lock. But...\" Becca cautiously stuck the old key into the lock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It fit inside, snugly! But would it turn? Becca held the padlock in her right hand and attempted to turn it gently with her left hand, but it wouldn't twist free. It was the wrong key, and she could hear set of footsteps descending down the stairs. She turned to run to her corner again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0No! Becca flashed back to the old days again. Mrs. Richardson always had trouble getting this lock open. That's why she gave Becca the key. A gentle turn wouldn't do it. Fumbling with the lock,  Becca twisted the key to the point it looked like it was about to snap, and the lock popped up! She pulled the padlock out of the latch, and quickly slipped inside the storage room, shutting the door behind her, just as another person had entered the basement.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Greetings, readers! I've been writing body swap interactives with everyone on WDC for close to two decades now. This is yet another, but this time I'd like to try and push myself a bit to improve the quality of my writing in this very narrow field. This is primarily meant as a personal project, but I will still be leaving it open for public additions as well. I very often hit walls when writing my own stories, but sometimes another writer's addition can really inspire me to continue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBranching off of the opening chapter of the main path, I will have a 'Feedback and Ideas\" form. If you have suggestions or ideas, but don't necessarily feel like writing them yourself (That's why folks add an endless number of option chapters to other stories, right?) feel free to post them in that area, and I may take inspiration from you! If you have an idea you'd like to write yourself, but the chapter map in one of the main stories doesn't give you the option, let me know here or by email and I'll tweak it so you can join in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Personal Goals for this Story</b> (Posted here, to remind myself while I am writing) <br>\r\n <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/buttonplay.png\" alt=\"*ButtonPlay*\" title=\"ButtonPlay\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> Writing more fleshed out, consistent characters with real stories and arcs to them.<br>\r\n <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/buttonplay.png\" alt=\"*ButtonPlay*\" title=\"ButtonPlay\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> Better quality of writing. I tend to get very anxious about writing chapters that are too long, and won't get read. For this project, I intend to treat each story chapter as a single page, rather than a summary as I tend to do.<br>\r\n <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/buttonplay.png\" alt=\"*ButtonPlay*\" title=\"ButtonPlay\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> Add meaningful splitting paths, when they actually make sense. In most stories, I feel pressured to add several options at the end of each chapter. That pressure is even greater now that I can add more than just two on a single chapter. Story splits should be the result of a character choice, I believe, rather than just a checklist of possible outcomes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
