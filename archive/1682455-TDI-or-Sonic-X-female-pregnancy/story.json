She knew that they were both under age but the moment was absolutely perfect. They bumped into each other in Cream's room because Chris was doing chores and his chore was to get laundry. Cream was there because she was playing with her toys. They met each other's eyes and Chris started playing with her dress. She said to excuse her for a moment and when she came back out, she was naked. Chris saw this and he got a boner. Cream sat on him and put her arms around Chris and looked at him seductively. Chris picked her up in his arms and put her on her bed and took his pants off. One thing led then led to another. Cream smiled at the memory. 'It's a shame Chris had to go to school,' she thought. 'We will probably continue this,' she thought and she smiled at the thought. <br>\r\n<u>A couple of weeks later</u><br>\r\nCream was at the doctors. She wasn't feeling good, and decided to find out what was wrong. Plus, her feeling sick was messing up her love time with Chris. She saw her doctor and had tests performed on her. The doctor came back with a weird look on his face.<br>\r\n\"What's wrong doctor?\" Cream asked.<br>\r\n\"Ms. Cream, I don't know how to say this, but I guess congratulations are in order. Ms. Cream your... pregnant.<br>\r\nWhat is Cream's reaction?</span></div></div>",

She then put her hand on it and started rubbing it. 'Wow, 'she thought. 'I have a baby in there.' She found a bench and sat down. She had all these questions running through her head.
