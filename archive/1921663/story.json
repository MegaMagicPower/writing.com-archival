This so boring!</i> Jack though to himself, walking up and down the tables of the indoor Flea Market.<br>\r\n<i>I know Mom and Dad wanted to spend more time with me, since I took this year off from College. But I was hoping we could do something more... not sucky</i> he thinks to himself, digging through the various boxes and tables of various knickknacks, oddities and used items that litter the dozens if not hundreds of tables in the Flea Market. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>At least, I had hoped that would have something that interested me. Old video games, comic books, toys, ANYTHING, I mean, what am I going to do with a old stained tea cozy?</i> He thinks to himself picking up a stained tea cozy that a nice old lady was selling for a mere five cents on the table in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put it back, and then quietly walked away from the table, and off into the massive Flea Market his parents has suggested they come to. Jack Dale Jr, 24 years old, often wondered how different his life would be if he had any brothers or sisters. While, he did enjoy being an only child at times, (he was spoiled nearly rotten as a kid), he often worried about his parents getting older without someone to care of, or to take care of them, reversely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They're lonely</i> he though to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis father Jack Dale Sr, and his mother Amanda Dale, were hard workers. His father was a high-level manager at his company, while his mother worked at one of the biggest banks in the nation. Of course, they didn't start like that, working their way up from the bottom. They always wanted a large family, but their plans of providing Dale with brothers and sister came to a grounding halt as their jobs gave them more and more responsibilities, and eventually, it just never happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best laid plans of Mice and Men\" they always say. Still, Jack did feel a little sorry for their loneliness. as he continued to walk through the flee market. <br>\r\nEventually, a bizarre table caught his attention out of the corner of his eye, covered with burning candles, skulls, and black velvet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLAVERN'S LAIR OF THE OCCULT was sprawled on the table, while heavy-metal music blasted through the speakers attached to an MP3 player. A 20-something dressed in all black, covered in make-up and mascara, his face full of piercings, looks at you, while banging his head to the heavy-metal coming form the speakers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome! Seeker Of The Dark and Unknown! Welcome To Laverns' Lair Of The Occult!\" he says. Jack tried his best not to roll his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe never tried to be cruel and condescending to anyone, a high-school career of being picked on and bullied will see to that, but he sometimes couldn't help but wonder what some people were thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I mean, I'm sure the \"Goth\" thing makes him happy, but man.. Seriously? </i> Jack thinks to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you interested in any of my authentically cursed, haunted, or otherwise evil items acquired from the deepest darkest regions of the world?\" Lavern says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From the deepest, darkest regions of the world huh?\" Jack says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, deepest, darkest regions of the internet, where I bought most of them.\" Lavern says, his get-up clearly failing him right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonkey paws, spell-books, hearts in jars, strange looking dolls, and other horror movie cliche looking items are strewn haphazardly across the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Half of these things look like there were stolen out of the prop warehouse of some D-Level Horror Movie Studio</i> Jack thinks to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is any of this stuff real?\" Jack asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably not. I just buy this stuff off of people desperate to get rid of it for some reason or another. Then I turn it around and sell it at places like these all across the nation for a nice profit.\" Lavern says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So all this is a get-up to sell second hand junk?\" Jack asks Lavern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much. Now see anything you like? I'll give you a good deal. I don't really want to pack most of this stuff back up.\" Lavern informs, completely dropping the \"Gothic Metal-Head\" angel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack keeps searching, and then a gleam of silver catches his attention out of the corner of his eye. Following it, he lays his eyes upon a coin, approximately the size of a quarter sitting on the table. Full of scratches, the strange coin appears to have the image of a pregnant woman, and a...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is that a pregnant man on this coin? Can't be. Impossible</i> He thinks to himself, studying the coin some more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat appears to be a pregnant man and a pregnant woman are on the head of the coin, a happy look on their face, while on the tail end of the coin, are the same pregnant man and pregnant woman, a look of panic and fear on their face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is the strangest thing I've ever seen. I don't think they make coins like this.. anywhere</i> Jack thinks to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a new thought races through his head, alien to his own thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i>Buy Me Jack.</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much for this coin?\" Jack asks, without even thinking about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I don't remember getting that. Huh. What a strange coin. Uh, I don't know. A Dollar?\" Lavern says looking at the coin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i>Pay For It Jack. </i></span> The alien thought races through his head again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take it!\" Jack says, taking a dollar out of his pocket and slamming it on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walks away from Lavern and his strange table, lost in thought, staring at this strange coin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack! Over here kiddo!\" Jack is snapped back to reality by the voice of his father, waving to him across the flea market. His father, Jack Dale Sr, while pushing 52,s in fantastic shape for someone who sits at a desk all day and does business stuff. <i> He must workout </i> Jack thinks, but he can't really imagine him lifting dumbbells while working on big deals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack rejoins his father, still looking at the strange coin he holds in his hand. <br>\r\n\"What do you got there sweetie?\" Jack knows that voice. The sweet soothing voice of his mother, Amanda. Amanda, nearly 55, brushes a long strand of her slowly greying dark hair aside, with one hand, holding onto to some kind of lamp with another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got this coin from one of the tables. Weird isn't it?\" Jack says, showing the coin to his parents. <br>\r\n\"Wow, never seen a coin like that before son. Might be worth money. Better hang on it\" his father says, scratching at his salt-and-pepper beard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So ready to go?\" His mother says sweetly, holding the lamp. <br>\r\n\"Yeah. You guys want to go out and eat?\" Jack says. <br>\r\n\"That's a great idea! How about our favorite diner!\" His father says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the family Dale head off out of the Flea Market and to the little four-door sedan that was Jack Dale Sr's car. His mother puts the lamp into the trunk, and gets into the passenger seat, while his father get's in the driver's seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No one ever drives Dad's car except for him</i> you say with a smile, getting in the back seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car engine roars to life, and heads off towards the Dale families favorite restaurant, and John  continues to study the strange coin he just purchased. He runs his fingers all along the surface, feeling some kind of strange connection with the coin, like there was part of him now that never wanted the coin to leave his side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><span class=\"clred\">Flip Me Join. Heads Or Tails. </span></span> the alien thought races through his head again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, he places the coin on his thumb, and flicks it into the air, catching it in his now closed fist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i>Look at someone Jack. Look </i> </span> the thought races through his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes fall upon...</span></div></div>",

He was hard-working, kind yet stern when he needed to be. Jack never wanted for anything, to a degree, and he had his father and mother to thank for that, his father moreso. Whenever his mother said no, his father always said yes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now, at his age, his father couldn't help but still spoil him on occasions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The benefits of being an only child</i> Jack thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, looking at him know, time was beginning to catch up to his father. While he was still in fantastic shape, His short hair started to turn grey, giving him salt-and-paper, same along with his beard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiver spots and other old-age related blemishes started popping up on his skin, and he started getting tired easier then before. During his childhood, Jack and his father would stay up all night together, playing games, telling stories, any and everything he wanted to do. Now his father started getting tired at 8 and was in bed by 9. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn, he's getting old</i> Jack thought, sadness washing over him slightly. He didn't want to think about the day when his parents weren't around anymore. When it would just be him, alone, with no one else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Reveal It Jack</span> the thought raced through his head. It was not his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout taking his eyes of his father, driving too the restaurant, talking to his mother in the passenger seat, Jack opened his hand to reveal the coin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had landed on...</span></div></div>",

Could you move the seat up? You're killing my knees here!\" Jack says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son, you know I need every inch I can get right now. I told you not to sit behind me, but you didn't listen to me.\" His father says. <br>\r\nAs the car comes to a stop at a traffic light, Jack notices his father look his head down at something and say<br>\r\n\"I know, he's silly isn't he? I hope you'll listen to me more than he does sometimes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother looks over with a smile on her face, reaching her hand over to Jack's father, and appears to give a rubbing motion on him. <br>\r\n\"Oh he's not so bad. Don't listen to your father\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack is more than a little confused by his father's and mothers sudden bizarre behavior, but ignores it. <br>\r\nHis parents have always been a little odd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, Jack notices that they passed the restaurant where they were going to eat. <br>\r\n\"Ah, hey Dad. You passed the restaurant.\" Jack says, looking out the rear-view window. <br>\r\n\"I know, but I have got to get home. My back is killing me, my feet are swollen like you wouldn't believe, and I have to lay down. I'm so bloody tired too.\" <br>\r\nHis father looks over at his mother.<br>\r\n\"This isn't as easy as I thought it was going to be. I'm sorry for all those comments I made years ago when you went through this\" his father says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What goes around, comes around eh fatso?\" His mother says with a devilish smile. <br>\r\n\"I think you're doing an amazing job. It'll all be over in another six weeks.\" She reaches out and places her hand on what Jack thinks is his fathers leg. <br>\r\n\"OH! That was strong one!\" She says. <br>\r\n\"I know, I felt it!\" His father says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack had never been more confused in his entire life. Something strange was going on, but he couldn't quite figure it out, looking at the back of his father's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just don't worry about it.</i> Jack thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, several minutes later, Jack and his family pull into the driveway of their house. Without wasting a second, Jack undoes his seatbelt, unlocks the front door, and heads inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave the front door open for us Jack! It takes your father so much more time ever - - -\" His mother calls after him, her voice becoming inaudible after a distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the house, Jack took off his jacket, throwing it over a chair next to the island, where the mail was scattered all over the counter. <br>\r\n<i>Home Sweet Home</i> he thinks, heading off to his room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved back home for a year, taking the time off of college, although, he can't really remember why. He thought it was because his parents wanted to spend more time with their only child before he fell away from them forever, but suddenly, that strange feeling came over him, his memories suddenly becoming cloudy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like someone tried to tape two tv shows at the same time on the same VHS, and only bits and pieces of both shows came through. He shrugged off the feeling, walking back to his room. Opening the door, and kicking off his shoes, he booted his video game console, getting ready for another marathon session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This year off is great. I had next to no time to game back in school, so I've spent few months getting caught up. To think I have almost another four months to go!</i> He thinks, digging through his game collection to find the latest game he wanted to play. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis room was the same as he left it, dozens of action figures (still in their original boxes) on his numerous shelves filled with comic books, role-playing books, and other pieces of nerdy accessories. Signed pictures of his favorite female sci-fi stars hung around his room, along with posters for some of his favorite movies. Everything was just the same, even the framed picture of a sonogram he had on his nightstand next to his fantasy book he had been reading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait?! WHAT?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis attention that something was wrong was finally brought to his attention as he looked over at the framed picture of the sonogram. The dark blob read \"The best little sister ever! Can't wait to meet you! Big Brother Jack!\" It was dated last month, and had the handwriting was his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the hell?\" Jack asks staring at the photo. It was real, not some kind of bizarre hallucination. <br>\r\nHe gets up off his bed, holding the photo, and leaves his room, staring at the photo. <br>\r\n\"Hey Mom, Dad?\" He shouts from upstairs, hoping to get their attention.<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" His mother asks. <br>\r\n\"Can you guys come up here for a moment?\" He asks, his eyes never leaving the picture. <br>\r\n\"No. Come down here, you know you're father has trouble with stairs!\" His mother says, soundly slightly annoyed. <br>\r\n\"Yeah whatever.\" He says, carefully taking the stairs as quickly as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Jack was not so engrossed in the picture he was holding, he would have noticed that the bedroom directly right to the stairs, was no longer just a room for various uses, but was in fact, painted completely pink, filled with small stuffed animals, a crib, a changing table, diapers, and the words \"Baby Veronica's Room\" was engraved on a plaque on the partially ajar door, which was painted pink, covered with little wooden ducks, hammered into the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack turned into the kitchen, holding the photo. \"What the hell is with this?\" He asks, holding the sonogram. <br>\r\n\"With what?\" His mother asks, preparing a lunch. <br>\r\n\"This!\" He finally looks away from the photo and upon his parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe photo drops from his hands to the floor in a clash of glass as his eyes fall upon his parents. His mother had no visible changes what-so-ever, but his father, well, his father was a different story altogether. The sensible button up shirt his father was wearing an hour earlier had been replaced by a heavy grey zip-up hoodie, which was stretched tightly across the massive mound that was his father's gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis father stood in the kitchen, hands pressed into his lower back, which caused his massive gut to stick out that much farther in front of him. <br>\r\nThe top half of his hooded sweatshirt hunged tightly to his pecs, well, what would have been his pecs, if not for the fact, that his pecs were larger and rounder, almost having the appearance of a pair of B-Sized women's breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jack. Look what you did! Go get some glass and clean that up!\" His mother commands, not seemingly to notice that massive, almost pregnant looking gut suddenly attached to her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It does have a pregnant look to it. 8 months pregnant</i> Jack thought, looking at his father's very round midsection.<br>\r\n<i>But that's impossible</i> he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, did you hear me? Go get a broom and clean that up!\" His mother asked him.<br>\r\nShe turned her attention to her oversized husband. <br>\r\n\"Honey, why don't you take that hoodie off now that we're in doors and relax a little? Go lay down on the couch and I'll bring in your lunch to you.\" She says to her husband with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis father unzips his hoody, revealing the mammoth 8 month pregnant belly that was barely hiding underneath. <br>\r\nUnder the hoodie his father was wearing a plain white t-shirt, which was tight against his body, the hemline barely reaching the very top of his belly button which was popped out, staring at Jack like a third eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA long dark line ran vertically on his father's belly, from the very top of it, to the underside. <br>\r\nDark red stretch marks very visible along the sides of his taught pregnant belly skin. <br>\r\nHis firm man boobs were visible under the white t-search, his nipples sticking out like little hats against the upper fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'm so big\" His father complains, cupping his pregnancy in his hands. <br>\r\n\"Hey, hey, hey. Don't say that. You're beautiful. You're absolutely amazing looking.\" His mother says, walking over to her expectant husband, and placing her hands on top of his which were resting on his pregnant belly.<br>\r\n\"I feel like I'm going to be pregnant forever!\" His father complains, rubbing his belly. <br>\r\n\"It's almost over baby. Another six weeks, and then our little girl will be with us!\" His mother says with a smile on her face. <br>\r\n\"Now, why don't you go lay down on the couch, stop worrying about how big you're getting, and watch some TV. I'll bring you in your sandwich in a moment.\" <br>\r\n\"Okay, I could probably write a few more chapters in my pregnancy journal\" he says, rubbing his hands over the vast expanse of his pregnant midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he tries to waddle away, his mother stops her husband. <br>\r\n\"Uh-uh-uh. You know the rules! Three kisses!\" She says gleefully, kissing her husband on the lips.<br>\r\n\"One for you!\" She says, and then lifts up her husbands white T-shirt, kissing his mammoth pregnant belly twice in two different sections\" <br>\r\n\"And two for our little girl! Mommy and Daddy love you Veronica!\" She says, giving her pregnant husband's belly a pat.<br>\r\n\"Now go lay down! I'll be right there!\" She orders her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's father waddles past him, heading off into the living room. <br>\r\nJack stands in complete shock over the scene he just witnessed. <br>\r\nHis mind is blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother turns to him.<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you going to pick up that broken glass or what?!\" She nags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The two feelings argued back and forth while his mom just stared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Jack did I start that scentence with 'if it please your highness'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, dad is, is I don't, I I can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son are you okay, you're looking pale?\" Asked Jack Sr. from his spot on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked over at his dad his eyes going right to his big belly, that was the absolute last straw, the mental strain was too much, and Jack passed out, the last thing he heard before the sweet embrace of unconsiousness being his parents calling his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later Jack was coming too, hearing his mom gently calling his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, Jack sweetie are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack recognized where he was, on his bed, in his room, there sitting on the foot of the bed was his mom, and sitting in a chair nearby was his still very pregnant father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You took quite a spill there chief, even your sister here is worried about you.\" Comments his dad, as he rubs his clearly shifting belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack would have panicked, but the breif period of unconsiousness allowed the strange new memories to, sort themselves out, Jack remembered, though he wasn't sure how, that day months ago when his parents visited him on campus with some unusual news, about how they were suffering from empty nest syndrome and how they have been talking about having another kid, how had singed up for an unusual medical experiment, since mom was getting to old to carry children safely they talked to someone about seeing if Jack Sr. could carry a baby to term. He remembered meeting Dr. Milne and her showing the family pictures of earlier voulenteers, a few college kids Jack's age, and some guys in their 30s. How Jack's dad was now the oldest man to go through the procedure, and how this was supposed to be an unusual alternative to allow married couples to have their own children without rellying on strangers to be surrogates. How Jack voulenteered to take some time off from college to help his mom and dad during the pregnancy and those intense first few months postpartum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembered visiting Dr.Milne with dad to see the progression of the pregnancy, he even remembered the day where he got that ultrasound photo that used to be framed on his bedside table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack honey, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looks over at his mom, not entirely sure what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Side note, the character Dr. Milne and her project are borrowed from the delightful Mpreg story: The Study, from mpreg central, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://mpregcentral.net/forums/showthread.php?tid=671,\" target=\"_blank\">http://mpregcentral.net/forums/showthrea...</a> check the domain here if you want to take a look, warning NSFW)</span></div></div>",

Now he was seated on his bed roling the coin that, unbeknownst to him, started all this in one hand, and in his other the photo of the snonogram now in need of a new picture frame, Jack just stared at the photo maybe hoping he could make it dissapear while at the same time admireing it. Even before these new memories flodded Jack's brain he did remeber that there was a time when he was little when he asked his parents for a little brother or sister to play his games with him, not that it ever came true, until now that is. Maybe this was the chance to be the big brother he wanted to be, and at the same time it was completely bizzare, why his dad, why not his mom, where did all those new memories come from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather then dwel on it to much and drive himself crazy Jack decided to just get some sleep and hopefully things would be clearer in the morning.</span></div></div>",

The other a woman around Jack's age with long blond hair and well tanned skin, also wearing a cap and gown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack Sr. gave the two women an aside glance. \"See what did I tell you two? If we let her go, she'd track her brother down in an instant, I'd swear she was part bloodhound, if I didn't give birth to her myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's mom rolls her eyes with a sarcastic yet loving sigh of 'yes, yes you gave birth to her we know', while the other woman starts saunturing her way up to Jack Jr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey babe.\" Jack says cheerfully at this woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey lover!\" She responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, woah, not in front of the kid okay.\" Jack whispers back before gesturing down to his sister still latched onto his leg, but looking up at them both with big innocent eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you a big sister..... talking about grown up stuff again?\" Asked little Victoria, the womans name garbeled and hard to hear for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there now, she's not your sister yet.\" Comment's Jack's mom as she manages to pry Victoria off her brother's leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet, but soon right.......?\" Replied Jack Jr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, and who knows maybe when we get married you and I will have to take turns being pregnant eh babe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mistery woman then places her hand on Jack Jrs stomach which suddenly bloated out to 8 months in size.

Jack Jr. stood there silently for a few moments, just drinking in the sight before him, then on pure instinct alone Jack Jr. slowly approaches his sleeping father and places his had on the pregnant belly, right then and there the baby, his little sister, gave a nice harty kick, making Jack Jr. jump back a bit in surprise, and thankfully the kick seemed to be enough to wake his dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, I'm up, I'm up. Oh, hi son what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, mom had to go to the office so she want's me to take you to your doctor apointment today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, great, I should of known it was you, Veronica here always starts kicking up a storm when your around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, well I'll set up your breakfast and we can get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sure, um, but before you go, could you help me up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh Jack Jr. goes over to his fathers bedside, this was going to be a long day.</span></div></div>",

What's a little overeating now and then? How often do we get to go out to eat with our only child these days?\" Amanda says, looking at her son with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you sir? What will you have?\" The pretty blonde says to him, waiting patently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout answering her, her places the coin on his thumb, flipping it high into the air, and then snatching it seconds later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Look Jack</span> the voice commanded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jack looked at Lynette Marks, he could have sworn that the air around her was shimmering, like a road on a hot day. <br>\r\nSoon the shimmer seemed to envelope the whole room, as Jack was snapped back to attention by his parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack! The lady would like to know what you wanted to order! So maybe you want to put your coin away and order something?\" his father said in a stern tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes went back to the pretty blonde waitress, staring at him, waiting for his order. He looked at the coin, and then back to her, suddenly aware that he just flipped his strange coin in the middle of a packed restaurant, with his parents and a pretty blonde waitress staring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah sorry. Cheeseburger, please\" Jack said, trying to regain his senses. <br>\r\n\"And do you want the fries for you or your mom?\" The waitress says, finally writing down his order on her pad.<br>\r\n\"Whatever\" was all he could say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't figure out what you wanted so had to flip a coin huh? I've done that\" His father says, acknowledging what just happened.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess.\" Jack said, his mind in a daze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething felt wrong. Seriously, seriously wrong. <br>\r\nLike he had been displaced from reality. He felt like an alien in his own normal world, a stranger in his own skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes absent-mindidly wandered back to that \"private\" party room, unaware of the subtle but major changes that occurred while he wasn't looking. <br>\r\nThe multicolored balloons that were once there to celebrate a 60th birthday had changed. The reds, the yellows, the greens, and oranges balloons changed into bright blue and pink balloons, the weights that were holding them down changing from heavy pieces of plastic, to small packages of pacifiers or small brightly colored stuff animals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small amount of gifts on the table that had previously been there had quadrupled in number, the plain standard birthday wrapping paper on them being replaced with hues of bright pink or blue, with little pictures of storks on them. Dozens of boxes of diapers stood stacked in two corners of the room, like giant pillars, little cards taped on the boxes, clearly full of money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe birthday cake, once glowing bright with 60 candles, was instead replaced by a large cake in the shape of a very pregnant belly wearing a blue dress, almost similar to the one Lynette was wearing. The 60 candles had been replaced by a two smaller candles that read \"60\" that rested on the very top of the pregnant belly cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demeanor and number of guests had changed too. Where once they're were only a few guests, now the room was overflowing with people, many young and old, cheering. These people were not here a second ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStranger still, the demeanor of the people that Jack figured were her family had changed drastically. Joy and happiness which had been there moments earlier, had been replaced with looks of disbelief, anger, and confusion, espically from the ones that Jack thought were her children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They looked angry and pissed; like they didn't want to be there. They weren't like that moments ago</i> Jack thought. <br>\r\nThe glass of wine that Lynette was drinking was replaced by a large glass of milk, while Lynette's hair had appear to grown longer, almost flowing down to her shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer once sagging breasts were larger and firmer, pushing out against the constrains of her blue dress, dark wet spots visible.<br>\r\nHer skin was more youthful looking, and she had a smile on her face a mile wide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Her breasts are bigger!</i> Jack thought, his eyes going to the two now supple and firm breasts hugging the top of her dress.<br>\r\nThey looked like they belonged to a woman half her age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Lynette! Give a speech!\" One of her older friends shouted at her, raising a glass of wine.<br>\r\n\"No! She doesn't need to give a speech! She should just sit down. Don't make her get up!\" Her son said, defensively. <br>\r\n\"Oh stop! I'm fine!\" Lynette said, slapping her son in the arm. She gave a smile, took a drink from her glass of milk, and put her hands on the armrests of her chair, trying to get up awkwardly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why is she having so much trouble getting up?</i> Jack thinks watching her. <br>\r\nMoments later, he had his answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she hoisted herself out her chair, her belly became visible. <br>\r\nHer very pregnant belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a groan, as she finally got to her feet, putting her hands into the small of her back, her 8 months pregnant belly wrapped tightly in the blue dress she was wearing, causing the fabric to bunch up in the sides. Her popped out navel was visible through the fabric, resting on-top of her mammoth blue mound like a little hat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly was massive, jutting out in front of her like she swallowed an oversized globe. With the tight blue dress on, it did look like a small planet covered completely in water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to thank everyone for coming today!\" Lynette beamed, her hands in the small of her back, causing her massive pregnant belly to jut out further.<br>\r\n\"Somebody once asked me when I turned 59 last year, \"60's coming up, What do you have to look forward too?\" And I didn't have an answer to that back then. But now today, on my 60th Birthday,  I have two!\" She said smiling, the wrinkles of the side of her face visible, patting her belly for emphasis, before returning her hands to the small of her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe banner which once read Happy 60th Birthday Lynette, now reads:<br>\r\n<b>Babies &amp; Birthday Cake! Lynette's 60th Birthday &amp; Baby Shower!<br>\r\nOne foot in the grave! Two babies in the belly!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was having twins! Lynette suddenly let out a gasp, taking one hand from her back and rubbing a spot on her belly. <br>\r\n\"Oh my, these two are active today!\" She smiles rubbing her belly in front of her guests.<br>\r\n\"Now, I now some people might say having twins at my age is crazy, or impossible. Maybe their right, but while those people are sleeping soundly at 9PM, I'll have a hot date with a breast pump!\" She jokes, the room erupting in laughter from everyone except her children. <br>\r\nShe jiggles her ample bosom for effect, before resting her hands on top of her pregnant belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still not quite sure HOW I got pregnant. My husband passed away two years ago, and  my doctor told me years ago that my childbearing days were over, but as I sit here, with little Matthew and little Sarah bumping away in side of me, I don't really care. I have the loving support of my two older children, their spouses, and my four wonderful grandchildren, whom I'm sure will love to help out when I give birth in a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It won't be easy. There are long days, and long nights ahead of me, but I will be the best mother I still humanly can be at my age, making sure these two new babies have everything they could ever want, and a happy home filled with love, laughter, and joy.So thanks again for coming to what I hope will be my last baby shower, because, well\" Lynette says, pausing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns showing her massive 60 year old pregnant profile to her guests, putting her hands into the small of her back, and giving a comical face. <br>\r\n\"I'm too old for this!\" A smattering of applause is heard, as Lynette smiles, places her hands on her belly and gives it a rub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then turns her attention to the massive amount of gifts on the table, opening them up slowly, as her son begrudingly video tapes his pregnant mother opening her gifts, laughing as she holds a tiny pair of baby clothes over her belly that reads \"That's not my grandma, that my mommy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues opening gifts, and eats a big slice of her pregnancy-themed cake, as Jack continues to stare on in amazement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the hell is going on? How is she pregnant! She can't be pregnant! She wasn't pregnant moments ago!</i> Jack thinks, watching the 60 year old pregnant woman play with her grandchild, who is enamored with her pregnant belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's you staring at Jack?\" His father asks, turning around, staring at the now Baby Shower/60th Birthday Party. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow. Look at her\" Jack father's says. \"She must be crazy having kids at her age.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother turns and looks at the much older pregnant woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding. I can't even imagine being pregnant at my age, let alone hers, and she's only a few years older than me. I think I would freak out\" she says. <br>\r\n\"Although, I think it would be just a little bit nice\" Amanda pauses for a second, a smile coming over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I might go over there and congratulate her\" his mother says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Jack says, confused as to why his parents seem to be accepting the 60 year old pregnant woman who wasn't pregnant moments before, far too well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to feel her belly and talk to her a little bit.\" Amanda says. <br>\r\n\"I don't know honey..\" Jack's father says.<br>\r\n\"Oh it'll be fine\" Amanda says .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Mom! She wasn't pregnant when we got here!\" Jack says, trying to explain the situation. <br>\r\n\"Jack, don't talk crazy like that so loud. She might hear you!\" His father says in a stern tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not crazy!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was strange his parents knew he was coming to visit and the left the kitchen so under stocked he couldn\u2019t even make himself a decent breakfast. He couldn\u2019t ask them about it at the moment though as they both had gone off to work, Jack Sr dropping Amanda off at the bank, where she worked, on the way to the company where he worked. \u2018Looks like I\u2019m going to have to get some food from somewhere else,\u2019 Jack thought to himself. As he made his way up to his room to get ready to go out, Jack failed to notice the bin was practically over flowing with empty food packets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda Dale sat behind her desk in her office, working and trying to ignore the gnawing hunger in her stomach. As the empty food packets strewn around the office indicated she had already failed this several times already. She couldn\u2019t understand why she had been eating so much in the past day. First the was the restaurant yesterday and then several times last night she went to the kitchen for a snack\u2026or two, this morning her breakfast had cleaned out what was left in the kitchen and she had gone to the corner shop several time today, she had been sick again when she woke up but it wasn\u2019t as bad as yesterday and she hadn\u2019t felt sick at all since then, all that was left was the hunger, she had to stop eating. Already her stomach had gone from ironing board flat to rounded potbelly. She nearly had to call in sick because her work clothes wouldn\u2019t fit, but she managed to get on a dark grey knee business skirt, and do up the buttons on a shirt and business jacket but it had been a close thing, even now she had to undo the lower few buttons of her jacket, whilst the buttons on her shirt creaked ominously. She had to stop eating so much, that\u2019s what she told herself after going to the corner shop for the fourth time today, it was also what she told herself the time before that, the owner was starting to make humorless jokes whilst wearing a cheesy grin his face each time she came in. Another wave of hunger went through, she place her pen on the desk and looked at the clock, it was nearly eleven she told herself, she could go get lunch now and no more trips for food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had just stood up when one of the cashiers came in, \u201cuh Mrs Dale, Ms Sommer is here, and she wants to talk to someone about her inheritance.\u201d Amanda sighed, Emilie Sommer was in her late twenties but still acted as though she was a teenager, she was the sole child of Hans Sommer the  successful Bavarian jeweler who left everything to his second wife (his first dying in a car crash several years after Emilie was born) when he died, his second wife, Penelope was a decent woman, in Amanda\u2019s point of view and did leave everything to her stepdaughter (having no children of her own) on the proviso that Emilie must spend a year doing a job so that she learnt the value of money. Emilie who had been outraged when she found this out a few months ago, after Penelope died, and had taken to hiring a lawyer to get her the money. It hadn\u2019t worked and never would as the bank wasn\u2019t people that she needed to complain to. Unless Emilie found out soon that complaining to the bank was never going to work she was going end up spending all the inheritance on the lawyer, who was on to too much of a good thing to tell Emile the right people to talk to. \u201cJust get Scott to deal with it, he is the branch manager,\u201d said Amanda.<br>\r\n\u201cScott went away to that business conferences in the Bahamas and won\u2019t be back until next week,\u201d said the cashier. They were right, that was another thing that had been happen in the past day she just kept forgetting things, she lost her pen three times today already.<br>\r\n\u201cI deal with her,\u201d said Amanda stepping out from behind her desk, \u2018ping\u2019 the bottom button of Amanda\u2019s shirt had popped off revealing the lower half curve of her swollen stomach \u2018is it really that big?\u2019 thought Amanda catching a glimpse of her reflection in the glass of her office door. The cashier politely took a great interest in the painting on the wall going slightly red, but not as red as Amanda who reached down to be pick up the button so it could sewn back on later. \u2018RRRPPP\u2019 At the sound of the tearing noise she straighten back up her hands flying to her rear, which felt larger than usual, she found the tear in her skirt. Amanda sidled back to her desk and carefully sat down as not to cause anymore of her clothing to break. \u201cUh just tell her that manger is away on business and the deputy manager is sick,\u201d she told the cashier hesitantly.<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026.\u201d Started the cashier.<br>\r\n\u201cIs sick,\u201d said Amanda more firmly.<br>\r\n\u201cRight away Ma\u2019am\u201d said the cashier leaving the room.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd send someone to get me a ham roll from the corner shop,\u201d Amanda said loudly after them, \u201cwith mustard,\u201d she said as an afterthought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell she was sick Amanda thought to herself, she was unable to work when she couldn\u2019t concentrate because of a voracious appetite and was literally bursting out of her clothes. She reached towards the phone on her desk, something was going on with her body maybe it was menopause but that was more hot flushes then increased hunger and whilst she heard there was bloating what she was experiencing though was\u2026 she looked down at her bulging stomach which was threating to pop off another button of her shirt. One way or another she needed someone to bring her some clothes that fitted and possibly take her to see a doctor; Amanda picked up the phone receiver and called\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking through his pockets, he tried to find change for some chips. \"2 dollars 50, 2 dollars 60, 2 dollars sev-huh?\" Jack stopped as he realised he had the mysterious coin in his hands again. Did it really cause his mother to become pregnant? There was only one way to tell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around he surveyed the people there for anyone that would be ideal pregnant women. \"Geez theres a lot of old women here,  wait!\" He found someone.

Jack tried his best to contain himself as he got the rest of his money into the vending machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I've never seen anyone more excited to get a packet of crisps\" a voice came from behind him.

He reached down to rub the side of his stomach, hoping that would help to soothe the sickness away. Was it something that he ate? He hadn't been carsick since he was a little boy, and it seemed strange that it would start again out of no-where. His headache throbbed behind his temples, and Jack sank back against the car seat. He felt tired all of a sudden, as if his recent run of late-night gaming sessions had finally caught up to him, and he tilted his head to rest his forehead against the blissfully cool car window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack?\" Jack's mother caught his eye in the rear view mirror, concern entering her expression, \"Are you alright? You've gone ever so quiet.\" She turned in her seat to take a closer look at her son, her eyes looking him up and down in motherly concern. \"Sweetie? You've gone pale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feels like I'm gonna throw up,\" Jack tilted his head further against the cold glass, \"Guess I ate something dodgy. Or something like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bet it was that hot dog you snarfed down from the guy outside of the flea market,\" Jack Sr declared with a self approving nod, \"You can't trust guys like that. Most of them don't even have a license to be there, you know. You don't even know what meat went into that 'dog, kiddo. Could be anything. Cat. Raccoon. Actual dog.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you're helping, dear,\" Jack's mother responded exasperatedly, \"Do you want us to drop you off at home, sweetie? You could go upstairs and get some rest.\" She looked as if she were going to say something else, but instead decided not to. Jack was grateful for it, and nodded as he rubbed a hand over his churning stomach once again. The thought of having something to eat both disgusted him and appealed to him at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one hand, he was feeling sick.The idea of heading home and going to bed was an appealing one, he could put Netflix on and just allow himself to doze in and out of sleep between episodes. He could maybe see about delving into his stash of snacks if he was feeling better later on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other? He loved the diner they were heading towards. And he had a sudden craving for his all time favourite triple cheeseburger with strips of bacon inserted between each patty. Jack's mouth almost watered at the thought, he could even have curly fries with that. Thick, curled fries with a dusting of spice to give them a little bit of a kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The ride to the diner became quiet, the sound of the radio filling the silence. On the way there, Jack struggles not to hurl on the seats. Once the Dales pulled up to the diner, Jack Sr. parks the car and gets out. Jack follows him, careful not to do anything that would upset his stomach. They get there and are escorted to a table near the window. The cool air helps with the nausea somewhat. The waitress comes by and they order the food and drinks. While waiting, his parents strike up a conservation about his love life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So sweetie, you seeing anyone right now?\" His mother inquired. Jack's face turns red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, I had a few flings here and there.\" His mind turns to the various one night stands he had with men and women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you ever see someone, tell us.\" His father injects. \"We want to meet them and see if they're good for our little boy.\" Jacks gets even more red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys,\" He whines. \"Don't embarrass me.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress comes back with their food and drinks and they dig in.

His dad wipes his mouth and looks to his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well son, your mom and I have something to tell you. We're going to visit your mom's brother We're going to be gone for three weeks so we're leaving you some money and food so you don't starve.\" Jacks smiles, happy for them. Maybe this strange sickness would go away by the time they came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" His parents finish the rest of the food in silence. Once they're done, his dad calls for the receipt. He pays and they leave. They get in the car and go home. Once there, Jack goes to his room, changing into something more comfortable. As he's taking his shirt off, he notices something odd. He's always been a bit chubby but it looked like he ate a bit more then he usually does. He thinks nothing of it and heads to bed. He gets under the covers and close his eyes. </span></div></div>",

He goes to the kitchen and sees a note with some bills next to it. <i>They must have left already,</i> he thought. Jack takes the bills, counting a large sum of money. It was enough to last him a few months. He then decides to read the note. <u>Jack,</u> it says, <u>sorry for leaving you without a goodbye. Your mother got a call saying that your uncle got hurt and his wife can't help him since she's pregnant.</u> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait, Aunt Cassidy and Uncle Frank are having a kid?,</i> he reads on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Cassidy's having a girl by the way, so congratulate them when you have the chance.

With a feeling of dread, he realizes that the nausea from yesterday was coming back. He sprints to the bathroom in time to throw up the contents of his stomach. After what it seemed like forever, Jack rises up from the toilet bowl, flushes and goes to the sink. He wipes his mouth clean and washes his hands. As he's drying them, that's when he notices it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the bathroom mirror was Jack, there was something off though. It could be a trick of the light but was his belly bigger? Through his shirt, it seemed more round. He wraps his arms around it and is surprised at how firm it felt to the touch. There was a nagging feeling at the back of his mind, he had felt this before on another person. It was much larger back then though. He remembered one of his older cousins being heavily pregnant with her son, as he was stubborn to come out. Jack had felt how hard her belly was and that was the feeling he was getting from touching his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm not-I couldn't be-</i> his hands tremble.

He tried to hide his face and keep looking outside so as not to attract attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, junior, are you doing anything tomorrow?\" his father asked.<br>\r\n\"Meeting Jenny.\" Jack muttered.<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" his father asked with a grin.<br>\r\n\"She's a nice girl,\" Amanda chimed.  \"Where are you going?\"<br>\r\n\"The mall,\" Jack groaned.  \"She says she wants my input.\"<br>\r\n\"That's not the way I though you would sound,\" he father said.  \"I thought you two were dating?\"<br>\r\n\"Taking it slow,\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sickly feeling wasn't going away.  Jack Jr. tried his best to hold it back as they ate dinner, but it was apparent.  His parents were kind and perceptive, however, and they hurried things along.  The drive back home was uneventful, although Jack continued to toy with the coin in his hand as he looked at his reflection.  There was no need to flip a coin and pretend to be a comical villain, but he couldn't help but feel the impulse.  He didn't want to look stupid in front of his parents, though, and he ultimately didn't flip the coin again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis nausea dissipated when they arrived home, and he quickly went to his room.  He had a journal that he would reflect on his goals in every now and then, sitting at his desk.  Jack's year off school hadn't quite given him a direction he wanted to discover.  Jenny was much more driven; she wanted to be a game designer.  He was going to need to rest up early.  He liked Jenny, but she had a tendency to linger whenever she shopped.  They would probably be out together the whole day.  As laid in bed at ten p.m., but sleep didn't come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried his best to be still, but he felt strangely uncomfortable.  Eventually, he got up, drank a glass of water, and stretched.  Around midnight, he went to the bathroom.  As he peed, he felt a strange feeling in his abdomen: a kind of pressure, which he passed off as his full bladder.  He washed up and looked at himself once in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to sleep,\" he declared.  But his stomach rebelled, and the sickness returned.  Jack wound up vomiting into the toilet, exhausting himself.  Afterwards, he brushed his teeth once more an then stumbled into bed, collapsed, and fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the morning began, the sun was hidden beyond a gloomy overcast sky.  The thick, swollen clouds blanketed the town in preparation of rain.  A thunderstorm warning was immediately in effect, which is what woke Jack Jr. up from his sleep.  Similarly to everyone else that morning, he felt dismayed looking out the window.  He forced himself up and cleaned himself, feeling heavy and sluggish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a text message, and saw a note from Jenny.  \"You up?\" it said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny had been organizing breakfast occasionally over the past few weeks, trying out different caf\u00e9s around town.  Jack was happy that she wanted to spend time with him, but they were already going to spend plenty of money today at the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come over to my house for breakfast. I'll make omelets,\" he texted.<br>\r\n\"Is that okay?\" Jenny asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  When you're ready.\"  Jack put his phone away and went to the kitchen.  His mother was eating toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want and omelet, Mom?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n\"No, thank you.\"  Amanda peered at her son when he wasn't looking.  There was something slightly different about him today that she couldn't place.  Had he gained weight.  His stomach was a touch rounder.  Still at home and getting a \"Freshman fifteen,\" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack Jr. was fond of cooking.  Perhaps he had simply picked it up from watching anime characters expound on the glory of food for many years, but it was a natural interest for him.  He liked to experiment with different tastes.  As he finished the omelets, his phone buzzed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sorry.  Something came up, so I can't make it in time for breakfast.  I'll see you at the mall, though, so don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\" Jack muttered.  He looked longingly at the omelets that he had prepared, but decided against eating them both.  He had a sneaking suspicion that she was uncomfortable seeing his parents.  He asked his mother where the styrofoam boxes were, and packed both delicious morsels away.  His stomach roared in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't they get cold?\" his mother asked.<br>\r\n\"They'll still be good,\" he replied.  Especially since he was the one who made it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack drove to the mall and met Jenny at the front.<br>\r\n\"Hey, sorry.  You didn't have to bring any breakfast.\"<br>\r\n\"It's my treat.\" he said simply.  They found a bench and ate, savoring each other's company.  Jenny only ate half of hers, but she seemed happy.  Politely, she asked Jack to finish her leftovers, which he gladly did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was trying not to think about his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two waltzed over to the computer store, hoping to find some nice parts to build a gaming pc.  Jack had recommended the task to Jenny to help with her game design.  It would be good to get hands on experience building a computer herself.  She agreed.  While they browsed for parts, an odd sensation began to bother Jack.  He felt something hot in his pocket.  When he felt around, he found the coin again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I don't remember taking this.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">flip me</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's insides churned as he looked at the thing.  He put the coin away, and went back to shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they had finished shopping for parts, after much deliberation, Jack and Jenny shared a buttered pretzel in the center of the mall.  They were right outside of a maternity clothing store, \"Belles and Bellies.\"  Jack thought it was a stupid name, but it wasn't really on his mind.  He was more concerned with what they were going to do after the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get some clothes,\" Jenny said.<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"I feel like shopping for clothes.\"<br>\r\n\"I though we were going to, you know, get a movie,\" said Jack.  She gave him a smile.<br>\r\n\"Come on.  There's not a lot of people here today, so it'll be real quick.  We'll get a movie afterward.  Besides, you could use another shirt,\" she teased.  She tugged at the hem of his t shirt.<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" he said.  He somehow hadn't noticed that it was hugging his body firmly.  \"Alright, we'll flip it.  Heads: we get a movie first. Tails: we get  clothes first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">Flip me</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he caught the coin, Jack looked at the result, and then ahead at the maternity clothing store.  \"Heads.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinked.  He was watching an employee leave the maternity store, only for her to expand before his very eyes.  It was an instant, but no one else seemed to notice or respond.  Not even the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get the movie, then,\" Jenny said<br>\r\n\"No, let's get the clothes,\" Jack replied.<br>\r\n\"You won the coin toss.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, it can wait,\" he said.<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had occurred to Jack that shopping was really Jenny's idea, and that she probably intended to get clothes in the first place.  He got himself a pack of larger shirts in the meantime, troubled.  He had been doing a good job of losing weight recently, so it was unpleasant to think that it was going away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny was a gorgeous woman.  Jack liked the way she looked in a dress, although it was not common for her to wear.  He complimented her on everything she chose, and thankfully never had to lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finished, they passed by a wishing fountain.  It was a nostalgic place for Jack.  He watched his reflection shimmer in the rippling water.  He pulled out the coin, compulsively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">Flip me</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On a whim, Jack flipped the coin into the wishing well.  His eyes flitted over to a vendor selling cheap jewelry, as he considered whether Jenny might want to browse them.  A pretty blonde woman was in the middle of trying to get the attention of passerby's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jack.  What are you looking at?\" Jenny asked.  Jack turned to her, unaware of how lucky he had been.<br>\r\n\"Oh.  Did you want to look for some earrings or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey turned back to the vendor, where a scene was taking place.The seller was making an awful lot of panicked noise.  Her attention, which before had been on selling jewelry, was exclusively on getting someone to take her to the hospital.  As she stepped out from behind the stall, the shape of her belly caught Jack's attention.  She was apparently in labor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get out of here,\" whispered Jenny hurriedly.<br>\r\n\"Hold on,\" said Jack.  \"Let's make sure she has some help.\"<br>\r\nJenny hesitated to respond, but she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack hurried over as well as he could to the panicking saleswoman.  Her outfit had somehow burst several buttons; she looked horribly disheveled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need help, ma'am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I need help, you little shit!  Oh!\" the woman cried.  Another set of contractions overwhelmed her, and she lowered herself onto the ground.  Jack couldn't believe that this was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" he yelled at another vendor.  \"Is there anyone that can get her to the hospital?\"  Another saleswoman hurried over to the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  But she wasn't...how did---what?\"<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Jack repeated.  \"You need to get her to the hospital.\"  But it was no use.  The blond woman's co-worker was in some kind of bewildered terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack sighed.  This was supposed to be a pleasant day.  \"Jenny, let's drive her over.\"<br>\r\n\"What?\" she whispered.<br>\r\n\"Now, Jenny,\" Jack asserted.  He grabbed the blonde woman's hand and pulled her to her feet.  \"We'll get you to the hospital, Miss.\"  She accepted, albeit begrudgingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was probably the tensest half hour of Jack and Jenny's lives to that point.  The hospital was thankfully close, but while getting to Jack's car they half expected the woman to give birth right then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't any need to stay with the woman at the hospital.  All they could do was hope that things went well.  So Jack drove Jenny back to her car at the mall, where they recuperated.  There wasn't anything that they really had in mind to say.  It was all a little strange.  Jenny, especially, was affected.  She seemed oddly flushed and didn't have much to say.  Finally, she held Jack's hand.<br>\r\n\"You were really cool,\" she murmured.<br>\r\nJack wondered at that.  \"Not really.  If it had gotten any more serious, I wouldn't have been better than any doctor or anything like that.\"  Jenny shushed him.  She kissed him on the lips.  It was a different kiss than he was used to from her, but passionate nonetheless.  When she separated, she buried her face into his chest, concealing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was going on, he wondered?  A greedy part of him thought maybe this was a chance for fireworks that night.  Then again, Jenny was acting overwhelmed, and she didn't seem in the right state of mind.  He thought of his options.  On the one hand, he and his girlfriend could spend the night together.  On the other hand, she would probably respect him more in the long run if he didn't push it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Let's get that movie,\" Jack said.  Jenny agreed, and the two made their preparations for movie night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny's apartment was well kept.  She put her purchases away while Jack set up the movie.  They had chosen a cheesy comedy so that they could poke fun at it while they watched.  It was something that they liked to do together.  Sometimes they cared more for talking about the movie than actually watching it.  Jack Jr. sat in the couch, feeling oddly exhausted.  Eventually, Jenny snuggled up against him.  While they laughed and relaxed, they eventually re-positioned.  Jack laid down on the couch, and Jenny rested on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir commentary of the movie died out as their attention was on each other, wondering what would happen next.  Jack was feeling exhausted, but he wanted to stay awake.  Jenny's head was on his chest, as she listened to his heart.  She crawled up and kissed him on the lips, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's dreams were restless, but he was paralyzed.  He woke up briefly at midnight, feeling odd.  He thought he could make out Jenny's silhouette, as he felt her head against his stomach.  He drifted back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning came rudely.  Jack snapped awake, absolutely dumbfounded with himself for not getting anywhere the previous night.  His lambasting was quickly halted, as he noticed something distinctly different.  His stomach was swollen outward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The...what?\"  He muttered.  His abdomen had a distinctly round protrusion, and not like a beer belly.  It was too perfect a curve.  He uneasily placed a hand against his gut, testing how firm it was.  His insides were uneasy as he did this.  His was still wearing his old shirt from yesterday, which was uncomfortably tight, and had ridden up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing his mind off of it, Jack got up and took a deep breath.  He went and got himself breakfast, feeling famished.  Jenny wasn't anywhere to be seen, but he assumed that she was in the bathroom. While he ate, Jack began to feel uneasy.  Jenny had been acting oddly since yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided to check in with her, and so he headed to the restroom.  Sure enough, she was inside.</span></div></div>",

She wasn't going to like him intruding, but Jack wasn't going to do nothing while she was clearly sick.  He opened the door and attended to his girlfriend.  Jenny was pale as a sheet, though she tried to hide her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look at me,\" she whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't help that,\" he offered.  He got a wash cloth and wiped the sweat off her face, and massaged her back.  She seemed miserable, and though he stayed with her, she wouldn't look at him..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make you some soup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have any.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll grab a can from home,\" he said, heading for his coat.  \"You going to be okay?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded.  Before he walked out of the apartment, he heard her call just audibly, \"Thank you, Jack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe checked the cabinets at home, and found the can he needed.  He also grabbed some fresh ingredients so that he could make some fresh onion soup.  Jack left a note on the counter for his parents.  He was going to stay at Jenny's another night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sudden weight gain was no longer on the front of his mind, but he did grab some extra clothes, and drove back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he returned, Jack found Jenny curled up on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm back,\" he called, enthusiastically.  As he set the items down in the kitchen, she whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.  I'm feeling better now,\" she lied.  Her voice was hoarse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it.  Just relax.  I'll make you some soup, and you'll get better in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't feel sick?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky.\"  She wrapped herself in a blanket and laid out on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long day, with not so much talking.  There was much soup had, and jello, and the local news.  Jenny looked like she had something on her mind, but she couldn't communicate it properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got fat,\" she deliriously stated once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're beautiful,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day ended, and night swiftly followed.  Jenny was put to bed, where she promptly fell asleep.  Her comment about his weight hadn't felt important, but Jack couldn't help but feel more uncomfortable as more time passed.  His back and stomach were mildly aching as he laid himself back onto the couch.  He'd consumed most of the soup that he made, and many other snacks.  He hoped that Jenny would feel better tomorrow, and  that his new gut would go away.  His insides squirmed as he fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly was rounder in the morning.  It was actually disconcerting to look at it, Jack thought.  But he couldn't dwell on that.  He went to check on Jenny.  She was extremely nauseous, and she had vomited during the night into a pot he put beside the bed.  While he was washing the pot, she emerged from the bedroom.  She was weak, but oddly cheery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm feeling a lot better today,\" she said.  She gave jack a hug, then backed up and looked at his stomach.  She had the strangest look on her face.  \"You're pregnant,\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, ha,\" Jack replied.  \"I think we should go to a doctor and make sure that you're alright.  You getting sick just came out of the blue.\"  His stomach was having spasms while he said this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" she said again.  \"I really am feeling better.\" Again, there was something heavy on her mind.  \"Jack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That coin that you flipped into the wishing well the other day. Was it a half dollar?\"  She sounded nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What made you think of that?\" Jack wondered.  \"It was some weird gimmicky antique that I bought for a buck.  I decided that I didn't need it.\"  He said this nonchalantly, but a look of terror flashed across Jenny's face.  She hurried into the bathroom, and came back with a box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to use one,\" she said.  Jack looked at the box.  His tone changed, his stomach twitching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you have an open box of pregnancy tests, if we've never had sex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and Jenny looked into each other's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not what you think,\" she said.</span></div></div>",

When Jack asked a passerby where everyone was, the response was hushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird shit's been going on,\" said the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny hurried to the wishing well, while Jack went to buy a stethoscope.  There was a simple way of proving that she was being crazy, so he decided to go with it.  When he rejoined Jenny, she was ankle deep in the wishing well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny!  You don't just jump into the wishing well in front of everyone,\" he hissed.  She seemed distraught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack grabbed her hand and prepared to guide her out of the store, but before he could go, a female security guard approached to scold them.  She was pregnant as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to have to ask you to leave,\" said the guard.  She was thumbing the coin in her hand, as if ready to flip.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The coin flipped perilously into the air as the guard glared at both of them.  In the instant that she saw it fly, Jenny panicked.  She swiped at the coin and swiftly caught it during its decent, looking at the guard.  As she did so, the guard's face contorted with discomfort.  Her hands flung to her belly as she was forced to sit herself down beside the fountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny grabbed Jack's hand and yanked him away.  The guard shouted at them from behind, but they paid her no mind.  With the coin retrieved, Jenny and Jack returned to her apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still tense.  Jack was glad they managed to get lucky and escape before more attention was drawn to them, while Jenny was horrified at what she had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You saw what happened, right?\" she asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No?  She got sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, she flipped the coin.  When I caught it...\"  She couldn't finish the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nevermind.\"  Jenny prayed silently for the security guard<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" Jack said.  \"I bought a stethoscope.\"  He put it in his ears and held up the resonator.   I'll prove it to you.  I would hear a heartbeat if I was having a baby, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at his belly, biting her thumb.  \"Maybe you should sit down first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll sit down.  Join me,\" he said.  The two traveled to the couch and sat next to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me listen first,\" said Jenny.  She had an odd expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"  He handed her the stethoscope.  When Jenny held the stethoscope's resonator to Jack's swollen stomach, she froze.  She started exploring his belly, inching over it with mad intent, until Jack had enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Jenny.  You're being weird.  Give it back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, wait.  There's um--there's more than one heartbeat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than one heart beat?\" He asked, disbelieving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  A...a lot more than one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack snatched the stethoscope from her and listened for himself.  The cacophony of beating sounds flooded his ears.  Try as he could, he couldn't count how many hearts there were, but she was right.  Jenny had been telling the truth.  As he listened, he noticed the squirming sensation again, and a mild tapping from within.  The realization made him sick, and he rushed to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finished, he made it to the doorway before he looked in horror at his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\" he asked.  \"Is this a joke?\"  Jenny sobbed a bit in reply, unsure of what to say.  Jack hurried over to the coin where is lay and brandished it about.  \"What the fuck is this thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, set that down,\" Jenny warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to set it on fire,\" he fumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Jack, you don't understand.  That thing makes you want to flip it.  You need to set it down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makes you want to flip it?\"  Jack scoffed.  Again, Jenny was right.  He could feel a sudden urge coursing through him, as if a voice was whispering in his ear, guiding his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held the coin in his hand.</span></div></div>",

With one hand, she tried to swipe the coin in the air, but she missed.  As it fell towards the ground, she placed her other hand over Jack's eyes, forcing the lids closed.  The coin fell to the ground, but she didn't dare look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were still for a moment, until it was clear that nothing had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Jack said, uncomfortable.  Jenny grabbed him with her other arm, still blocking his vision, and pulled him toward her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a minute.  I have a plan,\" she said.  They wobbled their way towards her dresser, where she pulled out a sash that she normally used for cosplay.  Jack was using his hands to make sure that hers never left his eyes.  Jenny then wrapped the sash around his head, and slipped her hand out.  Before he could open his eyes, it was already pitch black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're screwed,\" he grumbled.  \"Help me sit down.\"  They got him onto the bed, where they continued to mull over the situation.  The whole thing sat heavy with Jack.  There was no telling how he would get the unborn children out (and they still had no idea how many there were), so they would have to schedule a doctor's appointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bill would go to my parents' insurance.  I'll have to pay up front,\" Jack surmised, intent on keeping the whole thing secret.  The expense would be serious, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been trying to call my roommate,\" Jenny said.  \"I wanted to see if getting rid of the coin would help her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was that supposed to help, again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  I thought the evil juju would be appeased, or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't <i>The Ring</i>.\"  They were quiet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make dinner.  Stay there, and  don't get up without my help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't do much blind,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day went swiftly by.  Jenny scheduled a checkup for two days ahead.  Jack's other senses became more acute in his blindness, and the reality of his body became all too real.  They even discussed the darker possibilities: finding a back alley, where the unspeakable is committed.  It was an exhausting conversation, but Jack ultimately rejected the idea.  The day finally ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay Five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack woke up feeling distinctly different.  His belly had grown significantly this time, and destroyed his center of balance.  Jenny helped him to the bathroom to pee, where he had to sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.  Like you're nine months along?\" She tried to say gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christ.\"  His hands explored the protrusion.  He froze.  Jenny had started applying a cream to the bottom half of his abdomen without telling him.  \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm shaving you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must look pretty gross,\" he guessed.  \"I don't suppose this is some weird turn-on for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finished shaving him, she thought he looked a little better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it makes you feel any better, you look just like any other fat guy,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny lead him to the couch and plopped him down.  His hands rushed to his stomach, and it was clear why.  Jenny placed her hand on top of his and hugged him tight.  They were clearly kicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack felt no maternal instinct, and no awe.  His feelings were overridden by discomfort.  The rest of the day went by without much to do, until Jenny came up with a crazy plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack heard a meowing in front of him.  \"What are we doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the neighbor's cat,\" Jenny whispered.  \"When I take off the sash, look directly at it.\"  Jack did so.  The world seemed to shimmer in front of him, and he noticed the cat change in from on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't see a change,\" Jenny said from behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did,\" Jack replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\"  They turned to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Jack said, holding her tightly.</span></div></div>",

The occasional movements of his children were utterly surreal as the changed his shape.  His skin was taut and uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny and he went to the hospital for their scheduled appointment, but the doctor that they were supposed to meet was running late.  It took a long time to actually get a room, and a longer time before anyone showed up to talk to them.  They started getting restless, so Jack started thinking uncomfortable thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny.  Do you want to be a mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at him, confused.  He continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, with me.  Did you want to have kids with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat next to him and placed her hand on his.  \"I thought it was on the table, but I hadn't thought too much about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we really going to be parents?\" he asked.  \"How are we going to raise them?  You're still trying to be a game designer, and I was on a gap year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could get your parents' to help out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they might like that.  But they won't look at me the same way again.  It'll be like I'm not a son to them.  I shouldn't be like this.\" He was almost crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny leaned her head against his, one hand placed onto his stomach.  \"If I could take them, I would,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's phone buzzed.  His parents were probably concerned about him being gone for nearly a whole week.  The message, however, didn't make sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't come home yet,\" Jack read aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see.\"  After a minute, another confusing text arrived.  \"Fumigating?  No way that's true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened for a different doctor to arrive than they expected.  He was a young man with gelled back hair and a twirly mustache<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Dale?  I'm Dr. Koff; I'll be substituting for your regular Doctor, Dr. Chin.  It seems he's tied up with an emergency.  What seems to be the problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pregnant,\" Jack said bluntly.  The physician was unmoved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting.  Can you describe your symptoms for me?\"  Dr. Koff began to write notes on his clipboard as he talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor,\" Jenny interrupted.  \"This is going to seem really strange.  My boyfriend's stomach has been growing a lot recently, and it he's been moody and nauseous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm.  Mr. Dale, I'm going to list off a series of symptoms.  Just tell me if they fit with your situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First question: Do you have any history of mental disorders in your family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question segment went on far longer than Jack was comfortable.  He was then given very basic tests, observing his heart rate, his walking pattern, and whether he could reach his toes.  The last one was particularly humiliating.  Finally, the doctor excused himself to get a sonogram machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's weird,\" Jenny said.  Her phone chimed.  \"It's Alice!\"  Her roommate.  \"She gave birth yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gave birth?\" Jack worried.  \"Where is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, she's with her parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which...\" Jack said.  He got his phone and called his dad.  He was normally quick to answer his phone, but this time took several rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Junior,\" said his mother's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?  I have to talk to you about something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son, I can't talk now.  Did you get your mo...I mean, did you get my message?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  What's going on?\"  Jack needed to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, it's unsafe at home.  You remember that lamp your mother bought?  There's something wrong with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stared at his phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, Mom?\"  There was a sigh on the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, son.  Frankly, I'm not your Mom, and I can't talk right now.\"  The phone hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Koff returned with the sonogram machine.  Jack was stunned by his conversation, but he was forced to lie back.  The setup was quick, and the gel was applied to his belly.  Everything felt wrong to Jack as he listened again to the many heartbeats play on the speakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you turn the sound off?\" Jenny asked, observing his discomfort.  Dr. Koff did so, but paid more attention to  the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't lie to you, Mr. Dale.  There are certainly large foreign masses in your abdomen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many?\" Jack asked.  The doctor shushed him.  After some time, the doctor appeared to have gotten an accurate count.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, Mr. Dale.  You're a quintuplet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A quintuplet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  If you allow me, I can show you each of the four masses.  They are quite larger than usual in this case, and much more developed, but I believe we have an advanced case of multiple fetus in fetu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why congratulations?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're alive,\" said Dr. Koff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor was a quack, Jack decided.</span></div></div>",

As Jack and Jenny guessed it would only be a few more days before  they fully matured, and the prospect terrified Jack.  How would they even get out?  The situation demanded surgery, but would doctors even know what to do?  The thought of four children being dependent on him was also overwhelming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey left the hospital as quickly as possible after finding out.  The bill was steep, and Jack decided to use his parents' insurance anyway.  They had enough going on, apparently, that his problems would be a footnote.  The doctor said that they could only schedule surgery in another couple of weeks, but there was no waiting that long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to see mom and dad,\" Jack told his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.  What if we make things worse by going?  They said not to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't just do nothing,\" Jack affirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but we have enough problems.\"  Jenny unzipped her purse and lifted up the coin briefly, attached to the end of a long magnet.  It was an attempt to keep it from being flipped.  \"I would like to check on my friend and make sure she's okay, but I wouldn't forgive myself if I flipped this within her general vicinity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said Jack.  \"Then we need to get rid of that thing, and we need to see if there's any way to undo this and the magic lamp.  If I find that Lavern guy, I swear I'm going to hurt him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Lavern?\"  Jenny asked.  Jack informed her of the occult salesman.  \"Isn't today the last day of the swap meet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We better get going, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey raced to the location of the flea market, the sun having long since receded. When they arrived, they saw many booths and tables cleaning up.  Jack hauled himself as well as he could out of the car and waddled over to where he had last seen Lavern.  Thankfully, the young man was still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you grow a tumor?\" asked Lavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you sell my parents a lamp?\"  Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I dunno.  I had a lamp...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack grabbed him by the collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mother nearly died because of that lamp.  You better make amends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, there, Willy.  I can give you your money back if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want the money,\" Jack hissed.  \"I want something I can use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\" asked the terrified Lavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a book on the occult things that you sold?  Anything like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?  Yeah, I do, I do.  Let me get it out.\"  Lavern hastily found a rustic tome and handed it over.  \"Free of charge.  We good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see,\" said Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack tried his best to read the tome as they drove to his parents' house.  There were all kinds of items referenced in the pages: amulets, lamps, and even beverage concoctions.  On one of the later pages, he found the coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here,\" Jenny said.  It was dark out, but Jack saw the porch light of his home.  On the mat was the innocuous lamp that his mother had bought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" He thought.  He and Jenny walked up to the porch.  The simple object seemed foreboding now.  Jenny pulled a pair of gloves from her tongs from her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you have those?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In case I dropped the coin,\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were footfalls just inside the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that you, Junior?\" called his mother's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, mom, it's me.  What's going on?  Why's the lamp on the porch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your mother didn't want it in the house, you see,\" answered the same voice.  \"I told her it only works when it's plugged in, but she wouldn't feel comfortable if she wasn't far away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and Jenny glanced at each other.  \"Dad, do you have mom's voice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh....sport?  Right now, the only thing of mine I have is my pinky toe, and she's got the rest.  Every time we used the lamp, it kind of...activated or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a silence.  His father didn't seem to want to go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't let you see me like this, son.  I'm sorry.  Come back tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad...\" Jack muttered.</span></div></div>",

Everything was so messed up, Jack couldn't think straight.  He didn't want to leave his parents alone, but he didn't want them to see him like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed the lamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back soon, Dad.\" he called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye, son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked back to the car, Jenny comforted him as best she could.  The lamp was thrown into the back of the car, and they returned to the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust outside, they found the cat from the previous day, glowering at them.  It was held in remaining lap of its owner, who was relaxing on a community bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Ms. Barton,\" called Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, Jenny.  Taking care of yourself?\"  Sierra Barton was nice woman, and Jenny liked to be respectful to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Jenny said, as Jack continued walking past.  \"How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm wonderful.  Do you see anything different about me?\" she asked.  Jenny had never been asked this by her before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you get new earrings?\"  There was a pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, they're quite beautiful.  You should get a set for yourself at Louise's shop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny excused herself and returned to her home.  While she did, Sierra Barton returned to caressing her tiny belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were both exhausted, and decided to go to bed.  Jack lay uncomfortably on his side, facing his girlfriend.  Instinctively, they cuddled together, and Jenny's hand lightly caressed his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay 7<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's bump had grown yet again.  It was, frankly, enormous and taut.  He was almost worried that the doctor had miscounted the number of children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny put the lamp and the coin in the closet, hoping to stay far away from them.  As she did, though, she could almost hear a voice calling out to her.  Out of fear, she ran away from it.  They got to reading the book about the items for any knowledge that they could gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe accounts were lengthy, and the background information was hard to understand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I have two days left,\" said Jack, the prospect grim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, what, you give birth at midnight on the ninth day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't specify.\"  Jack sighed and leaned back into the couch.  Every part of him ached.  Jenny cuddled up against him and continued to read.  Only, she did this by placing the book on his stomach, which was annoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand this part about \"remaking the world.\"  As in, rewrites reality?  How does that work?\" Jenny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea.  What's that bit about the heads side?  Does it make the subject accept the change, or does it fool them into thinking they were always pregnant?\"  Jack was not amused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if I flip the coin and get heads, I could make you enjoy this?\" Jenny teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't.  You would also turn me into a beached whale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reading for the lamp also a long process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it swaps people's body parts that are close together.\"  Jenny surmised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was Mom's reading lamp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope they're okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  They're probably freaked out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey day began to wind down without much progress.  The book was hard to understand.  Jack and Jenny were both distracted.  Jack by the unborn, and Jenny by a vague sound at the edge of hearing.  She thought she heard a voice calling to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was approaching midnight, when Jack suddenly had an idea.  But whether it would be accepted was another issue altogether.  The tome mentioned something about the items within being compatible<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack?\"  Jenny asked, ready to fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you love me?\"  That got her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you be willing to try something for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, God, you want to have sex, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?  I'm serious.\" Jack said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny blushed.  Jack summoned up his courage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny, would you give birth to these children for me?\"  Jack finally asked.</span></div></div>",

She loved him dearly, and she could see how much strain his circumstances were causing him.  The weight, in a very literal sense, was also exhausting him.  She remembered the panic that she had gone through when the same thing happened to her roommate.  All the while she considered his request, the voice of the coin was tempting her inside her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't do it.  The agitation was becoming overwhelming.  Jack heaved himself over to her, and held her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please do this for me,\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw the stress on her face.  Something terrible was bothering her.  She squeezed his hands and wouldn't let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't,\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?  Jenny, I don't exactly know how I'm supposed to get these out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I should.  I just can't go through that again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack considered what she had said.  \"Again?\"  Jenny took a deep breath, tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a long time ago.  Before we met.  I was only eighteen.  It was at some party.  I got pregnant.\"  She started to sob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a child?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Jenny wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack waited for her to recover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I lost her,\" was all that Jenny said.  She leaned into Jack and cried.  She could feel the unborn moving within him, but she didn't know how to feel.  It should have been the other way around.  Jack held her for a while until she finished crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you get some rest?\" he suggested.  \"I'll keep working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clock struck midnight, and the eight day began with them holding each other in their arms.  Jack's stomach, already an impressive boulder, began to grow further and push the two ever so slightly apart.  In the shock of the sudden growth, they let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, I'll stay up and keep working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny shook her head.  \"We should get some sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they considered, the thrum of the coin seemed to grow stronger.</span></div></div>",

I know your scared, but some rest will do you good. It'll do the babies good\" She said placing a hand on his pregnant belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't talk about it..\" Jack said looking away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THEM, Jack. If we can't figure this out, we have to talk about.. our babies..\" Jenny said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our babies?\" Jack answered, resting his hands atop his pregnant stomach, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to talk about a Plan B. I'm sorry I can't take them from you...\" Jenny said, exploring the vastness of Jack's pregnant self. <br>\r\n\"But I can be there for you. It might not be exactly what we had planned for the future, but... every child needs a mother\" Jenny said, kneeling down and kissing his pregnant belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't - -  You don't know what you're committing to\" placing a hand on her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I do. But it may not even come to that. Let's get some sleep and we can figure out what's going on in the morning. We still have some time before...\" Jenny said, giving Jack's belly another kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before?\" Jack said accepting his possible fatherhood fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we need to buy diapers and cribs. Or I do at least. I'm not sure hauling you out to the mall is the best idea right now. Come to bed. I'll massage your back and feet. Every preggo loves that\" She smiled grabbing Jack hand and leading him to the bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stttttoooopppp\" Jack whined, waddling behind Jenny. \"I really hate it when you do that\" Jenny kiss him on the lips with a wicked smile. \"Then you'll love what comes after the teasing preggo. Sit on the bed and let's see how we can make this work...\" She said shutting the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack and Jenny become closer, both emotionally and physically, two cosmic forces of mischief were about to collide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the coin laid on the table, seemingly harmless, it began. The thruming noise increased, almost a dull hum, like the subtle hum of office lights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coin glowed, seem to grow larger as the lamp magical mystical mischievous energy amplified the coin aura. The hum grew louder as suddenly a slight POP! emerged as the energy emerged in an near invisible shockwave explosion. Lights flickered, a small tremor shook the building, cars alarms began to go off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind the door, the squeaking spring symphony momentarily paused.  <br>\r\nFrom behind the door, the voices of Jack and Jenny engaged in a brief conversation. <br>\r\n\"What the hell was that?\" Jack asked, clearly panting. <br>\r\n\"Earthquake or something. Who knows. Stay focus and grab me this way. This is the only way it will work.\" Jenny said panting. <br>\r\n\"I'm not sure I'm still that flexible you know?\" Jack answered.<br>\r\n\"Shut up and kiss me. We can probably still do this\" Jenny answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later the sound of squeaking bedsprings could be heard again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun rose several hours later as Jenny emerged from the bedroom with a satisfied look on her face. <br>\r\nAll things considered, last night was pretty good for the both of them. Though the day would bring new challenges, Jenny believes that last nights \"activities\" would help them focus their minds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny moved over to the coffee pot and began to make a new pot. She made just a small pot, as Jenny was trying to keep Jack on a strictly healthy pregnancy diet. No coffee for Jack. She smiled to herself at that prospect and began to see what she could make for breakfast. She was thinking something simple yet healthy, as she took several pieces of fruit from the bowl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fruit, eggs, toast, milk. Just what a preggo needs</i> She thought to herself. It wasn't Jack's level of cooking, but it would do. <br>\r\nShe would need to if she was going to be... Mom. Jenny shook her head and pushed the thought out of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not yet. We still have a chance to fix this</i> Jenny thought. She looked at the clock. 8:34 AM. Later then they usually started, but Jack needed all the rest he could. It was good for him, physically and emotionally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slight thrum began again. <i>Thrum thrum thrum</i> It was stronger this time. It made her teeth tingle slightly every now and then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coin was building up for another large burst sometime later today... But Jenny was unaware. Unaware of what had transpired during their eventful rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUD! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the sound of the newspaper hitting the door. <i>Right on time</i> Jenny thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe poured herself a cup of coffee and went to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out into her apartment hallway, she bent down to grab the paper. She began to read some of the early morning headlines when she heard the two next door neighbors on her left and right open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jenny!\" A male voice said. It was Mr. Henry Patterson, an older divorcee who just recently moved into the building. For a guy in his late 40's, Jenny thought he was pretty attractive... if she was into older guys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her head to meet Mr. Patterson and wish him good morning, her eyes went wide and the coffee cup tumbled from her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt CRASHED onto the hallway rug spilling the contents onto the floor as it shattered into several pieces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Patterson wasn't wearing his usual suit-and-tie he usually wore for work. Quite the opposite. He was dressed in sweatpants and white T-shirt that clung to him like a glove. On his middle was a very large, very pregnant belly. He looked ready to pop! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shirt rode up exposing the vast pregnant midsection as it hung low, exposing his popped out belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\" He asked, placing one hand into the small of his back, and streching, causing his pregnant belly to stick out even farther. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're--- you're--- you're\" Jenny stammered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On paternity leave? Yeah. I can't wait for these two to be born.\" He said with a smile behind his salt-and-pepper beard. \"Be honest, do chicks dig single dads? I read that somewhere. The dad bod they said. I hope so, because God, I don't think I'm ever going to lose the baby weight\" He said giving his belly an firm slap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just another two weeks. Man, I can't believe this is really happening. I still don't and look at me\" He said turning to expose Jenny to more angles of his pregnancy. \"Gone from top manager at the firm to a beach pregnant whale sitting on his couch, reading pregnancy books. I think I read everyone of them twice. Although, they didn't really have anything that helped me out... But I guess being pregnant is being pregnant right? I mean, look at Seirra over there.\" Henry said, wrapping his hands around his pregnancy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, and with the greatest fear in her heart, she turned to meet her next door neighbor, the crazy cat lady, Seirra Barton. <br>\r\nShe stood at the door, her pregnant belly hanging out of her cat shirt. She wore a pair of gym shorts covered in cats. She looked just as pregnant as Henry! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof you two!\" She said, giving her belly a slap. \"Treat Mommy better or I'll drop you two off at the pound!\" She said with a smirk at her own joke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeirra Barton, the crazy cat lady of 3B in her early 50's was pregnant. Very pregnant, and nobody seemed to notice that she wasn't yesterday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Henry! Looking large!\" Seirra said waving, as she put out her cat to go exploring. She gave her own pregnant belly a good pat for emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Seirra! Just what I wanted to hear. How you feelin' over there?\" Henry shot back. \"Like a walking house on swollen legs. I had no idea being pregnant was this hard! God, none of my cat shirts fit! I hope these two know what they're doing to their poor mother!\" Seirra answered back pressing her hands into her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but it's worth it right? That's what everyone else has been saying at the pregnancy group.\" Henry smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Preg-preg-pregnancy group?\" Jenny stammered. WHAT WAS HAPPENING? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you know. The building pregnancy group. It's been a life-saver for Seirra and myself. Everything we wanted to know about  pregnancy, birth and child-rearing. I understand why you haven't come but you must have seen the fliers for months!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Months?\" Jenny stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. We OOF. That was a big one\" Henry said giving his belly a pat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta go. I gotta go now\" Jenny said stepping back into her apartment and slamming the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thruming continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack! JACK!\" She screamed running to the bedroom....</span></div></div>",

She was briefly taken aback by his naked body, but continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a problem.  I was just outside, and the neighbors--they're pregnant too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.  Ms. Barton and Mr. Patterson both.  I just saw them.\"  Jenny put her hands on her head, panicking.  The thrum of the coin persisted in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's another pregnant guy?  What did he say?\"  Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wasn't even confused,\" Jenny breathed.  The previous conversation had her reeling.  Jack made for his clothes, but the only things that still fit were a hoodie and a pair of sweats.  Even then, the hoodie was tight.  He waddled over and grabbed his girlfriend by the hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's check it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey saw a poster outside for a barbecue being held by the pregnancy group.  The organizer of the group was a woman named Charmaigne Atley.  She was in the apartment adjacent to Jenny's, and by the description she was pregnant too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many apartments are in this building again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's, what, nearly half the tenants that are pregnant now?  What could have done that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, what if using the coin on the cat made it infectious?\" Jenny blurted.  Jack tried his best to calm her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?  Don't be ridiculous.  No way that could happen.\"  He despondently felt his own swollen belly.  \"Maybe we should attend the barbecue and get some info.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should!\" chimed in a stranger from behind.  They turned to spot Charmaigne Atley.  She was a short, petite black woman with long dreadlocks.  In her center was a large pregnant belly, jutting out from her tiny frame.  Her eyes grew big when looking at Jack.  \"The group has been a great way for all of us help each other out.  What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack.\"  He was a little hesitant to to talk with her.  He felt exposed.  \"I'm Jenny's--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--Friend from college.  He's just visiting,\" Jenny hurriedly said.  \"I would like to attend, though.  I want to congratulate everyone properly.  Will everyone else in the building be there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" Charmaigne said.  \"I'm so glad that I got Dylan to promise to bring her cornbread.  This little one has been craving it for all week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plans were made, and Jack and Jenny returned to the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack wondered.  \"Did we just teleport to a parallel universe or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  I'll see what I can find out at the barbecue.\" The barbecue scheduled for noon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack got the paper pad where they had been writing notes from the tome.  They knew that the items could be used together, and that their effects might change.  Both items worked in a similar way.  They affected the next person that was looked at by the user.  Jack took the two artifacts and placed them on the table by the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey formed a plan, and waited for the barbecue to begin.  Everyone from the building was attending.  Jack stayed in the room, while Jenny went out to talk.  At regular intervals, Jenny was going to walk out of sight, while Jack tried to use the lamp on the attendants.  When he held the coin in one hand, and the lamp\u2019s pull chain in the other, he felt a current pass through him.  He took this to mean that the objects were reacting to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all they knew, there was no method of reversing the effects of the coin by itself.  The only option that they saw was to try to add something new to the environment.  For now, he intended only to pull the chain of the lamp, and not to flip the coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party began...</span></div></div>",

I'm having triplets,\" Ms. Barton said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe experiment was going cleanly.  Everyone from the building was outside, helping to prepare the party for all of the tenants.  Ms. Barton, Ms. Atley, and Mr. Patterson had been the Jack's focus.  He sat uncomfortably by the window, peering at the gathering.  As he held the coin in his left hand, and the lamp's chain in his right, he focused his attention on the three as best as he could.  Unfortunately, the other tenants would sometimes get in the way.  The result was that the babies would movie between tenants for each pull of the chain.  No one seemed to notice that changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was careful to keep Jenny out of his sight. He was terrified of making their situation worse.  In truth, he wasn't sure how whether this experiment would fix anything for them.  It was an extremely dangerous thing to do, considering what had been happening to his parents, but Jack had not been affected by the artifacts as of yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coin was growing hot inside of his hand, and a thrum of power was resounding in his ears.  It was growing more intense over time.  The voice that tempted him to flip it had vanished, but he wasn't sure what to make of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis phone rang.  It was his father.  Jack worriedly put the phone on speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you doing, dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're doing okay, son,\" said his mother's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's your father.  I wanted to make sure that you were okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack thought about that.  Jenny had been incredibly supportive during this ordeal.  He didn't know what he was going to do about being a father, though.  He hadn't even properly chose a career for himself.  How was he supposed to support four children and Jenny?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nevermind about me, Dad.  What about you and Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack Sr.'s voice began to change tone.  \"Well, that's part of why I wanted to call.  See, I hope you're not playing with that magical doo-hickie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack Jr. pulled the chain a couple more times as he looked at the barbecue.  \"Nope,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you had been, I wanted to let you know that the affects seem to be wearing off.  I'm mostly the same again.  I just wish my voice would get back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack paused.  The lamp's power wore off over time?  \"You're doing better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it seems over the past hour  we've been getting back to normal pretty quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prep for the barbecue, and their experiment, had started about the same time.  He may have been undoing the curse on his parents.  Jack started pulling more frequently on the chain as he looked at the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear, Dad,\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm glad it's going away,\" his father said, finally sounding normal.  \"There was something else that I wanted to talk with you about.  I looked the peep hole when you visited, and um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack made a final pull of the chain.  There was no getting around this conversation.  \"Um, dad?  Do you remember that cheap coin that I bought?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh, the point is that Jenny and I are...\"  He had to force it out.  \"We're pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" his father finally said.  \"What are you going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I do?\" Jack mumbled.  The experiment on the barbecue didn't seem to be undoing the affects of the coin, but if it had spare his parents, that was still something.  The coin was becoming hotter in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, son, there are things a man has to do for his family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel more like the mother in this situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well, about that, Junior.  There comes a point where a man has to, well, man up.  And some responsibilities can't be dodged, or ignored.  I was happy to let you figure out what you want to do with your life, but if life is calling you to something--then that's what you need to focus on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was having a hard time speaking.  He looked down at the heavy mass of his abdomen, where four children resided.  \"I think this might be too much for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Junior.  You know your mother and I will always be there for you.  Quite frankly, she'll be over the moon to hear the news.  She was so excited when she found out that you would have a brother, and here I am ready to parent again as well.  I didn't expect to experience what your mother went through, but that's that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack froze.  \"No.  No.  No.\"   He turned back to the part to the party and began to pull rapidly on the chain.  The bellies of the tenants shrank and grew at alarming rates.  Each time he pulled the chain, the coin became hotter in his hand.  It was starting to burn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, son?\" asked his father after the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coin burned hot, and Jack yelped in pain.  He dropped it. The coin, glowing red, bounced off of the wooden floor and flipped many times.  Jack dropped as best as he could to try and catch it, but he only found himself staring at the result.  Tails.  As he fell, he had pulled the chain one final time and let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he saw anyone, it would be a disaster gain.  Jack Jr. forced his eyes shut, but the magic of the lamp was still in effect.  He had looked at the inside of his own eyelids, and for the lamp that was enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a current run through him, and his body grow hot.  As he sank against the wall, eyes shut, Jack grabbed his phone and hung up.  He would have to wait for Jenny.  Pressure mounted inside his belly, and he felt the mound of flesh with his hands.  To his horror, the skin stretched, and his belly swelled outward.  It was slow, but constant.  His breath labored, and his body grew heavy.  He was on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat there, immobile for a time, keeping his eyes shut.  His belly was broad, and had grown out to the length of his knees.  Every child that the coin had created, that had not been born, had been transferred into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack!  It worked!\" screamed Jenny as she ran into the apartment.  She was shocked when she entered her room and saw her boyfriend in his condition.  \"Oh, Jack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran to his side and held his head in her arms.  She placed her forehead against his, and whispered, \"It will be alright.\"  Jack tried hard to keep his eyes shut as he cried.</span></div></div>",

There was only the two of them together, for all that they were concerned.  Jenny didn't know how he had turned out this way, but it didn't matter.  She wiped the tears from his cheeks with her hands.  On the floor, the coin was red hot and shaking, it's magic unstable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack couldn't help from opening his eyes and looking into Jenny's.  He saw his own reflection as he peered into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment, the coin was overtaxed, and it came across a contradiction.  It couldn't focus on either Jack or Jenny, could not prioritize between the two.  The stress of the magic caused the coin to crack and spark.  They turned to see the artifact sputter and flip itself again and again, until it broke into pieces on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the very instant, it's magic was undone.  Jack's figure was restored to normal in a flash, as if nothing had happened.  He and Jenny were ecstatic, and they embraced each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it,\" Jack whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey turned to look outside at the ongoing barbecue.  The signs had changed to that of a generic birthday party, and no on attending was expecting any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack called his parents back.  They were fine.  It was an awkward conversation, but everything was back to normal, and that was all that mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey threw both the fragments of the coin and the whole of the lamp into the garbage, and disposed of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and Jenny returned to college.  Jenny's life continued more or less ordinarily, but her roommate decided to move out to raise her new children.  Jack moved in.  The experience had shaken Jack into thinking more about his future, and he took on life in a more determined fashion.  They were closer for their experience, and more firmly looking forward to their lives together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe End<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No, I've never been good with cats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure you could get used to it.

Really you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny brought the cat into her apartment.  Jack was twiddling his thumbs on the couch as he was brought up to speed.  He glanced at the cat that Jenny had brought in.  The one that they had turned into an experiment.  She was glaring at him.  Accusing.  \"I know what you did,\" it seemed to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInspecting it further, the cat looked a little smaller than when he had seen it change before.

So...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother swift KICK from his occupants caused Jack to grimace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We tell your parents\" Jenny finally rushed out under her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry what?!\" Jack answered back sharply his voice raising a few levels as he hefted his pregnant form of the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, please you should sit..\" Jenny said meekly. She knew this would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to tell my parents that... I'm.. I'm\" Jack couldn't finish the sentence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pregnant. Yes. Look I love you, and I love having you here, but you're going to have to go home sometimes.. Either with a belly or a baby. They're going to ask question, especially when the bill arrives\" Jenny made logical sense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how are we going to convince them that..\" Jack said, lifting up his shirt to reveal the belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know?! This isn't how this is supposed to go\" Jack motioned to his pregnancy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I was thinking about it.. And...\" Jenny looked to the coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" Jack nearly toppled over from the shock, catching himself on the corner of a bookshelf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not what you think. We, or should I say you, saw what happened with the cat. We take the coin and find a dog or cat or goldfish and demonstrate it's power on it. It's perfect.\" Jenny said meekly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hand rubbing his head, the other rubbing his pregnant belly, Jack let out a sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do.. do we have too?\" Jack said softly. He put both hands on his pregnant belly and rubbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're parents are going to find out one way or another. This time it's on your own terms. You can control the message.\" Jenny said, walking over to him, placing a hand on his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the message. Hi Mom and Dad, sorry I haven't been around for the past few days. Turns out that coin I bought at the swap meet was magical and I'm pregnant. But hey, good news, you're going to be grandparents!\" Jack said sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look if we tell them, they can help us... do something. I mean if we can't figure out something to do with these ones..\" Jenny said slowly moving her hand across Jack's belly \"They could at least buy us some cribs and diapers\" Jenny said with a laugh that covered the worry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great\" Jack said with a huff. He hated to admit it, she was right. If they didn't think of something, Jack was going to need a backup plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach gurgled with hunger. \"I'm hungry\" Jack said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny smiled. \"I bet you are. What are you craving?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sound craving. It makes me sound..\" Jack hesitated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pregnant?\" Jenny said with a wicked smile, patting his belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could go for some Mac &amp; Cheese. Like the yellow powder box kind... And a lot of it... With some chocolate milk.... And some pickles..\" Jack said sheepishly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Preggo\" Jenny said with a light pack on Jack's belly. \"Get to the table, and I'll see what I have.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-  - -  - Meanwhile - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat mewed softly as it returned back to it's owner apartment. Sierra Barton was the cat's owner, a lonely yet pretty woman on the verge of 50. She loved her cat, she was a cat woman. Just looking at her apartment would tell you that. Everything was cats. Cat shirts, cat clocks, cat pictures, cat figurines, cats cats cats. It had more cats then the movie CATS and that was saying something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sitting on the couch, watching some trashy talk show, as she usually did on her day off, sighing to herself. Her cat jumped up onto her lap and perched herself right on her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MEOW!\" The cat said loudly and sternly. \"What's the matter Ms. Whiskers? No luck in love prowling the city? I know the feeling\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother distressed meow emerged from the cat before the air around the cat began to shimmer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the - - - \" Sierra said softly before the cat leap on her stomach. Suddenly, she felt a great pressure in her stomach as it slowly began to expand - - -  -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - Day 6 - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stood in front of the door of his house, a hand in the small of his back to maintain his balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no mistaking it now. He was pregnant. VERY pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready?\" Jenny said softly, rubbing his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, every man dreams of the day he tells his parents he's pregnant\" He said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to chalk that up to the hormones\" Jenny slapped slapping his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack rang the bell.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I didn't eat that much while we were out!' He thought. <br>\r\n The mass having settled into his hips, put pressure on his nether regions, like something was going to fall out of him. Something large. <br>\r\n He had to spread his legs slightly as the pressure betqeen them grew, and then more as it continued. <br>\r\n Finally, just as it felt like he was really going to burst, it tapered off. <br>\r\n There was nothing reflective nearby, but he felt enormous. Looking down on himself the belly rounding out in front of him had to be larger than any pregnant woman he had seen, or any guy with a beer belly. <br>\r\n His shirt only covered the top most part, and he could feel that his pants had slipped down, exposing the top of his boxers and butt. <br>\r\n 'What the hell has happened to me?'

One hand quickly found its way to the small of his back as the weight tugged on his back. <br>\r\n Luckily his apartment was near the elevator, and he would soon be in the comfort of his apartment and, most important to him right now, his couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

His chest ached, though he wasn't sure why yet. <br>\r\nHe put his hands on the mound, feeling how right it was, like there was no room to grow, maybe the only reason he had stopped. <br>\r\n The skin was sore, running his hands over what he could reach soothed it, and he foubd himself tuning out, rubning the belly. <br>\r\n And then something inside...<i>moved.</i><br>\r\n \"What... What the fuck?\"<br>\r\n He placed his hand over the spot, pressing in slightly, and felt something oress back from inside. He wipped his hand back like he'd been burned. <br>\r\n Was it a parasite? Or were his organs rebelling after the expansion?<br>\r\n He felt more movement up towards the top of his belly, two shapes denting the skin, pushing out. As he felt it at the top of his belly he felt more pressure at the bottom, as if something was pushing to get out. Then he also felt more movement on the otherside. <br>\r\n The pressure down below felt like it had crushed his bladder. He had to pee badly. It has been hard enough to get to the couch, now he had to get up!<br>\r\n \"Ok, I can do this. Come on...\"<br>\r\n He tried to get up like normal, but he couldn't bend around his stomach at all. It was a big boulder, sitting on his hips. <br>\r\n Finally he tried sliding down off the couch,  into a slight crouch, that worked. <br>\r\n But now the full weight of his mound, squirming with whatever was in there, now bore down on his bladder. <br>\r\n He used the couch as leverage to help stand up, and started to waddle to the bathroom. Each step he took shifted the weight back and forth, making it harder and harder to hold. <br>\r\n He made it to the bathroom just in time. <br>\r\n Leaning against the wall, he relieved himself, glad he didn't have to sit. <br>\r\n He shook it out, feeling some slight relief from the presure inside of him. <br>\r\n As he turned to leave the bathroom, he caught himself in the mirror. <br>\r\n He stopped and stared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n An immense, round, mound hung from him. Like a large beachball. He turned to face the mirror, taking iff his shirt. <br>\r\n Starting down, he could see his chest was oddly swillen. His nipples had darkened. <br>\r\n But his belly... It was immense. <br>\r\n A dark line ran down the center of it. The skin was stretched, shiny, and pale. As he stared, he could see slight bumps raising against his skin. <br>\r\n \"What the hell is happening to me?\" He wondered out loud. <br>\r\n He waddled back to the couch, and sertled himself more carefully into it. <br>\r\n Something tugged at his mind, but it was impossible. <br>\r\n Just then, there was a knocking on the door. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

This just started and now I'm huge and swollen and here you are looking at me!\"<br>\r\n Jack waddled back to the couch, as whatever inside him kept moving, soon something else responded to the first thing and it there was a wave of bumos and jumps coming from the belly. <br>\r\n Holly walked forward and touched it, feeling the bumos and pokes as Jack grunted and ran his hands over his belly, trying to calm down whatever was inside. <br>\r\n She looked him ul and down. His chest was swollen, looking like breasts. The nipples were dark and stood out. <br>\r\n The belly was a large globe, sitting on his lap, and she could she his hips had widened and spread out. <br>\r\n In short he looked... <br>\r\n \"Jack... Are you pregnant?\"<br>\r\n \"No! I can't be pregnant. I'm a guy. Guys do not get pregnant. Girls get pregnant, not guys.\"<br>\r\n\"Well I mean, look at you! Your belly is huge, and there's definitely something in there moving.\"<br>\r\n \"Two somethings.\"<br>\r\n \"Ok, two somethings. You look ready to pop! I thought something was up but... How did this happen? You didn't look like this yesterday:-!\"<br>\r\n \"I don't know, we went to the flea market and left. My parents dropped me off. My stomach hurt, and I grew into... This.\" He said with a gesture to his stomach. <br>\r\n\"But that isn't possible! No one goes from not pregnant to almost due in an hour! And like..  are you... Like...\"<br>\r\n \"Well. I'm living it, so much for impossible. And am I what?\"<br>\r\n \"Well like... Trans? Because yeah. Guys can't get pregnant.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm a guy! Seriously! You can check!\"<br>\r\nHolly blushed. \"Um. Maybe later. Ok, I guess it isn't crazier than that suddenly appearing.\"<br>\r\n \"So did you get anything at the market?\"<br>\r\n\"The only thing I got was this coin, I can't see how it'd have done this.\"<br>\r\n \"Can I see it? I mean, this whole thing is crazy,  why not a magic coin?\"<br>\r\n \"Ok ok..\"<br>\r\n Jack started to get up, then looked at Holly. <br>\r\n\"Uh.. Y'mind?\"<br>\r\n\"What? Oh, sure.\" She reached out to help him up. <br>\r\n Instead, when she reached out to help she got tugged over and fell onto hin. <br>\r\n Her face was nearly in his chest, and her flat stomach was against his. <br>\r\n She could feel his babies kicking against her. Embarrassed, she pulled back and stood up. Both of the were blushing. <br>\r\n \"Well you are heavier than I thought. I mean, you know because of the babies. Because ithrer than that you look fine. \"<br>\r\n \"I look fine?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah. I've been spying on you for awhile. \"<br>\r\n \"Oh. Ok. Right.\"<br>\r\n Holly blushed again.<br>\r\n \"I titally didn't mean to say that outloud. Let me just help you up.\"<br>\r\n A bit more carefully she helped Jack get out of the couch. He lumbered to where he left his pants and tried to bend over to pick them up, nearly losing his balance. <br>\r\n\"Do you... Want me to get them?\"<br>\r\n \"No, I can do it.\" Jack dropped to a squat and was finally able to snag his jeans. With effort, he stood again, putting his hand to his back as he stood, panting slightly. <br>\r\n \"Ok, here we go.\" <br>\r\nReaching into the pocket he tried to pull out the coin. But it got stuck on its way out, and flipped oit of the pocket. <br>\r\n He managed to catch it. He looked up...</span></div></div>",

Uh, there.\" <br>\r\n Jack pointed to the hallway that held the bathroom and Holly ran towards it, still clutching the coin. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Ok, that was weird.\" <br>\r\n More movement from his abdomen brought his hand to it.<br>\r\n\"Ok, compared to this, perfectly normal.\"<br>\r\n He lowered himself back onto the couch, his back was straining just from standing for a few minutes. <br>\r\n  His shirt couldn't cover half of it, now just bunched up at the start of his swell. Looking down at it, he could tell his chest was poking out more as well. <br>\r\n And his belly... <br>\r\n It curved out, swollen so he couldn't see his lap. It felt like 30 pounds were strapped to him, pushing him down into the cushions. <br>\r\n And there was so much movement. <br>\r\n His hands moved across it, following the movements. <br>\r\n He felt like he was in a trance, following each movement. <br>\r\n Until he heard Holly cough and let out a disgusted noise as she came back into the room. <br>\r\n\"Sorry, I don't know what happened. Just suddenly had to hurl.\"<br>\r\n \"Do you think it was the coin?\" <br>\r\nShe froze for a second, and touched her belly. <br>\r\n \"I don't know, how quickly did it happen for you?\" <br>\r\n\"Quick. I went from normal to Mr. Mom between getting dropped off and getting back here.\" <br>\r\n The end of the sentence was punctuated by an \"oof\" as one of the twins gave him a hard kick to the kidneys. <br>\r\n She moved towards him. \"Are you ok?\"<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine, but they won't stop moving. Just got a hard kick.\"<br>\r\n\"Um... do you mind if I feel?\"<br>\r\n He looked at her for a moment.<br>\r\n \"Y-yeah. Just... here.\" <br>\r\n She bent over him, and he placed her hand on one side of his abdomen. <br>\r\n Which also put her chest about on level with his eyes. <br>\r\n He couldn't help but stare, and himself grow hard, under the weight of his belly. <br>\r\n For just a moment, he felt a bit of relief that his member was hidden. <br>\r\n Holly was in awe with his belly, her hand chasing around the movements inside. <br>\r\n And her hand moving across the swollen mass felt... really good. <br>\r\n \"As weird as it is, this is... kinda cool.\"<br>\r\n \"Yeah,\" he muttered. He wasn't really paying attention, feeling a pressing concern rising on him. <br>\r\n \"It's so weird in like, so many ways. But there's someone in there, alive. Moving. How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n His brain was a bit oxygen deprived, and a bit distracted, to catch his mouth in time. <br>\r\n\"Horny.\"<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Holly snatched her hand away. <br>\r\n\"Hot! I meant hot! This things like a furnace. And my back hurts. My hips hurt. My chest is swollen, and it hurts. I'm growing boobs! I'm heavy and fat. And I don't know what I'm feeling, and then you come in and find me all weird and pregnant.\"<br>\r\nHolly stood in front of him, the hand that had been clutching his belly resting on hers. <br>\r\n\"So... not good then?\" <br>\r\n\"No. Not good.\" <br>\r\n Jack felt himself blushing. All of that was true, and on top of the swelling in the last few minutes his chest... his breasts? Had started to ache. <br>\r\n And yeah. Hadn't he heard something about hormones? Hoo boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She looked at him for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He felt his blush get deeper. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"O...k.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He relaxed a little. <br>\r\n And noticed she was blushing as well. <br>\r\n Hadn't she said something about spying on him?<br>\r\n She waved the coin. <br>\r\n \"If this wasn't so weird, I'd say this is just a coin. But you, well. You're pregnant. And this coin has pregnancy all over it. It's got to be tied together.\"<br>\r\n \"So what do I do?\" <br>\r\n He could feel the panic pulling at him, but kept it down.<br>\r\n\"<i>We</i> are going to see what we can find out.\"<br>\r\n He felt relief flood through him, cool after the blush.<br>\r\n \"Thank you.\" <br>\r\n \"I'm not going to leave you alone, I promise. So what do we do first?\"</span></div></div>",

With just his drawers on he really didn't want to stand up right now. <br>\r\n He glanced down at himself, glad that his belly ws covering it... and noticed that his nipples were standing out, tenting his shirt. <br>\r\n<i>Oh god, what does that mean?</i> he though.<br>\r\n\"Oh, right. Let me help you.\"<br>\r\nHe was stuck. Not just on the couch. But he couldn't not get up, because she'd want to know why. <br>\r\n And when he stood up, she'd <i>know</i> why. <br>\r\nHe felt a blush again, certain he never blushed before getting pregnant. <br>\r\n \"Ok.Uh... well. I'm a little...\" he lifted his arms and she helped him stand. <br>\r\n \"A little...? Oh. OH.\" <br>\r\n His belly went into hers again, and then something lower brushed her leg. <br>\r\nShe took a few steps back, looked, and blushed as red as he was. <br>\r\n\"That uh.\" She stopped, then tried again. <br>\r\n \"That's not um. Little. Exactly.\" <br>\r\n Jack wasn't sure what to say. Nothing about him was little at the moment. Normally he'd feel good with a girl saying that but, well...<br>\r\n\"Um. Thanks. Sorry. Can't help it. I don't know. Hormones? I'm sorry. You're really hot and this isn't. This is weird. Can't help it.

That happens.\" <br>\r\n She kept staring. Jack dropped his hands below his belly. <br>\r\n\"Computer?\" <br>\r\n She nodded. <br>\r\n\"Yeah. Um. Computer.\" <br>\r\nBoth of them were now blushing so hard the temperature in the room seemed to increase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n She said \"After you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jack blinked. <br>\r\n\"Right.\"<br>\r\n He waddled past Holly, towards his bedroom. Maybe he had something that would help him... cover up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Holly followed behind him. Watching him waddle. She noted that she could see the roundess of his front from behind.

The weight on his hips felt like one of the large exercise balls he'd had to use in PE when he was younger. Adding to that his chest... jiggled, and his nipples felt like they were dragging across burlap. <br>\r\n<i>This sucks.</i> He thought. <br>\r\n And he felt out of breath. Just great. What must Holly think of him? His embarrassment deepened. <br>\r\n He opened the door to his bedroom, and then turned his head to Holly. <br>\r\n\"Do you mind giving me a moment? I want to try to find some pants that will uh. Fit. Or something.\" And maybe make sure there was nothing embarrassing left open on the computer, put some stuff elsewhere. He wasn't planning to have company (at that thought his hand brushed his belly) but he wasn't a total slob. <br>\r\n She was looking down when he turned to her, and she looked up blushing. <br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n \"I'm just going to look for pants or something real quick. Give me a minute?\" <br>\r\n She glanced towards his crotch, then back up. And blushed more. <br>\r\nHe felt himself flush again. <br>\r\n\"No! No not. No. Definitely no. No. I just want to see if I have something that I can y'know. Cover up. Some.\" <br>\r\n Because nothing he had would fit over his belly. <br>\r\n\"Oh. Right. Yeah. Good idea. Yep.\" <br>\r\n She watched him waddle into the room. <br>\r\n What was wrong with her? She wasn't usually like this. And yeah, she'd been spying on him for weeks. Ok, months.  <br>\r\n But right now? <br>\r\n Sure he'd... been blessed. <br>\r\n But seriously. <br>\r\n She heard noises from the room as drawers were opened and shut, and stuff moved. <br>\r\n That butt. Seriously. <br>\r\n She shook her head. <br>\r\n Cursing came from his room. <br>\r\n \"Are you ok?\" she asked. <br>\r\n \"Got a pair of basketball shorts. Trying to get them on. Not used to not being able to bend. And the babies aren't helping.\"<br>\r\n And something about that tickled her. <br>\r\n\"Do you want a hand?\" she asked. <br>\r\n\"Not... really. This is embarrassing.\"<br>\r\n \"It's ok, usually someone would have 9 months to get used to a belly.\" <br>\r\n\"<i>Women</i> would usually have 9 months. I had maybe ten minutes.\"<br>\r\n Holly rubbed her belly. Ten minutes? It had been more than that, right? <br>\r\n She had to be in the clear. <br>\r\n She heard more grunting and groaning from his room. <br>\r\n\"Look, let me help. You don't want to push yourself to hard. Who knows what might happen.\"<br>\r\nThere was silence from the room for a moment, then \"But it's just pants!\" <br>\r\n \"Ok, we can go without then.\" <br>\r\nMore silence. <br>\r\n \"I'd rather not.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok then.\"<br>\r\n\"Fine.\"<br>\r\n She walked into his room, and saw Jack trying to sit up on the edge of his bed. <br>\r\n He had a pair of black and blue basketball shorts on one leg, more or less. His belly covered her lap. <br>\r\n Which was good, she thought. Really. <br>\r\n Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I can't even put on my shorts,\" he moaned. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Look, don't worry about that. I'm here to help you. So let me help. Can you stand or?\"<br>\r\n \"I can do it,\" he said. He slid off the bed into a slight crouch, then stood up. <br>\r\n She noted he had gone down. <br>\r\n \"Ok, give me your shorts. I'll bend down, grab my shoulders, and then put one foot in each leg of the shorts. I'll pull them up.\" <br>\r\n Which would put her head... nevermind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He flushed a little. Which was cute. <br>\r\n And she had to admit she was feeling a bit... warm in certain places. <br>\r\n <i>Maybe it's the coin?</i><br>\r\n He put his weight on her, which nearly knocked her over at first. <br>\r\n Then he did as she said. She pulled the shorts up his legs. <br>\r\n <i>Careful with your hands,</i> she thought. Don't want to...<br>\r\n The shorts reached his waist, with a stretch. Now his bottom was covered, and his torso was... partially covered. <br>\r\n His belly was still well out, though. <br>\r\n She could actually see movement still. <br>\r\n \"Not giving you a break, are they?\" she asked.<br>\r\nHe put his hands on his belly, and rubbed circles on it. <br>\r\n \"No, I don't think they've stopped yet.\" He looked down, then up at her.<br>\r\n\"You're going to have to use the computer. No way I can sit there right now.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n She sat in the chair and slid it to the desk.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Ok, so let's look at the coin. Are there any marks on it? Like a language?\"<br>\r\n She pulled it from her pocket. <br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">Flip me</span><br>\r\n She looked puzzled for a moment. She flipped the coin over and stared at it. <br>\r\n \"No, just pregnant people on one side, and pregnant people on the other. One side they seem happy, the other worried.\"<br>\r\nJack let out a sigh. <br>\r\n \"Yeah, I thought maybe I missed something. Nothing on the edge either?\" <br>\r\n <span class=\"clred\">Come on. Flip me.</span><br>\r\nHolly felt puzzled again, then rolled the coin onto it's edge. <br>\r\n \"No... just... wait. There's a number. 12?\" <br>\r\n \"Well, that's not helpful.\" <br>\r\n \"OK. Well, we have an old coin. Don't know what the metal is. Makes men pregnant.\" <br>\r\n Jack made an unhappy noise.<br>\r\n \"Has pictures of pregnant people, and the number twelve.\" <br>\r\n Jack let out a sigh, then said \"Well I guess it's a start, at least.\"<br>\r\n \"Do you remember where you got it?\"<br>\r\n\"At the fleamarket.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but who did you buy it from?\"<br>\r\nHe paused. <br>\r\n \"I don't remember.\"<br>\r\n\"You don't remember?\" <br>\r\n \"I dunno. I just sort of picked it up and then... I'm not sure.\"<br>\r\n\"Did you steal it?\"<br>\r\n\"No. Yeah, I bought it. From some... goth guy? I don't know, it's fuzzy.\"<br>\r\n\"Weird.\"<br>\r\nHe motioned to his belly, where it rippled a few times. She also noticed his chest. <br>\r\n\"OK, ok. Fair.\" <br>\r\n She thought for a moment. <br>\r\n\"OK, first we'll see what we can find online. If we don't find anything, then we'll go to the Fleamarket and snoop.\"<br>\r\n\"But it won't be open again until Friday! That's five days! I can't go around like this!\" <br>\r\n\"Lets just...\"<br>\r\n\"What if I have to... I mean. They... they come out?\" <br>\r\n \"Well... I mean for one, if you are having twins, you still have a lot of growing to do.\"<br>\r\nJack paled. <br>\r\n\"I'll get bigger?\" he whimpered.<br>\r\n She nodded. <br>\r\n\"Oh. Great.\" he said, a bit breathlessly. <br>\r\n \"But what about people and work?\" <br>\r\n \"What do you do?\" <br>\r\n\"Ok I work from home. So that's ok. I can do the coding here.\" <br>\r\n She nodded. <br>\r\n He relaxed a little. <br>\r\n \"But still, this could just keep growing like it has been.\" He looked down. <br>\r\n \"Then we'll deal with that,\" she said, grabbing his hand. <br>\r\n \"OK.\" he squeezed her hand. Having a framework of a plan helped. As did having Holly nearby.<br>\r\nShe turned back to the computer. <br>\r\n \"Alright, let's get started.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack looked out the window and spotted someone walking down the street. It was their neighbor, Faye Jones. She and her husband had been your parent's neighbors for decades. When they first moved in when you were just a kid, they were a young and happy couple. But they didn't stay that way for too long. The one thing that she and her husband wanted more than anything was to start a family. For years they tried to get pregnant. When they got tested for fertility, it was discovered that Faye had a rare genetic disorder, PCOS. (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome) She would grow cancerous cysts in her ovaries - meaning that the chances of her getting pregnant were slim to none. While chances to increase her fertility were possible, they had very unsatisfying results. After a while, they gave up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was in her early forties. Tension began to rise between her and her husband and they slowly drifted apart. She had the look of a woman who hadn't been touched in years. Jack wondered if they considered adoption - but judging by how forlorn she always looked, he could assume they hadn't. He didn't know why, but he began to feel the alien voice in his head wanted him to specifically look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his hand and looked down at the coin. It was what Jack was considering Tails. It was hard to tell with this coin - the only difference between the two sides was that one side had the couple smiling, and the other had them frowning. In Jack's palm was the latter side. He wondered why they were so different, but he probably figured that the pregnancy on this side was an accident. Quite frankly, he was surprised the man wasn't frowning on both sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was focused on the coin, he didn't even realize that the car had driven up to the house. His dad parked and they all stepped out. Jack slipped the coin into his pocket. Something drew his eyes back toward Faye Jones - watching her as she solemnly strolled down the street. He knew that it wouldn't be long before the midlife crisis struck and her husband left her...How sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued into the house and went up to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, Jack had just finished showering. He was drinking a cup of coffee while putting on his work uniform. He had at most two hours before work, so he decided to sit down to read a comic book. While he was reading, he looked at his desk and saw the coin he'd bought yesterday. There was something so weird about the coin. As he stared at it, he took noticed of his own heartbeat - he heard it much louder and clearer now, almost like it was a base drum. For a few more moments continuing to stare at it, he heard what was tantamount to a dog whistle. He snapped out of it when he heard that. He shook his head for a moment and no longer heard anything. He figured it was just his imagination. He returned to his comic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly heard the doorbell ringing downstairs. He could hear someone go to the door. He could just faintly hear the mumbling of a conversation, but couldn't tell what was being said. But soon he heard his mom cheering and his dad began to laugh. He heard what sounded like clapping. Jack was intrigued. He went downstairs and saw his mom sitting on one of the couches in the living room in front of the coffee table. She was happy. He looked to the opposing couch and saw Faye Jones and her husband, Charles sitting there. They were smiling as well. He then saw his dad return with two coffee mugs - but he noticed that only one had coffee; the other had milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mom suddenly spotted him standing there. \"Oh Honey,\" she said. \"Come-in, come-in. Faye and Charlie have got some wonderful news.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack did as he was told and smiled when he greeted them. \"Hi Mr. and Mrs. Jones - so, what's the big news?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple looked at each other and held each others hands tightly. Faye was giggling as she turned back towards him and said, \"I'm pregnant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gonna have a baby!\" Charles added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was taken aback by this. It was very exciting news. After all these years, they were finally going to be parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally got one of your boys through, eh Chuck!\" Jack heard his dad say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None too soon,\" Charles answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow - this is incredibly good news!\" Jack finally said. He extended his hand toward Charles and said, \"Well, congratulations are in order. How did you find out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharles shook his hand as Faye answered his question. \"Well, it was the strangest thing. When I woke up this morning, I felt absolutely dreadful. I started throwing up at an alarming rate. Charles got worried so he took me to the doctors. The doctor told me that it was probably morning sickness. As good as it was we just couldn't believe him. He was almost positive, but just to be sure, he asked to take a blood sample to test. But for our confirmation, he recommended that we take some at-home pregnancy tests. So we picked some up and went home immediately. And it turned blue! I mean - I know we shouldn't be getting ahead of ourselves and wait for the results. But right now, we're both too excited.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it did turn Blue,\" your mom chimed in. \"I think you two are justified in your expectations. You're going to have a baby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was just taking all of this in. This was really strange. The woman sitting in front of him barely resembled the one he'd looked at on the street yesterday. The solemn expression she had clearly showed that things weren't going well with her husband. But now, they were as happy as could be; they were pregnant. But how could that be? According to their story, all of this seemed to happen overnight. And judging from the look of her yesterday, it was a safe bet that it had. The previous day, she was the withering shell of a woman, starved for attention. Now she was so vibrant and full of life - no pun intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack suddenly had a disturbing thought; was all of this something to do with the coin he'd bought? How ironic was it that he had a coin with pregnant people on it, he looked at Faye when he flipped the coin...and now she was pregnant. Had the coin given her what she wanted? No way - that was just too bizarre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack suddenly remembered that he had to get to work, and wanted to stop for a late breakfast on the way. So he looked at his watch and began to politely excuse himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is such great news you two,\" he said. \"I'm sorry I can't stay for more, but I've actually gotta get to work. But, congratulations again, and good luck with everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Jack,\" Faye said. So Jack left the room and went back upstairs to get the rest of his stuff. He grabbed his wallet, keys and cellphone. But before he walked out of the room, he looked back at the desk and saw the coin there again. He was a bit confused about what to think. It seemed like an extraordinary coincidence that he'd bought that coin, and then Faye became pregnant the very next day. It was impossible - not only was she over 40 years old, but she also had PCOS. It truly was some kind of miracle.<br>\r\nAnd that's what made Jack a bit nervous. He didn't believe in the Occult...but what if? Just what if the coin could somehow affect her fertility? Ever since he'd bought the coin, he'd been hearing some strange thoughts in his head; it told him to flip the coin and then look at someone. He looked at Faye, and now she was pregnant. And if the coin had nothing to do with it - then why did it happen now? He knew that Charles and Faye had long since given up trying. So why did it happen now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed the thought out of his head, he was just confusing himself. He was about to leave again, when suddenly he felt something in his mind. Something told him not to leave it behind. He didn't think much of it. He just reached over and grabbed the coin and dropped it into his pocket. He left the house and went out to his car. He drove off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does the story go?</span></div></div>",

He was happy for Faye, but frankly their personal lives didn't rank too high on his priorities. But more importantly, he was freaked out because of the coin. What if it had been the cause?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't think about it too much because he soon arrived at work. He finished the last of his biscuit and threw the rapper away. He worked at an electronics store - it was convenient for him, because the store was right next to a comic book store. Today he filled various positions. Occasionally he had to sweep, stock shelves, or manage the cash register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours, he was allowed to go on break. He went next door to pick up a new comic book. He took it back to his store and read it behind the counter. Soon he noticed an old high school friend enter the store; a girl named Jessica. The two used to hang out a lot. Jack always thought she was cute, but he knew asking her out would ruin their friendship. After graduation, he went to one school, she another...and that was it. They saw each other occasionally, but they lost what they once had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Jack,\" she said. \"It's been a long time. How have you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I've been alright,\" he said, with a slight fatigue. \"I'm taking a year off from college in order to make some money. How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on break from college,\" she said. \"So relieved for the break too, I was going crazy. But I'm here because my laptop's hard drive crashed. I need a new one. Think you can help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well - I'm on my break right now,\" he said. \"But, I can help you out.\" Jack stepped out from behind the counter and lead her over to the shelves where they kept electronics matching her laptop type. He handed her a box with a new hard drive in it. \"Tell ya what - I'll even give you my employee discount.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw Jack, that's so nice,\" she said. \"Why are you always so nice to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Jack said sarcastically. \"We're friends - being nice is an accidental byproduct of our relationship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled at that comment. They went back to the counter. Jack paid for it to use the discount, and Jessica paid him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks a lot, Jack,\" she said. \"It was really good to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was good to see you too, Jess,\" he said. \"Break's over - gotta get back to work. I guess I'll see you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe sooner than you think,\" she said. \"I'm in town for the next two weeks...Would you like to hang out, catch a movie, get a drink or...something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was taken aback by this...it sounded like she was asking him out. He didn't know what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure - it'll be just like old times,\" Jack said. \"When?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know - I'm basically free all week,\" she said. \"What day is good for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I can take at least one day off this week,\" he said. He got an idea. He reached into his pocket. \"Tell you what; I'll flip for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm - just like back in high school,\" Jess commented. \"Why did you always let a coin make your decisions for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The flip of a coin is the only real justice in this universe,\" Jack replied. \"50/50 - it's all left up to Chance...Unbiased, unprejudiced...Fair.\" He took out the first coin he found in his pocket. He suddenly heard an alien thought dance across his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me, Jack. Flip me!</span> it said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down and saw that it was the strange coin he'd bought yesterday. He looked back up at Jess and said, \"Heads - we wait till later this week. Tails - I take the day off tomorrow.\" He winked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Don't look away, Jack.</span> the alien thought said again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack flipped the coin off his thumb and caught it in his hand. He looked down at it. He saw the frowning faces on the figures in the coin.<br>\r\n\"Tails,\" he said. \"I guess I'll see you tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" she said. \"You can call me and set up the details. See you then.\" She left the store with a wink. Jack noticed a certain sway in her hips as she left. This was weird. It was like she was asking him out on a date. Did Jess want them to be more than just friends? Jack thought better of it afterward. He was probably reading too much into it. It was just two old friends hanging out for old times sake. He at least had tomorrow to look forward to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Jack finished his shift and left for home. He wondered what he and Jess would do tomorrow. He was certainly looking forward to it. But little did he know, that this day was only the beginning of what would amount to be the strangest and worst nine days of his life.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Getting home, Jack felt more exhausted than usual from work. He parked the car and walked into his house. He could hear his mother vomiting in the bathroom but ignored it for now, sure his father was already helping her. Jack walked up the stairs to his own room, took off his clothes, and collapsed onto the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">Dream</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was lying in a big bed, as Jessica walked toward him on all fours. They smiled at each other erotically and Jack reached out to feel Jessica's swollen pregnant belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our kids such are growing quickly in there,\" she said, placing her hand on top of his. He smiled and kissed her passionately on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not the only one,\" Faye said, rolling over in the bed, taking one of Jack's hands and placing them on her belly. Jack smiled and kissed her as well, holding his pregnant brides close to his body. They cooed and nuzzled against him, their bellies rubbing against his sides. From nowhere, there was the sound of a knock on a door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack? I need you to give me a ride,\" his mother's voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Jack said sleepily. Suddenly his mother appeared in front of him, a gargantuan pregnant belly in front of her, sweat running down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I need you to give me a ride to the hospital! Your brothers and sisters are comiiiiiNNNNNNGGG!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">End of Dream</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack jumped out of bed, panting. Suddenly, there was a knock on his bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, c'mon, I need you to drive me to work. Your father's gone and I still feel a little groggy,\" his mother said from behind the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Weird...</i> Jack thought, getting up. \"Do I have time to shower and stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you do, don't worry,\" his mother said semi-sarcastically. \"Just get a move on.\" Jack slowly got out of bed and grabbed a towel and a fresh pair of clothes and trudged along to the bathroom. As he took off his underwear and stepped into the shower, Jack looked down in shock and saw that in his sleep, he'd come himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dreaming about pregnant women made me do <b>that?</b></i> he thought, confused. <i>What's the matter with me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he got dressed, Jack walked downstairs to see his mother standing in front of the door, looking a little anxious. She had a thick sweater wrapped around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling any better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, a little. Let's go,\" his mother said quickly. Jack shrugged and walked out to the car and pulled out of the driveway with his mother in tow. Out on the lawn, Faye was getting the mail, wearing a pajama top and sweat pants. She waved to them with a big smile, and Jack could swear that she looked...rounded. It was easier to tell that she was pregnant now and her breasts had certainly gotten bigger. An image of Faye heavily pregnant and close to Jack flashed into his mind from last night's dream and he turned away, blushing slightly as he drove his mother to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping her off, Jack headed back home, walking inside to grab some breakfast. His shift was a little bit earlier in the day today, then he had class. Fridays were always a little grueling, but at least tonight he had Jessica's company to look forward to. As he chewed on his cereal, Jack reached into his pocket for his phone when he felt something else in his pocket. Fishing it out, Jack saw that the weird coin from yesterday was still with him. He studied it, especially paying attention to the smiling pregnant woman on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Geez, pregnancy around me everywhere today...</i> Jack thought, shoving the coin back into his pocket, finishing his breakfast and washing out his bowl in the sink. Driving his mom to work messed up his normal work schedule, so it was already time to go to work. Putting on his uniform, which amounted to just a grey collared shirt with the store's logo on it, Jack hopped back in his car and headed for work. As he left, he took one last stare at Faye, who was now sitting on her porch, one hand on her belly while the other was pursing her shirt's collar and checking out her new bosom with a perplexed but impressed look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack yawned as he walked into the back of the store and up to the counter. No one else was there, Friday morning being typically being a pretty slow time for the store. Peeking at the schedule that was taped to the back of the counter, Jack saw that it would just be him and the manager today. Speaking of which-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jack,\" his manager, April said. She was a tall, beautiful girl, in her mid-20s, with bright red lipstick, short red hair, and cute chipmunk cheeks. All in all, April was a pretty cool boss and didn't bark orders at Jack. Her only drawback was that she liked to tease Jack plenty, which got embarrassing sometimes. \"You look a little more tired than usual, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing, I just had to wake up a little earlier today,\" Jack said, resting his face in his hand, leaning against the counter. \"My mom got a little sick so she needed me to drive her to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope she feels better soon,\" April said with an empathetic face. \"Got any plans for later today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" Jack said, seeing a new box under the counter that needed unloading. He leaned down to pick it up when he heard April giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stood up slowly, giving April an accusatory look. \"What...what do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled again. \"Well, I just heard you were a little chummy with a customer that came in yesterday and you talked about spending some time together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"April!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, come on, it's cute. I've never heard of you going on any dates,\" April said with a smile, walking close to Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a date!\" Connor said, his face blushing. \"We're old friends and we're catching up, that's it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay\" she said again, her smile still on her face. \"C'mon, let's start unpacking some of these new shipments and getting them on the shelves.\" As she walked toward the back, Jack felt a tickle in his brain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Take me out of your pocket</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnconsciously, Jack reached into his pocket and pulled out the coin. <i>What?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack cocked his head? <span class=\"clred\">Is the coin-</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nScared, Jack gave the coin a quick flick of the thumb and caught it on the back of his hand and looked up at April as she walked into the back</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Jack, could you give me a hand back here, please?\" April's voice said from the back. Jack shook his head out of his haze and put the coin back in his pocket. As he walked toward the back, he saw April coming out. Well, not April exactly, but part of her. A globe of round, pregnant flesh drifted out of the doorway, the rest of April following. She stroked it gently, her work shirt only covering about half of her new-found maternity. \"It's a little hard with...this in the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're pregnant,\" Jack said with a stunned expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Jack, that is correct, I am pregnant,\" April said with a mockingly staccato voice like Jack's. She laughed and patted her belly and moved to the side. \"Let me get out of your way so you can reach the inventory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDazed, Jack walked past her and gazed at her belly. It looked real, as far as he could tell, but he couldn't figure out what was going on. To keep his mind off things, he went about his work, opening boxes and stacking cables and printers and all kinds of other computer hardware. Every time he saw April and her new round tummy, his face would blush a little bit more and he would work more quickly. In the end, Jack had done about an hour's worth of stacking in half the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicely done,\" April said, putting some of the smaller things - memory cards, iPod cables, etc. - onto the metal hooks that lined the walls close to the register. \"I thought you were tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I dunno,\" Jack muttered, standing behind the counter. April finished and came and stood next to him, still smiling at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't forget to be careful on your not-date tonight. I'd hate for your 'old friend' to end up like me,\" she said with a little laugh, bumping Jack with her belly. He shuffled away from her, his face now totally red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"April, knock it off. You aren't even really pregnant! I saw you when I walked in! You were totally normal!\" Jack said excitedly. April raised one eyebrow and turned to face him, giving him a full-frontal view of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, what are you talking about? I mean, I know you weren't here when I first got pregnant, but I'm almost nine months at this point. Geez, you're acting weird today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's mind was racing, trying to piece together the day. <i>First Faye's pregnant, and now April? This is a weird coincidence.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, April's face turned to a grin. \"Hey...could it be that you have a thing for pregnant women?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You're crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I?\" she said, motioning to Jack's pants. He looked down and saw a clearly visible erection. He tucked it behind his pants in a huff as April walked closer to him. \"Hey, it's okay, I'm not offended. I don't blame you, I don't think I've ever looked better. That's why I didn't bother getting a work shirt that fit all the way over. I like showing off the bump. Wanna feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack didn't know why, but he agreed, and started running his hands over her belly. It felt...much nicer than he expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...tight,\" Jack said, looking down at her belly, his embarrassed, confused expression fading some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it is,\" April said gently.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack heard the door open and looked up, keeping his hand glued to April's round womb. Jessica walked in the door and looked around before turning to Jack and...April. A strong sense of guilt filled him and Jack dropped his hand quickly from April's belly. April just laughed lightly without moving her lips and looked at Jessica, then Jack, then back at Jessica before smiling and walking into the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi,\" Jack said, his face turning red as Jessica walked up to the counter, also looking a little embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" she smiled, looking over at Jack. \"I just came in to pick up an iPhone case as a cheap gift for a cousin, but I didn't know you'd be here.\" She looked down and smiled to herself. \"But I...kind of hoped you would be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Jack said, shaking a little. As she was bent down, Jack had a good view of the shape of her breasts. They were...very full and incredibly sexy. Definitely bigger than he remembered yesterday. He didn't think much of it, just thinking he hadn't had a chance to ogle her from this angle yesterday. While he thought about her chest, Jessica nodded and looked back up at him, biting her lip. \"W-well, let me help you pick one out.\" Jack walked from behind the counter to the rack of cases, some of which April had just stacked. \"Anything in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I just want it to look a little different so he'll think I really tried,\" Jessica said with a guilty smile. \"He's nice and all, but we don't hang out ever. But my parents are pushing me to get him something since we live so close to him and my aunt, sooooo...\" She looked back and Jack and laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about this?\" Jack said, unhooking a case that was sturdy and looked like it had wood paneling. \"It looks kind of vintage and it's unique.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this would actually work perfectly. He's into that kind of retro look,\" Jessica said, taking the case from Jack's hands. \"Thanks,\" she said quietly, with a little smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything I can do to help,\" he said with a small smile back. He walked back to the register and rang the iPhone case up. \"I'll throw in the employee discount again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, this is such a relief to be done already,\" Jessica said with a sigh and a grin, handing her credit card over. \"Ever since last night, I've been feeling a little...I dunno, my stomach's been feeling weird and I felt a little tired. I'm better now, but it was really weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack smiled and handed Jessica her case and card back. \"Well, I hope you get better soon. My mom was feeling a little nauseous too, so there might be a bug going around.\" Then, an upsetting thought crossed his mind. \"So, can you still hang out tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and looked at Jack with a pleased expression. \"Yes, I'll be fine tonight. It might be good to hang out and have some fun tonight, get into a positive mood. That'll make the recovery process faster.\" April walked back into the room and looked over at Jessica again, her bright red lips in a curious smile. Jessica looked over at April, her eyes slowly drifting down to her exposed belly, which April's fingertips were gingerly stroking. \"W-well, see you tonight!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Jessica nervously left the store and Jack turned to face April just in time for her to slink up next to him, her belly pressed against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's cute,\" April said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"April, please, cut it out,\" Jack said, walking away, his body shaking a little, sorting some more inventory. April threw her hands up and smiled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, I'm not trying to make you feel bad. I just want to wish you good luck tonight...but I don't think you need it. She likes you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"April!\" he yelled back. She just laughed softly before gripping her belly. \"Oh, a-are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine,\" she purred, looking down at her roundness. \"Just some excited kicking going on in there. Mind if I sit down in the back to try and calm the little one down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the boss,\" Jack shrugged, gazing at April's hands drifting over her belly maternally as she bounced her belly in her grasp. She disappeared into the back and Jack went back to work, trying to regain his calm and get his mind off of...pregnancy. Maybe he did have a thing for pregnant women...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">You do</span> a familiar voice whispered in his head. Jack shook his head and ignored it, not even bothering to try and figure out where it came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWork was predictably slow, and after a few hours of sitting around and ignoring April's teasing and occasional invitations to belly rubs, which Jack started to vehemently reject, Jack clocked out and headed back home to change before he went to his classes. On the drive over, Jack flipped on the radio and listened to some music to try and get his mind off of things. It worked out well, until the block of songs ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-and that was that new French Montana track we know you all wanted to here. And remember! Later this week is the annual 101.9 Pregnant Bikini Contest down at Dino's Bar and Grill! Make sure you come out and watch these soon-to-be moms strut their stuff. And folks there is a minimum belly size requirement, so all these ladies are going to be big, big, big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack punched a random button on the dashboard and changed to a random station that was playing classical music. It wasn't Jack thing, but at least it helped turn off...whatever that was. <i>What is going on?</i> Jack thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he got home, Jack piled out of the car and walked back inside, marching up the stairs to his room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack? That you?\" he heard his mother's voice and walked back downstairs to see her come up to the foot of the staircase. \"I'm sorry, I had your father drive me back home. I was just feeling too unwell. But...I also forgot some of my things at the office. Would you mind taking me back?\" she smiled weakly, really trying to get Jack to agree to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...yeah, alright,\" he whined. \"Let me just get changed first.\" In a few quick moments, Jack had his work shirt off and was in jeans and a t-shirt. \"Okay, let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked to the car, Jack realized that if he drove his mom to work and back, he'd probably miss the first ten minutes of his Friday class at least. Thinking about it, Jack was getting increasingly uninterested in going to class. He was already plenty close to getting his master's and this was just a filler class to get enough credits to push him over the line. He was doing fine in it and it didn't matter if he went or not. Hell, he could just flip a coin to see if he should even bother going or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me</span> the voice from before came back into his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good idea</i> Jack thought robotically, getting into the car and reaching his hand into his pocket to fish out the coin that seemed to find its way into his casual pants. <i>Heads I go, Tails I don't</i>. As he flipped it, his mother got into the seat next to him in the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's that weird coin from the flea market, isn't it? I actually saw it while I was looking around. I even gave it a flip while I was checking out this antique mirror that pierced man had for sale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-\" Jack said, looking over as he caught the coin on the back of his hand. As he looked over, his neighbor Faye also came up to the window of the car, waving at both of them. As Jack looked at both of them, he looked and saw what the coin had landed on</span></div></div>",

The coin landed on tails as Jack continued to stare at Faye and his 50 something mother. <br>\r\n<i>We'll on the bright side, no school today. </i> Jack thought to himself. He could spend more time focusing on his date with Jessica. <br>\r\n<i>It's not a date. It's just two old friends getting back together </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a massive shiver went through both Faye and his mother, their bodies shaking as the chill went down their spin. <br>\r\n\"Brr, did it just get cold in here all of sudden?\" His mother asked, rolling down the window to speak to Faye, unaware of the gravid consequences of her son's actions. <br>\r\n\"Good evening Amanda, Jack.\" Faye said with a smile on her face a mile wide. She was taking to her newly pregnant state quite well. <br>\r\n\"Good evening Faye. Wow, your positively glowing. Pregnancy agreeing with you I take it?\" Jack's mom Amanda said with a smile on her face. <br>\r\n\"Very much so. Although....\" Faye said her face slowly changing to a worried look on her face.<br>\r\n\"Although what Faye? You can tell me anything.\" Amanda said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack banged his head against the back of the headrest of his seat. While the coin decided that he wasn't going to class tonight, (even if he didn't really need to. He was only taking the classes to get the extra credits he needed while he was visiting his parents for this year he was taking off), he still wanted to see Jessica. Jessica was everything to him. A good friend, someone he could tell anything to. She was the one who got away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Stop thinking like that </i> Jack thought to himself. Jessica wasn't his girlfriend or anything. Not some childhood crush that he secretly yearned for, she was just Jessica. That was it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Amanda, when you were pregnant with Jack. Did anything... strange happen?\" Faye asked. <br>\r\n\"Strange? What do you mean?\" Amanda asked. <br>\r\n\"Well, my morning sickness cleared up almost instantly. I mean I've only had it for two days of the three months I've been pregnant\" Faye said. <br>\r\nThis particular piece of information snapped Jack back to the current course of conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been pregnant for three months?\" Jack asked, staring straight ahead, fighting back images of Faye from his dream. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think.\" Faye said. <br>\r\n\"You think?\" Jack asked, thinking back to only a day or two ago when she first told their family the news. I mean, she was pushing 40 and had PCOS, and now she couldn't even remember how long she had been pregnant.<br>\r\n\"Jack, don't be rude!\" His mother snapped him. There was still times that despite being in his 20's, Jack's mom still had to treat him like a child sometimes. <br>\r\n\"Sorry Mrs. Jones\" Jack said. <br>\r\n\"Please call me Faye\" Faye said with a smile.<br>\r\n\"Uh-okay. Faye\" Jack said, his eyes going back to road as images from his dream came rushing back to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've been puking for two days which is when we found out we were pregnant, and now my morning sickness is gone. Not only that, I think - - - I think I'm getting bigger\" Faye said, stepping back revealing a small sizable bulge visible between where her sweatpants and her pajama top met. She put her hands on it, rubbing it slowly. <br>\r\n\"Oh Faye. Your just worried, pregnancy is different for every woman. Everything is going to be fine.\" Jack's mom said with a smile. <br>\r\n\"You're right. I guess. It's weird. I feel like I'm getting bigger every second\" Faye said. <br>\r\n\"It'll pass.\" Jack's mom said.<br>\r\n\"Well, thanks for putting my mind at ease. I guess I've just wanted this for so long\" Faye says, wrapping her hands around her pregnant belly \"That I'm just worried. Well take care guys, I think it's going to be chilly tonight, I had a shiver go down my spine a few moments ago\" Faye finished.<br>\r\n\"You felt cold as well?\" Amanda said. \"Must be something in the air\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Mom, can we go? I've got plans later.\" Jack said, trying to get out of this awkward situation. <br>\r\n\"Oh like what?\" Jack's mom asked, raising an eyebrow. <br>\r\n\"I'm going to hang out with Jessica later\" Jack said timidly. <br>\r\nA smile slowly came across his mom's face, while Faye made a noise that sounded very close to \"Awww\"<br>\r\n\"Look at little Jack going on a date\" Faye said with a smile.<br>\r\n\"IT'S NOT A DATE! WE'RE JUST HANGING OUT! SHE'S MY FRIEND!\" Jack said defensively. <br>\r\n\"Faye, enjoy your children. They grow up so fast\"  Jack's Mom said, messing with her son's hair.<br>\r\n\"Come on Mom, stop!\" Jack said getting embarrassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shame you never had anymore huh Amanda?\" Faye said.<br>\r\n\"Maybe back then, but if I was pregnant today, I would probably lose my mind\" Jack's mom said with a laugh.<br>\r\n\"Good thing you're not\" Faye said with a smile, unaware of Amanda's current condition. <br>\r\n\"Come on!\" Jack said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, Sorry Faye, we don't want this little Lothario to be late for his date\" Jack's mom said with a smile. <br>\r\n\"See you later\" Faye said, leaving. \"Sweep her off her feet kid\". <br>\r\nJack turned over the engine, and drove off taking his mom to her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip was uneventful and short, since his mom's work wasn't far from the house. Pulling into the parking spot, he parked in the spot. <br>\r\n\"Alright we're here\" Jack said. <br>\r\n\"Okay sweetie, give me a few moments\" His mom said, unbuckling her seatbelt. Jack noticed that his mom seemed.. different. He couldn't quite place it, but his mom looked different somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got out of the car and walked into her office. <br>\r\n<i>Does she have a bulge in her stomach?</i> Jack thought to himself watching his mom leave. HIs mind flashed back to the image of his mom massively pregnant in his dream. He shrugged the image off , and stared out the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemed to pass slowly, and Jack grew tired of waiting. He decided to... </span></div></div>",

The music was pleasant enough and Jack leaned back in his seat to relax when his cellphone started buzzing. Turning down the radio, he brought his phone to his ear. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Jack, great! I was worried I'd miss you going into class,\" Jessica's voice said. Jack nervously adjusted the phone in his hands and switched to his other ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, hey! What's up,\" he said, trying and failing to sound casual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing. I just wanted to know when you get out of class so we can get a jump on catching up,\" she said. Jack could tell that she was laughing slightly at his unnatural voice fluctuation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, actually, I'm helping my mom out right now so I just decided not to go to class today,\" he said, starting to shift in his seat. <i>I'll get to see Jessica even sooner than I thought!</i> he thought excitedly to himself. <i>Maybe she'll be able to get all this pregnancy weirdness out of my head...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! Call me when you're ready?\" Jessica said. Jack couldn't help but feel elated hearing the clear happiness in her voice and nodded. \"Jack?\" he nodded again. \"Jack?!\" he snapped out of his daze and realized she couldn't see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, definitely!\" he said, a little too excitedly. Jessica giggled and thanked him, hanging up. Jack laid his head back against the seat and took a long sigh. <i>It's not a date, it's not a date, it's not a date</i> he repeated in his head. <i>But...I wish it was.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrritated by his thoughts, which had been giving him grief all day anyway, Jack hoped out of the car and walked into his mom's office. It was a small set-up: just one big room with a conference room, a manager's office, and obviously some bathrooms. As he walked in, Jack looked around and didn't see any sign of his mother. There weren't actually very many employees there today, just a few women at their desks, typing away or looking over forms, and a pretty woman sitting at a bigger desk near the door. She looked like she was almost Jack's age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, did Amanda Dale come in? I'm her son, Jack.\" Jack reached out to shake her hand, which she obliged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Jack, I'm Tara,\" she responded, smiling. Jack noticed that the nameplate on the desk said \"Greg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you replacing the other receptionist?\" he asked, pointing at the name tag. Tara leaned back and smiled slightly, showing a slight irritation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Greg is <u>the</u> receptionist. I'm a senior partner who's just helping out on my day off because Greg broke his ankle,\" Tara said, raising her eyebrows up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn, she's cool and kind of feisty</i> Jack thought to himself. \"Oh, sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned. \"It's no problem, I'm just picking on you a little bit. Anyway, your mom came in but she's just in the bathroom now. Seems like she might have some kind of stomach bug.\" Tara leaned closer to Jack. \"It's part of the reason why she left the office today, I think. She doesn't want it to spread to any of us. Your mom's a really nice lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack laughed. \"Yeah? I wish she would be that way at home.\" Tara laughed softly, showing a little bit of pearly teeth. She had long, straight, jet black hair and dark brown eyes that she hid behind small, frameless glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked out behind the desk to the vending machine next to Jack. \"Hmm...I really feel like a Vanilla Coke,\" Tara said absently to herself, before turning to Jack. \"Can you believe that they still stock Vanilla Coke to this machine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack noticed it in there and raised one eyebrow. \"Yeah, that is surprising...I haven't had one of those in a long time and I'm pretty thirsty too.\" He fished a dollar out of his pocket, punching the right numbers into the machine. \"Oh, but look, there's only one left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">j\u0335\u0334\u0337\u0329\u031c\u031d\u0330\u0369\u0312\u0346\u033f&amp; #785;\u0367</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked around, confused. The familiar voice in his head was calling out, but there wasn't anything specific it was saying. He just felt like something was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One left, huh?\" Tara said, turning to Jack with a grin across her face. \"Flip you for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypnotically, Jack reached into his pocket and fished out the coin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heads you get it, tails I get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Jack muttered, flipping the coin, the happy, smiling side up. \"Heads,\" he managed to squeak out before Tara's midriff began inflating like a party balloon. Her belly pushed her polo to the limits, a popped out belly button clearly visible underneath the fabric. As Jack's eyes traced up her growing body, he couldn't help but notice her breasts also nearly double in size, snapping off one of her collar's buttons. As the swelling came to a stop, she had about a foot and a half of new, round belly growing out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara just grinned and started rubbing her new-found womb. \"Damn, I've got really bad cravings now. Best two out of three?\"</span></div></div>",

Was Faye's newfound pregnancy having some kind of abnormal psychological affect on him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe I really do find pregnant women attractive and this is my mind's way of opening me up to it</i> Jack thought, eyeing Tara's new, maternal body.

I know I bought it in a creepy kind of place, but that doesn't mean it's magical or cursed or something, does it?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you, chicken?\" Tara said with a sweet laugh, smacking Jack on the arm playfully. \"It's just for fun, Jack. Fli<span class=\"clred\">p it!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack did as he was told, only realizing at the last second that her voice had changed to that of the voice in his head. <i>Did the voice just make her say that?</i> Jack was now getting a little scared. Catching the coin on the back of his hand, they both saw the verdict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-heads,\" Jack said, looking back at Tara, who smiled with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, just one mo-oof,\" she said, suddenly bending down and gripping her belly, which started expanding. Her shirt was no longer able to contain her new size and slid up her skin, revealing her bare skin and popped out belly button, which even Jack, in his transitory state of denial, immediately admitted was cute. \"Huh, my sister was right. The growth spurts really pop whenever they feel like it,\" she said, patting her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need some help?\" Jack said, nervously eyeing her swollen belly, trying to keep his mind of the erection he could feel brewing in his pants. <i>It just happened again...but this time she seems concerned about it.</i> Jack's eyes turned back to the coin in his hand. <i>And it happened right after I flipped the coin, just like before.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Jack's mind was really starting to buzz. He remembered flipping the coin at the store before April was suddenly pregnant. <i>That's it, the coin is somehow doing this. It's crazy but it's the only explanation right now. I need to get home and really think about this.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Tara said, a weak smile on her face as she gripped her belly. \"One heads, one tails. This last one decides who gets the soda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip it!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's hand tossed the coin like it was going to burn a hole through his flesh. It was like he wasn't even in control of his own body. Now, fearing the power he hypothesized the coin carried, Jack watched the coin tumble to the ground in horror, his eyes meeting Tara's as it felt to the ground as a possibility struck him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If someone gets pregnant whenever I flip the coin, then...Jessica!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Tara said excitedly, having to bend over with her massive belly to see the where the coin landed. \"It's-</span></div></div>",

She now looked like she could pop any moment, and with her ripped shirt Jack had to admit that she was the sexiest girl he had ever seen. <i>Too bad she's not my girlfriend, so I could have some \"fun\" with her</i>, he thought and felt his erection growing to a point of nearly popping his jeans-button. <i>Oh man, I can't hide this. She just got to have noticed it by now</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, it looks like I'm not the only one who's excited about being this big and round\", Tara said gleefully. \"You know, I have never before felt so womanly, so...full-filled, so sexy. Obviously  you think I am too, which makes me very happy. Beacose, you know, I don't even care about wining the soda anymore. I'm not craving it anymore\" she, continued, biting her lip playfully. <i>W-what's going on? Is she coming on to me?</i> Jack thought, not quite being able to wrap his head around all of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm craving something else now. You know they say that pregnant woman get hornier then usual? Well, it's certainly true. I'm very horny now, and I'm craving that wonderful, handsome, stallion-in-bed-like hunk that made me this way\" Tara said, while moving as seductively as her big bump allowed around Jack before suddenly grasping his crotch.<br>\r\n\"And I can see, and certainly feel\" She said, winking to him \"That he is more than ready to take me to the backroom and ravish me like he did when he knocked me up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>WOW, does she thinks I'M her boyfriend - and the father of her baby, or - judging by the size, maybe even babies?</i> Jack thought stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what are you waiting for? Don't act like you don't want me, your \"little friend\" down here tells me otherwise - and he's not that small, by the way. No wonder you got me pregnant, with the size of that thing your swimmers barely needed to swim at all to reach my poor, little defenseless egg. Ahh, you're really going to make me say it, aren't you? I don't understand why you like that old movie so much anyway. But I must admit, the line is pretty seductive. Alright, here it goes:<br>\r\n<b>Hey Goose, you big stud! Take me to bed or lose me forever!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack had no idea what was going on, all he knew was that his \"other head\" was about to take over the control over his actions. Here, almost wrapped around him, stood a girl he had always felt an attraction towards giving him the go-ahead-signal, and that big bump of hers made her even attractive. And since she already thought he was her boyfriend and baby daddy, she wouldn't hold it against him afterward. <br>\r\nStill, this was wrong, wasn't it. It wasn't her taking and acting .- it was the mind tricks the coin somehow had placed on her making her acting this way. This wasn't what the <i>real</i> Tara would've wanted, and therefore he would, if he went on with it, in a way still take advantage of her against her will. His conscience really wouldn't feel good about that. Jack needed to think about this for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I might willing and ready right now, but I could just take matters into my own hands, you know!\" Tara said lightly annoyed. \"So, what's is going to be? Take me to bed or lose me forever?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Tails!\" Tara said with glee. \"I win?\" The trail end of her voice turned into a question as Tara bent down to grasp her belly again, which had begun to swell again. It was already massive after Jack had flipped the coin the second time, so now it was approaching an almost unbelievable size. \"Wh-what's-\" Tara panted nervously, holding her ballooning womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,\" Jack said, bending down to try and help her. Jack didn't have any medical expertise, real or imagined, but a pregnant woman's belly spontaneously growing twice in the course of a few minutes was outside the realm of conventional biology, so his help was just as good as anyone else's. Jack put one hand on her wrist and one on her shoulder, holding her in a semi-close fashion, and locked eyes with her as she gazed at her own swelling stomach. \"We should get you to a hospital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight on time, Jack's mother walked out of the bathroom and, seeing Jack and Tara, ran through the office to get to both of them. \"Jack, Tara, oh...oh! What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, we need to get her to the hospital,\" Jack said, throwing one arm over Tara's shoulder and walking her to the elevator on the building. For someone as big as Tara, they made good time thanks to Jack's speed. Jack's mom followed them closely, looking extremely concerned. Understandable, since Tara's belly had grown three times since she'd been in the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the elevator, Tara was still breathing a bit nervously, but she was standing on her own and didn't seem to be in any physical distress. \"It's okay,\" she said, patting Jack on the arm, \"I'm not in any pain and the swelling's stopped. Other than a bigger belly, I feel fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we should still get you to a hospital and make sure everything's okay,\" Jack said. Seeing how Tara was doing better, he started to move his arm off of her shoulders, but Tara's friendly pat on the arm now turned into a gentle grasp that kept it on her. She turned to Jack and smiled sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's a good idea,\" she breathed, giving him another gaze before turning back to her incredible bump. As she rubbed it slowly, Jack's mom spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does everything still feel alright? Can you feel the baby move?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara nodded. \"I don't feel kicks or anything, but there is still movement. Actually, there's almost more movement than before but that might just be because there's-\" Tara paused and sighed, looking at her new, massive size, \"More room to move in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked at his mother confused. <i>She's just accepting that she's pregnant? The fact that you walked out and she was suddenly pregnant doesn't surprise you at all?</i> As the elevator door opened and the three of them walked to the car, Jack started to think about the situation again. <i>Wait, she seemed to think she had already been pregnant too...same with April.</i> Jack could only come to one conclusion: the coin. <i>So, the coin makes some people think they're pregnant, but maybe it wares off after the first use. I did flip it three times for this poor girl, after all.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them loaded up into the car, Jack in the driver's seat, his mom and Tara in back seat. Jack drove quickly, peeking up in the rear view mirror to see if Tara was doing alright every minute or so. And, in fact, she seemed to be doing just fine. No more heavy breathing, no sign of pain at all, just a look of light concern. She was running her hands over her belly very gingerly, obviously worried about her baby growing inside her. It may not have been there an hour ago, but Jack could tell that there was a look of genuine love in her eyes. What Jack didn't notice was his own mother gazing at her belly, a mixture between nostalgia and concern in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the hospital, Tara insisted that they not go to the emergency room, telling Jack and his mother that she wasn't feeling that much distress and was sure that she was alright. \"I just want a little check-up to find out what's going on,\" she said calmly. Acquiescing, they took her to special pre-natal part of the hospital, one that had been added a few years back to try and give pregnant women more targeted and personal care. Tara seemed to have been here before, as the doctor who took care of her was familiar with her and was shocked when she saw Tara's new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and his mom followed Tara into the doctor's room, where she was already sitting back on a soft plastic cot, her doctor rubbing ultrasound gel on a wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's have a look,\" the doctor, who's name tag said that she was Dr. Kristen Harper, M.D., said. She rubbed the small ultrasound wand around a contained area on Tara's belly, who looked at the blurry screen with a nervous gaze. Her hands were on the base of her shirt, holding it up, even though the size of her huge belly more than assured that the non-maternity polo wouldn't get in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Tara finally said, anxiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...I'm surprised we didn't find this on any of your past ultrasounds, but you're carrying triplets!\" Dr. Harper said. Tara and Connor's mom's jaws dropped. For Jack, this was all so new that it almost didn't surprise him anymore. Almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Triplets?\" Tara said, a small smile starting to spread across her lips. \"But they're all healthy, aren't they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Actually, they're doing surprisingly well, considering how far into your pregnancy you're carrying them.\" Dr. Harper said, smiling at Tara before turning back to the screen. \"It's really strange that we hadn't found these extra fetuses before. This would make for an amazing journal article...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her voice trailed off, Tara turned back to Jack and his mom. \"Triplets! Can you believe it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's incredible,\" Jack said quietly, now calmed down enough to admire Tara's enormous, round belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack? If you'd like, I can stay with Tara while she finishes up her tests and paperwork. I'll call you or your father when we're ready to leave,\" his mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Jack asked, looking between Tara and his mom. They both nodded, Tara adding a little smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine,\" Tara said. \"You've already taken good care of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well...congratulations,\" Jack said, waving to them as he headed out of the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tara sat on the doctor's table, wiping the gel off of her enormous belly with paper towels, Amanda Dale took Dr. Harper quietly aside to talk to her. With the surface area that Tara had to deal with, she would be occupied for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-would you mind giving me a quick pregnancy test?\" Amanda, Jack's mother, asked. Dr. Harper moved Amanda to her personal office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? I'm sure you know that at your age, pregnancy is unlikely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I know, but I've felt some odd symptoms lately, and seeing Tara made me think about when I was pregnant with my son and it feels...the same,\" Amanda said, looking at Dr. Harper with intent. Then, she opened up her thick sweater and revealed her newly-perky breasts and her slightly rounded tummy. \"I know my body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Harper looked at her silently for a moment before nodding. \"Alright. Sit down and I'll give you a quick ultrasound. It's a lot faster than any pregnancy pee test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda leaned back and rolled up her shirt, allowing Dr. Harper to repeat the process she had just performed with Tara. Exhaling a deep breath, Dr. Harper looked and the screen and turned back to Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're pregnant, Mrs. Dale...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and?\" Amanda asked, sensing Dr. Harper had something to add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and there are four heartbeats. You're carrying quadruplets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack driving quickly back to his house, blasting the radio to an almost painfully high volume. After the experiences with April and especially with Tara, he needed to get his mind off of pregnancy and pregnant women. After meeting with April, his shortly approaching hangout with Jessica would be able to put him in a good mood, but if his suspicions about the coin were right, then Jessica was pregnant as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Calm down, Jack. You don't know anything for sure. Remember, there's no way a coin could get someone pregnant.</i> he thought, parking at home and walking out of the car. <i>But at least I left the coin at Mom's office so it can't bother me anymore.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stuffed the car keys in his pocket, he felt metal clink with metal. Curious, he reached back into his pocket and pulled out...the coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?...\"</span></div></div>",

It's Jessica\". Her voice sounded sultry on the other end of the phone. It was so alarming that it caused him to bobble his keys, dropping to the ground with a clink. <br>\r\n\"Hey Jessica. You-uh, sure sound different.\" Jack thought trying to get his head out of the gutter and back into reality. <br>\r\n<i>She's just a friend.

It uh, it should be fun to catch up\" Jack said to himself, putting his key back in the door, opening it, and letting himself in. <br>\r\n\"So where were you going to take me?\" Jessica asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well - uh. I thought the usual, just dinner out someplace nice. You know, typical\" Jack said, quickly becoming alarmed at the course this conversation seemed to be taking. She seemed so different from when he saw her earlier today. <br>\r\n\"You sure know how to make a girl feel real special Jack\" Jessica said with a come-hither giggle. <br>\r\n<i>Oh my glob, this not date is going to turn into a date</i> Jack thought to himself in a panic. He wasn't ready for this kind of commitment! I mean, yes he wanted Jessica, he wanted her ever since High School, but that was just a fantasy, this was turning into reality. <br>\r\n\"Uh----\" was all Jack could sputter out as his brain went dead.<br>\r\nJessica giggled. \"Oh relax you big dork. I'm just screwing with you\" Jessica said, her voice turning back to it's normal non-sultry self. <br>\r\nAll feeling slowly returned to Jack as his brain processed the information that just came to him. <br>\r\n\"Oh\" Jack said both relieved and disappointed. <br>\r\n\"I take it your parents are taking our little \"get together\" as a date?\" Jessica asked. <br>\r\n\"Yeah something like that\" Jack said, going back to his task of putting things away, straightening up around the house, and other such things. <br>\r\n\"I swear, it's the 21st Century. 2013! People can't seem to handle that a guy and a girl can hang out as friends and not have it be a thing\" Jessica said, strain in her voice \"Unnngh\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know right. All I heard from my parents and neighbors were \"Wak Wak Wak, Jack's got a date!\" Jack said sounding more like a bird than an imitation. <br>\r\n\"Seriously.. UNG\" Jessica said, straining again. <br>\r\n\"Something wrong Jess?\" Jack asked. <br>\r\n\"I'm just trying to get into my favorite pair of ultra-small skinny jeans, but THEY JUST DON'T WANT TO FIT FOR SOME REASON!\" She said, straining to close her jeans. <br>\r\nFor a few moments, Jack listened as Jessica struggled to close the pants but with no success. <br>\r\n\"Listen here jeans, I wore you last week and the week before that and that week before that. Nothing's changed. Now I command you to fit OR I WILL DESTROY YOU!\" Jessica commanded her pants, the sounds of strain being heard once again. <br>\r\n\"Let 'em Jess. Better to have worn those pants and loss then to have never worn them at all\" Jack said. <br>\r\n\"I don't get it. They fit last week. They didn't shrink in the dryer. I mean, I feel a little bloated today, but even then they usually fit\" Jessica said, disappointment in her voice. <br>\r\n\"Just wear something else\" Jack said. <br>\r\n\"Fine. Anyways, I'm just wondering what were going to do?\" Jessica asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking maybe a nice bite to eat and a movie or something? I don't know\" Jack said. He really didn't know WHAT he was going to do during this \"not date\" date. <br>\r\n\"Dude, you know what's cool? Laser tag. We should have a grown-up dinner and then play laser tag.\" Jessica said. <br>\r\n\"I don't know Jessica. Laser Tag? Are we a little old?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n\"Your never too old for Laser Tag\" Jessica said, smirking at the other end. <br>\r\n\"Okay, maybe if there's time. I'm really tired today. I have had the weirdest day in history\" Jack said. <br>\r\n\"Are you sure about that?\" Jessica asked.<br>\r\n\"If it wasn't, it had to be in the top 5 of all time\" Jack replied. <br>\r\n\"Well you can tell me all about it when you pick me up. Since you blew off class, I thought we could get this whole \"date\" thing done with\" Jessica said,<br>\r\n\"Hey it's not a date\" Jack replied.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's just Dinner and Laser Tag\" Jessica said. <br>\r\n\"MAYBE Laser Tag\" Jack corrected. <br>\r\n\"Okay Romeo. Just pick me up in twenty minutes. I'm starving. I feel like I could eat a whole buffet\" Jessica said. <br>\r\n\"See you in twenty\" Jack said, hanging up his phone, grabbing his keys and heading back out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n= = = = = = = = == = <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the hospital, Amanda slowly picked up the phone in Dr. Harper's office, who was going over the test results and the sonogram. <br>\r\n\"Wow, at your age. 1, 2, 3, 4 - Four healthy fetuses. I tell you Mrs. Dale, between Tara hidden two babies, and your middle-aged quadruplet pregnancy, I may just have enough to write a whole new paper!\" Dr Harper said, her eyes darting between the test results and the sonograms. <br>\r\nAmanda wasn't looking, she just held the phone up to her ear, staring down at her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Honey. How's work going?\" Amanda asked her husband.<br>\r\n\"Oh that's good. That's good. I'm glad to hear that\" Amanda responded. <br>\r\nShe had no idea how to tell her early 50's husband that his early 50's wife was pregnant - -- with quadruplets! <br>\r\n\"Um, I'm here at the hospital\" Amanda started to say before being cut off. <br>\r\n\"No, no, no. Everything's fine. We'll kind of. \" Amanda informed. <br>\r\n\"Jack's fine, I'm - - - \" Amanda ran her hand over her small bulge in her midsection. <br>\r\n\"It was Tera. Yes, that new pregnant girl from work. Seems something happened so Jack and I rushed her here. No, no, she's fine. Yeah, turns out she's having triplets! I know. She just really kind of popped out all of a sudden.\" Amanda continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr, Harper slowly lifted her head up from her stack of papers to Amanda, she knew what was coming next. She had a grin on her fact about it. <br>\r\nDr. Harper always loved this part of the job. No, not the everyday 20 and 30 something that were starting families or expanding them, she loved the rare occurrences like these were older couples were blessed with an unexpected visit from the stork. In Mrs. Dale's case, he had been working over time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack went home. Nah, I sent him home. I wanted to stay behind for Tera, and - - - \" Amanda paused. <br>\r\n\"Well, I think it's better if you could come down here.... Kind of immediately.  It's important\" Amanda continued. <br>\r\n\"It's pretty big. And I think you'll want to see for yourself. Is it good or bad?\" Amanda paused. <br>\r\n\"Depends on your point of view. Let's just say a Doctor here found something.\" Amanda said. <br>\r\n\"Look, I really need to show you because otherwise... Just get down here\" Amanda said. <br>\r\n\"Just ask for Doctor Harper's office. Floor 3. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hung up the phone and looked down at her midsection then sighed. <br>\r\n\"Couldn't tell him could you?\" Dr Harper asked with a grin on her face.<br>\r\n\"I don't think he would believe it over the phone. I still don't believe it myself\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n= = = = = =  =<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty mintues passed and Jack pulled up to Jessica's doorstep right on time. She was wearing a pair of black jeans and a red shirt. Oddly, she seemed slightly.. rounder than Jack remember her to be. Her breasts (something Jack noticed on her often) were differently much bigger and fuller looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jessica trotted up to the car, Jack took his eyes off her chest and onto the road, hoping that Jessica didn't see him looking. <br>\r\n\"Hey-a Jack. So ready for this Not-Date Date?\" Jessica asked, getting into the car and putting on her seatbelt. <br>\r\n\"I'm at your service M'Lady\" Jack said nobly. <br>\r\n\"Very well then. Driver, I hunger. Take me some place so I may dine.\" Jessica said, putting a hand to her head in a comical swoon.<br>\r\n\"As you wish M'Lady\" Jack said with a smile, driving off to their destination. </span></div></div>",

Chuck was a nice guy and he and Jack talked a lot, but he was a little nosy and eager. \"Whoever it is, I'd rather just ignore them and get going.\" Then, Jack's eyes bugged a little and he pulled the car back into Jessica's driveway and powered down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone important?\" Jessica asked as Jack quickly scooped up the phone and brought it to his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's my mom. Sorry-\" Jack said, his voice switching from its nervous, faux-cool tone with Jessica to his more natural cadence. \"Hi Mom, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Jack,\" Tara's voice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tara?\" Jack croaked, his nervous tone back, \"Wh-how are you feeling?\" Jessica looked over at Jack curiously, only hearing his side of the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, everything feels fine. I'm just a little bigger is all,\" Tara said matter-of-factly. \"Your mom left her cell phone in her purse after she left the doctor's room. I think she may be going over paperwork with Dr. Harper and it's taking a really long time. I've got everything squared away, so would you mind driving me to my home?\" Her voice sounded tiny and sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,\" Jack said, looking over at Jessica before turning back away from her. This only made Jessica only more puzzled. \"My mom just left you there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara laughed. \"Well, I don't mean it to sound that harsh, but I think she just got preoccupied and I'm all set to go. It's fine if you can't; I don't want to trouble you.\" Jack knew she didn't mean to, but he felt incredibly guilty hearing that. Here was a heavily pregnant woman whose condition, if Jack's hypothesis about the coin was right, was his fault, and he was preventing her from getting home because he was going to play laser tag with a girl he liked. He couldn't say no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's fine,\" he said haggardly. \"I'll be right there.\" His thumb switched the phone off and he cranked the car key to power the car back up. \"Um, we need to make a bit of a detour,\" Jack said to Jessica, his face apologetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of detour?\" Jessica asked, crossing her arms as unthreateningly as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A co-worker of my mom is stranded at the hospital and needs someone to get her home. My mom can't do it, it seems, and she's...not really in a good position to ask anyone else other than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Jessica asked, any hint of frustration now turned to curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack sighed. \"Well, she's pregnant. <b>Really</b> pregnant. But the thing is...she wasn't pregnant when the day started. She just sort of, boom, became that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's face turned to a confused smile. \"Well, how do you know she wasn't pregnant? What, she took a pregnancy test at the hospital and that's some huge surprise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-not exactly. See, when I walked into my mom's work, she was there and she was just like you or me,\" Jack said, pausing slightly. <i>Although, if I'm right about this coin, she's might not be so different from you,</i> Jack worried in his head. \"B-but anyway, suddenly, her belly just became all big and pregnant-y and everyone acted like it had always been that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...a little hard to believe,\" Jessica said slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then it happened again: her belly got bigger. And bigger. But this time, people noticed and my mom and I took her to the hospital,\" Jack said, taking the exit to the hospital. \"But even at the hospital, the doctor had records of her being pregnant, just not as pregnant as she ended up being after the weird swellings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swellings,\" Jessica said with a giggle. \"What a nice way to talk about the nurturing of human life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack felt himself blush slightly as he pulled up to the hospital. \"Anyway, that's part of why my day has been so weird. But after we drop her off, I promise you a fun, normal night. No giant pregnant bellies or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica rolled her eyes and chuckled. \"Jack, c'mon, don't be a jerk. I'm sure she's not GIGANT-\" As Jessica rolled her eyes, she spotted Tara standing outside the doors of the hospital, waving over to Jack's familiar car. \"Okay, maybe you have a point.\" They both got out of the car and walked over to Tara, whose original, fun personality had come back since her sudden growth spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much, Jack,\" Tara said happily, rubbing one hand on her belly as she turned to Jessica. \"And hello to you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Jessica,\" she said, reaching a hand out to shake Tara's as Jack felt himself sweating nervously under his shirt. \"You must be Tara.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I'm sure it wasn't hard to point me out,\" Tara laughed, smacking both hands to her belly. It made a loud, almost drum-like sound as she rubbed in small circles. Jessica laughed too and Jack joined in, but his laugh was far more phony. The three of them walked back to the car, Tara insisting to both Jack and Jessica that she didn't need any help walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and plug your directions into the GPS,\" Jack said, handing his phone to Tara in the backseat. With her belly as big as it was, she wouldn't have fit into the front too easily. A course now programmed for them, Jack rolled back out onto the streets as Tara adjusted herself in her seat so she could lean forward and talk to himself and Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're a friend of Jack's?\" she asked innocently. Jessica smiled and nodded, turning around in her seat to talk with Tara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we were going to hang out and play a little laser tag,\" Jessica said with a grin, knowing how much it annoyed Jack when she insisted on the laser tag that she KNEW she was going to get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm so sorry,\" Tara said, realization dawning on her. \"I had no idea I would be interrupting your date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a date!\" Jack and Jessica said, although Jack a little more eagerly. He turned back toward his side as his face turned red. Jessica looked back at Tara and smiled softly, biting her bottom lip and raising her eyebrows. Tara smiled back and nodded knowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, did everything turn out okay at the hospital?\" Jessica asked Tara, getting the topic changed for Jack's sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Tara said with a smile. \"Turned out there were two more babies hiding inside here, although the doctor didn't know why it would cause such a sudden growth spurt,\" she said curiously, rubbing her belly. Jessica leaned out of her seat a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-would it be okay if I felt?\" Jessica asked nervously. Tara smiled and stuck out her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, go ahead!\" she said. Jessica reached her hand out and ran her hands across Tara's taunt belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...there's so much movement, too. So you're carrying triplets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can hardly believe it. Not many women get to go through this,\" Tara said with pride, before turning back to her belly lovingly. \"Although, today was a total surprise, so who knows? There might be more hiding in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Jack had just pulled up in front of Tara's apartment complex. With Jack's help, she got out of the car and waddled over to her unit, smiling and waving at both of them. Back in the car, Jessica was still a little in awe of her first rub of a pregnant belly (to her knowledge).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she was totally flat-stomached when you met her today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. And that's not even the first time that's happened to me today,\" Jack added, pulling back out. \"But we can talk about that any 'ol time. Let's eat!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At the mention of food, Jessica's eyes lit up. \"I'm starving,\" she whined playfully, grinning as Jack pulled out of Tara's driveway and headed for the restaurant he'd planned out earlier in the day. It was an Italian place, family-owned, but also busy enough that they could hide out in the back somewhere without people noticing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were seated quickly, just as Jack had planned, in a booth in a back corner. The light was low and Jessica smiled flirtatiously across the table at him, the soft light given off by the lamp above them accentuating her quiet beauty. Jack grinned back weakly, glad to finally be on the not-date that was waiting for him at the end of the day, like a carrot on the end of a long, bizarre stick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the waiter came, they both put in their orders, but Jessica caught the waitress just before she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, actually, could we get an appetizer too, please? The bruschetta?\" The waitress smiled and nodded, writing down the order before leaving. Jessica smiled at Jack, hiding her lips inside her mouth. \"Sorry, I'm just soooo hungry. You probably think I'm a pig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No,\" Jack said with a reassuring smile. \"It's fine, eat whatever you want. You're great the way you are.\" At this, Jessica smiled brightly and preened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm great, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack laughed nervously. \"Y-yeah, you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Jessica said, leaning forward, \"You say the whole 'sudden pregnancy' thing happened more than once today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, twice,\" Jack said, taking a long sip of water. \"Remember when you came into my work and my manager was pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica thought back and remembered seeing April's big, round belly. \"Oh yeah! So she wasn't pregnant when you came in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. The same thing happened with Tara. Weird, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that is weird,\" Jessica said, crossing her arms in contemplation. \"Unless you're just imagining things or...something. Do you have any theories?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack took a noter nervous swig of water. \"W-well, I do, kinda. The only thing that was the same with both of them was right before they became pregnant, I remember flipping this coin.\" Jack pulled the infamous coin out of his pocket and put it on the table for Jessica to see. She took it in her hand and inspected it in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never seen anything like it,\" she said. \"But...it looks like there's a pregnant woman on both sides of these. That seems like a pretty big coincidence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Jack agreed, nodding. He'd forgotten all about the actual designs on the coin. \"But it seems weird, right? I mean, how could flipping a coin make someone pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica spied the waitress walking toward them with the bruschetta and she gave Jack a tiny grin. \"Let's see if it works, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't think that's a good idea, Jess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled and placed it over her thumb. \"Oh, c'mon Jack. It's not like a coin can <b>really</b> make someone pregnant. Let's just see, huh?\" And with that, Jessica gave the coin a quick flip and caught it. Heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go,\" the waitress said, placing the food on the table. Jessica looked at her, looked at the coin, then back to Jack, shrugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Jessica said with a smile, grabbing a piece of bread and springing tomato and cheese on it as soon as the waitress turned around. \"I guess it doesn't do anything after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" Jack said with a relieved sigh. <i>Good, so I was wrong about the coin,</i> he thought. <i>So nothing happened to Jessica when I flipped the coin yesterday.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did they know, back in the kitchen, the waitress reached into her purse under the counter and fished out her bottle of pre-natal pills for controlling nausea and washed it down with some water. <br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the hospital, Jack Dale Sr. had just walked into Dr. Harper's office, where the good doctor and Amanda Dale were sitting. Amanda smiled weakly at her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, honey,\" she said. Jack Sr. looked anxious, so she held his hand as he sat down. \"Don't worry, it's okay...Dr. Harper, would you mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Harper nodded and smiled. \"Mr. Dale, your wife is pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis jaw dropped. \"Pregnant? I...are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda and Dr. Harper both nodded. \"Positively,\" Dr. Harper said. \"And she doesn't show any signs of distress or any risky medical signs we see with pregnant women of her age.\" Dr. Harper turned to Amanda. \"Well, let's be honest, <i>our</i> age. I never want to discriminate against older pregnant women and I'll take good care of you, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack Sr. sighed and turned to give his wife a big kiss, which caught her by surprise. \"Well, I can't say I was expecting being a father again,\" he said with a laugh, \"But to be honest, I'm feeling pretty happy right now. I love you so much, dear.\" He went back to kissing Amanda on the cheek, who smiled sheepishly again as she moved Jack back a bit to talk to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's more,\" she said, taking a big breath. \"It's...more than one baby. It's four.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Harper handed him a print-out of the ultrasound as his eyes bugged out. Jack Sr. couldn't say anything other than, \"well...huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fork fell to her plate with a clang as Jessica leaned back in her seat, hand on her stomach. \"Whoo! I am stuffed,\" she said. \"That was great. I don't know why I was so hungry when I'm already bloated like crazy. Thanks for putting up with my rabid feeding, Jack,\" she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was an honor to watch you work,\" Jack joked, bowing playfully. Jessica threw her napkin at him with a giggling scowl as he finished his last bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, laser tag now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were stuffed?\" Jack asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I'm still hungry. Hungry for laser tag,\" she said in a deadpan manner, putting her fists on the table. \"C'mon, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright,\" he said, rolling his eyes with a smile. To be honest, he had partly picked the restaurant because it wasn't far from the laser tag place in town, expecting that this would be the outcome of the night. Jessica squealed with pleasure as the waitress brought their check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver at the Fun Zone, Jack and Jessica were putting on their vests and having the rules explained to them by a monotone teenager. While they listened to the rules, Jessica put down her gun and asked Jack for some help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My vest isn't going on too well. It's...pressing against my boobs and it hurts a lot,\" she complained trying to pull the vest closed. Jack gave her a hand, blushing at her admission that her breasts had gotten larger since the last time he saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey'd been put on opposite teams, at Jessica's insistence, because, quote, \"she wanted to kick his ass.\"And, as they went out into the dark battleground, she did just that. She found him out pretty quickly and camped close to him, blasting him away every chance she got, laughing and whooping maniacally as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is fun for you?\" Jack laughed after she zapped him the 10th time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't for you?\" she grinned back, sticking her tongue out. As soon as Jack's blaster turned back on, he zapped her back, hitting her squarely on the shoulder and freezing her. Jessica's mouth hung open, shocked. \"Oh, you'll pay for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about half an hour of gameplay, they both walked out, sweaty and laughing. Looking up at the game board, it was pretty clear that while the two of them were fooling around and trying to shoot one another, the others involved in the laser tag were actually racking up points. They both shrugged and laughed, heading back out to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, that was so fun,\" Jessica said, before turning quickly to Jack. \"Ooh, ice cream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" he smiled, pulling into a little outdoor place so the two of them could grab a cone. Then, they walked around in a nearby park, just talking, chatting, genuinely catching up. Time passed rapidly, and eventually is was close to midnight and the two of them were sitting on a bench together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad we did this,\" Jessica said, wiping the last traces of ice cream from her lips and tossing the napkin into a nearby napkin. \"I missed spending time with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me too,\" Jack smiled, scooting a little closer to Jessica. \"B-but, you know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Jessica said, moving closer as well, her voice getting quieter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know we both said this wasn't a date, but if it had been a date, i-it would have been one of the best I've ever been on.\" Jack was almost trembling at this point. Jessica smiled and brought her face closer to his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well put,\" she giggled. \"But...I feel the same way.\" Their eyes met and each one looked at one another's lips. Soon, they were moving in for a kiss, their eyes slowly closing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the clock struck midnight and Jessica stopped just millimeters short of Jack's lips. \"Ugh, I feel...\" she clutched her stomach. \"Whoa,\" she moaned, her belly now expanding slowly. It wasn't dramatic, but they could both see her abdomen rounding out, creating a visible bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica?\" Jack said worriedly, holding onto her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack?\" Jessica asked, looking down and feeling her belly, which was now firm in the middle. \"What's happening to me?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack helped Jessica into the passenger seat of his car. She wasn't feeling weak or sick, but the shock of the sudden expansion definitely left her in a somewhat stunned state. As they walked together, her hands were still on her now curved belly, studying it with her palms, saying nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't much different in the car. Jack drove quickly, his eyes looking out to watch the red lights of other cars and the white stripes of the road that were both illuminated in the dark. His whole face was pale and he could feel nervous droplets of sweat starting on the back of his neck. Even in this stunned state, Jack could still make sense of what was happening. After all, he'd already done something similar earlier in the day with Tara, who's pregnant belly suddenly grew and grew. So, Jack's worse fears had come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>But this doesn't make sense</i>, Jack thought to himself, looking over at Jessica's adorable little bump. <i>With Tara and all the others, I flipped that coin first. I didn't do anything this time and her belly didn't even grow that much, compared to everyone else.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica rolled up her shirt to look more at her new middle. Her belly button looked like it was on the verge of popping out but there was still plenty of room to go. Jessica traced its rim with her fingertips before going back to stroking her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really firm...\" Jessica said, pressing her palm against her waist before trying to pinch her belly skin. \"It's tight too. So at least this isn't fat,\" Jessica giggled to herself before sighing again. \"But then...what it is? It just feels like I'm swollen in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should see a doctor in the morning,\" Jack said, trying to think of something to comfort Jessica, or at least try to make sense of the situation. \"How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...it feels fine, I guess,\" Jessica said, looking back down at her tummy. \"But, you know what it really looks like? Like I'm pregn-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't,\" Jack said, as the car stopped quickly at a red light, rubbing his temples nervously. \"Don't...say that. That doesn't make any sense. None of this makes any sense. You, April, Tara, Faye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica put one hand on Jack's arm. \"Jack, look, I'm sure everything's okay. I said I feel fine, right? Just...let me get some rest when I get home and I'll figure things out in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack sighed heavily and nodded, driving off as the light turned green. \"You're right. I'm sorry for getting upset.\" They drove for about 10 more minutes in silence until Jack pulled in front of Jessica's house. \"Well...let me know if you find anything out or if you, you know,\" Jack hesitated and looked down, \"want to hang out again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica grinned and unbuckled her seat. \"Don't worry, I will. And Jack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up just as Jessica leaned over and kissed him on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Overall, it was a great date.\" Jessica hopped out of the car and walked up to her door, one hand still over her newly found bulge. Jack couldn't shake the shocked expression from his face the entire time he drove back home. It wasn't until he lay down in bed and stroked the slightly-damp spot on his cheek that he smiled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----Faye and Amanda: Day 4 / Jessica: Day 3----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking downstairs the next morning, Jack yawned loudly, scratching his head. He felt like there was something very important to remember or think about, but it escaped him. <i>I'm sure it'll come to me</i>, Jack thought, sitting down at the kitchen table, pouring himself a bowl of cereal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did, his mother and father walked in from the living room, both of them with an anxious expression. \"Jack?\" his mother said, wearing a heavy robe. \"Can we talk to you for a minute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Jack said, looking back and forth at his mom and dad to try and figure out what they were asking about. They both looked at each other before his mom sighed and gave a tiny smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...pregnant,\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ah, right,</i>Jack thought, his heart sinking as the events of the past day replaying themselves in his mind. <i>That's what I was trying to remember</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, pal?\" his dad said, putting his arm around Amanda's shoulders. Jack nodded, swallowing a big bite of cereal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess so. I mean, if you're both happy, then I'm happy,\" he said. \"Did you find out when you were with Tara?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mom nodded. \"Yes, and there was...something else. You're not just going to have a little brother or sister. You're going to have...four.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked at her with a shocked look, still trying to subconsciously reel in his expression. \"F-four?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, quadruplets,\" his father said with a nervous laugh. \"But the doctor said everything looks healthy, so that's one less thing to worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack felt himself shake nervously as he quickly finished his cereal. \"W-well, um, congratulations Mom, I guess. I've got to g-go right now, but I guess we can talk more about this later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sure,\" his mom said, her hand unconsciously going to her waist, rubbing it gingerly. Jack put his bowl away and headed out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of ear range, Amanda turned to Jack Sr. \"There's another problem we didn't tell him about, you know.\" Opening her robe, she revealed a pronounced bulge in her middle, the size of a 30 week pregnant belly. \"I know it's four, but the doctor said I was only three months pregnant. This looks...a little big, wouldn't you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack Sr. was speechless, looking at his over-50 wife's pregnant belly. \"I...whatever you say, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got into the car, Jack let out a long sigh as he quickly dug his coin out, staring at it. \"This is all your fault,\" he said. \"I don't know how, but it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Jack</span> the coin said softly. Jack scrunched his face up. The coin knew he was talking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever. Let's try and think about this,\" Jack said, talking out loud. \"Alright, so when I flip you and look at someone, they get pregnant. That much is clear now. And sometimes it's a lot and sometimes it's a little. And...sometimes they're fine with it and sometimes it surprises them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack turned the coin over in his hands a few times, studying the designs on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two sides to a coin, so...two different results. Maybe heads is a full pregnancy and one is just a little one...or one makes them fine with it and one surprises them. But which is it? And what happens if I flipped it and looked at a guy?\" Jack looked at the design on the coin of what looked like a pregnant man and shuddered. <i>I'll have to try not to do that</i>, he thought to himself, pocketing the coin again and turning on the ignition.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack drove, and drove, and drove some more. He practically drove until he almost ran out of road. Then he turn around and drove some more, just driving around with no particular place to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to clear his head after everything that has happened; April, Tara, Faye, Jessica... His mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh god, Mom.</i> Jack thought, thinking back to his encounter with his parents. His mother was pregnant. His 50-something mother was PREGNANT. And not just with one baby, but with FOUR. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour little brother and sisters he was going to have. Four little brothers and sisters he would have to look out for and help raise. Oh god, he wasn't going to be an only child anymore. He was going to be a brother, big brother Jack! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This isn't just about you anymore Jack. Think about Mom</i> He thought. Four! She was going to be huge! Absolutely massive! Jack thought back to the dream he had... Was it dream? Or a vision of the future? All the images came rushing back to him... Jessica, Faye.. His mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head trying to take his mind off of everything that seemed to happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Jack</span> the voice in the back of his head called to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this coin really talking to him? Was this coin the cause of all of it? Faye, April, Tara, Jessica... His mother? He thought back to the conversation he had with himself just moments earlier.. Crazy as it may be, could this coin really cause a pregnancy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBZZT! BZZT! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was snapped back to reality by the ringing of his cellphone. Without looking he snapped it up, answered it, and put it to his ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica? Are you okay? Did you go to the Doctor? What did the Doctor say? Are you - - - \" Jack just let out, without thinking. <br>\r\n\"Jessica? What are you talking about bro? It's me Ian, your best friend. Your best friend since Junior High. Your best friend that you've been hanging out with all summer? The best friend that's calling to remind you that we had a very important appointment at the mall?\" Ian, Jack's best friend (not of the female variety) said. <br>\r\n\"Ian?\" Jack said confused. His mind was racing, he almost had no idea where he was or what he was doing. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, Ian. Thin as a rail, tall, lanky, wears glasses, the second half of the dynamic duo known as Stick Man and Blubber Boy, as we were so <br>\r\noften called in Junior High and High School.\" Ian reminded him. <br>\r\n\"Hey, I wasn't that fat in High School\" Jack corrected. <br>\r\n\"Tell that to your backside\" Ian reminded him. <br>\r\n\"The size of my backside in High School aside, what were you talking about? What appointment at the mall?\" Jack asked, the events of the past few days weighing heavily on his memory of something very important. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you forgot.\" Ian said. <br>\r\n\"Let's say I did. Want to cut to the chase?\" Jack said, getting slightly annoyed. <br>\r\n\"Three words and a number - Zombie Massacre Mania 2! Or did you forget that the biggest video games of the year came out TODAY, and we have two deluxe editions waiting for us at GameWorld?\" Ian said, almost sounding almost offended that his best friend forgot this truly historic occasion. <br>\r\n\"Oh man, Zombie Massacre Mania 2! I totally forgot!\" Jack said, slapping his forehead with his hand.<br>\r\n\"You forgot? How do you forget ZMM2? That's like forgetting to breath!\" Ian responded back to him smartly. <br>\r\n\"I've had a lot of mind. It's been.. a weird couple of days. \" Jack says. <br>\r\n\"You see, this is what happens when you don't hang out with your best friend for a week. Everything goes to hell for you. But don't worry, Dr. Ian Carter has the cure! Zombie Massacring. I recommend an all marathon session.\" Ian replies. <br>\r\n\"You're not a Doctor Ian. You manage a coffee shop.\" Jack replied. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I manage it\" Ian reinforced. \"Now, are you coming or not?\" Ian finished. <br>\r\n\"Be there soon bro. We shall soon be knee deep in the undead!\" Jack replied, almost all of his cares seemingly pushed aside by the promise of ultra violence against the undead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack turned his vehicle around and headed off to the mall. Upon arriving some time later, he managed to find a decent parking spot in the garage, which was lucky since the mall seemed particularly packed today. He got out of the car and walked inside, the cares of the world and the weirdness of the days before seemingly melting away with every step he took. However, Jack didn't know that the weirdness that seemed to be following him around like a chain these past few days was only about to get worse and more crazy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack strolled through the mall, past the clothing stores, book stores, furniture stores, and dozens of other stores, taking in the sights, sounds, and smells. Giant pretzels were baking in a restaurant, a live band seemed to be blaring away in the center pavilion, and shoppers seemed to be talking amongst themselves, hauling around their packages. Jack even noticed a few very attractive looking girls his own age walking past him, talking on the cellphones or texting. Jack stopped and checked them out, admiring them, remembering that sometimes, he really really loved the mall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as he passed \"Buns In The Oven\" all of the memories of the pass few days came rushing back as he watched pregnant women of all shapes, sizes, and ethnicities waddled into the trendy maternity store. He thought of April. He thought of Faye. He thought of Faye, and Jessica, and his mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lowered his head and kept walking, trying to keep his eyes off the new Maternity Lingerie display in the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more stores, Jack finally reached his destination of GameWorld, the game superstore, where a long line of eager gamers awaited to get their hands of the second installment of the world's most popular zombie killing RPG. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, you made it! I thought you got lost or something! What took you so long!\" Ian said, walking over to his friend, and putting his arm around his shoulder. Ian was taller than Jack, always has been since they were kids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan was an odd one, while he was tall, he always seemed so thing, giving off the appearance of a walking stick with eyeglasses. Ian had short dark hair, glasses, and almost no facial hair, which many people thought was also odd. For whatever reason, Ian couldn't seem to grow a mustache or a bear, despite being the exact same age as Jack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh, had a lot on my mind\" Jack said, removing Ian's arm from around his shoulder and giving his friend a playful push. <br>\r\n\"Well at least something is on your mind.\" Ian replied. <br>\r\n\"Oh ha, ha, ha. So, you ready for this?\" Jack responded, trying to desperately get his mind off of... maternal things. <br>\r\n\"You know it. I took the next two days off so we can play co-op both in person and online. I swear man, it's going to be just like when we were kids and had the marathon weekend sessions.\" Ian said with a smile, remembering the good times. <br>\r\n\"Two days off? I guess being manager has it perks?\" Jack replied. <br>\r\n\"Set the schedule, more pay, and slide off all responsibility to my assistant manager? Hell yeah.\" Ian smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the line for the zombie killing goodness grew shorter as more and more people picked up their game, Jack slowly grew more and more depressed. Not because he was sad about finally picking up the game he had been waiting three years for, but for whatever reason, the mall was slowly becoming crowded with more and more pregnant women, which only seemed to remind Jack of his situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after picking up their pre-ordered deluxe edition of their game, Jack and Ian sat a table at the food court. Ian was going on and on about all the new features of the games, the new quests, the new abilities, the new epic life or death choices a player was forced to make, but it was all going in one ear and out the other as he watched a pregnant woman sit down across from them and order a big lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Earth to Jack! What's going on, you've been like a zombie all day! Do I have to be the chainsaw of undead justice down upon you or something?\" Ian said, referencing one of the new weapons in the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ian, you're my friend and I can tell you anything right?\" Jack said, starting. <br>\r\n\"Of course man. You know it.\" Ian said.<br>\r\n\"Look, something.. Something weird has been going on lately.\" Jack said. <br>\r\n\"Well, spit it out! Come on man, what's going on?\" Ian asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack hesitated. Does he tell his best friend everything? About the coin? About Faye? Tera? April? Jessica? His mother? He would sound crazy. But.. It's Ian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A few days ago, I go with my parents to this rummage sale or something like it right? I'm looking around at all this junk right? And I come across this coin - - - \" Jack said as he reached into his pocket, pulling out the coin, and placing it on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I buy it right? It's just a coin I think right? So, on the return trip home, I end up flipping it while looking out the window, and I see Faye Jones. You know Faye right?\"  Jack asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she had some disease or something that made it hard for her to get pregnant or something. ' Ian responses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Well the next day, she comes over and she announces that she's pregnant. And I'm all like, well that's great. I mean, I think nothing of it right? But you know what I think? I think this coin - - - \" Jack says, tapping the coin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this coin did it.\" Jack says, nodding his head for emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-- huh.\" Ian says, giving his friend a \"Bro, you've gone insane\" look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right. And that's not all right. So, I'm at work, and I go on break to the comic book store, and guess who comes in? Jessica.\" Jack says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica as in \"I've loved her since forever and won't admit it and still just say she's a friend even though it's obvious I want to be much more than friends with her\" Jessica?\" Ian asks, already knowing the answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not in some many words but yes. Also shut up about Jessica\" Jack said, continuing his story. <br>\r\n\"Anyways, she comes in and we talk a while. I mean, it's been a while since I've seen her since High School, so I ask her if she wants to hang out, and I flip the coin, and we agree to go out.\" Jack continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you had a date with Jessica?\" Ian asked his eyes going wide. \"Dude, you gotta tell everything that happened with that man. Tell me bro, did you hit it?\" Ian says, asking for all the juicy details. <br>\r\n\"Dude, shut up and let me finish!\" Jack said. \"Now where was I? Oh yeah. So, the next day right, I go to work, and April's there right. And I feel the coin calling to me, almost begging me to flip it right? So I do, and I look at April, next thing I know right - BOOM PREGNANT\" Jack says, his voice going loud as his emphasis on the boom and the pregnant, causing a few people to look over their table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"April? Dude, she's been pregnant since you worked there. You were telling me about how during the job interview her belly kept hitting things around the store as she asked you questions and you had to pick up everything. \" Ian says, very matter-of-factly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ian? What are you talking about! That never happened! I'm telling you, I flipped this coin and she became pregnant and acted like it was always that way!\" Jack said, his voice slowly getting louder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay. I believe you. Is that all?\" Ian said, trying to calm his friend down. <br>\r\n\"No!\" Jack said. \"So April's all like \"I've been this way forever\" and I'm like \"No way\" and she's like \"Whatever\". So I go home, and my mom needs me to take her to her office to pick up some stuff since she's been so sick lately. So I take her there, and after a while I go inside because, hey I'm bored right? So I go inside and there's this woman there named Tara, and we both want a soda, so we flip a coin - - THIS COIN \" Jack says, once again tapping this coin, his voice getting loud \"And then BOOM! PREGNANT! And she's all like \"I've always been pregnant, and she's like \"I'm pregnant so I really want that soda, let's go again, and I flip again - She becomes MORE PREGNANT\" Jack says, his voice so loud people in the food court are listening to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now she's all like, my twins really want the soda, let's go one more time, so I flip again, and now she's having triplets, but here's the thing, she only remembers having twins right? But I tell she's wasn't pregnant when she came in, and my mom comes back, and she's like not at all phased by this. So because I just watched her belly expand and become pregnant we loud her up into the car and take her to the hospital. Once we get there it's all like \"My doctor is here\" and we take her there and it's like she's been pregnant this whole time and the doctor's like \"Wow, how did we miss this third baby? And I'm thinking \"BECAUSE SHE JUST BECAME PREGNANT!\" Jack is practically shouting now as he gives his explanation, and a couple people in the food courts are starting to leave the surrounding tables , clearly to get away from the crazy person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, I really think you need to see someone about this dude. This doesn't sound healthy to be imagining all this!\" Ian says, actually getting concerned for his friends mental health. <br>\r\n\"I'm not imagining this! This all really happened! Just ask Jessica! She's pregnant too! And it's all this coins' fault!\" Jack shouts. <br>\r\n\"Jessica's pregnant? Wow, wonder who the father is? Last I heard, she hasn't been seeing anyone for months.\" Ian wonders. <br>\r\n\"THERE IS NO FATHER! OR MAYBE THERE IS! I THINK IT'S THIS COIN!\" Jack shouts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up over there you crazy freak!\" Someone yells from across the food court. <br>\r\n\"You shut up!\" Jack yells back.<br>\r\n\"Jack, bro. I think you're beginning to lose it\". Ian responds back to his friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not losing it Ian! Jessica's pregnant! I watched her grow pregnant at midnight! Call her if you don't believe me! It's not just man! MY MOM IS PREGNANT! WITH QUADRUPLETS! FOUR!\" Jack is shouting. <br>\r\n\"Whoa, whoa whoa. Dude. Your mom is pregnant? Seriously?\" Ian asks, amazed. <br>\r\n\"Yes dude! She's over 50! And she's pregnant! With four! And it's this coins fault!\" Jack says, grabbing the coin off the table and holding it in front of Ian's face for dramatic effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I can't believe your mom is pregnant! That's crazy! I'm, she's kid of old, but hey, you get some brothers and sisters right? I mean, that's cool right?\" Ian asks, trying to remain positive. <br>\r\n\"No it's not!\" Jack says back, slamming his head on the table, and keeping it there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, look man. I understand that finding out your mom is pregnant at her age is quite stressful, but I don't think it's causing all this nonsense you've been describing to me. You and I both took Health Class, we know where babies come from, and it sure as hell isn't from some coin. I think you're in some weird, messed up kind of denial about - - - something I don't know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLook at it like this okay? You come back from college to hang out with your parents right? And then you find out your mom is pregnant, at her age, with four babies right? Suddenly your whole life is thrown upside down, and to top it all off, you start dating a pregnant chick right? So your brain comes up with this whole thing okay? This is just your bizarre way of dealing with stress. \" Ian explains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But look at the coin dude. It has pregnant people on there! Not just a woman, but a man! I think this thing could work on man!\" Jack explains to his friend showing him the coin. \"Man, you gotta take some pills or something for this. Men don't have babies. Women have babies, and apparently a lot of the women in your life are having them and it's causing you to go loopy.\" Ian says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't believe me.\" Jack says, shaking his head. <br>\r\n\"I believe that you believe it. But to make you feel better - - - \" </span></div></div>",

Jack\u2019s entire body shook as his tried open his fingers, it was like some invisible force was forcing his fingers to stay closed over the coin. \u201cCome on Frodo it\u2019s not the One Ring,\u201d said Ian.<br>\r\nWith a great effort  Jack opened his hand, the coin without changing in any physical way seemed to try and hold on, before falling into the water with a \u2018<span class=\"cblue\">plonk</span>\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you throw it?\u201d asked Ian.<br>\r\n\u201cIt was hard enough to let go as it was,\u201d said Jack staring right ahead of his gaze at the fountain without quite taking it in. It was a stone woman in the Greco-Roman style of sculpting, it was wearing a toga and was carrying an urn both also carved from a white marble (or more likely a fake substitute) from the urn water gushed out into the pool surrounding the fountain. Jack felt as though he had lost an arm or a friend, he hand an urge to jump into the water and get the coin, and found his hands on the ledge and his legs tensed to jump. His pulled himself together and straightened up, and felt strangely better, but this feeling wasn\u2019t to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a waste,\u201d stated Ian looking around at the pool surrounding area, \u201cI mean you\u2019re not allowed to swim in there.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe water is only knee deep,\u201d Jack pointed out.<br>\r\n\u201cbut that not the point it\u2019s a piece of prime mall land with enough room to fit a shop and some left over for that fountain and small pool around it, but instead they go this large \u2018pond\u2019 which no one is allowed to enter,\u201d Ian continued turning around and walking towards the exit, Jack followed suit.

But it did leave him enough time to go home and have a shower, letting the coin go was felt like lifting a heavy weight and made him sweat accordingly, not to mention summer was getting into gear and Jack was the kind of guy who could perspire in winter. A quick rinse and a change of clothes would be good, he said goodbye to Ian who was grinning mockingly after Jack said why he had to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack raced home and quickly found a clean change of clothes before going to the shower, he made sure not to bump into his mother, part of Jack thought that disposing of the coin would make things go back to normal and he didn\u2019t want to evidence that said otherwise for as long as possible, after all Jessica might be calling him to the hospital to tell him she wasn\u2019t really pregnant that it was just gas or a food baby or something.

With the coin out of sight, Jacks mind could rest and have to deal with all the crazy craziness that was certain to go on in his life right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan reached into his pocket and pulled out this coin that his friend just gave to him. It was impossibly smooth, almost brand new feeling, yet looked older than old. It was covered in deep scratches, yet the image of what looked like a happy pregnant woman and a pregnant... man? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man this thing is weird\" Ian says looking at the images. \"I have no idea what Jack would buy something like this. But that's his problem not mine.\" Ian said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ian walked back towards where he parked on the opposite side of the mall, he was constantly flipping the coin and catching it, a trick his uncle taught him to do when he was younger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he flipped the coin, over and over and over again, Ian looked at all the people who crowded this mall. It was particularly crowded today, but  that didn't seem to bother Ian, he loved to people watch, women, men, old, young, it didn't matter to him, although Ian's favorite was the scantily clad ladies who did seem to frequent this shopping center. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ian walked into the parking garage, he didn't seem to notice behind him, men and women, young and old, either cover their mouths because they were about to be sick, or that the midsections of these peoples were beginning to round out, some of the men and women responding in panic, others rubbing their new round life orbs with a smile and coo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - -  - - -  Back to Jack - - - -  -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack left the mall a new man.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack knew exactly what he needed to do. Pulling out of the mall parking lot, he headed back to the somewhat-familiar neighborhoods where Jessica lived. As he drove, he didn't notice the pregnant women (and men) walking along the entrance of the mall, either strolling along pleasantly with their full womb cradled in their arms or waddling anxiously and uncomfortably, staring in confusion at the new occupant inside them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he pulled up in front of her house, Jack texted Jessica to let her know he was outside. After a few moments, he got a message back. &lt;Come on in&gt;.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack could feel himself shaking nervously as he walked up, still not knowing what condition Jessica was in after last night's sudden...episode. Every time Jack's mind drifted to the conclusion that she must be pregnant, he shook his head emphatically. <i>The coin's gone now,</i> he told himself. <i>The coin's gone, and with it, all my problems.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica opened the door as Jack approached, giving him a soft smile. \"Hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" Jack said back, walking up to her. He couldn't help but notice that she still had a slight bulge under her shirt. Swallowing nervously, he looked back up at Jessica, who still had a tiny grin, one of her front teeth just barely biting her lip. Without a word, Jack kept walking forward, Jessica taking a few steps back to let him inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should talk in my room,\" Jessica said. Jack wasn't exactly sure of what to make of this turn of events, but he gladly followed Jessica down the hall into a very cool-looking bedroom. There was a subtly green paint over the walls, a stacked bookshelf, a CD rack, and a table covered in various computer and music accessories. Jessica sat down on a bed with a thick comforter and patted the seat for Jack to sit next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Jack said slowly. \"Did you, um, go to the doctor or anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did,\" Jessica said, before taking a big sigh and turning to Jack. \"Looks like I'm a mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack hung his head and looked at Jessica sadly. \"Oh, Jessica, I'm...so sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica smiled weakly and put her hands over the firm bulge in her mid-section. \"About three months pregnant, according to the clinic. Looks like you were right: that coin of yours really does make people pregnant. That's the only explanation, unless my fingers can get me pregnant.\" She giggled and looked at Jack, who's already nervous face turned bright red with embarrassment. \"Aw, c'mon Jack, I'm trying to make jokes to lighten the mood. This is usually the kind of thing you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked back at Jessica and tried to force a smile of his own. \"I just want make sure you're okay. This whole thing is my fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's not your fault,\" Jessica said, resting her head on Jack's shoulder, making a pouting face. \"Stop saying that. Who could have expected that a coin would make someone pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I went ahead and got rid of the coin. I gave it away to someone who assured me they'd put it somewhere far away, out of reach. It can't get anyone pregnant ever again,\" Jack said, before sighing and looking down at Jessica. \"Well, not before it got my mom pregnant, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mom's pregnant too?\" Jessica said, looking back into Jack's eyes from her spot on his shoulder. \"You're sure it's the coin's doing? Couldn't she and your dad have just...you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she's kind of old to get pregnant from that,\" Jack said, trying not to think of his parents...ugh. \"Besides, it sounded like she was a lot further along and the coin seems to make people kind of advanced into their pregnancy.\" Jack paused before adding the next issue. \"And she's pregnant with four babies, which seems like exactly the kind of dick move the coin would pull.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four?!\" Jessica said, wrenching her head up suddenly to stare back at Jack. \"Your mom is having quadruplets?\" Then, a serious thought dawned on her and Jessica clutched her small belly. \"You...you don't think I could be pregnant with that many, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack thought about it before shaking his head. \"I mean, I guess it's possible, but I doubt it. Remember Tara, the woman I told you about from my mom's work? She was pregnant with triplets, and that was after I flipped the coin three times anyway. The coin must have been flipped more than once around my mom. So you probably don't have that many babies in your pregnancy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack finished his sentence, he realized how casually he was now talking about Jessica being pregnant. He buried his face in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't do that,\" Jessica said, moving closer to Jack. Gingerly, she wrapped her arms around him in a small hug. \"I know this is a weird situation, but you've got to be a little cooler about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Jack said, his heart still sunk from the idea of all the lives he and his coin must have ruined. Jessica moved his chin to face her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm scared and I can't fake it all the time,\" she said, hugging Jack and burying her face in his chest. Jack embraced her back, holding her close. She wasn't crying, but he could feel her taking deep breaths as her heavy breasts, their new size now explained, rose up and down as they squeezed against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do your parents know yet?\" Jack asked. She shook her head, her forehead rubbing back and forth against his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm scared to tell them. I need to at least have an idea of what I'm going to do first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm here if you need anything,\" Jack said, tightening his grip and moving one hand to rest against Jessica's shoulder. \"After all, I got you into this mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom against his shirt, Jessica giggled and looked up at Jack, her eyes barely watery. \"You've got to stop saying it like that. People will think we did it.\" Jack gulped and grinned, moving back as he felt an erection growing. <i>Your friend's in the biggest trouble of her life but one mention of sex and I go all hard</i>, Jack thought pitifully. <i>I'm a real class act</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. Hey, let's talk more later, okay? My parents will be home any second now and I've got to think of a good story for them. Soon enough, they'll notice how I've been...\" Jessica paused and pulled up her shirt, revealing the bare slope of her newly-found pregnance. \"...growing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack blushed and nodded, trying to look only at her eyes. \"Okay. But really, let me know if there's anything you need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to hang out with you later today. That's what I want, dummy,\" Jessica said, sticking out her tongue. As the two of them walked down the hallway, Jessica walked up to Jack as they exited the door and gave him a kiss on the neck, looking up at him while biting her lip. \"Well...bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye,\" Jack said with a small but genuine smile, heading back to his car. He sighed heavily once he left, the reality of the situation hitting him all at once. Faye. Amber. Tara. Jessica. Mom. Probably the waitress from the restaurant and plenty of other people he inadvertently got pregnant and thus threw a massive wrench into their lives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>At least that damn coin is gone for and I won't have to worry about this happening to anyone else</i>, Jack thought. <i>No one else is suddenly going to get pregnant</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the thought of pregnancy, Jack's mind immediately went back to Jessica's tiny, bare tummy. Not Tara's gargantuan womb, Amber's flirty belly, but Jessica's small bulge. He couldn't shake it out of his head. He imagined it growing bigger and bigger, Jessica looked up at him with doe eyes as she massaged her maternal orb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\" Jack yelled at himself inside his car, jamming the key into the slot, powering it up, and driving off a little too fast for a residential neighborhood. \"What is the matter with me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- Amanda Dale ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's mom stood in her bathroom, looking at herself carefully in the mirror. She had never been a bad-looking woman in her own opinion, even as he entered her 50s, but the change she noticed in herself was revolutionary. Her skin was much softer and smoother, without any wrinkles or sags present across her entire body, especially her belly. Her breasts were nice and firm and there was more sensitivity in each nipple than she'd ever remembered. Her face was much the same, with a new warmth present her cheeks while she still maintained her mature charm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda looked down at her big, round belly that, surely, looked much too big to just be three months developed, as the doctor had told her yesterday. Even with quadruplets, that was just silly. Still, she wasn't exactly complaining about its size yet. She had loved being pregnant with Jack so many years ago and she couldn't remembering having any morning sickness except for once a few days ago. On top of all of that, she was sure that her pregnancy was the source of the rest of her body looking so...different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More women should try growing four people inside them,\" she scoffed to herself, putting her clothes back on and waddling out the door for the mail. Out there, she saw Faye doing the same, only she was just as big as Amanda!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Amanda!\" Faye said, walking over, rubbing her big belly. \"I couldn't believe it when you called me. We're going to be pregnant together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's weird, huh?\" Amanda said, following Faye's lead and massaging her own belly in the same way. \"Although I look a little big, even for quadruplets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you look about the same size as me,\" Faye said, craning her neck to admire Amanda's middle. \"Although, that makes sense, because I just had another appointment this morning and...I'm carrying quadruplets too!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- Jack Dale Jr. ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack waited at a long red light...</span></div></div>",

His eyes flicked between the phone and the red light as he read the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;hey its amber&gt; it read. &lt;can you come to the gym on ryder st?&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack quickly typed a message back. &lt;sure&gt; He wasn't exactly sure why he agreed, but he didn't exactly have anything else planned for the day and he wasn't in the mood to dive right back into video games. It still felt strange, though. If anything, he would want to stay as far away from pregnant women as possible, especially when it was his and the coin's fault that she got pregnant in the first place. &lt;be there in 20&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack added the last part because, if he was going to the gym, he needed to grab a change of clothes first and he was pretty close to home. As he drove up, he saw his mother and Faye talking on the front lawn. And with a shocked expression, he saw that they both had considerable pregnant bellies. Nowhere near as big as he'd seen on Amber or Faye, but they both looked like they were close to reaching full term. What's more, Faye was giggling and putting her hands on her and Jack's mother's belly! He looked away, blushing as he quickly backed down the driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, I guess it makes sense that she'd be a little bigger than normal. She's carrying...four after all</i> Jack thought, trying to rationalize his mother's sudden belly size. Before, she'd managed to cover up most of her new-found size with her robe. <i>But Faye...that seems like a huge jump in just one day</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he darted into his room, Jack opened a gym bag and started stuffing in a plain white shirt, shorts, and some athletic shoes. After pausing and considering it, he included a change of underwear, a towel, and some shampoo in case he got too sweaty and needed to shower there. Satisfied that he was done, Jack looked around his room to see where he'd dumbly left his car keys. He looked and looked until-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack?\" His mother called from down the steps. \"You came back while I was talking with Faye. How was your trip?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could hear her getting closer, so as soon as he spied his keys on top of his dresser, he quickly swiped his hand over the top and stuffed the key and anything else he happened to catch in his grip into his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FineI'mgoingtothegymnowbye,\" he sputtered, walking through the door just as his mother walked in, narrowly getting past her without bumping into her new belly. And with that, he was out the door and down the stairs. His mother was left standing by the door, absently rubbing her belly with a curious expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping back into the car, Jack texted Amber that he was on his way and drove off. While her new pregnancy certainly made things different, it wasn't that odd on the surface that Amber had texted Jack. She had done plenty of athletics in high school and college and still exercised and even went to charity runs every now and then. And ever since he lost all of his weight from high school, Jack had maintained a fairly regular exercise regiment, so the two of them ran into one another at the local gym sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he got to the gym, he changed and walked into the gym's main center, looking around for any sign of Amber. As he looked, he felt a tap on the shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey there, guy,\" Amber said, her usual, teasing grin on. \"Glad you could make it.\" She was wearing a baby blue tank top that covered her belly but pushed her swollen cleavage clearly into view. Around her toned hips were a pair of grey sweatpants and her shoulder-length fire-red hair was tied into a messy bun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no problem. I felt like I needed to com here to relax anyway,\" he replied. \"So, did you want to go for a run together or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber's smile turned up a little more as she chuckled. \"No, actually, I didn't bring you here to work out. I need a lamaze class partner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack jaw dropped as his eyebrow skewed confused. She needed him for <b>what</b>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her eyes as she smacked her full lips, looking for the right words. \"Well, my friend who usually takes me couldn't make it today, and I couldn't think of anyone else who'd help me out. I don't have a lot of reliable friends, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, it's...nice that you think so much of me, but lamaze class, Amber? That's a little...familiar, you know?\" Jack said. And with that, Amber's eyes lit up as she chuckled even louder, taking a big step up to Jack, her full-term looking belly barely an inch from his torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jack, always so forward, yet still so shy,\" Amber said. \"Look, it'll be okay. It's just helping me stretch, timing breathing, things like that.\" Then she leaned in and whispered. \"Don't worry, I won't tell any of the other girls that you like pregnant chicks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't-\" Jack said far too loudly, catching himself and starting over, \"I don't have any kind of special attraction for pregnant women. Y-you were just saying that to tease me yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know me so well,\" Amber winked. \"So you'll do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack sighed. \"Well, I can't just let you be in the class alone. Sure, I'll do it, but you'd better throw some good shifts my way for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got it,\" Amber smiled, walking with Jack into a room off to the side of the gym. It was covered in posters with diagrams of pregnant women at various stages, some with cross-sections showing the uterus and whatnot. And, of course, there were plenty of pregnant women in the room, most of them wearing outfits similar to Amber's. They were talking, joking, patting each other's bellies. Some even came up and talked to Amber briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow, they really think she's been pregnant all this time</i>, Jack thought. <i>Then why isn't it like that for Jessica</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright moms, get ready,\" said a woman at the front of the class room. Like the other women, she was heavily pregnant, but she was just wearing a black top that did nothing to cover her belly, which to Jack, looked like it might be carrying twins. To term. As she spoke to the room, Amber nudged Jack softly and walked him to a soft mat where the two of them sat down. Amber crossed her legs, her belly taking up her entire lap. \"To start off today, let's just do some assisted deep breaths.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other women and their partners started to stir and Amber turned her back to Jack. \"Put your hands on my back and press down,\" she said, blindly reaching for one of his hands. \"I need to stretch out and then you're going to breathe steadily at the same pace as the woman at the front and I'll follow along. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, okay,\" Jack said, putting his hands nervously on Amber's back. Her tank top didn't cover much around her shoulders, so his fingers went right on her warm, pale skin. Then he pushed gently until she was bent down about as much as the other women. Then, the pregnant woman and the front of the room started taking deep breaths, which Jack repeated. Amber followed his breathing pattern, but as she started lagging behind, he leaned in, figuring it would be easier to hear him and follow along. From her back, he felt her chuckle, and sure enough, she started breathing at the right tempo. After a few minutes of this, Amber turned around as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check out any of the other women while I had my back turned?\" Amber murmured, grinning at Jack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushed. \"What? No, of course not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? Some really nice, big bellies here. Especially Trisha in the front,\" Amber said back. \"Go ahead and get some eyes-full. It's not like we're in a committed relationship.\" Amber winked again before giving Jack her arms. \"Now hold onto my wrists. Same thing, but I'm stretching the other way now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack held onto her hands, they put their feet together and Amber stretched forward and breathed with Jack. As she was bent down, her full cleavage was totally exposed to Jack, who had a hard time not looking. And, every now and then, he would sneak a peek of the class's apparent instructor, Trisha, and her huge belly. Jack didn't know what it was, but he got a hypnotic feeling from watching her bouncing, dancing, round belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those shorts don't hide much,\" Amber whispered gleefully. Jack looked down and saw his erection clearly showing through the baggy fabric of the athletic shorts. As he looked down, Amber laughed, causing some of the other people in the class to look over. \"Hey, it's okay. You don't even have to tell me if it was me or not who gave you that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're supposed to be doing your breathings,\" Jack whispered back, agitated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you,\" Amber said, resuming the gentle pattern of deep breaths coming from Trisha. When they were done, Amber leaned back up and patted Jack on the shoulder. \"But, hey...thanks for being here to help me. I really do appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're welcome,\" Jack said, shaking his shoulders and adding. \"I mean, you know, no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber giggled again and turned her back to Jack again. \"Now, don't freak out,\" she said as she scooted back and leaned against Jack. He shifted around nervously as Amber moved his hands to hold onto her arms. \"Don't worry, for the next one you're just counting my breaths...I don't even mind that it's rubbing against me right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack turned bright red and started to speak as Trisha yelled \"and go\" and Amber began taking lots of quick, short breaths. Jack nervously started counting, until he got to 50 and Amber stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Jack,\" she said, patting Jack on the leg. \"Ready to do it again? Not too much stress for a frail guy like you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm fine,\" Jack said quietly as Trisha had the women start to do their breathing again. As Jack got to 45, he heard a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Jack</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistracted, he missed the final number. Amber turned around with a weirded-out look as she slowly stood up, using one arm on the ground to support herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay there?\" she asked, grabbing a big, round rubber ball and sitting on it. \"Next is just a birth ball, okay? Not too much work for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine,\" Jack said, distracted by the voice in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Jack!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack absently reached into his pocket, and past his car key he found a slim metal object in his fingers. <i>It can't be...</i> he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't help it. Jack knew by now what would happen when he flipped this coin, but it was useless to try and fight it now. He flipped the coin, looking at Amber, with a few other women, including Trisha, possibly caught in his line of sight as well.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack caught the coin, smiling side up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa,\" Amber mumbled, gripping onto Jack's wrists for support. Her belly began to expand, just like he'd seen it do for Tara. Her exercise tank top seemed to be able to handle the growth, still covering much of her belly, but a creamy slice of underbelly was definitely there and hard to ignore. \"Here, help me out, won't you Jack? I know you're not thrilled about being here, but at least don't let me fall. It's hard sitting on the birth ball with two full grown babies inside me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two?\" Jack said, staring at Amber now much-larger belly. \"You're carrying twins?\" Amber rolled her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did this at work yesterday. Yes, Jack, I'm pregnant with twins,\" Amber said with a scoff and a grin. Moving one of her hands, she lifted her tank top to reveal her full, bare belly. In the process, Jack's hand was rubbed all across her swollen middle. It was creamy and soft and Jack couldn't help but blush. His first time rubbing a bare pregnant belly and it...felt great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoo, alright moms, let's do some channelled breathing exercises to wrap the day up,\" Trisha said from the front of the stage. Jack looked over at the class's instructor, still inexplicably drawn to looking at her and her unexposed belly. Now, to his surprise, she was also much bigger than before! From his estimates, her belly size was just about on par with Tara's triplet belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, help me down, will ya?\" Amber said, covering her belly back up. Jack leaned in to help her roll off the ball, the size of her maternal middle making it that she had to <u>literally</u> roll off. As she slumped down, Jack grabbed her belly and hips as she sat back down. \"Hey now, where are you grabbing at?\" Amber grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked away embarrassed. \"So what's this next thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just breathe deep and try and relax. It's good for the baby, it's good for me when I have to deliver in a few weeks, so on, so forth,\" she said, closing her eyes and breathing in slowly. Then, after about a minute of inhalation, she released, her breasts, even bigger than before, sighing back down. This, Jack felt less strange about being aroused by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she started her next breath, Amber cracked one eye open. \"Most partners...put their hands on the woman's belly at this point,\" she said quietly. Sure enough most of the other groups (most of them looking like married couples) had their hands on pregnant bellies. Gingerly, Jack placed both of his hands on Amber's belly. She slowly put her hands on top of his and took in a slow breath, this one even deeper than before. Jack didn't notice it, his eyes glued to Amber's belly, but she now had the faint curl of a smile on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really tight,\" Jack said quietly. Amber giggled as she let out her breath. \"What does it, um, feel like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heavy and full,\" Amber said, taking in a breath. After a minute, she released it again. \"But kind of good. I can feel the babies resting inside. When they move, I can sort of sense where they are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" Jack said, relaxing his hands against her belly as Amber took another big breath. He couldn't help but look at Trisha again, who was sitting in the same cross-legged position as the rest of the women, only her hands were eagerly rubbing her own belly. \"Is Trisha carrying triplets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, crazy, huh?\" Amber said, opening one eye. \"You're not going to leave me here and run off with her, are you? I know you like pregnant bellies, so bigger must be better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't-\" Jack said in a hushed, annoyed tone, before looking back at Amber. \"I'm not going to leave you. I'm your partner and I'm helping you out. B-besides, you're just as nice as she is. It's not all about having a...big belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Amber said, trying to hold back a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...you have a prettier face,\" Jack said, feeling his face get warm. \"And, you know, I know you personally. You like to have a good time and joke around and that's...fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber's smile slowly faded and, without warning, she rested her head down on Jack's shoulders. She held it there and Jack kept his hands on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Jack,\" she finally said as the class ended. \"You're so dumb, but you can be sweet sometimes.\" Amber picked her head up. \"Thanks for helping me out.\" Then, she winked, put her hands on the floor and stood herself up. \"See you at the store. I'll be sending out the schedule tomorrow. I think you'll like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was speechless. He watched the women and their partners walk toward the door, most of them heading for the women's locker room. Jack stood up and walked to his own locker room, changing out of his gym clothes. It hadn't exactly been a work-out, but boy was he sweaty. Jack wet his towel in the sink and just gave his face and armpits a quick wash before heading out the door to his car. As he drove, he reached into his pocket and dumped the Coin into the tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have expected it, in retrospect,\" Jack said. \"I have a feeling I won't be rid of you for a while. But until then, I've really got to be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack pulled into his driveway, he saw his mom and Faye walk over, both laughing over some private joke or comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey buddy, glad you got home. Faye and I were about to head out ourselves,\" Amanda said. Jack nodded silently and handed his mother the car key, trying not to look at her (or Faye's, for that matter) new, pregnant bump. As his mother got into the car and closed the door, Faye turned to Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how was that date yesterday?\" she asked with an eager smile. Jack chuckled to be polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it was fine, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm dying to hear all about it,\" Faye said. \"I haven't heard of any of Jack Jr.'s romantic exploits. Come over sometime and we'll have a nice, long talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack felt a shudder run through him. Faye giggled and waved her hand, walking around to the passenger seat. Jack had seen her look better and better since she announced she was pregnant (although she had always been pretty good looking, to be honest) but today it was like she'd transformed hugely. Her skin shone more, everything was perky, even her hair looked better. And Jack could hardly ignore that her breasts had increased in size too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as thoughts of her pregnant belly crept into his head, Jack darted back inside to finally crack open Zombie Massacre Mania 2.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>- - - Now: At The House - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack Dale Jr had only one thought going through his head at this exact moment: Zombie Massacre Mania 2. <br>\r\nHe needed to kill digital undead. His soul yearned and his body ached to be a washed in the 1080P glory of green zombie blood as he slaughtered the horrid abominations of Dr. Zomtox that he has unleashed upon the world once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharging up the stairs, he threw his dirty duffle bag aside, fired up his GameBox, carefully removed his copy of Zombie Massacre Mania 2 from it's oversized collector's edition box, put the disc in the tray, closed it, and fired up the installation process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing the installing the game would take a few minutes, Jack decided that now would be a good time for a shower after that... workout session with Amber. Probably a cold one; a very long, very cold shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack left the room, throwing his dirty gym clothes into his overflowing hamper, he went into the bathroom to take his shower. However, as he was off, signing along badly to a popular rock song on the radio during his shower, he didn't notice the coin, very similar to the one to the one that he gave his friend Ian, and identical to the one that was currently resting in the tray in his car that his mother was currently driving, appeared on his dresser again with a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExactly 15 minutes and 24 seconds later, Jack entered back into his room, fully refreshed, dressed to lounge, and ready for some full on Zombie Massacre Mania 2. As he picked up his controller, which was laying on his dresser, he didn't notice that the coin had appeared again on the dresser, as he was too engrossed by the opening CGI video depicting several busty blondes and redheads blasting away at zombies, while another muscle bound hero, chopping away the hordes of the undead with a circular saw that had been grafted on his body in place of a left hand. This particular character was hacking with one hand, and shooting at zombies with an UZI with his other, shouting \"Funky\" all the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down into his big comfy gaming chair, he pressed the start button, and looked for his friend Ian online. It only took a matter of moments before a little pop-up bubble told him that XX_IAN_DA_KING_OF_ALL_XX wanted to start a new game. With a smile of his face, Jack accepted that request , and a mere seconds later, would wish that he hadn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell have you been?! I have been waiting for over an hour! We get one of what's certain to be the greatest games of all time, and I'm all ready to go slaughter some undead hellions while staring at the very fine and shapely curves of my female zombie slayer that I created, whom I'm lovingly and jokingly calling \"Future Ex-Wife #3\", and you're just doing what - - - \" Ian asks, chastising his friend over the gaming headphone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was - - - uh\" Jack tried to choose his next words carefully, knowing that Ian, while being his best friend, could sometimes have a screw or two come loose upstairs when it comes to certain things, delaying of video game playing of hot new release games on release day being one of them.  \"I was at the gym\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan let out a huge sigh. \"Man is this about the fat thing I said earlier? Man I was just kidding, there's no need\" Ian was interrupted by Jack.<br>\r\n\"It's not like that. I'm on my way home from seeing Jessica\" Jack explained, creating his hero on the character creation screen, creating an overly buff, action-movie hero version of himself, whom he dubbed \"Jack Slayer\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, whoa. You went to see Jessica? Man, what did I tell you? You don't mess around with a chick whose going to have kid. Next thing you know she's going to try to pin that thing on you. She's just some chick who could keep her - - - BANG\" Ian was cut off by a loud gun going off in the game, followed by the words \"PLAYER JACK SLAYER HAS BETRAYED MS. FOXXXY. MS. FOXXXY IS BLEEDING OUT\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL MAN?\" Ian was screaming on the other end of the head-set. \"I told you, DON'T TALK ABOUT JESSICA LIKE THAT\" Jack said sternly. \"She's going through some seriously heavy stuff right now, and it's all my fault. So now you apologize, or so help me, I'll let your character bleed out, and you'll have to wait 48 hours until you can make a new character\" Jack wagered with his friend, citing the new \"Permadeath Lock-Out\" feature that was enabled whenever a player chose to play the game on \"Zombie Apocalypse\" difficulty, which, like true gaming gods, Ian and Jack did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on..\" Ian complained, watching Ms. FOXXXY life bar slowly drain as she bled out on the sidewalk of the starting area. <br>\r\n\"Do it Ian. So help me..\" Jack insisted. \"Alright fine. I'm an ass, and I take back everything I said about Jessica. There happy?\" Ian said, almost not even meaning it. \"No, but it's close enough of an apology I'm going to get from you. Let me heal you up\" Jack said, pressing a button on his controller to use a med-kit on his friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waste of a perfectly good med kit. Anyways, why were you at the gym?\" Ian asked, watch his character get healed.<br>\r\n\"Amber texted me, turns out she needed a lamaze partner and - - - \" Jack was stopped by an burst of nearly hysterical laughter. <br>\r\n\"It's not funny. So help me, I'll shoot you again\" Jack said, readying his fire button finger. <br>\r\n\"Sorry, sorry. Please continue\" Ian said, his character getting back up from the ground, and the two digital avatars of Ian and Jack start the game proper and begin their quest to save the world from Dr. Zomtox. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack continued his story, going into every conceivable detail about what happened between him and Jessica, him and his mother, and what happened at the gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - Now: At The Mall - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amanda pulled into the parking space (with some great difficulty, her pregnant belly was making driving more difficult than she remembered), she stopped her pregnancy related gab-session with Faye as she noticed a fleet of ambulances parked outside of the west entrance of the mall. The paramedics were examining what appeared to be several different pregnant women of various ages and race, each woman having a very worried look on their faces, and, stranger still, to Amanda at least, what appeared to be several very overweight men, stethoscopes being run across the large midsections of said men, fear and terror in the men's faces, confusion and disbelief on the faces of the EMT's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think happened here\" Amanda asked, heaving herself and her four occupants out of the car, holding onto the door frame, which made her thrust her belly forward, making her appear even larger than before, if that was even possible. <br>\r\n\"People probably got sick from that terrible food they serve at Chicken Shack. I ate their once, was sick for nearly two weeks. I swear, you hire sixteen year old to cook fast food, and they can't even do that right sometimes.\" Faye says, heaving herself out of the car, just like Amanda did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think we should go see what's up?\" Amanda says, craning her neck over the crowd of people who have gathered to check out this most.. unusual scene. \"Nah, I gotta pee like a pregnant woman\" Faye says, a smile on her face, bemused by her own cleverness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the bathroom sounds like a great idea.\" Amanda says, rubbing her midsection. They close and lock the car, and then waddle off towards the south entrance, unaware of the several local news trucks that were pulling up to report of the incidents that just happened an hour earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n= = = A Short Time Later: The House = = = <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then I found the coin in my pocket dude!\" Jack said, laying down the law on some undead hordes with Killamtronic 9000 in the game, scoring over 10,000 EXP. \"Oh not this coin thing again dude!\" Ian sighs on the other end of his headset. <br>\r\n\"Yes! I tell you man! I think this coin has somehow found it's way back to me dude. I used it again, and Amber and several other woman became more pregnant!\" Jack said, killing zombies. <br>\r\n\"I hate repeating myself, so I'm just going to say this: Your story is a lie and you're a liar for lying. I have the coin you gave me, right now. There is no possible way in the universe that you can have it - - - OH YEAH, ULTIMATE ZOMBIE KILLSTREAK! BRING IN THE AC-130!\" Ian screams into his headset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I..\" Jack says trying to explain. \"No butts dude. I'm telling you, I'm looking at right now. Unless your \"pregnancy coin\" as you claim it to be, can magically duplicate itself, your imagining things again, probably to cover up your feeling about women in Amber's... condition; and if I can be frank dude, that's weird\" Ian says, the echoes of his AC-130 zombie killing power-up echoing over his words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have a thing for women in that.... condition\" Jack says defensively. \"Hey man, whatever floats your boat. I'm not one to judge about things like that\" Ian says. \"But what I can judge you on is that your cuckoo banana crazy insane man imagining a magic coin that gets people pregnant. I can judge you on that\" Ian says smugly. \"Whoa, look out bud, Goliath Zombie right behind you! Get down!\" Ian yells into his headset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hit it with the flamethrower!\" Jack yells, jamming the buttons and twisting the sticks on his controller.<br>\r\n\"Way ahead of you. EAT FIREY FLAMLY TOASTY DEATH ZOMBIE SCUM!\" Ian yells.</span></div></div>",

Jessica's name popped up. <i>Oh God</i>, Jack thought. <i>What's happening to her now?</i> He wanted to talk to her now but he'd learned better by this point not to tell Ian the intimate details of his new, crazy life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ian, pause for a minute,\" Jack said, hitting the controller's START button to freeze the game. \"I've got to take a piss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I might as well do the same,\" Ian said. Their headsets went mute as Jack quickly picked up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica! Are you okay? Is everything-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn on the news,\" Jessica said in a dead voice. Jack walked downstairs to the living room and flipped on the TV, switching to the local channel. A big BREAKING NEWS banner was emblazoned across the bottom, reading \"Mysterious Disease Break-Out at Southlyne Mall.\" He turned it on just as the anchor, the beautiful and busty Mia Vasquez, was describing the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;-Mall, as dozens of women have reported either sudden nausea or severe abdominal swelling. But what's even more bizarre is that, by these women own conclusion and according to some of the medical personnel who have treated these women, they appear to have become suddenly pregnant.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera cut to one woman, sitting by an ambulance, a perfectly round pregnant belly in her lap. She was struggling to cover it with her shirt, which was clearly not meant to be used as a maternity blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;I was just walking, feeling fine, and then boom, I got this big belly and I start feeling kicking inside me. The medics estimated that I'm eight months pregnant! I haven't even had sex in a year!&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe TV started showing B-roll of pregnant women walking around the mall, looking concerned or confused as Mia's voice continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Medics do not yet have any explanation, but the local hospital has sent over its mobile pre-natal center to try and help the situation. What we've also noticed is that there were already an abnormally high number of pregnant women at the mall when this occurred.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera cut to another woman who had an enormous belly, again, clearly not wearing maternity clothes. Part of her fabric and pants were actually torn, but she seemed content, rubbing her belly absentmindedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;No, I've been carrying these twins inside me for about seven months now. But I was walking past the food court when I started noticing all of these pregnant women freaking out and grabbing their bellies. And then I saw one woman's belly suddenly pop out and scream! I love being pregnant, but I can imagine how scary it must be for it to suddenly happen.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Mia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;One additional strange thing is that men, although in smaller numbers, appear to have been affected by the same affliction as these women who became suddenly pregnant. Some men reported sudden nausea, while others reported got swollen abdomens and were treated by medics. While we have heard confirmation from some medics that at least one man is confirmed pregnant, none of these men would speak with reporters.&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Jack, flip me!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes glued to the TV, Jack didn't even think to stop himself from fishing the coin from his pocket, where it suddenly transported itself. Flipping it, it landed on heads, and Mia Vasquez's black, professional dress got a little tighter, as the clear impression of a pregnant belly began to swell forward. The fabric of the dress was thin and silky, so a dimpled belly button was visible against the fabric. Her already ample and visible cleavage swelled some more, mushing up through her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, did you see that?\" Jessica asked on the other end. Jack saw the coin in his hand and freaked out, tossing it onto the coffee table. It landed on heads, and Mia's belly and breasts grew yet again. \"You were right, people are just suddenly becoming pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Jack said, waiting to tell her about how the reporter on screen got to where she is. \"This is bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm more willing to hear about that magic coin theory of yours,\" Jessica said. \"Were you at the mall with it today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I was at the mall today,\" Jack said absently. \"But I didn't flip it at all when I was there. In fact, that's where I gave it away to one of my friends. He said he'd get rid of it.\" Jack paused. \"But...I still found it in my pocket later in the day. And, believe me, it was still working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got more people pregnant with the coin?\" Jessica said, a kind of pity in her voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...it has a kind of power over me, I don't know how to explain it. It <b>makes</b> me flip it. L-like just now, it made me flip it for this reporter on TV.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica paused. \"Okay, so...if you made that happen, and they haven't said anything about new pregnancies breaking out, then...what happened there already happened. Maybe something happened while you were there with the coin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was slightly distracted by Mia rubbing her own belly and talking with the anchors back in the studio. They were remarking how it was ironic that they sent their pregnant reporter to cover this story. \"Um, no, all I did was give it to my friend and then leave.\" Then Jack sighed and rubbed his temples. \"But, Ian's kind of a moron, so I wouldn't put it past him to just flip the coin a bunch of times after I told him not to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well, try and get that coin back from him,\" Jessica said. \"I'm starting to believe it can do what you said. I mean, I'm living proof of that, huh?\" Jack swallowed nervously. \"But I'd rather someone who knows the bad stuff the coin can do have it instead of someone who doesn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right,\" Jack said. \"Wow, you're pretty quick to figure these situations out. We make a pretty good team.\" He smiled to himself before adding. \"A-are you okay, by the way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica laughed and snorted. \"Yes, for the last time, I'm fine. I think I can manage being three months pregnant until we figure this whole thing out. Talk to you later.\" Jessica hung up on the phone and Jack continued to watch the TV screen, image after image of pregnant bellies waddling in front of his face. After a while, he remember that he had Ian on hold and stood up to leave, his erection pressing painfully against his pants as he got up. Jack decided not to think more about this for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ian, you there?\" Jack said, his headset back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm here. Geez, how much did you have to drink? You were gone for a while,\" Ian said back as they unpaused the game and watched the digital zombies slowly burn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to help my dad out with a...shelf,\" Jack said, tapping the keys quickly. \"By the way, you said you still have that coin, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I do,\" Ian said, his sexy avatar throwing a grenade at a mutated, hulking zombie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm going to need it back,\" Jack said. \"It turns out it belonged to my great-grandpa, so it's an heirloom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, dude. You told me not to give it back to you and as crazy as you are, believing it's magic or whatever, I don't think it's a good idea for the two of you to be together. Besides, that was a shitty lieDUDE, SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT!\" The hulking zombie from before tackled Jack's macho man, killing him. Ms. Foxxxy was preoccupied by a swarm of zombies slowly closing around her, until-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PLAYER MS. FOXXXY IS DOWN. PLAYER JACK SAVAGE IS DOWN. GAME OVER\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" Ian said. \"Damn, this game is tough, but it's fun. Want to go again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Jack said, restarting. \"Oh, it's showing the 'create a character' page again, what's happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to find one with better healing stats,\" Ian said. \"This one's fast, but your's has enough firepower that I'd rather balance it out with healing.\" Ian scrolled through avatar's until he started laughing on the other end. \"Oh, dude, I think I found the perfect one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan selected the \"Pregnant Survivor\" character, a chiseled, sexy woman with a swollen pregnant belly, not at all covered by her frayed camouflage tank-top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ian, c'mon man, that's not funny,\" Jack said, starting to shake a little nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, Jack,\" Ian said in an exaggerated voice. \"Look at how good this one's medic stats are. It would be wrong for me <b>not</b> to choose this one.\" A green frame wrapped around the character and Ian typed his \"Ms. Foxxxy\" name into her slot. \"Alright, now we can start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate you,\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- Amanda Dale ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda and Faye strolled through the mall, noticing all of the pregnant women, both worried and not. They even passed by the now-pregnant Mia Vasquez, her cameraman following behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we came on the right day,\" Faye joked, bumping her belly against Amanda's. Amanda smiled politely and rubbed her own belly. She couldn't help but think about the women outside. They were saying they had suddenly and mysteriously become pregnant. Well, wasn't it the same for her? It's just been a little more gradual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where did you want to go?\" Amanda said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye smiled back. \"Oh, don't worry. I've got a whole day planned.\"</span></div></div>",

Just keep staring at Ms. Foxxxy's luscious curves, I know you want to\" Ian said jokingly. <br>\r\n\"I'm going to come to your house and kick your face into jelly if you don't cut the crap Ian\" Jack said defensively, desperately trying to get the subject away from women who happened to be, as the said in the old days \"in the family way\". <br>\r\n\"Dude, chillax man. Your denials are really starting to get weird. You know Bill Shakesman once wrote \"The lady doth protest to much\" Ian said, trying to sound intelligent but failing miserably. <br>\r\n\"That was William Shakespeare, moron\" Jack said, laying down covering fire, trying to evacuate a group of survivors from the waves of zombies quickly approaching them.<br>\r\n\"Whatever\" Ian said on the other end of the microphone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - Now: At The Mall - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The whole day planned? So what's first?\" Amanda asked, putting her hands on the sides of her gravid life dome. <br>\r\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t mean to be katty, but you need new clothes. badly\u201d Faye said, looking at Amanda\u2019s Dale \u201cmaternity\u201d apparel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda was wearing a plan blue ladies t-shirt, that given her current condition, was a size or three too small.  It tightly hugged every single one of her many maternal curves, showing that this clearly over 50 woman was pregnant. A generous helping of belly hung out from the hemline of her shirt, while a pair of white pants hung the underside of her belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile not high fashion, it had high function for the time being as Amanda Dale continued on her journey towards motherhood for a second time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with what I\u2019m wearing?\u201d Amanda asked, looking at her \u201cmaternity\u201d clothes as though they had some kind of stain on them or something.  \u201cI mean, it\u2019s the best I can do for right now before my husband can take me back to the storage shed where I have all my old maternity clothes.\u201d Amanda said, resting her hands ontop of her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye snickered. \u201cWow, really? You have all your old maternity clothes? You didn\u2019t <br>\r\n throw them out when you realized the 1980\u2019s weren\u2019t coming back?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Amanda said almost defensively. \u201cLook, Amanda, it\u2019s the 21st Century. We have phones that allow us to surf the internet in the middle of the desert while playing any of the 10,000 songs we load onto it. We have hybrid cars, HDTV\u2019s, and cloud computing, I don\u2019t think now is the time to go back to your oversized\u2026 I\u2019m going to be generous and say \u201cPoison\u201d T-Shirt. \u201c Faye said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t \u2018POISION\u2019 Faye\u2026 It was REO Speedwagon\u201d Amanda said, almost ashamed to correct her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye let out another snicker. \u201cThe point is Amanda,  we\u2019re in age now with designer maternity wear; clothes that are meant to emphasis our growing bodies, flaunt it even. We don\u2019t have to hide behind oversized dresses and large coats, now we can dress provocatively as we want, because the truth it\u2026 men love it. \u201c Faye said as a smile crossed her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure about all this Faye? I don\u2019t mean to sound like a total.. you know what..\u201d Amanda said, trying to cover up her own language. \u201cBut, you don\u2019t really have the most experience with all of.. this\u201d Amanda said, circling her belly her hand for emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCruel but fair. But alas, when you were as desperate as I was to get pregnant\u201d Faye said, covering her midsection with her hands, almost afraid that someone was going to try to take it away from her \u201cI followed every maternity trend, every parenting tip, everything and anything related to pregnancy and child-raising just in case, just in case, this was the one time\u201d Faye said, a slight tear, thinking about all the times that all of her could be\u2019s would become shan\u2019t be\u2019s and how this last chance for her became a will be, four times over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, hey, hey\u201d Amanda said, comforting her pregnant friend and neighbor, \u201cDon\u2019t think about the past. Think about the future, your four little ones\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye dried her eye, and with a smile \u201cAnd yours, as well\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d Amanda said, looking down at her maternal midsection, the words of the pregnant reporter echoing through her head \u201cmysteriously pregnant\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, are we going to stand her all day, or are we going to do some shopping\u201d Faye asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the boss Faye. Apparently you\u2019ve done the research, I\u2019m just the 50-plus pregnant woman along for the ride\u201d Amanda said, following her friend as they walked deeper into the mall, heading to the maternity store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, Faye and Amanda walked (through almost a waddle by now) into L'aspirant \u00e0 la mode, a hip modern store for the expectant mother. The store blared all of the latest pop music songs, while bizarre modern art hung on the walls or played on the TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda took in the scene, and wondered if she made a huge mistake. \u201cUh, Faye?\u201d She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d Faye asked, already beginning to look at all of the very modern, very hip, and very provocative maternity clothes hanging on the racks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, I think I might be a little too old to be shopping here\u201d Amanda said, picking up a very provocative piece of maternity wear off the rack and holding it up, looking at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonsense. If you can still get pregnant, you can still shop here. Now, start grabbing clothes and trying them on, or so help me, I\u2019ll pick what you\u2019re going to wear for the next few months\u201d Faye said, almost threateningly, looking a pair of shorts and a shirt that would do little to cover certain portions of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Amanda said, looking at a pair of trendy hip hugging jeans, and a tight shirt that read \u201cI DID THE DEED\u201d written across the middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Amanda, this is probably going to be your last pregnancy. Dress a little daring, act a little daring. Have fun being pregnant\u201d Faye said, picking out another outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d She said, picking up several outfits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed, as Faye and Amanda picked out several maternity outfits, Faye going for more and more provocative, while Amanda tried to pick out the most conservative outfits she could find. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, in a store like L'aspirant \u00e0 la mode, that was a little tough, especially with Faye watching Amanda\u2019s every move and choice. As Amanda found something that she may have liked, Faye would throw down three especially sexy looking outfits on top of the one she just liked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost like something out a movie. A younger woman (although not by much) showing an older woman how to be \u201chip\u201d, \u201ctrendy\u201d, and \u201csexy\u201d; all it needed was a catchy pop song playing over the time it took as Faye watched Amanda try on outfit after outfit, each becoming more and more hip until Faye finally approved of something Amanda picked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, time passed and Amanda quickly found herself with several bags full of clothes attached to her arms. Bra\u2019s, underwear, pajamas, shirts, pants, everything a growing woman might need. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhew. I can\u2019t believe I bought all that\u201d Amanda said, looking through all her bags. The clothes she bough where more provocative then she would have liked, but as Faye constantly told her \u201cIf you\u2019ve got it flaunt it\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwo more things you\u2019ll need Amanda\u201d Faye said with a devious smile on her face, and her hands behind her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no. Now what?\u201d Amanda said, slightly annoyed, almost afraid of what need madness her friend Faye will visit onto her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her devious smile firmly glued onto her face, Faye slowly revealed what was behind her back; a pair of very sexy lingerie and a black-and-hot pink two-piece swimsuit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lingerie was a two-piece set of blue garters, which were attached to a skimpy blue lower half, which were then attached by blue straps to the bra, which was lacy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. No. No. No. No\u201d was all Amanda could say, pointing at Faye\u2019s sick attempt at humor. \u201cOh come on Amanda, lighten up. You\u2019re pregnant, not dead.\u201d Faye said, putting the two items onto the check-out counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not wearing those\u2026 things. It\u2019s bad enough what you convinced me to get now.. but those two things? No way.\u201d Amanda said, crossing her arms like a stubborn child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, if I told you once, I told you a hundred times today, if you\u2019ve got it, flaunt it. Amanda, you\u2019re a beautiful woman, and you\u2019re even more beautiful now, stop being so afraid of what everything will think. So your over the hill and have a bun or four in the oven? What\u2019s it to them? Why should you have to hide because of what they think? Take charge, and show them. Show them that at over 50 your still so crafty you can make people. Take this - - - \u201c Faye said, jamming the lingerie in Amanda\u2019s almost already full arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd tonight, remind your husband how you got pregnant in the first place.  Enjoy your next few months of intimacy by wearing this almost every night and go wild! You\u2019re a woman who has needs! Fulfill them!\u201d Faye said,  firing up Amanda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd take this\u201d Faye said,  holding up the two-piece bikini \u201cAnd get some sun. The gym has this great pregnancy swimming class! You and I are going to go together. And you know what? Take your family out to the beach or to a water park or something, and rock this thing girl. Make women jealous and men lustful. Take your husband and your son and spend some time together as a family of three before you guys become a family of seven.\u201d Faye commanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right\u201d Amanda said, slamming the lingerie and the bikini on the check-out counter, pulling out her credit card, and saying \u201cTwo more things\u201d. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Amanda was feeling more relieved and relaxed, not just because she found some trendy if not provocative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, here we are\u201d Faye said, stopping outside the massive, massive two-level store known as Baby Universe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope everything isn\u2019t sold out.. I mean, you heard that new reporter when we came in\u201d Amanda said, looking at a surprising number of pregnant women who seemed to making Baby Universe their temporary home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t tell me you believe all that nonsense?\u201d Faye said, rubbing her belly whilst looking at her friend.  \u201cAmanda, you and I both know, from experience that women only get pregnant ONE WAY. Not from any kind of mysterious outbreak the news media can cook up in order to drive up viewers.\u201d Faye said as she walked towards the store, passing a giant stand that read \u201cSIGN UP FOR THE 101.9 Pregnant Bikini Contest, hosted by Sandwich and Oven in the Mornings! Big Bellies, Big Prizes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda followed, continuing the conversation. \u201cWhat on Earth are you talking about Faye?\u201d They entered the store, and began to look around, making their way the crowded store, bumping into shelves and bellies, trying to get everything they might need for the new additions to their families. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the internet. People can get access to news 24/7 now on their phone or tablets, so the news media make up these stories to scare people into watching so they can make money off of ad revenue\u201d Faye said, picking up some baby related objects, fawning over them, before putting it back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean think about how ridicules that story sounded Amanda? It breaks all the laws of known reality.  I mean, did you even hear that reporter? She said they confirmed a MAN to be pregnant. Men don\u2019t have babies Amanda, if they did, trust me, I would have made sure my husband did all the work if you know what I mean\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess your right\u201d Amanda said, putting some baby items into her basket. This was the second time today that Faye had managed to convince her that Faye\u2019s opinion was correct, however, in this instance, Faye was unaware of how wrong she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemed to fly as Amanda and Faye scoured the store, picking up almost everything they could ever need. Diapers, boxes of them, adorable pieces of baby clothes, although Amanda thought that she should find out what she was having, as she thought it was wasteful to buy four of every color. Amanda filled up one shopping cart, and then another, and then another, lost in a daze of maternal shopping bliss, \"Awwing\" at every tiny piece of clothing, every tiny little soft toy, every little thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her, it had been so very long since she had last done this. Now, her she was, when most women would be retiring and spoiling their grandchildren, she was planning on welcoming four new members into her family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding up a little blue onesie that read \"Mommy's Little Brat\", she looked at it closely for a few minutes, wondering if she should add it, when something caught her eye. Well, it wasn\u2019t something, but rather someone, which happened to be,  at least according to Amanda, a severely overweight man holding small pink clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amanda watched the man for a few moments, the man was constantly trying to decide between the pink one in his left hand, and the pink one in his right, while occasionally rubbing his very vast midsection, muttering something under his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at his stomach, Amanda could have sword she say it move, but it was hidden away behind a large oversized black shirt that hugged that man\u2019s midsection, making it appear firm and round, not fat and flabby.  It was almost like he was preg\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda shook her head, and turned around, drawing her attention away from the man, who looked out Amanda, and then turned away to find some privacy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEverything okay Amanda?\u201d Faye asked, staring at Amanda who looked like she\u2019s just seen a ghost. \u201cYeah, I thought I saw something, must have been the light playing tricks on me\u201d Amanda answered; trying to push away what she knew was impossible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her attention back to shopping, and loaded up another cart. After what seemed like hours of shopping, Amanda was exhausted, and her carts were full. She made her way to the check-out counter, ready to pay for the mountains of  baby products.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour husband is probably going to kill you\u201d Faye said, as she helped Amanda unload all of her carts. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I have something for him tonight that will calm him down if you know what I mean\u201d Amanda said, rattling the bag of lingerie, with a knowing smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs all of this going to fit in the car?\u201d Faye asked. Looking over her purchases of maternity wear and baby supplies, Amanda might have to admit that she may a went a way bit to far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s okay, whatever doesn\u2019t fit in your car, you can have delivered to the house with the cribs\u201d The young pretty (and slightly) pregnant clerk behind the counter said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Amanda asked. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s part of the deal. We\u2019re offering discounted delivery on all purchases over a certain amount, which, you\u2019ve clearly exceeded by generous amount\u201d The clerk said, tapping the price total of the register, and almost giving Amanda a heart attack looking at the price. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whistle could be heard somewhere back in the line, which just caused Amanda to look down to her midsection and said \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re coming when Mommy and Daddy have all the money for all this stuff.\u201d She gave her belly a pat and finished her transaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter filling out all the forms, and loading up all the bags of maternity clothes and what bags of baby stuff she thinks she could fit in the car, she and Faye, (who chose to have everything delivered as opposed to try and fight for space in the car) made their way out of the store and back to the parking lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, same to you too! Nice mouth for a woman who\u2019s going to be a mom!\u201d A young thirty something man with short hair, a goatee, and a slim build said, holding up a sign that read \u201c101.9 THE EDGE Pregnant Bikini Contest Sign-Ups\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns his attention away from the woman he was talking too, and turns his attention to Faye and Amanda. <br>\r\n\u201cWell hello there ladies, my name is Ryan \u201cOven\u201d Marsters. Prehaps you\u2019ve heard of me? I\u2019m the co-host of the Morning Madness with Sandwich &amp; Oven in the morning. Maybe you\u2019ve heard of us?\u201d The man called Oven said, raising an eyebrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh not really\u201d Amanda said, trying not to offend the man named \u201cOven\u201d, \u201cBut you listen to The Edge right? The leading rock and alt station? We\u2019ve got The Edge over the competition\u201d Oven said, trying to sell the station in his usual DJ voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know my son listens to your station\u201d Amanda said, trying to get out of this conversation as soon as it starts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell hey, your kid\u2019s got great taste, but I\u2019m not hear about that. I\u2019m hear to talk to you about 101.9 The Edge special event: Miss Stork\u2019s Pregnant Bikini Contest at Dino\u2019s Bar and Grill, and we\u2019re looking for contestants to enter, grand prize winner gets a cash prize of $9,000 dollars.\u201d Oven says holding out a sign up form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, no thanks\u201d Faye says, about to leave when Amanda takes the form. <br>\r\n\u201cSo tell me all about this\u201d Amanda says looking over the form. <br>\r\n\u201cAmanda? What?\u201d Faye says shocked. <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one telling me to be adventurous and free during my pregnancy. This looks like just the thing I need. If you\u2019ve got it, flaunt it, right\u201d Amanda says, turning her words back onto Faye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat. So the contest is 5 days from now at Dino\u2019s Bar and Grill. There\u2019s three sections to the contest: The standard bikini phase, where you introduce yourself and we get a look at you, you walk down the cat walk that kind of thing. Section two is the talent portion, show off some kind of awesome talent you can do while pregnant, and section three is the dance off, best pregnant dancer wins; you can do any type of dance you want, twerk, standard, pole..\u201d Oven continues explaining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPole dancing?\u201d Amanda asks, raising an eyebrow. <br>\r\n\u201cYup. After that, we tally up the scores and the best pregnant woman wins, $9,000 dollars cash money, and a private photo session with the best photographer in town to be the new model for 101.9\u2019s colander next year, all while pregnant of course.\u201d Oven says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny why are you doing this?\u201d Faye asks, looking over the form herself. <br>\r\n\u201cThese kind of things get huge ratings, I have no idea why.\u201d Oven states. <br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it ratings?\u201d Amanda says. <br>\r\n\u201cIf it makes you feel better, you can say we do to support all forms of beauty.\u201d Oven says sarcastically. \u201cSo are you going to sign up or not?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda looked at the form, looked at her clothing bag, and then looked at Faye. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bought it at that sale a few days ago. How did you get it Faye?\" Amanda asked. <br>\r\n\"I don't know. I must have picked it up by accident when I put my house keys in the coin tray in your son's car.\" Faye said looking at it. <br>\r\n\"Huh, that's weird, because I swore he had one just like it on the dresser in his room. I went in their earlier to take care of a few things, when he was out. Must have bough two\" Amanda rationalized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want me to give it back?\" Faye said looking at the coin in her hands. <br>\r\n\"Nah. He's got another one. Keep it. It'll be a memory of our time together today.\" Amanda said sarcastically. <br>\r\nFaye laughed, knowing full well they had plenty of souvenirs from today's shopping trip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda and Faye walked right out of the mall, past the growing number of reporters whom seemed to be gathering outside of the mall, making whatever incident that happened here today, the main story of the night. Mia was back out there, reporting the story again, talking with a paramedic who seemed to be reporting on his findings. Several pregnant women, and one severely overweight man, similar to the one she saw early in the store, were either waiting to be interviewed or being checked out by paramedics or the mobile pre-natal division that were deployed there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda and Faye loaded their (mostly Amanda's) packages into the car, and drove off back towards their homes, after spending several hours in the mall shopping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - Much Later: The House - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this is a good saving spot\" Jack said, trying to get the crick out of his neck. He always knew he should never game of as long as he does, but he needed several hours of mindless zombie violence right now. He had.. a lot on his mind. <br>\r\n\"Oh come on. Wrapping up already? We've only been playing for... wow, that long?\" Ian said on the other end of the microphone. <br>\r\n\"Yeah. It's getting close to dinner time. My Mom and Dad will be home soon. They're really big into these family dinners, since I've been gone for so long\" Jack said. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, well. I think the family dinner is going to continue after your gone Jack. I mean your mom is \" Ian said over the headset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say it. It's bad enough I had to stare at your damn character all day, I don't need any more reminders right now\" Jack said. <br>\r\n\"Look man, I'm not saying anything. Just go to a shrink and get your head examined. Magic coins, expanding bellies, that stuff isn't good for the old brain apartment. \" Ian says before logging off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nXX_IAN_DA_KING_XX is offline, his game console told him as saved his game and powered down. Jack can get back to zombie slaying some later time, right now he had a decision to make. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could stay for dinner with his family, which he always looked forward to, until recent events made the situation weird... Or he could do something else, ditch dinner with his family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't avoid his family forever could he? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack walked downstairs to the family dining room. His father was setting the table, looking over at Jack as he put the plates down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you help your mother bring the food in from the kitchen?\" Jack's father asked, placing the utensils out one-by-one. Jack swallowed and walked into the kitchen in the next room, his mother turned to the stove, putting the finishing touches on each of the meals cooking in the pots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, take this, please,\" his mother said, turning around and handing Jack a pot. As she did, her belly brushed against Jack's hip. It was covered by a bulky apron, so it didn't give off any real sense of size, but it was certainly big enough that she had trouble easily controlling it. \"Whoops,\" Jack's mom chuckled, putting one hand over her belly. \"I guess that'll take some getting used to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" Jack said, taking the food back into the dining room, taking his time before going back in. Each time Jack went back inside, he was careful to avoid his mother's new pregnant bulge, and he would hurry back with the food. Finally, he and his father were done and Jack sat down just as Amanda Dale walked in and removed her apron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye's influence on Amanda was profound, as Jack's mother was wearing a form-fitting maternity blouse. Her full belly size, which made her look about 30 weeks pregnant with just one baby, was pronounced largely and her chest, while fully covered, was also shown off nicely. Jack immediately felt his legs shake beneath the table. His sudden...strange feelings toward pregnant women made his first real sight of his pregnant mother a bizarre sensation. It made him wonder how much bigger she would get, especially with quadruplets, and made him think about Amber, Tara, Faye, Trisha, the pregnant news reporter, and of course, Jessica. Jack also couldn't help but notice that his mother now looked decades younger. She never looked <i>bad</i>, but hell, it was a little hard to recognize her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda ate with a restrained gusto, talking with Jack Sr. as our hero tried to keep his eyes glued to his plate. Eventually, however, he couldn't help but pick up on something interesting in the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-and since Faye's carrying quads too, we could get the same sized clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faye's carrying quadruplets too?\" Jack said with loud surprise. His parents stopped and stared at him before his mother responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" she said, with a little grin. \"Weird, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Jack said, going back to his food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Jack, we both want you to know that the babies coming isn't going to have any impact on you moving out. We don't want you to feel pressured to stay and help,\" his father said. Jack had been planning to move out for months now, when his classes end. Jack nodded and went back to eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it was just like they said on the news,\" his mother continued. \"Pregnant women everywhere, a lot of them freaking out about how big they'd gotten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But isn't that kind of like y-\" Jack's father said before his mother cut him off and shushed him silently, nodding toward Jack. Jack wasn't paying attention but they both nodded and went back to their conversation. As the meal wore on, Jack finished quickly and excused himself, going back to his room and looking around. He didn't feel like playing any more video games and he wanted to get out of the house. He grabbed the keys and headed out the door, yelling across the house to his parents that he was heading out and he'd call when he's coming back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both nodded, finished eating as well and relaxing on the couch. As the door closes, Amanda smiled and sat closer to her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I didn't <i>just</i> buy clothes at the mall,\" she said, pulling her blouse down a little to reveal the lace on her lingerie, as well as an ample eyeful of her swelling breasts. Jack Sr. gulped and looked into his wife's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you want to? Even like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda laughed and moved her lips closer to his. \"Oh, dear, I feel perfectly fine. After...talking with Faye, I'm much more comfortable with this whole pregnancy. And besides, I think I look pretty good pregnant. Better than I've looked in years, wouldn't you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Jack Sr. said with a grin, looking his wife up and down. She groaned and grinned, slapping his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could have agreed in a better way than that,\" she said, looking out the door to see Jack's car leave before she slipped her blouse off, revealing her bare belly and breasts, held in sexy, tiny red lingerie. \"Ready, Jack baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here on the couch?\" he replied, starting to take his shirt off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm too big to be moving around,\" Amanda laughed, throwing herself into her husband's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- Jack Jr. ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack pulled up to Jessica's house, texting her as he stepped out of the car. She texted him back, saying to come on up. Heading upstairs, Jack found Jessica sitting on her bed with a smile, inviting him to come sit next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, crazy day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little,\" Jack said, sighing and sitting down. He told her about the mall, about the coin still coming back, and about finding out about Faye's quadruplet pregnancy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does she look?\" Jessica asked with a grin. \"All young and plastic surgery'd up like your mom suddenly was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Jack nodded. \"Although, she was always kind of...cougary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica fell back on the bed laughing, stopping to look at Jack, then continue laughing. \"Okay, well, that's a nice way of putting it. Any luck getting the other coin back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" Jack said, pausing as he thought about leaving it in the car earlier. He definitely left it there, but...he flipped it during the news broadcast. \"There might actually be a...third coin now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, really?\" Jessica asked. \"Who's got that one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack thought about the only people who would have been in the car. \"Either Faye or...my mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica made a nervous face. \"That's not good. Well, if your mom's got it, that'll probably be easier to get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Jack said, sighing and turning back to Jessica. As their eyes met, Jessica kept smiling, as if trying to encourage Jack to cheer up. He smiled back. \"How have you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I guess,\" Jessica said, looking down at her own small bump. \"I haven't really been freaking out about...this, at least not yet. I dunno, I've just been thinking about other things, doing other stuff. I watched a movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What movie?\" Jack asked. From there, they drifted off into a long conversation about any number of different, non-pregnancy related topics. Hours drifted away easily, the two of them already great friends. Eventually, Jack realized that it was almost 11:30. \"Damn, I've got to go back, sorry. I promised my parents I'd let them know when I'd be coming home and they're probably freaking out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-kay,\" Jessica said in a goofy pout, standing up and opening her arms for a hug. Jack enthusiastically hugged her back, the two of them smiling brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let you know if any more developments come up,\" Jack said as he left. Jessica nodded, and when he left, she went over to her computer and plugged in a recording camera. She waiting until it was almost midnight, then she hit *Record*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Jack,\" she said, rolling up her shirt to the camera, trying to show as much of her barely-pregnant belly as she could. \"I wanted to make you a little video to show you that...or if...it's still happening.\" Midnight hit, and Jessica gasped, her belly rounding out more now. She was now clearly pregnant, even if it wasn't very far along. \"Whoo...\" she breathed. \"It happened again. I just keep getting bigger. Or, rather...the baby's getting bigger.\" Jessica put down her shirt and turned to the camera. \"I don't think I look bad...pregnant, though. I feel good.\" Jessica bit her lip, her cheeks getting redder. \"If I'm being honest, I know why I didn't freak out when I found out I was pregnant. I've always thought pregnancy was really...beautiful and amazing and maybe even a little sexy. So the idea of being pregnant myself and getting to see my belly sudden expand like this is maybe a little exciting.\" Jessica was bright red now, looking directly into her camera. \"I'm hoping you think it's exciting to because I...I like you.\" A pause. \"I don't even know if I'm going to send this video to you. Maybe this was a mistake.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack pulled into his driveway. The whole drive back, he was thinking about how he left out his class with Amber when he told Jessica about his day. Was he trying to hide it? Was there a reason to hide it? He was wrought with guilt and headed straight for bed, his parents long asleep after a long evening enjoying Amanda's changing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- Amanda and Faye: Day 5 || Jessica: Day 4 ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack woke up pretty late in the morning, groggily showering and checking his computer as he got changed. Amber had e-mailed all of the tech store's employees their schedules for the next week. Jack was curious to see what great times Amber had given him, since she promised it in exchange for him being her lamaze partner. Opening the Excel file, he saw...long, midday hours. And every day he was signed up, it was just him and Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" </span></div></div>",

He couldn't take it. He couldn't risk the possibility of being enveloped by it's power again, using it on someone, ruining their life. It was bad enough what happened to Amber, (twice, he thought to himself) what if next time and he's not as lucky and it lands him in an even worse problem than he was in now... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I doubt it could get much worse, but I really shouldn't risk it</i> Jack thought to himself, picking up the coin, twirling it around in his fingers. <br>\r\nHe looked at the images on the coin, the happy pregnant woman and man, the unhappy pregnant woman and man. <br>\r\n<i>On the news they said that a man was confirmed pregnant. I mean, that has to be wrong right? Men can't get pregnant, that's impossible. But after all, so was everything else that seemed to be happening lately</i> Jack thought to himself looking at the coin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right here... Coin, whatever the hell you are. I don't know what you are or how you work, but listen to me. You're staying here. You're not causing anymore trouble. You're not going to appear in my pocket, you're not going to copy yourself, you're just going to sit here until I can figure out what to do about all of... this stuff you've been doing.\" Jack chastised the coin, almost expecting it answer him, but it didn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt just sat in his hands as he placed it back down on the dresser, walking away, and closing the door to his room behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there it sat for the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack walked past the door to his parents bedroom like a monster was after him, hoping to avoid another run-in with his mother like last night. However, as he walked past he heard something he didn't expect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you're up to this?\" His father asked, as Jack pressed his ear to the door. \"They need me Jack, I have to work. We have five kids to support. Look, I'm pregnant not dead. I have maternity clothes, I have a car. I can spend some time at the bank today doing some work. I took a personal day yesterday, but I have no excuse today. Besides, I kind of want to bask in the congratulations of my co-workers.\" His mother said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be careful okay? Things are.. odd right now. Especially about..\" Jack's father was interrupted. \"I know, I know\" Jack's mother said hesitantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack walked away from the door, not wanting to listen in to the rest of the conversation, which is a shame, because he would have learned so much about what was coming, but alas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack overslept which prevented him from getting a good breakfast, opting out instead of getting drive-thru. He ate his breakfast sandwich hastily, while blaring loud music from his speakers, as he pulled into the parking space for work. Cleaning up his mess, he threw away everything in the outside trash bin, straightened his uniform and with a sigh, entered into the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Strong Hands\" Amber said, waddling in with her twin-filled belly leading the way. She wore a maternity version of the store uniform, which in retrospect did little to actually completely cover her belly, but it did more than her last outfit did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-uh, hey Amber\" Jack said, trying to not look directly at her belly. \"So, like the schedule for next week?\" She asked with a giggle and a wink \"Uh, yeah. Thanks for all the shifts, I could really use the money right now\" he said, looking at everything else but Amber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, my face is right here. You can look at it and not my midsection, even though I know you love it\" she said with a sassy giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't...\" Jack protested looking Amber straight in the face. <br>\r\n\"Oh calm down Strong Hands\" Amber said with a smile. \"I'm just messing with you. I want to thank you for yesterday. I know it was a little awkward... to say the least, but you really helped me out.\" Amber said putting her hands into the small of her back and pushing, making her belly jut out farther ahead, making more of her maternity shirt lift up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I give you a hard time lately Jack, but you're a good guy. Dumb but sweet. You're going to make some lady very happy some day.\" Amber said, giving her belly a pat. \"I - uh\" Jack was flabbergasted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now. We're not getting paid to stand around here and talk . I'm giving you a choice. Rick's running late but should be here a little after the store opens. If you want you can run the till until he gets in, or you can work in the back while I handle the front. I'd much rather have you in the back. We've got a lot of new product that needs to be out today. The regional manager is stopping by today to inspect the store and he wants everything out and ready to go.\" Amber says, switching from friend to boss in an instant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll uh - - - \" Jack thought about it for a moment. \"I'll work in the back. I need to exercise off that breakfast burger I just had\" He says jokingly. <br>\r\n\"Alright, get back there and get unloading. The display set-ups and daily inventory sheet is back there. You know what to do.\" Amber says, walking over to register. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, right\" Jack says, walking towards the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter closing the door to the back store-rooms, he let out a sigh of relief. Back here he could hide, and work, and try, try, TRY, to get his mind off all things pregnancy related. Flicking on the radio, he rolled up his sleeves and got to work opening and stacking boxes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're listening to 101.9 THE EDGE. Now it's back to Sandwich and Oven with the MORNING MADNESS. So here they are, the masters of morning madness, Sandwich and Oven!\" The radio blared as the morning talk show went on and Jack worked. </span></div></div>",

He wanted to get his mind off of pregnancy, but sure enough, it followed him wherever he went. And it certainly didn't help that the contest's description had given him a persistent erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pregnant bikini contest, huh?\" Amber said, leaning in the doorway, one hand on her round belly. \"I'll bet you'll get a front row seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha,\" Jack said flatly, trying to keep his back to his boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, looks like you're making good progress. I'm going to go get an early lunch. Hold the fort while I'm gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" Jack responded. Amber turned out and headed to her car, stopping to rub her belly intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A pregnant bikini contest, huh?</i> she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- Amanda Dale ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda walked into work as casually as she could, trying not to draw any more attention to her midsection. Although, there wasn't too much she could do to make it more clear. The maternity clothes Amanda picked out with Faye may have been trendy and looked great on her, but they did little to hide her pregnancy. Especially now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt vacant stares on her, including one from one of her closest friends at the office, Rick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda...\" Rick said, his eyes staring right at her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Rick,\" Amanda said with a sigh and a smile, turning her eyes to the rest of the office. \"Hi everyone. So, I guess now's a good time to announce it: I'm pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations!\" Rick said with a cautious smile. \"But you, um, weren't this big a few days ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's more than one, so I'm growing a little faster than usual,\" Amanda said. It was half-true, but Amanda knew there was something more to it than that. Yesterday, Amanda looked like she was about 30 weeks pregnant with one baby. Now, you would expect her to have gone into labor at the drop of a pin. Her belly was enormous: perfectly round, sticking out a little over a foot from the rest of her body. Amanda figured carrying four babies would make things different from when she was pregnant with Jack Jr., but...even so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than one?\" Rick said, his eyebrows raising. \"Twins?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda smiled. \"We can talk more later,\" she said quietly, walking over to her seat. It took some adjusting to get to a position where she could reach her keyboard over her belly, but when she was settled, Amanda got right to work, just like always. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours of work, Amanda got a text from none other than Tara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;hi Amanda. just heard the big news. want to get lunch?&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;sure!&gt; Amanda sent back. She was a little annoyed that someone told Tara without her getting a chance, but she was good friends with Tara and it would be nice to talk to someone else who knew what it felt like to have their pregnancy sneak up on them a little. Imagine getting so close to delivery and then finding out there were another two babies in there! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda smiled to herself a little as she thought how it might be nice to meet a pregnant woman who's belly is actually bigger than hers. Although, at this rate, and with one more baby inside her than Tara...maybe that won't last long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoon rolled around and Amanda headed out to meet Tara where they agreed to get lunch: the mall's food court. When Amanda walked in the door, she saw Tara sitting in on one of the benches arraigned in a circle around the potted trees in the mall. She waved enthusiastically, wearing her usual dark clothing, her raven hair tied in a knotted ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda, oh my god!\" Tara said happily, the two of them waddling together and hugging as best they could. \"Look at you! It's true!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Amanda chuckled with a grin, rubbing her own big belly. \"I just found out a few days ago, but I'm doing plenty of growing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. May I?\" Tara asked, reaching her hand to Amanda's belly. Amanda nodded and Tara felt all around her stretched out tummy. \"I can't believe it's grown this fast, though. How many months are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thr-\" Amanda was about to respond, but she stopped herself. In retrospect...there was no way she was just three months pregnant. That didn't make any sense. \"The doctor says I'd have to go in again to really pin it down. But, they did tell me that it's quadruplets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quadruplets?\" Tara said with a smile and a raised eyebrow. \"And I thought I had a big bundle on my hands.\" Tara began cradling and rubbing her own belly. \"Ooh, okay, calm down,\" she giggled. \"Speaking of which, they're starting to kick up a storm. They must really want lunch. Shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely,\" Amanda said, rubbing her own belly, trying to match Tara's movements. She wondered what it would feel like to have four babies kicking inside her simultaneously. The thought scared and excited her at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the heavily pregnant women waddled to the food court, drawing plenty of looks. Grabbing plenty to eat, they both sat down at a big table that could accommodate their bellies and began eating and talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda, I don't mean to sound rude, but you really look amazing,\" Tara said, swallowing a big bite of her caesar wrap. \"Are you doing anything new, or is it all...the pregnancy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must just be the pregnancy,\" Amanda responded, shrugging. \"Although, I'm always in a better mood the day after I've...you know.\" Amanda winked at Tara, who started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda! You sly fox,\" Tara said with a huge smile. \u201cEven while you\u2019re pregnant?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I say? I\u2019ve gotten very comfortable with my new body,\u201d Amanda said, taking another bite with a smile. \u201cAlthough I have to give a lot of credit to my friend. And the maternity lingerie she helped me pick out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaternity lingerie?\u201d Tara said skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, there\u2019s a great place that sells it right in this mall, actually,\u201d Amanda said, pointing in the vague direction where she and Faye had shopped yesterday. Tara nodded contemplatively and continued to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I can\u2019t even imagine what it would be like to have sex while I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d Tara gave a weak smile. \u201cOops. I guess I gave you a little too much of a window into my life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Tara, I\u2019m in my 50s and I\u2019m pregnant with quadruplets. Believe me: I envy you in a lot of ways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Tara said with a smile, taking her last bite of food. \u201cWell, this has been great, but it\u2019s probably about time for you get back, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, unfortunately,\u201d Amanda said, putting both hands on the table to help herself up. Tara did the same, taking a little more time. Her belly was nearly twice as big as Amanda\u2019s and her shirt didn\u2019t even cover it completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amanda headed back to her car, Tara walked toward Baby Universe to browse around. On the way, there was a big table with 101.9\u2019s logo emblazoned above it and a sign-up sheet for the pregnant bikini contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not,\u201d Tara said to herself, reaching for the pen.</span></div></div>",

Since we've caught the Pregnant Bikini Contest Fever, I'm thinking you, me, our lovely on-air co-host Ms. Sexy Lisa Smith, and our lovely expectant contestants all take pregnancy tests on-air tomorrow morning as a joke. It'll be funny!\" Sandwich says, fighting back laughter. <br>\r\n\"That's a great idea! What do you think Ms. Sexy Lisa Smith?\" Oven asks his female co-host. <br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. I'm down. Besides, you might need to take one because of all the hurling you did this morning Oven\" Sexy Lisa Smith says over the radio. <br>\r\n\"Baby please. I was only puking because I have to look at Sandwich's ugly mug all morning!\" Oven shouts into his mike playfully, playing a sound effect of someone puking. <br>\r\n\"Oh, and that's another Oven Zinger!

So long this morning everyone, up next we got 101 minutes of non-stop rock, right here on The Edge!\" Sandwich says finishing up his stick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack checked his watch, noticing that Amber still wasn't back from her early lunch yet. <br>\r\n\"What is taking her so long? My lunch hour is coming up, and if I don't go on it soon, I'm going to get another violation. That's the last thing I need right now\" Jack said, tapping his foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put aside his work and went out front looking for Amber, and yet, still did not find her. <br>\r\n\"Oh for crying out loud\" Jack said to himself. With everything that had been going on in his life lately, the last thing he needed was trouble with his job. <br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm going on lunch. Can you tell Amber when she gets back?\" Jack asked grabbing another employee. <br>\r\n\"Are you sure? I'm sure she'll be back soon. Can't you wait? I don't want to get trouble raining down on me if she comes back and you're gone\"  the employee said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be fine. Just tell her I did it to avoid another lunch violation. She'll understand\" Jack said. <br>\r\n\"Whatever you say man\" The employee said, walking off to do his job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack went into the back, logged himself out for his lunch break, and walked out the employee back entrance to his car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was out and it was a very beautiful day as Jack made his way to his car. His mind wondered back to everything that had been happening lately, wondering how he got into this mess. He was hoping that something would come and just take him away from all of this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Jack was about to get his wish...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You Jack Dale?\" said a beautiful, busty red-head, waiting for him by his car. <br>\r\n\"Uh---\" Jack said, his eyes being drawn to her ample cleavage, on display for the whole world. <br>\r\n\"My eyes are up here\" she said flatly. <br>\r\n\"I uh, yeah sorry I\" Jack said, trying to regain his composure. <br>\r\n\"So you're Jack Dale Jr?\" She asked, nodding her head slowly. <br>\r\n\"Yeah. And you are?\" Jack asked, his \"I'M IN DANGER\" sense not tingling because of the beautiful distraction in front of him. <br>\r\n\"You purchased this coin a few days ago didn't you?\" The busty red-head said, holding up a photo of the coin. An exact photo, 100 accurate in every detail. <br>\r\n\"Uh, how do you - - \" Jack was starting to say before he was grabbed from behind, had a black sack shoved over his head and was drug off into a large black van that anyone would have probably noticed was parked where it shouldn't have been parked if Jack was paying more attention to his surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH COME ON! YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!\" Jack shouted behind the black sack shoved over his head, before WHAM! He was punched in the back of the head, and sweet darkness over took him. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack was a smart guy. Well, smart enough. He got good grades in school, always considered himself to be \"street smart\". However, when your kidnapped, thrown into a van, awake in an abandoned office building surrounded by people calling themselves \"Mr this or Ms. That\" and had a chance to escape, most people who were considered smart would take the chance to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jack chose to listen, which some people would claim to make Jack the dumbest man alive right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you people? What the hell is going on?\" Jack asked, more than a little pissed off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We represent a group of people who's lives have been ruined by this particular item\" Ms. Apple said, holding up the photo of the coin. <br>\r\n\"And these particular group of people think that by helping you they can help themselves\" Ms. Smart continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Particular group of people?! What the hell are you talking about? Why are you talking like you're some sort of special government agents\" Jack asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told them that approach was cliched.\" Mr Quick said, getting up and walking over to Jack. \"Look, Jack. I'm going to cut the double speak crap.  <br>\r\nWe're a support group\" Mr Quick answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Support group?\" Jack questioned.<br>\r\n\"A support group for people affected by that damn coin. Each one of us have been affected by the coin in some way. Family members, friends, co-workers, and in some cases.. ourselves\" Mr Quick said, his eyes not trying to give away which one of these people were affected by the coin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what you want me to join? Come to the meeting every Tuesday night and say, Hi my name is Jack, and my life was ruined by a coin I bought from a guy at a rummage sale? Sorry, not interested\" Jack said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here to help Jack. We think we can stop whatever it is that's happening around you.. Unless of course you want four new siblings\" Mr. Ox says standing up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell do know about that?\" Jack asked, turning his attention over to Mr. Ox, really really really hoping he doesn't punch him in the face again. <br>\r\n\"We've been following you these past few days. We were actually in town to retrieve the coin at the rummage sale before it managed to find someone new to.. bond to\" Ms. Smart said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bond? Can you guys pretend I'm stupid and tell me what the hell is going on?\" Jack asked, wanting answers. <br>\r\n\"How about a story? A long, long, time ago, there was this coin.\" Mr. Quick says, tapping on the picture of the coin. \"And nobody knows where it comes from. Some people say it fell from the stars, some people say it's the last artifact from a time where actual magic ruled the world. Either way, this coin has one very special power: It can get anyone pregnant. ANYONE Jack. Men, women, young, old. It doesn't matter to the coin. Why? Because it's all food to it?\" Ms. Apple explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food?\" Jack asked. <br>\r\n\"You see Jack. Along the course of everyone's life, we go from Point A to Point B, changing the route every so often either in big ways or small ways depending on our choices in life.\" Ms. Apple continues. <br>\r\n\"Where we go to school, what career we choose, who we fall in love with, so on and so forth. Each decision a small or major fork in the road that all eventually leads to the same place: Point B\" Mr. Quick continues. <br>\r\n\"We call it our Destiny-nation, you know instead of destination\" Mr. Ox says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't call it that. It's just a name we're using for it right now\" Mr. Quick responds back, rolling his eyes. <br>\r\n\"The point is, everyone ends up where they're supposed to end up. It's how the world works.. But this coin.. changes all of that.. for everyone. Uh.. how do I explain this easily...\" Ms. Smart said scratching her head. \"Wait, I've got it\" She said snapping her finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled over a white board from somewhere in the office, wrote \"Point A\" on one side \"Point B\" on the other, and up at the top she wrote \"Amanda Dale\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your mom right? All the paths in her life all lead to Point B, but along the way she took different routes to get there. Met your dad, had you, so on and so forth. But this coin right? It changed all that. Ever since that coin was used on her she became pregnant, and BIG TIME\" Ms Apple explains as Ms. Smart writes on the white-board. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having a child is one of the biggest changes a person makes in their life, and as such, it's one of the biggest route changes on the way to the  Destiny-nation\" Ms Apple continues, as Mr. Ox gives a beam of pride of the use of the term. <br>\r\n\"Now that your mom is pregnant, her destination is no longer Point B.\" Ms Apple explains. <br>\r\n\"The Destiny path of your mom up until a few days ago was Point B, whatever Point B may have been to her. But now, her Destination is in chaos. She's over 50, pregnant with quads, and will have to work many more years to support them along with your father. Point B is no longer an option, she's headed to Point C, or Point D, of Point E..\" Ms Smart takes over. <br>\r\n\"The coin, causing that pregnancy, created new destinations for her, and is feeding on the chaos that creates. It alters people's destiny by creating a pregnancy, and uses that to feed itself. Create, feed, hunger, create, feed, hunger. It's all the coin does.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's just not her Point B that changes, it changes for everyone. Let's say one of your sibling grows up and marries a nice girl, we'll call her  Mary Sue. Mary Sue and your Sibling get married and have a kid together, while that may sound nice, Mary Sue was destined to marry someone else and have kid who would grow up and become president, thus changing everyone's Point B's, and giving the coin more chaos to feed.\" Ms. Apple continues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This coin creates pregnancies, in both men and women, to create chaos to feed itself on the chaos created by a change in a person's destiny\" Mr. Quick summarizes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I - - don't believe any of this\" Jack said, taking in all of the mind-blowing information. <br>\r\n\"Well you better believe it fast, because the clock is ticking\" Mr. Ox says. <br>\r\n\"What - what do you mean\" Jack asks looking confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smooth Ox\" Ms. Apple says, flustered. <br>\r\n\"He needs to know sooner rather than later.\" Mr Ox says.<br>\r\n\"KNOW WHAT?\" Jack asks, getting angry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The coin's - - -magic, if you want to call it that, can be reversed, but it needs to be done quickly before the effects become permanent.\" Ms. Smart says. <br>\r\n\"How?\" Jack asked not skipping a beat, trying to undo everything he's done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll get to that. But there's something you need to know: The coin has chosen you Jack. It's bonded to you, and that's why we're here to help you\" Ms. Apple informs.<br>\r\n\"Bonded?\" Jack asks. <br>\r\n\"Whenever the coin needs to work it's magic to feed, it bonds to someone to use them as it's puppet so to speak.\" Mr. Quick answers. <br>\r\n\"You mean like all those times the coin wants me to flip it\" Jack says getting it. <br>\r\n\"Bingo. It uses you to do it's dirty work. But bonding is tricky Jack. You see, by using you as it's puppet, it also gives you the chance to stop it. You caused it, your bonded to the coin, you can stop it. But not for long, when those kids are born in a few days, the \"circuit\" if you want to call it that, linking the two of you together will be complete and it will be too late to stop it\" Ms. Apple  informs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see what you're saying and -  - - WAIT, A FEW DAYS?!\" Jack asked, the words in the sentence hitting him like a ton of bricks. <br>\r\n\"The coin's magic works it's way fast, each month of pregnancy lasting about a day, maybe a little less or a little more depending. The coin uses this as a defense mechanism\" Mr Quick starts again. <br>\r\n\"9 months would make it too easy to figure out a way linking the magic between the coin and the person bonded to it. So the pregnancies are accelerated to a month a day. By the time the person or persons involved figured it out, it would be too late to stop it.\" Ms Apple continues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once ANY one of the kids are born, the circuit is completed and it's too late to reverse it, no matter what\" Mr. Ox finishes. <br>\r\n\"But if each pregnancy is 9 days, then why do some women act like they've been pregnant for months?\" Jack asks, wanting clarification. <br>\r\n\"It's the inverse of the magic Jack. The ying-to-the yang if you will. For every accelerated pregnancy created by the ring, sometimes a pregnancy is just created in a specific month of pregnancy, and the person will either believe they were always pregnant, or react like someone who just witnessed their belly grow large with child. It all depends on\" Ms. Apple says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends on what?\" Jack asks. <br>\r\n\"Heads or Tails Jack\". Ms. Smart answers. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was old, older than old, yet looked brand new. It looked like something out of horror movie, where some kids in a cabin find a book and nothing good happens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRusted hinges held the book together, while a thick, almost metal like cover, covered the front. The pages were old and yellowed along the side, some pages even falling out of their binding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell is this thing? Because honestly it looks like something that if I messed around with it could bring the dead back to life\" Jack says looking at the book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the answer to your problems\" Mr. Ox says. <br>\r\n\"At least we think so\" Mr Quick corrected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Jack asked. <br>\r\n\"This books contains everything, everything people have gathered about the coin over time. Accounts, encounters, attempts to destroy it, that kind of thing\" Ms. Apple says. <br>\r\n\"Somewhere in the massive volume, MAY, be the answer. But we've only recently gotten ahold of it, came from a private collector who had come across it in the rare-book market. He got it after he encountered the coin and by then it was too late for him\" Ms. Smart says, trailing off a little bit. <br>\r\n\"Hope the poor guy can loose all that pregnancy-weight. But his daughter is the cutest little thing you ever saw\" Mr. Ox said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He gave the book to us, hoping that we could have it translated for when the coin came to someone next, but shipping delays caused that to not be so, we just got it the day we came here for the coin, and found you\" Ms. Apple informs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you translate this book, you might find someway to destroy the coin while it's still bonded to you, before one of the children are born and it's too late.\" Mr. Quick states. <br>\r\n\"And if not, you'll really help out the poor schmo how the coin comes to after you, while your on diaper duty\" Mr. Ox says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack rubbed his head with the palm of his hand. This was all too much.. Much to much.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My head hurts. I taste purple\" Jack said rubbing his head. <br>\r\n\"We're going to drop you off back at your house. You should really get translating right away. Clock's ticking\" Ms. Smart said. <br>\r\n\"While this has been a super great experience and everything, I'm going to go back to work and try to repress this whole thing\" Jack said. <br>\r\n\"Don't worry about going back to work. We managed to convince your manager Amber that you had an emergency you needed to deal with at home. She gave you the rest of the day off, with pay I might add\" Mr. Quick said.<br>\r\n\"But she said you now owe her a favor, and then she called you \"Strong Hands\" for whatever reason\" Mr. Ox said. <br>\r\n\"So ready to begin?\" Ms. Apple said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, isn't there something else I can do?\" Jack asked. <br>\r\n\"Not really\" Mr. Ox said, putting the black sack over Jack's head. <br>\r\n\"Oh come on again with the bag\" Jack said behind the shroud. <br>\r\n\"Support group my ass.\" Jack said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look man, we're just a bunch of people who met on the internet and came here to help you. We're not professionals.\" Mr. Ox said before WHAM! Hitting Jack in the back of the head again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - Later - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack awoke in his car in a parking lot not far from his house. The book was in the passenger seat, staring back at him. <br>\r\nJack looked at it, and it looked back at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have just bought those old coloring books at that damn sale\" Jack said, turning the key in the ignition and driving back towards home. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back home, Jack peeked around the house, looking to see if his parents were home so he could hide the book. No such luck, as his mom was lying back on the couch, her shirt rolled up, her hands meticulously rubbing her full belly. Jack could tell that is was obviously bigger than the day before, and not just because it was now totally bare. She looked like she was 41 weeks pregnant with just one baby. Her belly was gleaming as she was using some kind of oil or cream, Jack couldn't tell. But the sight made him feel...things he was embarrassed to feel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Jack,\" his mother said, not taking her eyes off her belly. Jack nervously walked into the room, also watching his mother rub her belly. The group from earlier had explained it partially to him, but now that he saw his mother's belly, Jack fully understood: she really was getting closer to delivery with each passing day. \"It's crazy, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Jack said, snapping out of his experience just a few hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big I look,\" his mom said, looking over at her son, a little smile across her face. \"When I was this big before, I was being driven to the hospital by your father. But the doctor says I still have some more months left.\" She sighed and stroked her full size again. \"God only knows how big I'll be by then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's face turned red and he turned back to hurry up the stairs to his room. Closing the door behind him, Jack dropped the mysterious book on his desk and turned it open. The first page was full of tiny, almost calligraphic writing. He strained the read the words, making out lines like \"with child\" and \"sudden.\" He flipped a few more pages, seeing that the book was not organized in any way he could tell. It was more like a scrapbook, with different writings and observations. One page had a series of Polaroids of a pregnant woman who got bigger with each photograph, with pictures labeled \"Day 4,\" \"Day 5,\" etc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning the page again, he found a small section that he could understand. It looked like he turned to be right in the middle of a journal entry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>The coin's voice, it has to be the coin's voice, is getting louder. It's saying more than just simple things like flip and look. Today it told me not to turn the corner. Like there was something it didn't like or something it couldn't stand. It's strange. I wish I could find out whatever it was, then I could be rid of this damned coin</i>.\" That was certainly interesting, but it wasn't all that helpful to Jack. There was something that could be used against the coin, but no word on what it is or how to use it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking through the book some more and spending a lot of time absently staring at the pictures of pregnant women, Jack slammed the book closed and rubbed his eyes. This was going to be even harder than he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner, Jack,\" his father called. Jack looked over at the clock. He had spent hours and hours looking through the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I didn't even notice...\" Jack said to himself, putting the book away someplace secret. \"Hopefully some of it sunk in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the dinner table, his mother was already sitting there with a smile, her belly now covered up. They all ate, his mother taking food in with gusto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Jack, I saw Tara today. She was put on maternity leave after she found out that she's got triplets, especially this close to her due date, but she was fine,\" his mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good,\" Jack said, glad she wasn't hurt too badly by the coin's chaotic magic. Then, he remembered what the \"support group\" had told him. If they give birth, it's all over. \"Do you know how far she is from her, um, due date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly, but I'd guess a few weeks, especially the way she looks,\" his mom said, raising her eyebrows to emphasize her point. \"I don't even know of any women who are pregnant with triplets for this long. It's been more than eight months, for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good</i>, Jack thought. <i>She isn't going to give birth too soon. I've still got the same amount of time to fix this</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were finishing up, Jack's mom took another big bite and then paused, putting her hand to her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh...\" she said curiously. \"Oh! Oh, Jack, they're kicking!\" She grabbed Jack's dad's arm, who reached over to his wife's big belly and began rubbing with a surprised look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda, that's incredible,\" he breathed. Amanda turned over to face her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, here, come feel!\" she said, beaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, I dunno,\" Jack said hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" she said, taking a deep breath as she got a particularly hard kick. \"Wow, it's so strange feeling so many bodies kicking inside there.\" Nervously, Jack reached out his hand, which his mother grabbed and rubbed against her belly. \"There, your big brother is feeling you now. Will you calm down a little?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack blushed and brought his hand away. \"I'm going to go hang out with my friends,\" he said as he ran upstairs. Amanda frowned a little and started to rub her own belly, moving her hand where she felt bumps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He just needs to get used to it, Amanda,\" his dad said, putting his hand over Amanda's. \"It took you a while to get used to it too, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Amanda said, looking down at her belly. \"I'm still not completely used to it. At this rate, who knows how big I'll be tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll still be gorgeous,\" Jack Sr. said, planting a kiss on his wife's cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpstairs, Jack dumped the book into his backpack and headed out the door, grabbing his keys and all. There was only one place he could think to go: Jessica's house. Now that there was a way to get rid of the coin's magic, he had to tell her. Besides, having another pair of eyes might make it easier to figure something out from the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were joking, drinking, having a great time. He felt increasingly groggy and figured he would probably have to slow it down some. Turning around on his stool, he surveyed the rest of the bar. It was a big place, with a restaurant there and everything. There was a stage off on the side being set up, with some big signs for a radio station being hung up. A beautiful blonde woman was giving orders, showing where speakers and lights should be set up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon guys, if we get it up now, we can see how things will look for the actual competition in a few days,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Lisa,\" one guy said as he threw some cables up into the rafters to get them out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ian?\" One of his friends said. \"Some of us are going to grab a cab back, want to come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmidunno,\" Ian said, pulling a coin out of his pocket. \"Heads I stay, tailsigo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, sure, whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whooop,\" Ian said, tossing his coin lazily and catching it. \"Tails. Llllezgo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan's friends helped him to the door and none of them noticed the scream of surprise as Lisa Smith's uterus gained a few full-term occupants.<br>\r\n--- Jack ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then they took the bag off my head and I was back home,\" Jack said. Jessica was flipping through the book, listening and reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" she said, stopping at the same page Jack had focused on before with the polaroids. \"Wait...these are all just days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, that's the other thing,\" Jack said, his voice getting more serious. \"They said the pregnancies accelerate by the day, so nine days is like nine months.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looked down at her own belly, which Jack had noticed was bigger than before. It now looked like a real pregnant belly, even if it wasn't as big as...well, everyone else's. \"How many days do you figure it's been for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure,\" Jack said, trying to think about when he must have first flipped the coin. \"Maybe...four?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So five days left for me,\" she said, rubbing her hands over her belly. \"But I guess the bigger issue is just four days left for your mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, so we've got to figure something out soon,\" Jack said, leaning down to look at the book with Jessica. His hair brushed her cheek and she looked over at him and gave a little smile. He didn't notice so she bit her lip and looked back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spent hours going over the book, discussing ideas, trying to find patterns. It got later and later and the two of them bumped into each other, which led to nervous giggles. It happened enough times that when Jack's hand brushed against Jessica's inflated breasts, she slowly closed the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-maybe it's too late to keep trying this,\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, maybe,\" Jack said, sighing. He liked spending time with Jessica and trying to find a solution, but it looked like she was calling a night a night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to just, you know, sit and talk?\" Jessica asked, moving to sit on her bed. Jack happily joined her. They didn't say anything, though. They just looked into each other's eyes as their eyelids got heavier and their faces got closer. They weakly kissed, their lips just barely touching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to feel my belly?\" Jessica whispered. Jack moved his hand to her abdomen and Jessica rolled up her shirt. \"Is this the first time you've felt a pregnant belly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mom beat you there by a few hours,\" Jack chuckled a little. Jessica giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor baby,\" she said softly, kissing Jack on the neck. They lay back in the bed, cuddling together. Jessica moved her hand up Jack's shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-do you want me to take it off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica nodded, biting her lip. They both undressed, still just holding each other and kissing every now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever...you know?\" Jack said shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think anyone's ever asked a pregnant woman that question before,\" Jessica chuckled, kissing Jack on the chest and moving her hand to his erection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack smiled and turned around, moving his hand around one of her supple breasts. \"Well, w-would you like to do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Jessica said with a smile, positing Jack to enter her. \"Absolutely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack penetrated her labia, struggling to pump against her and kiss against her body. \"Y-you're belly's in the way,\" he gasped, trying to talk while his erection was being stimulated by her insides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica giggle and sat up, riding Jack from on top. \"Better?\" she asked, her face bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better,\" Jack managed to get out, now vigorously moving in motion with Jessica's hips. \"But now I can't reach your breasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica laughed and started to massage her own chest. \"Like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" Jack moaned, reaching his hands around her tight ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I knew you'd like this big, pregnant tits,\" Jessica said. She was starting to lose herself in the dirty talk, but she loved this side of her too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess,\" Jack managed to squeak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and you love my round, pregnant belly. You can't wait to see it grow and grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess, wait,\" Jack said, starting to struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big, huge, more babies in it than your mom's. I'll smother you with my full womb and then you'll bend me over and fuck me in my wet, pregnant-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was cut off by Jack coming too soon, his face contorted with embarrassment and pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, that really turned you on, huh,\" Jessica said to herself, a little surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...complicated,\" Jack moaned, collapsed on Jessica's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- Faye ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Jack, Jessica, and everyone else, the coin felt threatened. It could sense that the One It Was Bonded To was looking for ways to sever that bond and undo what it had done. The One didn't realize it, but he had gotten a step closer to figuring it out and ruining the feast of chaos it had before it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the coin's power was not to be underestimated. It had a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Faye rolled around in her bed, by herself, she grabbed the coin in her palm in her sleep. She was alone in bed because her husband refused to share the bed with such a pregnant woman and it broke her heart, as happy as she was that she was pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">You love being pregnant, don't you Faye?</span> the coin called to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye opened her eyes. She was in another room, mysterious and unknown. She looked down and saw that her belly was...huge! It was bigger than any pregnant belly she had ever seen before. And what's more she could feel so much movement inside her. Faye happily rubbed her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I've waited so long to be pregnant. I didn't think the day would ever come!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA figure stood before her, any details about him obscured somehow. \"Well, I'm glad you like it. But do you remember when you first found out you were pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course! It was the happiest day of my life!\" Faye said. \"It was...um...it was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, your pregnancy just came one day,\" the figure said. \"And it can go just as easily as it came.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye looked down and saw that her belly was gone. What's more, she looked and felt even older and weaker. \"No...\" she said. \"What...what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The boy across the street wants to take that away from you,\" the figure said, getting closer. \"But you can stop him. Just do...exactly what I say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in her bed, Faye curled up, a smile across her face as she rubbed her belly. \"Mmm...just tell me what to do.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amanda: Day 6|Faye: Day 6|Jessica: Day 5| \"Oven\": Day 3<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack Jr awoke in a bed that wasn't his. As he  rubbed the sleep from his eyes, he noticed the delicate curve of the lifted sheets next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Jessica's hand was wrapped around her now 5-month pregnant belly, which was covered by blue bedsheets. Her hand rested upon it like she was worried like someone was going to snatch it away from her. Her other delicate hand was covering the spot where Jack was sleeping moments before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stopped what he was doing and looked at the scene before him. Jessica looked... so happy. She looked like a happily married woman who was starting a family with the man she loved, not a single 20-something in a dead-end job, mysteriously pregnant because of a coin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack felt a pang of guilt as he watched this scene. Not just because he's felt he ruined Jessica's life, but because of what happened the night before. As the memories of the beautiful lovemaking they spent the whole night doing (Jack was rather proud that he beat his personal best record by two additional times) rushed back to him, he wondered what would become of their friendship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSex between friends is always weird, but add into the whole \"Hey female best friend, you're pregnant with a rapid pregnancy caused by a coin whose feeding off the chaos caused by said pregnancy\" in the mix, and it just cranks the weird-o-meter up to 11. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica stirred softly in her sleep, her hand rubbing her new larger midsection, a smile creeping on the sides of her face as she dream of... what? Jack wondered where he fit into the grand scheme of things in Jessica's life now, because, well dammit, he loved her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the first time that Jack ever admitted to it, either in his head or aloud, but he knew it was right. Watching Jessica sleep, he LOVED her. <br>\r\nShe drove him crazy, and he wanted to be with her the rest of his days. They've been friends forever, and as time passed he watched grow from a dorky young girl into the beautiful young maternal woman in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack always knew that there was something between them, but Jack could never risk the chance that he was wrong and risk a friendship for mixed signals. He stood next to her as they struggled through high school and the awkwardness that came with it. The long hot summers, just him and her at the beach, hoping that chance for the kiss, the kiss that would change everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after last night, he wondered what came next. You just can't back a night like last night, and he'd never want to. But still he could - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBZZT! BZZT! BZZT! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack pulls his cellphone out his pants (which took him a few minutes to find as the clothes in Jessica's room where strewn about in the fit of passion last night) and looked at it. It was a text from Amber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Great.</i> Jack thinks as he checks the message: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Morning Strong Hands. Hope I didn't pull you away from anything important, but I need you to come in early today. I know you had to leave yesterday, but the work that needed to be done yesterday wasn't done, and now it's raining hellfire down on all of us. I need you in here before your noon shift, and it's going to be probably an all-day shift, so hey, lot's of overtime, but it needs to be done. I'd do it myself, but... well you know Strong Hands </i> the text message ended with a winking emoticon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic\" Jack muttered to himself looking over to the book. He barely made a scratch to the hefty tomb that may hold the answer to reversing all of this... and now he has to go into work all day \"Mmm, what was that?\" Jessica asked, leaning forward on the bed, causing her pregnant belly to jut forward, and she put two hands behind on the bed,. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh uh.. Good morning Jessica\" Jack said, starting to get flustered at the beautiful sight before him. <br>\r\n\"Good morning lover. Why don't you come back to bed?\" Jessica said with come-hither voice and devilish look on her face. <br>\r\n\"Uh, lover? J-j-j-j-ess about last night, we uh, we - we - we\" Jack stammered, his brain shutting down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica started laughing, as she heaved herself (with some difficulty) out of bed, wrapping the sheet around her like a toga. Her 5-month belly and it's curve visible through the bed sheets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax you big dork, I'm just messing with you\" She said, giving him a kiss on the check. <br>\r\n\"But then what what what what\" Jack said, even more confused than before. <br>\r\n\"Than what was all this?\" She motions to the room, implying about last night.<br>\r\n\"It was just some fun... between friends. I mean, I'm awash in hormones Jack, I needed a.. release\" Jessica said, in an obvious lie that anyone who wasn't Jack could have picked up on<br>\r\n\"But all that.. dirty talk. You said some..\" Jack said<br>\r\n\"It was all just.. part of the fun of the moment. Heh, you didn't think I actually meant any of that did you?\" Jessica said, another obvious lie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no. Of course not\" Jack said, in an obvious lie that Jessica didn't pick up on. An awkward pregnant pause fell between them. <br>\r\n\"So uh - - -\" Jack said without thinking. \"Well uh\" Jessica said, one of her hands resting on her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh, better get going. i gotta get to work soon\" Jack said, looking down at the ground and rubbing the back of his neck. <br>\r\n\"Don't you want to shower first?\" Jessica asked.<br>\r\n\"Are you asking me if - - - \" Jack said, his mind jumping to conclusions<br>\r\n\"You want to use my shower? It's down the hall to the right. Just be careful my parents don't see you, they probably haven't left for work yet\" Jessica said, her face turning red, knowing what Jack really meant to say.<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah, right.\" Jack said, covering, before leaving to go take a shower. <br>\r\n\"Don't you need a change of clothes or something?\" Jessica asked, following after Jack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I always keep a change in my car just in case of emergencies. Same thing with my work uniform, I mean you never know right?\" Jack asked, before slipping out of Jessica's room.  \"Yeah, you never know\" Jessica said to herself quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked (almost now a full-on waddle) over to her full length mirror, and dropped the sheets covering her pregnant form. Turning her body to see her very pregnant profile, she put one hand into the small arch in her back and used the other to explore the quickly growing curves of her maternal form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jessica. Look at you\" She said, exploring her curve with a sense of bemusement. \"Oh boy... Or are you a girl?\" She looked down at her midsection, talking to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had some time while Jack showered, and so she grabbed her camera and began to take pictures of her pregnant form. <br>\r\nSometime later, Jack entered, dressed in his clothes from last night, while Jessica sat dressed in a blue bath-robe, which was tight around the middle, looking at her digital camera with a smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" Jack asked. <br>\r\n\"Nothing\" Jessica said, hiding the camera. <br>\r\n\"Well thanks for letting me use your shower. I better go before I end up being late for being early\" Jack said with a dopey smile.<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Jessica said, another awkward pause falling between them.<br>\r\n\"Well last night was uh. Nice. Thanks for uh\" Jack said, not quite sure how to finish this conversation.<br>\r\n\"Yeah uh\" Jessica said, putting her hands into her back, making her belly jut out some more. <br>\r\n\"Well, talk to you later\" Jack said, heading for the front door. <br>\r\n\"Wait, where are you going?\" Jessica asked. <br>\r\n\"I'm leaving\" Jack said. <br>\r\n\"Not out the front door! Use the window!\" Jessica said.<br>\r\n\"The window?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n\"My parents are still out there, and if they see you leave and me.. like this, they're going to start asking questions the two of us don't have answers for\" Jessica said. <br>\r\n\"That makes some sense\" Jack said, heading for the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened it softly and put one leg through it, looking back at Jessica. <br>\r\n\"Oh wait the book!\" Jack said, remembering. \"How am I going to work on it while I'm stuck at work all day\" <br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it. I'll handle it\" Jessica said, looking over at the book.<br>\r\n\"You will?\" Jack asked. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I have a shift today at BooksBooksBooks, and it's probably going to be pretty quite today, so I can spend some time translating it with the other books at the book store\" Jessica said. <br>\r\nJack looked over to Jessica's BooksBooksBooks uniform.. There was no way people weren't going to know she was pregnant when she wore that thing. <br>\r\n\"Are you sure about going out in that today? I mean, your going to be hanging out all over\" Jack said politely. <br>\r\n\"Yeah well I gotta work. I'm trying to save some money to finish up school when I can go back\" Jessica said. <br>\r\n\"Okay\" Jack said, his leg still hanging out the window. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me know how it goes.\" Jack says, getting ready to leave. <br>\r\n\"Hey one more thing\" Jessica asks. <br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Jack answers. <br>\r\n\"Just in case we can't find some way to.. stop all of this\" Jessica says, point to her belly \"Do you want to go with me to the mall later tonight to go shopping?\" She asks.<br>\r\n\"Shopping? What?\" Jack says confused again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to need things for myself and the baby if you can't reverse this\" Jessica says<br>\r\n\"Jessica, I'll find some way to stop all of this. I promise you\" Jack said sternly. <br>\r\n\"Don't make a promise your bank account can't keep. Baby stuff is expensive\" Jessica said with a flirty smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over and gave Jack a kiss on the head, which caused him to fall out the window in shock.<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Jessica calls out to Jack.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine. A little pain. But I'm fine\" He answers back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica closes her window with a soft laugh, patting her belly after she's done. She looks over to her BooksBooksBooks uniform and lets out a sigh. <br>\r\n\"Well kid. I think it's time we finally told some people about you\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shimming down the side of Jessica's house and down into his car, Jack drove off to work, the car riding a little joltily as he felt his hands shake. He couldn't believe it: he had really had sex with Jessica. Something he'd only dreamed of since high school. And somehow, it was even better than he could remember. As he drove on, he faded back into his memory, remembering the heavy-eyelids and moist smile of Jessica as they felt each other's touch and he caressed her big, round belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She's too big for it just to be one baby</i>, Jack thought. <i>I'll bet its at least twins. Maybe it's more and she'll get as bigger with each day and I'll wrap my hands around those fertile curves</i>-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething snapped in Jack's head and he saw the red light ahead of him. Pumping the brake, he felt the whole car shake and heave forward as he stopped suddenly, looking around to see how far out into the intersection he'd gone. Jack started sweating nervously, realizing he'd been daydreaming and it could have gotten him into a car accident. More than that, he hadn't just been daydreaming about sex, he was daydreaming about pregnancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack flipped on the radio and waited for the light to switch back to green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well gang,\" Sandwich said over the air, \"like we promised, all three of your morning hosts are going to take an on-air pregnancy test. B-but, before we start, our own station fox Lisa Smith has an...announcement she'd like to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Lisa said in an obviously nervous tone. \"Well, I'd kept this pretty secret from everyone, but...I'm pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say,\" Oven could barely be heard saying over the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You certainly kept it a secret from us,\" Sandwich said. \"How, um, how far along are you? You look like you're pretty well...cooked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm not sure exactly how far along I am, but the reason I'm as...big as I am is, according to the doctors, I'm carrying triplets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOven burst out laughing. \"Wow Liz, you're sure going to have your hands full. I never pictured you as a mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telling me,\" Lisa said quietly. \"Well, we might as well make it on-air official, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" Sandwich said. \"We each drank a ton of water and just peed into a few cups and we've got our pregnancy tests ready to dip in. Ms. Smith?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small *bloop* sound of the test being dipped into the urine cup. \"Positive,\" Lisa said, her voice stilly shaky. \"I-I told you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're not messing with us,\" Sandwich said. \"Alright, now before I go, some of our Twitter followers told us that if a guy gets a positive pregnancy test, it's a possible sign of testicular cancer, so let's see how everything is down there.\" Another *bloop*. \"Clean bill of health for Sandwich,\" he said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess only one of us is going to be changing diapers, pal,\" Oven said with a laugh as he dipped his test. \"And it's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, let's go to commercial,\" Sandwich said, the station's promo playing as Jack pulled into work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back, sure enough, Amber was standing by a rack of electronics, one hand stroking her bare belly as the other hand looked at items, then put them back and scribbled on a clipboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you here, Strong Hands,\" she grinned, turning around. From the side, the full curve of her belly was accentuated. Jack's mind drifted back to his daydream and he tensed up. Amber had always been an incredibly attractive woman and he'd be lying if she'd never snuck into his fantasies and dreams before, but over the course of her sudden pregnancy, something else about her was picking away at his subconscious. And now, seeing her before him, he was consumed with an incredible lust for you. Every tease she ever through him hit him at once and made him want to explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-glad to be here,\" Jack said, his face starting to blush. He knew today of all days, he couldn't handle her flirting and jokes. \"What needs moving?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, you're eager to start, aren't you?\" she said, picking up the clipboard and giving a few looks over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just...it helps me keep my mind off of things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, always so mysterious,\" Amber said in a mocking tone. \"Alright, there's lots of new shipment boxes that came in over there,\" she said, pointing to a small mountain of cardboard. \"Use the codes on the top to sort them, okay? Be good and I might give you a little reward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber laughed through closed lips and drifted to the front of the store. Jack sighed and slipped on a pair of gloves and got to work. \"At least she's gone,\" he muttered to himself, not knowing Amber heard him just next to the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt BooksBooksBooks, Jessica was moving from shelf to shelf, stacking books and hiding so she could try to pull her shirt over her massive belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't want to show you off this much,\" she whined. With another quick step, she felt herself bump into something big and firm, knocking her a few steps back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry! I didn't see you th...Jessica?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looked up to see that she had run into a giant mass of belly. \"Mrs. Dale?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda Dale was standing in front of Jessica, one hand rubbing her enormous belly where Jessica had bumped into her. \"It's good to see you,\" she said, eyeing Jessica's own belly. \"H-how are...doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" Jessica said, seeing Jack's mother's line of sight pointed right at her own pregnant belly. \"Oh, yeah, right. No, it's alright.\" <i>You should talk</i>, Jessica said, her eyes hungrily gazing at Amanda Dale's own pregnant belly. <i>Jack, you really undersold your mother's belly. It's...amazing</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, that was rude of me,\" Amanda said, a tiny smile breaking across her lips. \"You've been seeing a lot of Jack lately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Jessica said with a pleasant smile, her mind drifting off. \"I mean, he's been helping me out with...things. He stayed with me last night to help out. It's not always easy, you know?\" Jessica was a pretty masterful liar and figured she needed to cover Jack's tracks, especially after she'd kept him out all night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good, I figured he was just out a friend's house,\" Amanda said with a smile, rubbing the other side of her belly where she felt a few of her young moving around. \"But I'm not too surprised he's helping you out. Ever since he was little, he had such a fascination with pregnant women, \"Amanda giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Jessica said with a raised eyebrow. <i>Interesting...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, but, well, I don't want to get into too much detail, but it got him into a little bit of trouble. I think he's tried to block some of it out,\" Amanda said with a sigh. \"I think that's why he's not talking to me too much about how he's going to be a big brother pretty soon,\" she said, patting her big belly. It was the size of an overly ripe watermelon. Luckily, the maternity clothes she and Faye picked out covered all of her smooth skin, but it was still pretty tight and her popped out belly button was visible through the fabric, as were her ample breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" Jessica thought, still gazing and admiring at Amanda's maternal body. Then, Jessica felt something odd and clutched her belly. \"Wha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica, what's wrong?\" Amanda said, waddling over to feel Jessica's belly, her own pregnant tummy pressing against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, I just feel...something,\" Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda beamed as she rubbed Jessica's belly. \"Oh, Jessica, you don't know what that is? That's your baby kicking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looked at her in disbelief, before looking down at her own belly, rolling up her shirt some. \"Really?\" she said quietly, before adding. \"...I had no idea it would like this much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda moved her hands some more, before giggled. \"Sweetie, I think that's because there's more than one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's eyes practically popped out of her head. \"M-more than...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda nodded. \"That's what it feels like to me. Maybe it's time for another ultrasound.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Jessica whispered. \"Well, it was really nice to meet you again, Mrs. Dale, but I should probably finish stacking these books.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, of course,\" Amanda said, giving Jessica a clumsy hug that mostly consisted of her belly and breasts smushing against Jessica. \"Well, congratulations. We'll have to talk again soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we should,\" Jessica said, the sight of Jack's mom's big belly dancing through her mind. As soon as Amanda left, Jessica hurried back to stacking books as another employee walked up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess, you're, um, untucked,\" Mariah, a tan, tall girl with super short, wavy bleach blond hair, said. She was Jessica's best and only friend at work and one of the smartest people she knew. She was given a weak explanation of Jessica's sudden...motherhood and figured that she shouldn't ask any questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica pulled her shirt over her belly again. \"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, I looked through that book, like you said. Weird stuff,\" Mariah said, turning Jessica to face her. \"But I think I found something you might be looking for.\"</span></div></div>",

I understand that know. It's not indestructible, at least not to me. The voice, it speaks to me, louder and clearer now, it's calling me... I try to fight it, yet it always win. It's trying to keep me away from something, and now I think I know what - - Itself. It's greatest strength is it's greatest weakness, only then can it be undone. But time is short, the children grow quickly in both my wife and my mother.  Soon they shall be here.  </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" Jessica asks, rubbing her belly where she just felt a very powerful kick. <br>\r\n\"Don't ask me, I'm not the author.\" Mariah says, flipping through the pages of the very large tomb. \"Where did you say you got this again?\" She asks, raising an eyebrow towards Jessica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh - - - a friend\" Jessica asks, telling a half-truth. <br>\r\n\"Well, wherever he got it from, tell him that author of this thing is one freaky mamba-jamba\" Mariah says, examining the pages. <br>\r\n\"I mean, this is some Paranormal Activity or Blair Witch style shit in book form. Hell, I'm almost convinced that this \"Magic Coin\" almost exists. I mean, look at this entry from someone who talks about their brother's pregnancy. I mean, photos and everything, it's almost like it was real!\" Mariah said with chuckle looking over the book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Almost real\" Jessica said to herself, slowly wrapping her hands around her expanded midsection, a decent amount of firm, belly flesh hanging out from the hemline of her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll look over more of it later. I mean, it seems like an interesting book, and the fact that's it written in so many languages, make it seem  that much more real. But, if you want my opinion, I think the author needs to include a page of translations or something, because no-one will be able follow this difficult storyline without them\" Mariah said, closing the book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell him that\" Jessica said, her hands still wrapped around her belly. \"You must be starving Jessica, why don't you take a long lunch or something? Get that kid something to eat\" Mariah said with a smile. <br>\r\n\"Are you sure about that?\" Jessica asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, go on. Go eat something.\" Mariah said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you want anything?\" Jessica asked, getting her purse from behind the counter. <br>\r\n\"Nah. I'm good. I'm not the pregnant one\" Mariah said, teasing her expectant friend. <br>\r\nJessica responded with something equally catty, before waddling off to find her, and her unborn children something to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mariah watched her pregnant leave, her smile turned into a frown. <br>\r\n\"Jessica, how did managed to hide your pregnancy for so long? You weren't that big a few days ago. Why didn't you tell me earlier? You have my support\" Mariah said, as she turned back to her work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, BING-BONG, filled BooksBooksBooks as Mariah turned towards the customer who just walked in. <br>\r\n\"How can I help you ma'am? Looking for books on pregnancy and child-raising? Because it certainly looks like you're going to need some if you don't mind me saying so\" Mariah said, with a pleasant smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tense pause filled the air.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm looking for book similar to that. A friend of mine brought it in\" the 40-year old pregnant woman said, a devious smile on her face, a blank stare in her eyes, and a gleaming coin, in her hands, just ready to continue it's work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - -  Sometime Earlier - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye stood in her bra-and-underwear, admiring her expectant curves in the mirror, rubbing oils and creams all over her body. She had a smile on her face as she explored every curve of her body, taking it all in. Finally, after years of trying to get pregnant, to finally have the baby she knew she deserved, she was blessed four times over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a good person, and finally something happened to a good person. She was kind, loving, helping others before herself, and yet it seemed like she would never have a little version of herself to hold in her arms, to tell her that it loved her, to take care of her when she got older. But now she would have four, and she was beyond happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could barely believe just how pregnant she actually was as she delicately slide her hand over pregnant belly, admiring at how huge it was, and how far it stuck out in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was happy, and nothing could ever take that away from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Don't be so sure</span> the voice called to her in her head. She looked around confused, and when she looked back into the mirror, she wasn't pregnant. She was flat as a board, her unborn children missing, and she was looking older than she ever thought possible. <br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">The boy. The boy is close. The girl. She is with him. I can feel them through her. They have something Faye. Something that will take it all away from you. Keep the boy and the girl away from it. The bookstore. It's at the bookstore. Get it. Hide it. </span> The voice was not longer soothing or alien. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was down right terrifying. Something dark, otherworldly, and hungry sounding. But it's words pierced her head, making her mind go almost completely blank. But it was right, Jack and his girlfriend had to be stopped. They were going to take her family away from her. She couldn't allow it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping back to reality, she had the sudden desire to go to the bookstore. Humming to herself absentmindedly, she got dressed into her sexy maternity clothes, and headed out to her kitchen, where her husband was sitting to himself, a very serious look on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Charles. How is daddy doing today?\" Faye said with a smile, wrapping her arms around her sitting husband, her massive belly pressing into his back. \"Faye we need to talk\" Charles said sternly, taking his wife's arm off of him. <br>\r\nFaye happy mood changed instantly. \"What's wrong?\"She said. <br>\r\n\"I cheated on you Faye.\" Charles said, plainly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye could have been punched in the face by a heavyweight boxer and it would have hurt less than Charles words. <br>\r\n\"Wha - - What do you mean?\" Faye asked, hurt and anger seething up from inside of her. <br>\r\n\"Right before you got pregnant. I cheated on you with a girl at a shop. I think her name was April or Amber or something.\" Charles said plainly. <br>\r\n\"Wh-wh-wh-wh-\" Faye said, fighting back tears. <br>\r\n\"Why? Because it wasn't working between us for a long time Faye. We've been trying for some many years, and for so many years we were denied. I just - - - I just couldn't take it anymore. I was getting older, you were getting older, it was- -  it was starting to show. So late one night I went out for a few drinks, and there she was. She just got off work, she was in this sexy little uniform. I bought her a few drinks, we had some laughs, and we - - - \" Charles said, the shame piling on top of him. <br>\r\n\"You son of a - - - \" Faye nearly shouted at the top of her lungs. <br>\r\n\"There's more\" Charles said, closing his eyes. <br>\r\nFaye stood quiet and angry and very pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's pregnant. Almost ready to pop. And she tracked me down one day at lunch. I don't know how. Probably those damn social networking sites. But she gave me this\" Charles said, handing a note over to Faye. <br>\r\nFaye read it to herself, fighting back tears, mouthing along the words. <br>\r\n\"She wants to what?!\" Faye said. <br>\r\n\"She wants to move in with us. She's willing to forgo suing me for child support if she can move in with us, raise our children together\" Charles said, slamming his head against the table.<br>\r\n\"How did she I find out I was pregnant?\" Faye asked. <br>\r\n\"Those damn social networking sites I guess. If we say no, she'll drag us to court after the babies - - \"<br>\r\n\"BABIES?\" Faye shouted. <br>\r\n\"Yes, she's pregnant with twins\" Charles said to himself. \"She'll drag us to court after the babies are born and sue me for child-support. Faye.. We can't afford that.\" Charles said.<br>\r\n\"So you're going to allow this? Some strange woman - - your little.. whore move in with us!\" Faye shouted at the top of her lungs. <br>\r\n\"If she takes us to court, she'll win, and with the lawyer fees and child-support fees, not to mention the babies.. We'll be bankrupt Faye. But, if we let her move in.. We can pool all our money. Take care of all these children properly...\" Charles said, rubbing his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere, heard only to Faye, the coin laughed as it feasted on the spreading chaos it was deftly spreading with it's magics. It had the power to rewrite reality, and it did it's job well, at least to those whose reality had been re-written. Yet, as it feasted, it hungered for more. <br>\r\nFaye felt like the bottom of the world has been dropped out beneath her. Some strange woman, some.. skank, who slept with her husband was out-there, carrying the half-brothers or half-sisters of her children, and now she dared to try to force her way and her bastard children into their perfect little lives. She wanted to strangle her husband, after all, it was his fault, but she would deal with later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed to get that book. It was knowing thought at the back of her head, driving her even more crazy than this situation allowed. Without thinking, she reached into the pocket and pulled out the coin. <br>\r\n\"Faye, what are you doing?\" <br>\r\n\"Heads, we take our chances. Tails, we let her move in.\" Faye said, as she flipped the coin, and stared straight at her husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, she caught in her hand, looking at her husband, opening her hand to reveal... Tails. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Faye smiled sweetly as Mariah looked between her and the massive tome behind the counter of the service desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another book like this? I'm not sure I've ever seen any others. I'm not even sure if this is published,\" Mariah said. As she talked, she tried to peer over the desk's edge to see just how big Faye's belly was. <i>She'd better buy some baby books quick, because she looks like she's about a month overdue</i>, Mariah thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, well, like I said, a friend of mine brought it in for me,\" Faye repeated, sloping her hand across her roundness as one of her quads gave her a particularly sharp kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah tried to put the pieces together. \"A friend from a lamaze class? Another pregnant girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye's eyes lit up. This girl was believing her lie. \"Yes, that's the one.\" <i>So, Jack's girlfriend got knocked up too. Didn't think the kid had it in him</i>. \"So, if I could just-\" Faye reached over the desk for the book but Mariah slowly placed her hand over its cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, Jess never said she wanted me to look it over. She's on lunch now, but she should be back pretty soon. Is it okay if you just wait until she gets back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye was certainly not okay with it. She had the hormones of four pregnancies raging inside her and she just found out that her husband was having an affair and his mistress was moving in with them. She was in no position to be turned away from what she wanted. But, instead she just smiled and beamed her motherly glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem at all! Thank you very much for your time,\" she said, turning and waddling away. Mariah continued to watch her, both with caution and with curiosity. Faye walked between some shelves and watched Mariah from her hidden spot. Then, she flipped the Coin in her hands as it landed on Tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Mariah's belly swelled out to huge proportions, making any onlooker assume she was just about near the end of her pregnancy. Mariah looked down at her belly, feeling her now-exposed skin with a cautious hand, a terrified look on her face. She walked as quickly as she could to the back of the store, trying to hold her belly for support. Faye preened as she walked casually over to the desk and picked up the book herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Faye left the store, she saw a familiar face and a familiar belly: Amanda Dale. \"Hi Faye,\" Amanda said happily as Faye slipped the book into her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Amanda,\" Faye said, struggling to give the equally pregnant woman a hug. \"How have you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright, I suppose,\" Amanda said, resting one hand on her huge belly. \"When I was pregnant with Jack, there wasn't much in the way of baby books, so I figured I would try to find something here. There must be at least one book on how to raise multiple babies at once, right?\" Amanda laughed softly. \"How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've got just about every baby book you can name,\" Faye chuckled, \"but I like coming down here. The quiet sounds of the bookstore put the little ones at ease.\" Faye rubbed both hands across her belly for emphasis. \"Say, when Jack gets back home, would you mind sending him over to my house? I need some help with some chores. Charles is...unavailable and I'm, well...\" Faye lightly bumped her belly against Amanda's. \"You understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Jack---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at work, Jack was just finishing up stacking the rest of the boxes. The front of the shop wasn't too busy but he couldn't seem to find Amber anywhere. Looking around the place, Jack heard some noise coming from the supply closet in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amber?\" Jack asked, opening the door. Inside, he found Amber sitting on the floor, hands around her belly, tears streaming down her face. \"H-hey, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what do you care?\" Amber choked, wiping her nose with a handkerchief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack sat down next to his manager, keeping the door closed behind them. \"I care plenty. What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber lazily lifted her hand to show that she was holding her cell phone. \"I got what I wanted. The guy who knocked me up is letting me move in with him and his equally pregnant wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack got nervous. This was a lot more drama that he was anticipating. \"O-oh, well, if that's what you wanted-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't want that, Jack! I never wanted my life to turn out like this. I mean, sure, it seemed like the best way out when I asked him to move in, but it's still a shitty situation. And now that it's actually staring me in the face, I just...\" Amber started crying against, clutching her belly more tightly. Jack cautiously wrapped one arm around her shoulder. \"Sorry. Hormones, I guess,\" Amber sniffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, you have a right to be upset. It would be scary for anyone,\" Jack said, Ms. Smart's word ringing in his head. <i>Feeding on the chaos</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Strong Hands,\" Amber managed to joke, resting her head on his shoulder. \"There is one other solution, though. There's a pregnant bikini contest and there's a pretty nice cash prize involved. If I win that, I might have a chance to keep my head above water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think you have a good shot at winning,\" Jack said, his body shaking nervously. \"Y-you're really pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Amber said, lifting her head, looking into Jack's eyes. \"Even pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack gulped. \"E-especially pregnant.\" Amber's eyelids were heavy and she brought her face closer to Jack's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Jessica---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was sitting at the mall, by herself, eating a caesar wrap with an enormous pregnant belly in her lap. All in all, a pretty depressing sight. She looked around the maternity clothing store a bit before she went to eat, but she didn't buy anything. For one, she didn't have the time on her lunch break, but she was also anxious to try things on...with Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I understand ma'am. Thank you for your time!\" An overly cheerful voice said behind Jessica. A chubby guy walked up next to her table, holding a clipboard. \"Christ, you don't have to be such an asshole about it,\" the voice's owner grunted. He turned to see Jessica and gave a little smile. \"Sorry about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" Jessica smiled. \"I used to have to do survey work at my school, so I know how rude people can be. Want to take a load off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" the man said, sitting down in the oversized mall bench next to Jessica. \"I'm Oven from-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Sandwich and Oven. Yeah, I've heard you before. My friend listens to your station a lot,\" Jessica said. Oven's smile relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, we love the support,\" he said. \"I'm actually signing people up for our big pregnant bikini contest this week. After all of the pregnant people who showed up here a few days ago, I figured I get a lot more people to sign up, but...no luck, I suppose.\" As he turned from his clipboard to Jessica, he noticed her baby bump. \"Say...you're probably a bit smaller than our other contests, belly-wise, but would you think about signing up? The crowds at these sorts of things usually like someone who's less pregnant anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was hesitant. \"Um, I dunno. What would I have to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crafty smile went across Oven's face. He'd been working in marketing for his station before he became an on-air personality. Time to work his magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not much. Wear a bikini, parade around with other pregnant women, maybe dance a little. And you've got a good shot to win the cash prizes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's ears perked up. \"Cash prize?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nine grand,\" he said. Jessica's hand moved to her belly. If she and Jack didn't figure things out with this coin, she would definitely need the money to support her baby...or babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, this sounds like fun,\" Jessica said, signing the clipboard enthusiastically. Oven grinned and he decided to push his luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And actually, one of the women we had planned as one of the helpers in the event is changing her mind and is entering the event herself,\" Oven said, not adding that Liza had looked perfectly barren the day before and now was ready to birth a litter any second. \"So, do you know anyone who might want to go in her place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was about to say no, but then a funny idea crossed her mind. \"Sure, I can think of someone,\" she said, signing Jack's name and e-mail onto the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Oven said, happy with his day's spoils. \"See you again in a few days!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Oven thanked her and walked away, two heavily pregnant women were watching Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she's the one?\" Ms. Quick asked, caressing her massive belly as it strained her non-maternity dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. We need to talk to her too,\" Ms. Apple said, her breasts and belly straining the buttons on her white, collared shirt. \"And then we need to track down whatever idiot has another version of the coin and is flipping it around at random.\"</span></div></div>",

If one had to classify on a scale over one to ten, the amount of idiocy that came from Ian, well, good person, it would be over 9000. (Author's note: I'm sorry, but not really). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan didn't real manage a coffee shop, that was just a convenient lie he told to his best friend Jack, because well, Ian was embarrassed. Ian felt like he sold out, given into the man, hung up the idea of changing the world for a safe and well paying 9-to-5. Ian always wanted to do something that would change the world, and little did Ian actually know, as he sat there, watching men and women go by, flipping the coin, chewing on his pen, that he REALLY was changing the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ian watched a beautiful woman, (easily a solid 9 in Ian's book) drag along her boyfriend (some douchebag who dressed like a douchebag, or at least that's what he was to Ian. Any guy who has a seriously hot girlfriend that Ian wanted, was a douchebag in Ian's book) along the street, he flipped the coin, it landing \"Heads\" side up as he chewed on his pen, his attention was turned away from the window (where he would might have seen the consequences of his actions, and might have stopped everything before it spiral further out of control) by the barking voice of his boss, Ryan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IAN!\" He shouted at the top of his lungs, causing Ian to spin his chair around and face his boss. \"Ah, hey boss. What's going on?\" Ian said, putting the coin on the desk, and trying his best (and failing) to make it look like he was busy. <br>\r\n\"Where are those reports I asked for?\" Ryan asked, veins popping out the side of his neck. Ryan Martin was your average 40ish something manager. His hair was salt-and-peppered as the pigment in his hair went, he had a goatee, and was slightly paunchy as, well he tried to work out as often as he good, in the last desperate throws to save what was left of his good looks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, reports?\" Ian said, trying to think of a lie fast. <br>\r\n\"Didn't you get my several emails I sent you?\" Ryan said, the vein in the his neck almost trying to escape his fleshy prison.<br>\r\n\"No man, I've been.. uh.. busy\" Ian said, shuffling papers on his desk, completly distracted as the very pretty woman that he just spied moments earlier came waddling behind the window, one hand in the small of her back, the other gripping the hand of her equally pregnant boyfriend, the other hand resting on his expectant midsection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well make yourself un-busy!\" Ryan shouted at Ian, his attention not focused on the pregnant man and his pregnant girlfriend who just waddled by the window. \"We're swamped today, and this place is a damn ghost-town today! Greg's still out with his broken leg, both Tara and Amanda are out on maternity leave - - -\" Ryan said, listing off everything that seemed to be going wrong all at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have an Amanda who works here? How come I've never met her?\" Ian asked, looking at his boss. \"And Rick's dealing with some \"emergency\" family situation... He said something about a wife, or a sister, or an aunt or someone suddenly becoming pregnant or something. I don't know, sounds like a bunch of crap, but legally I can't argue against \"personal emergency\" days ever since we got sued three years ago.\" Ryan says, not even batting an eye at Ian's question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're down FOUR people, and today I just found out that we're taking part in some local contest that some rock station is putting on.\" Ryan said, rubbing his temples. \"Contest? What contest?\" Ian asked. \"Something about a bikini contest or something. I don't know just - - - \" Ryan said before being cut off by Ian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, I'd like to help out in anyway I can to make sure that this bikini contest that we're sponsoring goes off without a hitch. Matter of fact sir, I'd like to volunteer my services to - - -\" Ian said with a smile, not aware of what was really about to go on. <br>\r\n\"Well, I'm glad you're taking initiative, for a change, but that won't be necessary, as you're already doing it\" Ryan said. <br>\r\n\"Oh - - \" Ian said, trying to mask his excitement. <i>All those beautiful fly honeys in those sexy bikinis.. ah man. I've hit the jackpot!  </i> Ian thought to himself, imaging himself being drowned by eye-candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you checked my email, you'll see all the reports I need done by the contest in a few days. Nothing to complex, just something you can show to the people outside the contest to get them to sign up with our bank. Also, see if you can get the contestants as well, really sell to these ladies the importance of saving for their future of their children\" Ryan said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh---- okay\" Ian said, mildly confused.  Anyone else would have remembered the \"special\" bikini contest being held by 101.9 THE EDGE, and would have put Ryan's comments together, but alas, Ian was a special kind of idiot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, have something for me by the end of tomorrow. This is basic level work Ian, any idiot can do it, SO DON'T LET ME DOWN AND PROVE TO ME YOU AREN'T WHAT I THINK YOU ARE\" Ryan said, pointing his finger at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah\" Ian said, picking up his coin as his boss left. <i>Man, I really, really hate that guy. He's such a jerk, always insulting me and shit. I should report him or something. I'm sick of this. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Heads I let it go, Tails I tell that sonofabitch of\" Ian thought to himself, flipping the coin, watching his boss as he left. The coin landed in his hands, \"Heads\" side up as he watched his boss walk away. \"You got lucky this time\" Ian said to himself, taking his eyes of his boss and firing up his work computer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan worked to himself for a few minutes, planning out the reports and whatnot he would need for this bikini contest they were sending him too, as Ryan went from desk to desk, cubicle to cubicle checking up on his underlings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan half-listend into a conversation between Ryan and an older co-worker Yolanda as he typed away. <br>\r\n\"Why, boss. How are we feeling today?\" Yolanda said in such a sugary sweet tone that it could rot your teeth. <br>\r\n\"Just waiting for all of this to be over.\" Ryan said, exhaustion present in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan continued to tap away on the keys, slowly killing the time to lunch and killing more time till he can go home. <i>Maybe all of this was a mistake. I should have just gone back to the Coffee Shop and continued trying to sell my screenplay</i> Ian thought to himself. <br>\r\n\"How's the wife taking it?\" Yolanda asked.<br>\r\n\"Going baby crazy. Already painted the room twice, said she wanted something gender neutral. I honestly never thought we would ever have kids let alone \" Ryan said before being interrupted by Yolanda. <br>\r\n\"That' you'd be doing most of the work?\" Yolanda said, a laughter at the tip of her tongue. <br>\r\n\"Yeah. My back is killing me, my feet are swollen, my chest is killing me.  Honestly, I can't believe women go through all the time.\" Ryan said. <br>\r\n\"Well, men in your.. condition are slowly becoming more common. God knows what's causing it, but you heard the news report from the mall the other day, and all the interviews from other men who became..... well look at you\" Yolanda said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a bad screenplay Ian thought. It just needed some refinement.. But refinement didn't pay the bills, and ever since his roommate moved out (okay, fine dumped him) he needed something more.. stable. He never really had much interests in banks, but somehow he applied and was hired. It took care of everything he needed, but still, he felt like some part of him died whenever he clocked in here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough maybe, this bikini contest might just inspire him to do better in this husk of a corporate job. At least, Ian hoped. <br>\r\n\"At least I've Tara to help me through the.. changes I've been going through\" Ryan said.<br>\r\n\"And not to mention Amanda. Did you see her the other day? Big as a house! At her age!\" Yolanda said. <br>\r\n\"I saw her, but didn't get a chance to talk to her. I was busy with other things\" Ryan answered.<br>\r\n\"What did the doctor say?\" Yolanda asked. <br>\r\n\"Healthy, but I need to keep my stress and anger down. It's not good for me\" Ryan answered.<br>\r\n\"The BOTH of you\" Yolanda corrected.<br>\r\n\"How could I forget? So, Tara's gone, Amanda's been placed on maternity leave, I'm going on my leave soon..\" Ryan said. <br>\r\n\"It's like it's spreading around the office!\" Yolanda said with a laugh. <br>\r\n\"How knows Yolanda, you might catch it next\" Ryan joked. <br>\r\n\"At my age?\" Yolanda asked.<br>\r\n\"Stranger things have happened. I mean, look at me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, his work somewhere between somewhat started and somewhat finished, Ian got up from his chair, grabbed his coin, and walked out of Titan Bank, on his way to his lunch hour, punching out in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a beautiful day. The sun was shining, it was not to hot, the birds were singing. Ian, bobbing his head along to the music blaring from the headphones from his MP3 player, strutted down the street, a sub sandwich in one hand, an ice cold refreshing bottle of water in the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack strutted down the boulevard, taking in the sights of the downtown city walk. Stores, tourist attractions, everything anybody could ever want was on this long stretch of street, and Jack was (in his mind) the king of it all right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing his sandwich and downing the water, he threw away the trash, and started his next favorite activity aside from eating, sleeping, gaming, drinking and.... lady \"relations\" having.... people watching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked past the street artists, shops, kiosks, fountains, he reached into his pocket, fishing out his coin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love Jack like a brother, but man, I think he's honestly losing it\" Ian said. \"I mean, he made this big deal about you, and so far, you done exactly squat. Hmm. Look at me, talking to you like you're going to answer me. Maybe I'm going to be the crazy one?\" Ian asked the coin, not expecting a response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">I like you</span> an alien voice buzzed through Ian's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like myself too\" Ian said to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan was a special kind of idiot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud angry rock filled the air, catching Ian's attention. Following the sweet gothic rock sound, he was lead to a very special discovery: The Lady Machine. The Lady Machine as it was, was an all gothic rock band made up of four girls who at this very moment, was preforming to a very small and very unamused crowd in the middle of the plaza. The women, dressed in all black, with face piercings, dyed hair with bright neon tips, white face makeup, ripped up t-shirts, combat boots, were rocking it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan drank them in, each one of their womanly features being absorbed into his mind's eye. He was in love with every girl in the band. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is the end! No more no less!</i> The lead singer screamed out, carrying out the spirit of goth rock onto the quickly vanishing crowd, obviously not impressed with what they were hearing. THE LADY MACHINE, CD'S 5 DOLLARS. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan stood there for the longest time, falling in and out of love with each member of the band, before realizing that he was going to be late back to work. Man, if he was late again from lunch... He had no idea what his boss would do to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching into his pocket, he pulled out a few bucks and some change and tossed into the little box set up in front of the band. As he chucked the last of the money in the bin, he didn't notice a scratched silver coin end up into the box, \"Heads\" side up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around from the the goth rock band, he suddenly was face to face with an almost smothering crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Where did they come from? There was hardly anyone here a second ago</i> Ian thought to himself as he tried to push his way through the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.. Sorry. Sorry. Excuse me\" Ian said, breaking through the crowd. As he went through the crowd, he noticed a few of the people there had T-Shirts with the name \"Mommy Kills Best\" written on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hmm. Must be some kind of new brand of clothing or something</i> Ian thought to himself as he continued to push through the crowd.<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like minutes, Ian finally made it out through the gathered mass of people, and started making his way back to the office. <br>\r\n\"Man, what a massive group of people. I can't even see that band anymore. What was there name again? Lady Machines or something?\" Ian said, trying to look back at the band, but seeing nothing but a sea of onlookers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. I'll search for it later or something. They were pretty good, and damn fine looking\" Ian said to himself, walking back to the office. <br>\r\nBack on stage, The Lady Machines were no more. Oh, it wasn't because like all great bands they broke up, it was because you see, The Lady Machines never existed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocking out on stage right now was the viral internet sensation \"Mommy Kills Best\", made up of entirely the same girls who were once The Lady Machines, but were now all rocking out on stage in skimpy outfits, and very, very, pregnant. The sign next to them, no longer a crappy sign written on cardboard, was an official sign advertising \"Mommy Kills Best\" headlining 101.9 The Edge's Pregnant Bikini Contest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Look at what you made!<br>\r\nLook at what you gave me! <br>\r\nLook at how I killed you!<br>\r\nBorn to die!<br>\r\nBorn to die!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very expectant main singer, followed by her very pregnant drummer, her very pregnant bassist and her very pregnant guitarist, joined their  signer for the chorus of their hit song \"Born To Die\" from their upcoming hit album \"And The Cradle Will Fall\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressed in a pair of black lingerie, a dog collar, and several piercings on her face, stomach, and nose, the lead signer continued to belt the closing refrain of the song, while the crowd breathed in their performance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F--- you very much everyone! We're \"Mommy Kills Best\", the world's only pregnant goth metal band, buy our cds, buy our t-shirts, buy our new maternity wear, just buy our stuff, we're going to have kids to feed, and continue to rock the f--- on. Don't miss us tomorrow on the news, and be sure to see us live at the pregnant bikini contest coming up from 101.9 The Edge! Good afternoon! Our backs are killing us!\" The lead signer shouted into her microphone, throwing up some middle fingers, and waddling off the stage with the rest of her band, and making their way to the back as the crowd screamed for more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - Just a little bit later - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan was almost there, almost back to work on time. <br>\r\n\"Are you sure we have to find her?\" the woman asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes. She knows where Jack is. He's running out of time. We have to make sure that she keeps him on track\" <br>\r\nIan was about to pull his ID to open the employee entrance when he felt.. it in his pocket. <br>\r\nThe coin. Crazy Jack's crazy coin.<br>\r\n\"Didn't I give you to that awesome band The Lady Machine?\" He asked the coin. <br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Don't worry about it</span> the coin answered back to him. <br>\r\n\"Meh. I'm sure I just gave them some extra change. Probably a good thing too. It would be a real dick move to just give a nothing band just a worthless coin. <br>\r\n\"Well, what do you think? Heads I finish all the work today, or Tails I just do half the work and just screw around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmiring a pair of two very beautiful women who seemed to be having a very important conversation close to him, he flipped his coin, caught it, and saw that it landed on \"Tails\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, half work time, half time to screw around on the internet\" Ian said to himself, going through the employee entrance, the loud KA-CHUNK of the automatic door blocking out the screams from the two women across the street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we - - - -\" one of them said, grabbing her newly pregnant belly.<br>\r\n\"I think we are\" the other said.<br>\r\n\"We need to find Jack, and quick\" one of them said. <br>\r\n\"Yes. But first, I'm starving, and suddenly have to pee\" the other said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd inside, Ian blissfully worked away for a few minutes, then screwed around on the internet for another chunk of time, switching between work and screwing around for the rest of his work day.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan was a special kind of idiot. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>---Present Day---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan was scrolling through IGN forums, trying to find some fun moves to try out when he went back to playing Zombie Massacre Mania 2. It looked like the North part of the city the game took place in had some nice building layouts so he could corral hoards of zombies into an enclosed space and take them all out quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, his e-mail pinned and Ian groaned, moving his mouse back to look at the messages. It was from Lisa Smith, one of the event's organizers from the radio station. \"Blah blah blah...very interested...open to more diversity of prizes, okay,\" Ian mumbled to himself. He e-mailed Lisa as soon as he got back from lunch, figuring it would be at least one easy step that he could tell his boss he took. But now he had to look and find a way for the bank to get more prizes. \"More phone calls...\" he grumbled again, making a note of it on a sheet of paper in front of him. Then, another part of the e-mail caught Ian's eyes. \"Blah blah...won't be able to help with the contestants because I'll be competing as well?...need you to take my place with the contestants?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan sat up excitedly in his seat. He wasn't just organizing this dumb PR stunt for the bank - he'd get to interact with these bikinied beauties too. A happy grin crawled across Ian's face. Suddenly, he had an incentive to get as many people to this thing as possible. Ian quickly googled pictures of Lisa Smith, ogling her \"pre-pregnancy\" body, thinking about what she must look like in a bikini...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---At the Mall---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's talk to her,\" Ms. Quick said, starting to move toward Jessica, who was just finishing her meal. Every step she took was interrupted by Ms. Apple's new, pregnant belly bumping against Ms. Quick's own. \"Watch it, will you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I've only had this belly for about an hour. I'm not used to being pregnant like you,\" Ms. Apple sarcastically replied, adjusting her steps to try and waddle forward. By the feel of things, she was carrying more than one baby and every occupant of her womb was incredibly active, which didn't help the recent mom-to-be maneuver herself very quickly. In the past, the coin made Ms. Apple the sudden and unexpected child of her mother while her father was overseas in Desert Storm. He was not thrilled to find that his wife had a baby while he was deployed for well-over nine months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Quick, on the other hand, had been a high school senior and a promising candidate for any university she wanted. Then the coin rolled into her life and interrupted that all a bit. She ended up giving her resulting twins up for adoption but she was never able to get quite back into the prestigious future she had worked for, especially after her family disowned her as soon as they found out about the pregnancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two, now pregnant again thanks to Ian's reckless coin-flipping, made their awkward way over to Jessica, they were cut off by a grinning man with a clipboard. \"Hello ladies, my name is Oven from-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out of the way!\" Ms. Apple panted. She could see Jessica throw her food in the trash and start to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to tell you about the pregnant bikini contest 101.9 is throwing-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, fine, whatever!\" Ms. Quick yelled, grabbing the pen and messily signing her name on the clipboard. As they turned to try and find Jessica, Oven stopped Ms. Apple as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you? There are prizes available!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" Ms. Apple screamed, signing her name as well and shoving Oven out of the way as the pair looked for Jessica. \"We don't have time for this! If you don't want to end up like one of those pregnant men on the news, leave us alone!\" Ms. Apple and Ms. Quick slowly waddled off, looking for Jessica, who by this point had gotten a long head start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right,\" Oven said under his breath, looking at their names on his board. \"A pregnant man. Like that'll happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Jessica---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica returned to Books Books Books, rubbing her belly gently as she felt the little one, or little ones, inside her stir just a bit as she digested their meal. Little moments like that made Jessica a bit happy to be pregnant, but she still hoped that Mariah had made some headway with translating the book. Being pregnant was one thing, raising babies were another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked over to the counter, she couldn't find the book anywhere. Jessica picked up papers, looked under every surface she could, but no sign of the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone see Mariah?\" Jessica asked an employee walking by. She was pointed toward the back offices, where she quickly waddled to. \"Hey Mariah?\" Jessica piped up, seeing her friend's short haircut over a shelf. Then, as she got closer, she saw Mariah clutching her massive belly, looking at it with awe. \"Oh...oh no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess?\" Mariah said, turning to face her. \"Is...is this what happened to you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica nodded and sat next to her friend, wrapping her arm over Mariah's shoulder. \"Sorta.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah turned back to look at her belly, full-term with twins. \"I can feel them...moving...inside me. This is real,\" she said, before anxiously looking back at Jessica. \"I can't raise a family now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey,\" Jessica said, rubbing Mariah's back to comfort her. \"You know that book I had you look over? It's got the answer to undo all of this, and if anyone can figure it out, it's you.\" Mariah smiled and looked back at Jessica with a smile, wiping a stray tear from her eye. \"Now, where is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah shrugged. \"Back at the counter, I guess. I didn't take it with me.\" Her eyebrow turned up in concern. \"You mean it's...not there?\" Jessica's face sunk as she shook her head. \"I don't...wait, there was a woman here who wanted it. She was the biggest pregnant woman I've ever seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, did she have sort of shoulder-length brown hair?\" Jessica said, trying to describe Jack's mom as best she could. If you were talking about gigantic pregnant bellies, the only person that came to mind to Jessica was Amanda Dale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really,\" Mariah said, starting to get worried. \"But trust me: with a belly that big, she'll be hard to miss. You and I can canvas all of the maternity events that seem to be popping up around town lately.\" Mariah paused and thought a second. \"These can't all be separate...something's going on beyond just you and me, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorta,\" Jessica said with a weak grin. \"I'll explain it to you as we walk...or waddle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica and Mariah went to the epicenter of the massive pregnancy outbreak - the mall - to see what kind of clues lay there. While the incident that made the news had long since past, there were plenty of pregnant women (and men with bulging middles) walking around, some happily rubbing their baby-filled tummies, other nervously feeling their swollen flesh. The first place they tried was the maternity clothing store, where they both made some headway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, there was a woman with hair like you described, but there was another one with her,\" the store's owner said. \"She was just as big. I told corporate they were crazy when they wanted us to stock sizes that big, but I guess it paid off in the end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And they were shopping <i>together</i>?\" Jessica asked, getting another nod from the store's owner. \"Then Jack's mom must at least know her,\" Jessica said to Mariah. \"I know where we've got to go next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While you're here, why don't you ladies pick out some new outfits?\" the owner said, motioning to Jessica and Mariah's pregnant bulges, both of which were exposed by their non-maternity shirts. \"I know exposed pregnant bellies are the 'hip look' now, but we've got clothes that can accentuate that look right here in store!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe some other time,\" Jessica said with an apologetic face. \"But if we come back, we'll probably pick up some baby clothes too.\" <i>But hopefully</i>, Jessica thought, <i>it won't come to that</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two left, Oven spotted Jessica's familiar face and walked over. \"Hey, I see you brought a friend!\" he said, holding out his clipboard suggestively. \"So, would you like to sign up too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but did any, like, HUGELY pregnant women sign up for this?\" Jessica asked, hoping he might have a lead. Oven chuckled and rolled his eyes a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite a few, way beyond anything I'm used to.\" Mariah and Jessica turned to each other with a worried expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If there lots of women, we'll need another set of eyes at this pregnant bikini contest to find the woman who took the book,\" Mariah said. \"Yes, I'd like to sign up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOven handed her the clipboard with another big smile on his face. Four signatures in about half as many hours. \"So you've heard about our contest, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah blushed as she filled out the form. \"W-well, I just heard about it on the radio. In passing, you know.\" Oven and Jessica both looked at her with a curious glance as Oven took back the form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, looking forward to seeing both of you there. Good luck,\" he said, walking off to find someone else, stopping briefly to rub his swollen ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, we should talk to Jack's mom,\" Jessica said. \"That woman she was with at the clothing store might be the same one who took the book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show me the way,\" Mariah said.</span></div></div>",

In the past chapter, please read Ms. Quick as Ms. Smart)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Amanda Dale---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda reached down and pressed play on her little boom box. The CD whirred inside and soon the piano and bass begin to trickle out. Taking a deep breath, Amanda took the first step in her routine, swinging her hips to move her quadruplet-filled belly along with her in tandem. Each step flowed into the next, and soon Amanda was moving through the room in a graceful dance, running her hands across her belly at each major movement. She may have already had experience moving around while pregnant, but carrying four babies as opposed to just carrying Jack was quite a bit different. Still, Amanda was helped by the contest's format, as she only had on a maternity bikini she'd smartly picked out when she went shopping with Faye. No step felt hindered by the occasional bagginess of maternity clothing and the bikini gave her growing bosom ample support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about half an hour of this practice, Amanda took a break, running a cloth across her huge belly and between her breasts to sop up all of the sweat. Moving with this much new weight was quite the workout, but she was also filled with an incredible new energy that helped her power through and dance to her heart's content. And it was important to practice, because if the past days had taught Amanda anything, it's that her belly is going to keep growing by surprising amounts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went over the routine again in her head, listening to the music as she leaned back and rubbed her belly. It was a somewhat vanilla routine, especially compared to the options the man at the mall had given her, like pole-dancing and twerking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No matter how I may look now, a woman in her 50s should not be twerking,\" Amanda said to herself. Still, she wasn't too concerned. This was going to be a very polished routine, and if nothing else, belly size should account for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda looked at herself in the mirror, stroking the sides of her big belly. Even when being pregnant was reasonable and she imagined what she might look like when she found out she was pregnant with Jack 25 years ago, she never imagined she would be this big. \"And I'm not even done...\" Amanda sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock at the door. Amanda slipped on some quick clothing to cover her current lewd dress and waddled to the door. Much to her surprise, two other pregnant women were waiting for her, one with brilliant red hair and the other with lush dark hair. \"Is this the Dale residence?\" the dark haired woman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is,\" Amanda said, running her hand under her own belly as she looked at both of theirs. \"Can I help you with anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, we're looking for Jack Dale Jr., but...I think we have some important information for you too,\" the red-haired woman said, looking at Amanda's belly with surprise. \"May we come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda thought about it and agreed. Of course it wasn't typically a good idea to let strangers into the house, but the shared pregnancy among them made Amanda feel a kind of shared kinship with the women. After awkwardly getting stuck trying to walk into the doorway at the same time in their heavy pregnant states, both women made it inside and sat on the couch across from Amanda, who took the sitting opportunity to open up her sweat pants and give her belly some room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Ms. Smart, and this is Ms. Apple,\" the red-haired woman said, before the dark-haired woman whispered in her ear (\"this is why I didn't want codenames\"). \"I mean, other way around. We're working on a study of families where one member is having children at a later age. According to our information, your current pregnancy came about as a bit of a surprise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...yes, I suppose you could say that,\" Amanda chuckled nervously, holding her belly a little closer, not sure just how much information to give away. I've only known I was pregnant for a few days now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know how many days?\" Ms. Smart asked directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-excuse me?\" Amanda said, surprised by the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know exactly how many days you know that you've been pregnant?\" Ms. Smart said again, resting a hand against her own belly as her newly added children began kicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I guess it was about three days now. But I got suspicious before then, but only for a few days or so.\" Ms. Smart and Ms. Apple turned to one another, whispering \"six days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we've already talked to your son and we saw that he had an interesting coin with him. You wouldn't know anyone else who has a similar coin, do you?\" Ms. Apple asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought this was a survey about me being a pregnant old lady,\" Amanda grumbled, still annoyed by their first question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's doing a study on that. I'm studying rare artifacts,\" Ms. Apple said. The two of them were pretty lousy liars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I haven't seen another coin like that, but he left it in our car a few days ago and I think my neighbor Faye took it. She's not as old as me, but she's just as pregnant,\" Amanda snipped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Apple and Ms. Smart looked at each other and slowly got up. \"Well, thank you very much for your time, Mrs. Dale. Hopefully we'll see you again,\" Ms. Apple said, adjusting her shirt to keep her heavy breasts covered, both of them taking on additional size thanks to her sudden pregnancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me some warning next time,\" Amanda said with a fake smile, leading the two women out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Jack Dale Jr.---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amber,\" Jack said softly as his manager moved her lips close to his. His head was swimming with emotions. Ever since high school he'd dreamed of being with Jessica and now he was. But Amber was just as beautiful and Jessica told him that last night didn't mean anything anyway. Maybe...he could just-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's phone aggressively buzzed in his pocket and Amber paused, looking down to the source of the small noise. Jack brought the phone to his ear while Amber gazed at him with a 1000-yard stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack! It's Jessica. Look, big problem: the book's gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gone?\" Jack said, looking over at Amber and blushing profoundly, a terrible guilt rocking his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but we think we have a lead. It might have been a friend of your mom's. A <u>pregnant</u> friend,\" Jessica said. Jack rolled his eyes. That could be practically anybody nowadays. \"We're headed over to your place to ask her. Do you get off work soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty soon,\" Jack said. Amber was breathing heavily, biting her bottom lip with just the edge of one of her front teeth. \"I can help you figure things out...we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of my co-workers and I. She was translating the book but she ended up, well, like me and the book probably got stolen by some huge pregnant lady,\" Jessica said in a fury. \"I've got to hang up the light's turning green butwe'lltalkokaybye!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone clicked off and Jack turned back to Amber. She could tell that it would be a no from him and she started to shake her head, putting on her usual, sarcastic face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Problems?\" Amber purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I have to go a little early today,\" he said, \"But trust me, it's in your interest to let me go too, not just mine.\" Amber was a taken aback by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just go, Strong Hands,\" she said, resting herself against the wall and heaving her fertile body up. \"I can still do plenty over here with the other employees I've got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Amber,\" Jack said, walking toward the door. \"Good luck with, um, everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber let out a deep sigh, her volatile emotions she was trying to keep at bay starting to surge back a bit. \"Don't worry about me, Strong Hands, just go do what you need to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack headed for his car and went home, unable to believe how close he came to kissing Amber. It hadn't even been 24 hours since he had sex with Jessica. His life was getting more and more hectic as the days went by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me</span> the coin beckoned to him for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no point in resisting anymore. Jack gave the coin a toss and looked up as the light changed and the coin landed on heads. And just his luck, he saw local newswoman Mia Vasquez reporting on the street corner. She was already carrying two babies thanks to the coin and now a third one was added to the mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Great</i>, Jack thought, a bit sarcastically, although a piece of him was thoroughly aroused by the gorgeous reporter growing even wider with child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, Jack appeared to have beaten Jessica and Mariah to his home, unaware that they had gotten massively side-tracked by two other pregnant women, Ms. Smart and Ms. Apple, but that's a story for another chapter. \"Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Jack,\" his mom called from her bedroom, still practicing her dance routine. \"You're home earlier than you said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well the schedule wasn't exactly set in stone,\" Jack said, looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could ask about the book, his mother waddled out of her bedroom, still in her bikini. The sight of his massively pregnant mother dressed like that sent shivers down Jack's spine, filling him with conflicting emotions. \"By the way, Faye said to go over to her place for some errands. Could you do that quickly, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faye's?\" Jack said, figuring that she's probably the only other truly \"huge\" pregnant woman besides his own mother that Jessica could be talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, don't worry Jack,\" his mother said with a giggle. \"She won't bite.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>--- Jessica ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack was walking into his parent's house, Jessica and Mariah were working their way onto the bus to try and get within walking distance of Jack's house. Jessica wasn't in much shape to drive and she'd managed to get to work by borrowing a ride from Mariah. Well, as of a few hours ago, Mariah wasn't exactly able to drive either. Perhaps even more so than Jessica. While the coin had Jessica nicely at five months pregnant with an as-of-yet determined number of fetuses, it cut out the middleman with Mariah. She was abundantly pregnant, nine months in, with what she had determined to be twins. Jessica may not have been able to cover up her pregnancy any more, but compared to Mariah, she was a feather weight. And neither of them were wearing clothes that exactly concealed their current condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking onto the bus took a bit longer than they thought. There was a line to get on and every other person was pregnant. When Jessica and Mariah squeezed their bellies past and waddled onto the bus, they could see a sea of bellies, some covered, some not. Normally it would be an odd sight to see a pregnant woman standing on a bus, but all of the seats were filled with mothers-to-be, all of who were no doubt a result of the coin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess and Mariah pushed in as much as they could, wombs bumping against wombs. As they moved past, Mariah clutched her own belly, the commotion causing her young to kick and move inside her - a feeling she was still not used to.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, buddy, let me have a seat. I'm pregnant!\" one woman yelled at a man sitting down next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So am I!\" he barked back, holding his hands around his swollen middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit, don't use those practical jokes about pregnant men on the news to fool me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, feel for yourself! They're kicking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole bus was filled with similar commotion. Some women cooing over their pregnancy, calling it a miracle, others angry that their husbands cheated on them and got the neighbor pregnant too, men in total disbelief of their situation. Jess and Mariah looked at one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's not just us?\" Mariah asked with a grimace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" Jessica said, looking around the bus. \"That thing about the mall on the news was all real. And Jack says he knows a lot more people personally that this has happened to, like...\" Jessica leaned in to whisper to Mariah. \"His mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yikes,\" Mariah said. \"So, how does Jack feel about...you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would Jack care?\" Jessica said, turning her head slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah squinted her eyes in confusion before blushing. \"Oh, I'm so sorry. I thought you two were going out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Jessica's time to blush. \"Oh...no, we're not.\" Jessica turned and watched out the window, not wanting to let her friend see her embarrassed face. <i>She thought we were going out</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom outside, Jessica caught a glimpse of a news van, where Mia Vasquez, now expecting triplets, was reporting on the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here outside the First Regional Hospital, where doctors are still unsure what has caused the recent rash of what is being referred to as 'sudden pregnancy.' I'm joined with Kristen Harper, an obstetrician here who has seen some of these unusual pregnancies herself. Dr. Harper, hello.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, and congratulations on your own pregnancy,\" Dr. Harper said with a smile, motioning to Mia's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia giggled. \"Yes, these are certainly not sudden. I've been dealing with these three for over nine months now,\" she said. \"But, Dr. Harper, what are your observations as of now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, all of the women-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-and some men,\" Mia interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And some men, yes, who have complained of 'sudden pregnancy' do check out, so far. These people are truly pregnant. So far, we believe that there has been some failure of birth control in this city. Shipping routes are being traced, but that seems like the most likely explanation. When people don't realize they're pregnant, sometimes it creeps up on them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what is your explanation for pregnancy seen in men, Dr. Harper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Harper took a deep breath, \"Well-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this time, Ian happened to be watching the report, hoping the bottom of the screen would cut out Mia Vasquez's pregnant belly and just show off her ample \"weather fronts,\" as he called them. That Mia Vasquez did not work as a weather reporter, and had never worked as a weather reporter, seemed to be of little concern to him. He flipped the coin and it landed on Tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn screen, Dr. Harper was about to finish her sentence when she felt a sudden lurking in her stomach. Holding her middle, she watched in silent amazement as her belly swelled out until she looked ripely pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" was all Dr. Harper could get out as camera crews flocked around her, the first 'sudden pregnancy' caught on film.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the bus, Jessica and Mariah were back to talking, trying to keep their minds off of the awkward exchange and their own occupied uteruses. The bus rolled to its next stop, and two particularly tired-looking pregnant women walked on: Ms. Apple and Ms. Smart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"haa...haa...you, please get off the bus. We need to talk to you,\" Ms. Apple gasped, pointing at Jessica. Jessica and Mariah looked at each other with confusion, not doing anything. \"Oh good lord...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Apple and Ms. Smart pushed past the gauntlet of pregnant men and women, belly smacking against belly, until the four women were face-to-face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about the coin,\" Ms. Smart said, leaning her hips forward so her belly pressed against Jessica's. Mariah looked at Jessica and shrugged, giving Jessica a look that said <u>maybe we should go with them</u>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother arduous trip later, the four women were on a bench, all of them taking deep breaths after working past another long line of bellies and the crabby men and women attached to them. They briefly explained their work, their society, their talks with Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's...haa...haa...all of this is happening because there's more than one coin now,\" Ms. Apple said. \"Your friend, Jack, has one of them, but someone has another one. That's what's causing all of these pregnancies. It can't all be Jack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that how I got pregnant without him being around?\" Mariah said, resting her hand on her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where were you when it happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The store Jess and I work at, BooksBooksBooks,\" Mariah said. Ms. Apple and Ms. Smart swore under their breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There wasn't any other reported pregnancies around that area. There must be a third coin,\" Ms. Smart said, resting her head in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And after that...someone stole the book. The one Jack gave me,\" Jessica said. Another swear. \"B-but, we have a lead on who might have it. That's where we were going now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Smart looked up. \"Well, that could be good then. If you're right, then we not only get the book, we get one of the coins too. And with two coins, combined with Jack's special traits, we might be able to find the third one with little trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What 'special trait?'\" Jessica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the coin always binds itself to one person in each round it travels, but it seems to have stayed with him for much longer. It has a kind of connection with him. On some deep level, it makes sense that the coin would go to Jack,\" Ms. Apple explained. \"Our other two members have been following the coin on foot for many years now and they haven't seen a connection like this in their time and we've only seen something like it in the book once or twice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica and Mariah looked at each other in disbelief. \"Why would that be? I mean, Jack's great and all...\" Jessica said, pausing for a moment. \"But, it's not like he's magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as far as we can tell, the coin has made this connection with him because...he likes pregnancy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...what?\" Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know...\" Ms. Smart said, rubbing her belly up and down slowly. \"He <b>likes</b> pregnancy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's face was stuck between a blush so red it looked like she had hives and a pale so bloodless she could have been sucked dry by a vampire, so Mariah decided to take the reigns. \"So, if we get the other 'coin,' he might be able to...work something out with them? Use its power for his advantage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the theory,\" Ms. Smart said, \"But you're a part of that solution too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Jessica</font>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're part of that solution too, Jessica,\" Ms. Smart continued. \"You were one of the first people the coin got pregnant when Jack had it. You hold some power too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you people know all of this?\" Jessica asked a bit angrily. \"Why didn't you stop it before it got lost or whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we're trying to help you!\" Ms. Apple said, turning around quickly, her belly jiggling a bit. \"We had some pretty bad things happen in our life thanks to that coin and we don't want the same things to happen to you. Besides, it's not as if we're being left unscathed by this whole thing,\" she said, gripping and rubbing her belly obviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah put her hand over Jessica's, inadvertently touching her friend's belly. \"Sorry, we didn't mean to...be rude. Thank you very much for your help. Will you help us look for the book?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we have to go talk things over with the co-members of our organization. They may have found the other coin - the one that's causing all of this trouble,\" Ms. Smart said, pointing to her belly. \"Good luck to both of you. We'll be in touch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica and Mariah went back on their way, not too far from Jack's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd think they'd ask for our phone numbers...\" Jessica said after a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're very bad at being a secret society,\" Mariah said, shaking her head. \"And what dumb code names.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>- - - - Jack Dale Jr - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack gulped a deep gulp as he knocked on the door of his neighbors, Faye and Charles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack thought back to how it all started, how it all started with Faye. He saw her out the car window when he first bought the coin, and how everything quickly unraveled from there. He knew for years that Faye and Charles were struggling to conceive, and he thought about what \"undoing\" all of this might mean...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid he have the right to deny someone something they so wanted desperately for his own selfish reasons? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and Faye stood there, in her stylish maternity wear, in her full pregnant glory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Jack. How are you doing today?\" Faye asked with a smile, one hand hypnotically rubbing her belly, the other bracing herself against the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'm fine.. Mrs. Jones\" Jack said, trying to keep his eyes off Faye's ample barely covered pregnant stomach or her ample cleavage that she had on display thanks to her maternity wear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jackie\" Faye said, in a sultry tone that alarmed Jack as much as it excited him \"Call me Faye. Your a man, not a child anymore\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh\" Jack said, his brain screaming at him that something was wrong. \"Okay Mrs. J - - I mean Faye, and it's uh Jack by the way.\" Jack said, inviting himself in, squeezing by Faye's massive pregnant belly, his eyes trying to avoid contact at all costs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where's the work you wanted me to do? My mom said something about it?\" Jack asked looking around the house. A dirty plate filled with food, and a half drunk glass of milk lay on the table, along with what appeared to be a basket of laundry; Faye's maternity clothing mixed in with Charles' clothes, Jack spotting Charles' favorite shirt resting on-top, although to Jack it seemed.. larger, almost stretched out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I have few things I need help with. Charles is... working on something else right now, so he's unavailable. I'd do it myself but..\" Faye said with a giggle, lightly slapping her belly for emphasis. \"It's nothing too crazy, I just need help painting the last section of the babies rooms and some other things. The delivery truck from Baby Universe is finally coming tomorrow, so I need to make sure everything is ready for when they arrive. I'm going to need them to put everything together after all.\" Faye said, letting something slip out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Jack asked, still trying to avoid eye contact with any part of Faye. \"Wouldn't Mr. Jones do all of that for you?\" <br>\r\n\"Charles is... busy, like I said\" Faye said, adjust the edges of her maternity clothes, smoothing out the wrinkles and pull it tight over her curves. \"I don't think he'll be able to do much for a little while\" Faye said, carefully choosing her words. <br>\r\n\"But what's so important about what he's doing that he can't help out his pregnant wi---\" Jack was beginning to say before being interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this? A million questions time? He's busy Jack. Now don't worry about him, don't you want your forty dollars?\"  Faye said slightly annoyed, trying to change the line of questioning. <br>\r\n\"Oh Mrs. J - - - Faye, you don't have to pay me at all. I earn my own money now, I'm not a little kid\" Jack said. <br>\r\n\"Nonsense, I'm paying you for a job. It shouldn't even take you that long. Charles had most of the painting done before he got - - - \" Faye said, thinking about her next words \"busy. Should only take you an hour or two\" Faye said. \"Now follow me\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack followed Faye upstairs, the stairs creaking and groaning under her weight. A few mere moments later, Faye flicked on the light to what would be the nursery, half-painted. \"Everything you need to finish is over there. It shouldn't take too long, Charles finished all the top and lower portions of the walls. Just fill in the middle\" Faye said, giggling and rubbing her belly as she said \"fill in the middle\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack couldn't help but think that Faye was flirting with him somehow, but shook it off. <br>\r\n<i>Focus Jack. You've got to ask her about the book. </i> Jack thought to himself as opened up a can of green paint and got to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed as it always did, Jack painting as quickly and as carefully as he could. He needed to be done with this and ask about the book, but if he did a bad job, he'd only have to do it again. Time is ticking he kept telling himself, thinking back to his mother in her bikini..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, do you want to watch some TV or something while you work?\" Faye asked, carrying a small TV in her hands, propping it up against her massive belly like a shelf. <br>\r\n\"Mrs. Jon- - - Faye, you really shouldn't lift stuff like that. It's not good for you!\" Jack said, rushing over to Faye and taking the small TV from her.<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, a little heavy lifting hasn't killed a pregnant person yet\" Faye said with a smile. <br>\r\n\"You mean a pregnant woman\" Jack said, correcting her. <br>\r\n\"Right. That's what I meant to say\" as she looked down that hall at... something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'd like to watch TV\" Jack said, trying to be nice. He hooked up the small TV and turned it on. <br>\r\n\"If you need anything else, I'll be in my room. Just knock before you come in okay?\" Faye said with a sultry smile and a pair of come-hither eyes.<br>\r\n\"Uh.. okay\" Jack said, turning it to the news and watching Faye leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - Faye - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door behind her, Faye reached into her pocket and pulled out the coin. <br>\r\n\"Do I really need to do this?\" Faye asked herself. <br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Yes. He's going to take it all away from you. THEY'RE going to take it all away from you. It's the only way. She's getting closer now. I can feel her through her friend. They think you have the book. Hide it. I cannot be stopped now</span> the voice talked to Faye in her head. It was no longer soft. It was cold, harsh and vile sounding. It sounded like a disgusting abomination bathing and feasting in it's own vile juices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt scared Faye to death, but she headed it's every word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But my husband..\" Faye said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Cheated on you with some tramp. Knocked her up. He's the villain here, not you. He broke the trust. Besides, your husband is busy making your dreams of a large family come true. He needs his rest. A little extra martial activity won't hurt anyone. Sleep with Jack Faye. It will destroy Jack's relationship with the girl, and then.. Then you can finally become a mother. It's what you always wanted. </span> The vile thing in the coin convinced her, not telling her the truth of how everything was falling into it's cruel design. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vile thing would not be denied. It was days away from it's triumph. The amount of chaos sewn here would never be able to be fixed, no matter how hard Destiny tried. The world would be forever changed, and it would feast. Feast forever... Or at least until it hungered again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right\" Faye said, putting the coin on her dresser next to the book. Opening her closet door, she buried the book deep, under some old baby clothes and old pregnancy books that dated back several years ago. Slamming the door shut, Charles groaned in his sleep, turning softly, the bed creaking under his increased weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye began to disrobe, and grabbed her pair of maternity lingerie that she was saving for a special occasion. Now was a good as time as ever, seeing as Charles wasn't in any condition to fulfill her womanly needs.  Pulling out the hottest shade of lipstick she could find, she prepared herself for what was going to come next.... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Some time ago, I was talking with Dr. Kristen Harper, when, she suddenly, \"grew pregnant\" right her in front of us.\" Mia continued on her report, showing the footage from earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, even if she did have the book. That doesn't mean anything does it?\" Jack asked himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After being rushed into the hospital, we received reports that Dr. Harper is in fact, about 8 1/2 months pregnant with a single child, a boy, that according to staff is completely healthy, given Dr. Harper's older age and the fact that she was not pregnant this morning. I'm standing with Dr. Thomas Mott, senior obstetrician here at the hospital who has decided to say a few words about the strange incidents these past couple days. Thomas?\" Mia asked, turning the microphone over to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why would she have the book if she didn't know what it did?\" Jack debated with himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Mia. First off, I would like to report that Dr. Harper is okay, resting comfortably. She's still in shock about everything that's has happened to her, but physically she's just like any normal pregnant woman. Now, as for the matters regarding the pregnancies in this town, all I can say is this: We're working hard with outside investigators to locate the source of all these mysterious pregnancies. If anyone, male or female, is pregnant or believes themselves to be pregnant, they need to come down here for a check-up.\" Dr. Mott said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Explain how men are getting pregnant. This should be scientifically impossible\" Mia said. <br>\r\n\"Impossible? No. Extremely improbable? Yes. But I urge all men who are pregnant, think they might be pregnant, or are having pregnancy symptoms to come down right away. We're not going to grill you with a thousand questions, or turn you over to the government to study in some lab. All we want to make sure is that they have a healthy pregnancy. There's no reason to hide or be ashamed. It's perfectly natural if not slightly unusual, but please, gentlemen, think of your child's future. I assure you, it can be all strictly confidential if you want it to be, or you can go around and tell everyone that you're pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe just want to make sure that you're healthy. We've never seen anything like this before, and we need to make sure that as the child grows larger, no serious complications arise.\" Dr. Mott finishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what is causing men to get pregnant? Don't you think you should find out? This is the biggest medical discovery of the 21st century.\" Mia says, rubbing her belly. <br>\r\n\"All we care about right now is ensuring a healthy pregnancy. Medical books can wait, medical care comes first. That's all\" Dr. Mott said, walking away from the camera. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you heard it there folks. Truly a strange time to be living in. Mia Vasquez reporting.\" Mia signed off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pregnant men. Wow, hope that doesn't happen to me..\" The male news anchor said. <br>\r\n\"Oh, would it be so bad?\" The female anchor sitting next to him said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, even if she did have the book. That could mean any number of things\" Jack said to himself, finishing up the painting. <br>\r\n\"It's not like she stole it on purpose. Maybe there was a mix-up. That was it, a mix-up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack finished his work and took a look at everything. Not bad, all things considered for a rush job. Putting away everything for painting, Jack set out to look for Faye to tell her that he was done, and to ask about the book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knocked on the door to her room, but heard nothing but a groan coming from the other side. \"Faye?\" Jack asked, trying to turn the handle into Faye and Charles room. It was locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faye?\" Jack asked knocking on the door. <br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Faye said, standing in the hallway, in a blue satin bathrobe. Her hair was down and unkempt, making her look wild and fierce. Her lips were a bright, alluring shade of red, her makeup was perfect, making her look irresistible. The blue satin bathrobe hugged her every curve, exposed her ample cleavage. She was barefoot, resting one foot against the back of her leg, as she pressed herself back first against the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was rubbing and caressing her every curve with her hands, slowly. Images of Jack's dream from days ago came rushing back to hit him in the face like a two-ton truck that was on fire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I - uh, I  uh\" Jack was having trouble finding words. His brain had melted, his mouth was drive. He wanted her. But this was Faye! The woman who babysit him growing up! His mom's best friend! A married woman! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh, finished all the painting and igottagonowbye\" Jack said, rushing down the hallway, but was stopped when she flung an arm out to stop him.<br>\r\n\"Where you going in such a hurry?\" Faye asked, biting her lip with her teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IuhgottagohomenowI'msuremymomneedshelpwithsomethingbye\" Jack said, talking to fast and trying to escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, now. You're not going anywhere until I pay you.. And you have some of my famous lemonade\" Faye said, grabbing Jack by the arms and leading him downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo parts of Jack were now at war with each other: His head and his... other head. His head told him that something was wrong and he needed to leave. NOW. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis.. other head told him to stay for a while. Have some lemonade. Get paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis other head was winning, despite a valiant fight by his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that does sound nice, but I really need to go and - - - whoa\" Jack said, and Faye threw him onto the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kick up your feet. You work yourself to hard.\" Faye said in a sultry voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye walked over to Jack and gave him a glass of lemonade. \"Drink up. It's good. I can't wait to serve it to my children on hot summer days.\" She said, forcing the glass into Jack's hand. \"Oh! They're kicking up a storm right now. Wanna feel?\" Taking Jack's free hand, she placed it on her ample belly with a sultry smile, and begin to rub it all over her very pregnant belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's other head as starting to put up a much better fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I REALLY, REALLY, need to go right now\" Jack said, gulping down his lemonade and trying to get up from his seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye grabbed him and pulled him back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not don't be rude Jack. You're a guest. Stay for just a little while longer.\" She said, inching herself closer to Jack. He could smell her, she smelled amazing. She put on a very special perfume for just this.. occasion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's head was losing badly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, do you think I look attractive like this?\" Faye said, placing Jack's hand back on her belly. \"Some people say that pregnant women aren't attractive.. But look at me\" Faye said, adjusting the opening of her robe to show off more of her cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack could only make some kind of noise that sounded similar to an old 56K modem starting up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a yes\" Faye said, standing up before Jack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShowing grace that you wouldn't imagine with a woman her size, Faye pinned Jack to the couch with a foot, her hands slowly making their way to her robe belt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Jones, you're trying to seduce me!\" Jack said, alarmed. <br>\r\n\"Mmmm. Whose trying?\" Faye said, undoing her robe, dropping it to the floor and revealing her maternity lingerie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A woman has needs Jack.\" Faye said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - Jessica - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of breath, Mariah and Jessica waddled up to Jack's house, as another car pulled up to the driveway next door. A very pregnant woman in a work maternity uniform got out with a small duffle bag and walked to the front door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica knocked on the door and after a few moments was greeted by the very pregnant form of Amanda Dale. \"Hello Mrs. Dale, you're looking amazing\" Jessica said, somewhat envious of Mrs. Dale size.<br>\r\n\"Well thank you Jessica. You're looking.. a little full around the midsection.. Are you..\" Mrs. Dale said, reaching out a hand towards Jessica's belly. <br>\r\n\"I don't want to talk about it\" Jessica said, pulling away. <br>\r\nAmanda's eyes suddenly widened. \"Is Jack the father?\" Amanda said. <br>\r\n\"Look, where is Jack? Him and I need to talk\" Jessica asked, dodging a line of questions she didn't have answers for. <br>\r\n\"He's next door with Faye, a friend of mine. He's helping her out with some chores, since's she so pregnant. We've both big deliveries coming tomorrow from the baby store and - - - \" Amanda Dale was interrupted as Jessica and Mariah took off waddling towards Faye's house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's - - uh - uh - got to be the one!\" Jessica said, holding her belly and waddling as fast as she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica waddled right up past Amber with Mariah right behind her, and knocked on the door. <br>\r\n\"I don't think anyone's home\" Amber said. <br>\r\n\"Wait, don't I know you. Aren't you the girl whose dating Jack?\" Amber asked, eying Jessica up and down. <br>\r\n\"We're not dating. We're just friends\" Jessica said, knocking on the door again. <br>\r\n\"Judging by your midsection, you look like more than friends\" Amber said, a hint of jealously in her voice. <br>\r\n\"He's not the father! I mean he is, but he isn't! It's complicated. GOD WHY WON'T THIS DOOR OPEN UP!\" Jessica said, pounding on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the door creaked open on it's own.. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Faye!\" Jack sputtered out as Faye dropped her robe, revealing her barely-covered body. Around her ample breasts was a tiny, laced bra with thin silk that showed her full, dark nipples behind a hazy layer of fabric. As she crawled toward him, Faye's rounded butt swung back and forth, giving Jack a look at her equally small panties, replete with the same thin lace. Around her legs were long, soft stockings attached to her creamy thigh with a garter belt. \"Wh-what are you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh,\" Faye smiled, putting one soft finger to Jack's lips, \"you don't need to be shy and fight it anymore. You were right: you're not a little kid anymore. You've grown up into quite the man. Just the kind of man I need right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, you're married!\" Jack stuttered, Faye's swollen breasts directly in his line of sight. He could smell the sweat and heat coming off her and could see her chest rise and fall with each breath and heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And like I said, my husband's busy,\" Faye grinned, leaning in closer to Jack. \"Too busy for me, that's for sure. It's okay, Jackie. If you don't tell him, I won't tell your girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not my-\" Jack said, remembering what Jessica told him that morning and pausing. He had to come to terms with it. \"She's not my girlfriend. She told me so herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww,\" Faye smiled, leaning in to plant a wet kiss on Jack's neck. Jack shuddered at her touch, especially as she included a little lick at the end. \"Looks like we both need this, hon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but, Faye,\" Jack said, looking back at her, his mind searching for a way to get out of this. \"Y-you're...pregnant. Should you really be-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I should,\" Faye said sternly, playing with Jack's hair. \"I need it more than ever.\" She leaned him deeper into the couch's cushions, pressing her breasts against his face, whispering close to him. \"And I know you do too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA twinge rocked through Jack's body at her last words. \"W-what do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Faye sat up, sitting across from our young hero, rubbing her belly with a grin. \"It's okay, I've put the pieces together myself. The way you've looked at me, the way you've even looked at your mother, your knocked-up 'friend who happens to be a girl.' Kudos on that, by the way. It took Charles twice as long as you to get a woman pregnant.\" Faye chuckled to herself, looking down at her belly and barring her teeth. \"Or maybe not. Who knows what that dog's keeping from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Jack said. Faye looked back at him with a piercing look again, deciding there's no point in bringing this young man into her personal troubles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, the biggest clue of all came from your mother directly,\" Faye purred, her eyes opening. \"She told me the whole story about you and pregnancy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what story?\" Jack said, raising one eyebrow. What was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said you might not remember. As cute as it was, it may have been a little traumatic for you,\" Faye said, brushing her hair out of her eyes. \"But as she says it, when you were little, you were <u>very</u> curious about pregnancy and felt the belly of every pregnant woman you could. And if there's one thing little kids have pretty wide access to, it's the pregnant moms of their little friends. So who should be so lucky as to have a pregnant 3rd grade teacher but little Jackie Dale Jr! And she would let you all feel her big, twin-filled belly whenever you kids wanted, but no one was as enthusiastic as you! It came to be that you wouldn't even ask permission: you would just rub and feel and she would smile and let it happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she was getting pretty big, and one day she happens to be wearing a button-up shirt and her twins give her two particularly strong kicks. It bursts! her shirt open, revealing her bare belly to the whole class. And who runs up and feels and rubs her belly but you! But, unfortunately, the principal was looking in on classes that day and he saw the whole scene. Apparently, he was quite the puritan, so he called an immediate meeting with you and your parents and yelled at you until he was blue in the face. They told him later that it was a bit uncalled for, but they didn't want to reinforce bad behavior. After all, you can't just rub a woman's belly without her asking! We want to be protective of our babies! (Faye gave her own big, bare belly a long rub and giggled) It seemed to have quite the impression on you, as your mom said you never made much talk about pregnancy after that. If anything, you tried to <u>avoid</u> pregnant women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye crawled back toward Jack, who was staring back at her in disbelief. She...she was absolutely right! All of these memories were flooding back into him and he remembered the day with astonishing detail...Ms. Tammy and her belly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But things are different now, Jack. I want you to feel my belly.\" Faye took his hand and pressed it against her maternal flesh. \"I want you to be curious,\" she said in a breathy tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack couldn't help himself. He planted his face against Faye's quadruplet-filled belly and began kissing and licking, pecking and sucking. He was like a man possessed. While Faye had helped to break down a few mental walls in his head, the real secret behind it was the two coins resonating. Jack had his in his pants' pocket, Faye in the pocket of her robe which lay just at the bottom of the couch. Yes, they were trying to bring Jack's coin into the hands of someone more reliable, like Faye, but it was something more: Ms. Apple and Ms. Smart were right: Jack had a strange sort of power of his own, and bringing the coins together amplified his power over theirs. He could get what he wanted. And right now, only one thing was on his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, Jack, that's it,\" Faye cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-this is wrong,\" Jack sighed, flicking her popped out belly button with his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's all right,\" Faye said, bringing Jack's head up. \"Now, I'll bet you've had all sorts of fun with that little friend of yours, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah, once</i>, Jack sighed in his head. \"Y-yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">It's close</span>, the coin beckoned to Faye. <span class=\"clred\">Hurry.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure a young man like you just lost himself feeling her breasts. But now, it's time for you to see what a woman's breasts look like.\" Faye pulled her shoulders around, having already undone her bra strap while she was telling Jack his own story. The already flimsy lingerie fell into her lap and her engorged chest hung down, bouncing happily as her breasts were freed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...uh...\" Jack said, things suddenly getting much realer for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye giggled. \"You are so cute,\" she said, reaching for his pants. <span class=\"clred\">Yes, they're in his pocket, get them out.</span> <i>Uh, yeah, that's what I was trying to do</i>, Faye thought back at the coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnzipping them and working them down his hips, Faye reached one hand around in one pocket, her hand searching for the coin, but also trying to feel for his erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you-\" Jack tried to ask before Faye grabbed his chin. <i>Can't have any distractions</i>, she thought. <i>Get the coin, then we can have real fun.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh,\" Faye said. \"Let mama take care of it.\" With that, Faye brought her lips to Jack's, who hesitated, looking back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I...I can't...why can't I? It's just a kiss...it'll lead to more than a kiss...I want more than a kiss</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack leaned up and kissed Faye back, their lips opening to taste more of each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-THIS DOOR OPEN UP?\" a familiar voice shouted as the front door gave way and Jessica, Mariah, and Amber tumbled inside, their bellies bumping against one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Jones?\" Mariah called out. \"Could we talk to you, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear someone over here,\" Amber said, motioning for the two to walk over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Jones, I'm a friend of...oh my god.\" Jessica said, her arms falling to her side. Jack looked over and pulled away immediately, struggling as his pants fell even further down his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Jessica, I...I was-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to be sick,\" Jessica said, running out the door. Mariah followed her out, holding the bottom of her belly to keep it from moving around too much and impeding her movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber looked back at Jack, her fists trembling. \"Wow, so that's why you wouldn't kiss me. Because you were fucking the wife of the guy who knocked me up. You could have just told me, Jack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amber, I didn't...wait, THESE are the people you were talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the tramp who slept with my husband?\" Faye barked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay out of this,\" Amber growled, turning to Jack. \"You know what, don't bother coming into work tomorrow. Or for a while. I'll let you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left last, slamming the door behind her. Jack hurried to pull his pants up, Faye's hands stopping him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, forget about them. Why don't you and I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Jones, I-I'm sorry. I can't,\" he said, running out the door and calling out to Jessica and Amber as their cars backed out of the two driveways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye sat on the couch and rubbed her big belly, sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">We have the book and we've stopped the boy. Now you'll have your babies, Faye.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and not have sex for even longer,\" Faye scoffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commotion awoke Charles a little, who whimpered from the bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be quiet, dear. Just lay still and cook that baby inside you,\" she grinned, happy her husband wasn't taking the pregnancy as well as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In Faye's nursery, the TV continued to play and the news kept coming in. Mia Vasquez was now standing in front of the local high school, where the parking lot was packed to the brink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now I'm standing outside North Central High, where the school district is holding a city-wide meeting to discuss issues facing the school system, as the recent high number of pregnancies is set to push the city's population well beyond previously projected levels. Parents are also concerned by the number of students in the high school who have become pregnant,\" Mia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mia, Rick Sanner here,\" one of the news anchors said. The entire channel was huddled at the front news desk in anticipation, talking remotely with their top field reporter. \"We haven't heard any reports of students dropping out of the high school system in any higher numbers. Are you hearing anything about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia nodded. \"Yes, that's an interesting aspect. One might expect a student to drop out, transfer, or lay low when they get pregnant at the high school level, but the sheer quantity of pregnancies seems to have created a kind of community among students, even those men who find themselves with child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fascinating,\" Rick said, still unaware that he was a few months pregnant himself. Over the past few days, Rick had tried to use the \"pregnancy epidemic,\" combined with Mia's own triplet pregnancy, to push her into situations where she would seem like less of a serious journalist. Rick himself was never particularly talented aside from his good looks and charisma and he had heard plenty of talk that Mia would replace him as one of the station's main anchors. Unfortunately, his plan backfired and Mia was proving to be an excellent reporter on the issue and was the only one on the case, which helped her as national attention began to flock to the little town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go inside the meeting now,\" Mia said, nodding to the producers to start playing clips she recorded earlier. The entire meeting was held in the gym, with all of the bleachers filled to the brim and every chair available set up on the floor, each one occupied. At the front of the gym was a long table, with all of the school board's members sitting, accompanied by prominent principles and teachers from the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fact is, folks, if we all want our kids to go to school in the city, taxes will need to rise across the board,\" School board chair Sandra DeRosa said, eliciting groans and grumbling from the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I have to pay for this mass irresponsibility?\" one man said, standing up angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman with a slight belly stood up, lifting her shirt so her bulge was clearly visible. \"Irresponsibility? I've been divorced for two years and haven't had sex since then. The doctor told me I'm four months pregnant! I had no say in this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother woman stood up, this one with a massive pregnant belly that bobbed around as she stood. \"We wouldn't need to raise taxes if you people hadn't introduced 'sexual education' into the schools. You filled all of the students' heads with sex. I'm not paying for our schools to teach my kids to start shacking up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey lady, look who's talking?\" someone yelled from the back of the room. \"You look like you're about to birth some new kids out any minute now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made these babies with my husband with love,\" the woman shot back, turning around abruptly. \"Don't try and twist it around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, let's all settle down,\" said Srini Vsaraja, principal of North Central High. She stood up, revealing her own round pregnant belly. \"We are re-examining our sex ed policy to see where we might have had faults, but we must recognize that there are also some things occurring that we cannot explain. Many students are saying that they suddenly became pregnant, which matches up with what a lot of other people are saying. And we have seen these students before and they certainly weren't nine months pregnant last week.\" Mumbles of agreement rippled across the gym. \"So for now, we need to make sure we have schools for all of our children when they grow up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen cut back to Mia, who was now accompanied by another pregnant woman. \"Alright, now I'm joined by Zoe McPhaerson, who's here to show how this issue is not just affecting the public school system. Now, Ms. McPhaerson, what happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Zoe said quietly, \"I was a teacher at St. Alphonso's Catholic High, teaching English, and I loved it, but...one day, I suddenly became pregnant, like you can see.\" Zoe sheepishly rubbed her big belly, which was still dwarfed by Mia's triplet belly. She was a young woman with short, curly brown hair and big chipmunk cheeks. \"I explained to them that, like so many other people, it just sort of happened, but because I'm pregnant and unmarried, they thought it sent a bad message, so I was fired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're not the only one, correct?\" Mia added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe nodded. \"We were told not to say anything, but now that I've been fired...I can say that several students were moved into secret, private classes because of their pregnancies and some of the nuns who teach who became pregnant were moved to secluded property in the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible,\" Mia said, nodding back to the camera. \"This sudden swath of pregnancies seems to be affecting every part of life here, and no word yet on a cause, but we will be staying on the case. Back to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Mia,\" said Brooke Roberts, one of the station's anchors. \"One part of city life that is benefiting from the high number of pregnancies is a pregnant bikini contest that is conveniently scheduled this week. And joining us live is one of the event's emcees, 101.9 DJ Samuel Wichowitz.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, and actually, I prefer to go by Sandwich,\" he said, standing outside Dino's Bar and Grill, which was adorned with signs for the 101.9 Miss Stork Pregnant Bikini Contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam, how has the sudden spike in pregnancies affected the contest?\" Brooke asked, silently rubbing her own four-month-pregnant belly behind the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we've gotten a lot more entrants that we'd expected,\" Sandwich said, trying not to show his annoyance. \"And we were definitely surprised that our own co-host, Lisa Smith, got pregnant and is entering the contest herself. But it should be fun. The big numbers have brought in a lot of advertisers and we're increasing the number of prizes we're offering. It should be a good time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And our own Mia Vasquez is entered, I understand,\" Rick said, smiling with schadenfreude as he hoped Mia's participation would reflect poorly on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, she certainly is,\" Sandwich chuckled. \"And she'll certainly be a strong contender. Either way, she'll get a lot of attention, which will definitely help her in the broadcast world, I'm guessing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmph,\" Rick sneered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, good luck to you and all of the entrants,\" Brooke said with a smile, sensing Rick's irritation. \"Should be a fun night. Now, speaking of which, we rejoin Mia Vasquez on the scene. What news do you have for us, Mia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brooke, I'm at Titan Bank, with one of the organizers of the bikini contest you mentioned, Ian Douglas,\" Mia said, standing next to an obviously nervous Ian. His boss had pushed him out to the media to promote the bank's involvement in the contest, so he had to come up with some proof that he'd actually done his job, which he had not. He got excited when he heard he'd be interviewed by Mia Vasquez, but when he saw her huge pregnant belly, his volupture dropped right off. <i>Jack jinxed me talking about pregnancy so much,</i> Ian thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Mr. Douglas, what is Titan Bank's involvement?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, we're involved,\" Ian said, running through his head for something to say. \"We're funding the prizes and...we're looking for more as things go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Mia said, foolishly believing that Ian knew what he was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, some great stuff, lllllllike,\" Ian said, rummaging around in his pocket, until he found the coin in his pocket. \"Like this, um, antique coin. It's...rare and a definite collector's item.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" Mia said, nodding. \"What a unique prize, especially for a...bikini contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we like to do things differently here at Titan Bank,\" Ian said, gulping nervously, a little pleased with how well that had turned out. \"And there'll be...all kinds of neat prizes like that, so come check it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, well said,\" Mia said. \"Now Brooke, Titan Bank goes beyond just sponsoring the event. A few of the bank's employees are entered in Thursday's contest, like-hey, what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen went black as someone's hand was clearly covering the camera. \"We need you to turn these cameras off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you? This is a legitimate news broadcast,\" Mia retorted angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Health and Human Services.\" And then the camera cut out and the station went to commercial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Faye was trying to seduce Jack to get his coin and to break apart Jessica and Jack whom we're getting closer to discovering what, if anything could undo this pregnancy nightmare that was rapidly spreading across the town thanks to the idiots of a very special idiot named Ian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jessica didn't know that, which explained Jack trying to chase after her in his underwear, trying to put his pants on. <br>\r\n\"JESSICA! PLEASE WAIT! IT'S - - - \" Jack screamed after her. <br>\r\n\"It's exactly what it looks like!\" Jessica said, tears streaming down her face like a river, her hands wrapped above and below her sizeable pregnant belly.<br>\r\n\"I - I came over to do some work. I didn't want to! My mom made me! And Faye she just - - - -\" Jack said, finally managing to get one of his legs into his pants. Jack didn't realize that it was the wrong leg and that his pants were on backwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She just threw herself at you Jack? Is that it?\" Jessica said angrily making her way back to the bus stop. <br>\r\n\"Yes! Okay, glad we're on the same page Jess\" Jack said, trying to fix his pants. <br>\r\n\"Don't call me Jess. You know what, don't talk to me. Ever. We're OVER! \" Jessica said, waddling along. <br>\r\n\"OVER!? WE NEVER EVEN STARTED! Jessica, why are you so upset? It's not like we're even going out! We're just friends! You said so yourself!\" Jack said, trying to make sense of this nonsense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then clearly you don't understand women, especially me, as well as you think you did!\" Jessica said, finally making her way to the bus-stop. <br>\r\n\"WHAT DOES THAT MEAN!?\" Jack was throughly confused, and now was getting angry. <br>\r\n\"IT MEANS I LOVE YOU STUPID SHIT! I LOVE YOU! I'VE ALWAYS LOVED YOU! WHY DO YOU THINK WE HAD SEX? BECAUSE I NEEDED RELEASE?! I LOVED YOU AND THAT WAS OUR MOMENT TOGETHER! IT WAS OUR EVERYTHING! YOU! ME!\" Jessica paused her screaming, lifting up her shirt to expose her taut pregnant flesh. <br>\r\n\"THESE! IT'S MEANS WE WERE FINALLY TOGETHER! WE HAD EVERYTHING WE COULD EVER NEED! AND YOU THREW IT ALL AWAY FOR SOME... SOME..\" Jessica was crying more than a river, she was crying an ocean, her makeup smuding as she let out years of repressed feelings firmly backed by a deep sense of betrayal. <br>\r\n\"Slut\" Mariah said sheepishly, her head and eyes looking firmly at the ground.. Well, her very pregnant twin-filled belly that happened to block the ground. <br>\r\n\"THANK YOU MARIAH. YOU'RE A TRUE FRIEND.\" Jessica said, turning to her pregnant friend. \"SLUT!\" Jessica then turned her attention back to Jack to continue her assault. <br>\r\n\"But Jessica, you said it didn't mean anything! YOU SAID WE WERE JUST FRIENDS!\" Jack shouted back, in shock of what he was hearing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all laid bare before him, and Jack felt like a very special kind of idiot to not have noticed it before. But Jessica words... Can a woman say one thing and mean another? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT WAS CODE YOU IDIOT! IT WAS AN OBVIOUS LIE! YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO SAY \"I WANT US TO BE MORE THAN FRIENDS! I LOVE YOU JESSICA! I WANT US TO BE A FAMILY!\" Jessica said, putting her hands on her belly for emphasis. <br>\r\n\"HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT!? \" Jack screamed, stretching out his hands from his head, for emphasis. <br>\r\n\"IT'S CALLED BEING AN ADULT AND PULLING YOUR HEAD FAR OUT OF YOUR OWN ASS JACK. Why don't you try it sometime?\" Jessica said, turning her back to Jack. \"Goodbye..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the book?! What about this!?\" Jack said, reaching into his pocket and pulling out the coin. <br>\r\n\"Shove it far up your own ass. Maybe it will dislodge your head\" Jessica said, back turned towards Jack. \"As for the book, don't worry about it. I'll think of something.. Something that doesn't involve you.\" Her words with firmly baked with hurt and hate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this time, that it anyone was paying attention, that alone black helicopter was flying over head. But, helicopters in a small suburban town was the norm, so no thought was given to it as it made it's way to the First Regional Hospital's helipad to set-up it's command center. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the fight was so intense, nobody else did not happen to notice the second, the third, the fourth, or even the fifth matching black helicopters that were quickly making their way across the town, setting up it's perimeter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was taken back by Jessica's goodbye. It sounded so... final.<br>\r\n\"Jessica.. You need me\" Jack was hurt. It was like she reached into his chest and pulled out his heart while shouting \"Kali Ma! Kali Ma!\" (Author's Note: Ha-Ha! Temple Of Doom reference) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll solve this own my own Jack. I don't need you. I'll never need you. I think you better leave.\" Jessica said, her words cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Jack was sure it was over. Everything was over. This was it. The end of his world. The end of the world. <br>\r\nHe couldn't speak. All he could do, was walk slowly back to his house, one leg in the wrong pant leg, fighting back pain and hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemed to stop as he slowly opened the door to his house, and trudged inside, head hung low. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis very pregnant mother came towards with a quickness that would surprise anyone given her size. \"Jack, baby, what's going on? Why was Jessica here? Is she pregnant?! Are you the father!? What was all that shouting outside? Why are you pants down? Did you finish your work for Faye? Did \" Her words were strong and motherly. She had no idea what was going on with her son, and she wanted answers - - - NOW. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"notnowmomidon'twanttotalkaboutitokay?\" Jack mumbled softly to himself, staring ahead into nothingness.<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" His mother asked, putting one hand into the small of her arching back, the other resting on-top of her mammoth pregnant mound.  \"Jack baby, what happenned? Why is Jessica pregnant? ARE YOU THE FATHER JACK?! Oh my god, you are the father. I can't believe - - - JACK, WHAT DID WE TELL YOU ABOUT SAFE SEX?! OH MY GOD, YOU'RE GOING TO BE A FATHER. It all makes sense, how long have you been seeing her? Did it start when you moved back? Oh was it more recent? She looked like four months pregnant, Jack have you been seeing her for a year?! Do you know what this is going to do to you!? It's going to make finishing college almost impossible! You can't raise a family on minimum wage! You have to - - - \" Amanda's mouth was going 10,000 words a minute, her words full of concern and comfort and more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ISAIDNOTNOWMOMIDONTWANTTOTALKABOUTITOKAY? IT'SNONEOFYOURBUSINESS! WHYDONTYOUWORRYABOUTYOURSELF! THERESALOTOFYOUTOBECONCERENDABOUT!\" Jack screamed at mother, his words becoming long unbroken sentences as he finally broke down, and threw himself at his mother. <br>\r\nTears flowed freely from her son as she caught him in her arms, almost losing her balance trying to juggle pregnancy and her full-grown son as he sobbed into her shoulder. <br>\r\n\"She was the best thing to ever happen to me Mom! And I-uh-uh-uh-I screwed it all up! Oh god what am I going to do! It hurts so much! ShegoingtoleaveandIllneverbeabletofixanyofthisanditsthatstupidcoinsfaultandI\" ; Jack's words were slurring and coming together as he was becoming entrapped in glass case of emotion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sssh. Sssh\" Amanda said, trying to comfort her son, stroking his hair. \"It's okay baby. It's okay. Just let it all out. We'll figure this out together okay? Just let it out. It's okay, Mommy's here\" Amanda said, her maternal instincts on overdrive. Despite being in her 50's and pregnant with FOUR babies she couldn't even imagine having, she would always be a mother to Jack, her first born son, and she would always be there for him, even when trying to keep out with four little ones playing underfoot soon. <i>But how soon?</i> She thought catching a glimpse of herself in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - Meanwhile - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Health and Human Services! That's a load of horseshit! Who are you and why did you interrupt my broadcast! Freedom of the press!\" The very pregnant Mia screamed at the man and woman dressed completely in black dress pants, black jacket, black sunglasses, a white shirt with black tie for him, and a white button blouse for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am we're going to need you calm down. We're health and human services\" The woman said, quickly flashing a badge to the pregnant reporter before putting it back in her jacket pocket. <br>\r\n\"Bullshit! You don't look like any Health and Human services person I've ever seen. You look more like just stepped out of that movie about those guys who fight aliens on Earth.\" Mia said, so angry she was forgetting obvious movie references and cliches that were standing right in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We get that a lot. But we're still going to need you to calm down ma'am, and come with us.\" The man said, standing up straight and snapping his fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral armed personal came around the corner, gas masks on, guns at the ready. Dressed from head to toe in body armor and black fatigues, there looked like something out of a video game about special forces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is this!? What the hell is going on!\" Mia screamed as two of the heavily armed.. persons, lightly grabbed her by the arms. \"Get your hands off me! You can't treat a pregnant woman like this!\" Suddenly, another group of armed persons came and started grabbing the camera man and Ian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh what the hell. First pregnant chicks and now this!? Man can this day get any worse?!\" Ian asked as he was grabbed by the shoulders. <br>\r\n\"I need everyone to calm down. We're not here to hurt you. We're here to help. Strange things.. unnatural things have been happening in this town, and we're here to make sure that everyone is okay... And that it doesn't leave until we figure out what's causing it\"</span></div></div>",

Did you notice anything unusual during your pregnancy?\" A doctor behind a hazmat suit flung a hundreds questions at her a second. <br>\r\n\"What about your sir? Are you pregnant? Are you experiencing any pregnancy like symptoms? Tender breasts? Swelling of the abdomen? Vomiting in the morning? Odd cravings for food?\" A nurse in the hazmat suit flung the questions to Ian and the camera man as they were ushered into the ambulance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors shut firmly close as the three were drug into the car, and it speed off, as dozens, if not hundreds of other similar vans spread out across the town, the scenario playing out over and over again as dozens of black helicopters flew across the town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - Later in the Dale household - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was laying on the couch, his head resting on his mother's massive pregnant belly. He should have felt weird about this whole thing, but he was just too damn tired. He was tired from the hurt, and right now he just wanted to rest. He listened to the four heartbeats in his mother's massive belly, he could feel the kicks and punches of his siblings inside her. <i>This is all my fault. You guys shouldn't be in there</i> Jack thought to himself, trying to communicate somehow with his unborn siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda had a smile on her face as she played with her grown son's hair, trying to comfort him as her unborn children played inside her, clearly happy to have their big brother so close. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Mom. What am I going to do?\" Jack asked. He told his mother what she needed to know, not the whole truth. He made up a bullshit story about the year-long relationship, and made up lies to cover lies he never told to cope responsibility for Jessica's condition and their somewhat.. fuzzy relationship status. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, she never said we were dating. We were just friends.. with benefits\" Jack said, reaffirming his lie. \"Being grown-up is complicated and weird baby.\" Amanda said, trying to find something to say to her son. \"I mean, look at me. I'm going to be a mother again when my own little boy is starting his own family\" Amanda said, trying to put a smile on a lot of mixed emotions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to fix this!\" Jack said, lifting himself of his mother's pregnant belly and sitting up straight on the couch. What he meant to try and fix was this whole situation that the coin caused, but Amanda didn't know that. \"Maybe you just to do the right thing baby. Just tell her everything, how you really feel, and say you didn't know, and maybe, maybe she'll forgive you\". Amanda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Faye, what the hell where  you doing?</i> Amanda thought to herself. Next time she saw her, she would have some SERIOUS words about all this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, what about Faye.. She..\" Jack was trying to find words to make up a lie about why she tried to to do what she was planning to do. You couldn't really tell her the truth about a pregnancy causing coin and a book that may hold the truth to unravel it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about her. I'm sure she had a reason to.. do, what she had to do. When she couldn't get pregnant, I'm sure it put alot of pressure on her marriage and.. Like I said, being a grown-up is complicated.\" Amanda said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I am a grown up. I'm in my 20's remember?\" Jack said, a little annoyed to be talked to like a child. \"You'll always be my baby\" Amanda said, brushing the cheek of her son. <br>\r\n\"Greeeatttt\" Jack said to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRING! RING! Amanda heaved herself over to pick up the phone next to the couch. \"Dale residence, Amanda speaking\" Amanda said. <br>\r\n\"Amanda, baby, sweetie. It's Jack. You gotta turn on the the news!\" Jack's father sounded panicked on the other end of the line. \"Honey is everything okay?\" Amanda asked, resting a hand on her belly. \"They're taking all of us to First Regional! I'll meet you there okay! Just - - \" The line went dead at the other end of the line as Amanda stared at the phone quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was that Mom?\" Jack asked. \"It was your father. He said that someone was taking him to First Regional. He said turn on the news\" Amanda reached over to the remote and turned on the TV. It came to life in a hum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We repeat, this is the emergency broadcast system. We interrupt your regularly scheduled program to bring you this important pre-recorded message:\" The voice on the static image of some kind of symbol said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention residence: Due to the unusual events that have happened in your town these past few days, the depart of Health and Human Services Sector 7, is immediately ordering all residents to the nearest hospital for examinations and pregnancy tests. We do not understand what is causing the pregnancies in your town, nor do we have any idea what is causing the men of your town to become pregnant but we are determined to find the answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease do not be alarmed. We are here for your own safety. Anyone male or female, young or old, that is pregnant or found to be pregnant will be released back into the general population of people found not to be pregnant after some minor and completely safe tests. Each person, pregnant or not, will be given a blue examination card, which will allow you to travel about your town normally. Those without the blue examination card, will be taken to the nearest hospital for an examination. Those who are found to be pregnant will receive a pink sticker on their card. This sticker will be issued daily after the pregnant person is examined by our team of highly trained doctors and nurses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFailure to head to the daily examinations for those issued the pink sticker will result in major fines and possible imprisonment. We care about the health about the people of this town, born and unborn. For your own safety, armed personal will be present on every major street and corner to enforce the \"Blue Card Policy\". Failure to comply will be meet with imprisonment. Once you have your blue card, and a pink sticker if you need it, you will be free to move about the town at your own pleasure.

We have <br>\r\narmed personal at every major entrance and exit. Do not attempt to cross the quarantine. Food and medical supplies and other items that regularly enter your town will be inspected to help determine the source of the pregnancies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife will continue as normal. You will go to work, kids shall go to school, mail will still be delivered, movies will still be shown, you will just be unable to leave town until further notice. We apologize for this, but it's to ensure your own safety, and the safety of others and society outside the quarantine zone. Life will continue as normal. This has been a message from Health and Human services sector 7. Please once again make your way to Regional National hospital for examination. Failure to do so will result in fines and imprisonment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmed personal will be by in hours to check for the Blue Card. If you do not have it, you will be taken for examination. Unless you wish to be dragged to your examination, please leave your residence now and make your way to the hospital. This message will repeat for the rest of the day. Your regularly scheduled programming will continue tomorrow morning at 8 on all television and radio stations. Thank you for your cooperation. This message will repeat in 30 seconds.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that last phrase the message cut back to the symbol on the screen, leaving Jack and Amanda staring at each other.<br>\r\n\"Is this really happening?\" Jack asked. This was all to much for him. <br>\r\n\"I guess. Did they say that men were getting pregnant?\" Amanda asked, her hands cradling her belly, trying to protect it.  <br>\r\n\"I uh\" Jack didn't want to think about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go get changed. We need to go.\" Amanda said, standing up. <br>\r\n\"Go? Where?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n\"To the hospital. Whatever this Sector 7 is, they're not messing around. Let's just go get this over with and find your father\" Amanda said with bated breath. <br>\r\n\"But why did  they take him?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n\"He probably didn't want to go. He's always been so stubborn sometimes.\" Amanda said with a smile. <br>\r\n\"But you don't think that he's - - \" Jack couldn't finish the thought.<br>\r\n\"Oh I hope not. Four kids is bad enough. But five? Forget about it. Although, it would be nice for your father to know what I'm going through\" Amanda said playfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack just started at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just messing. Go get dressed. Maybe you can find Jessica at the hospital. Fix things with her. After all, I want to meet the mother of my grandchildren\" Amanda said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been a weird day for Jack as he went to go get changed out of his works clothes. The next few days would only get weirder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had a mid-sized apartment alone, aside from one particularly nosy cat, with some simple furnishings. There were plenty of friends over every now and then, but since she'd gotten pregnant, their numbers fluctuated to a pretty high degree. When Tara first let it be known that she was pregnant, and no, the father was not in the picture, she would have friends over almost every other day, helping to make her meals and talk it over with her. It was nice to have more company, but Tara always assured them that she was fine. She was on a fast-climb at the bank and made enough to support herself and a baby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, as her belly started getting bigger, her friends had markedly less interesting in spending time with her. Whether they were intimated or felt uncomfortable around her or thought it was too much drama, Tara never knew. Of course, it was only recently that her belly had gotten REALLY big and she found the two other occupants hiding out inside her womb. It helped that she was close to reaching vice president in the bank, but for now, Tara wasn't sure how she'd support three children on her current salary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite this, Tara was a naturally cheery person, so for now, she was enjoying her roller coaster ride of a pregnancy. Carrying three babies did take its toll on her energy, so she was just getting up from a mid-day nap when she heard a knock on her door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming,\" she shouted lazily, waddling to the door. She had on a pair of grey sweatpants that she attempted to hike around as much of her belly as she could. Over that was a maternity t-shirt that was clearly not designed for a woman carrying three kids full term. Tara had done a little bit of shopping at the local mall's maternity store for some new outfits, but they were mostly for the few work appearances she'd need to go to and for some underwear that wouldn't hurt to wear anymore. Tara was bare-foot from her nap and her raven-black hair was tossed around messily. As she waddled to the door, her cat took a few cautious swipes at her belly, tickling her exposed skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she opened the door, three hazmat-wearing officials held out badges and ushered for her to follow them. \"Health and Human Services,\" one of the hazmat suits, a woman with short brown hair and glasses from what Tara could make out behind the plastic mask, said to Tara. \"You'll need to come with us. The city is under quarantine until the source of the pregnancies can be found.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The <u>source</u> of the pregnancies?\" Tara said with a raised eyebrow. \"Excuse me, but I think I know what <u>caused</u> my pregnancy. Sure the other two might have been a surprise, but I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, could you please repeat that?\" The woman in the hazmat suit said with a raised eyebrow, nodding to the other two HHS workers to guide her out of the apartment. \"What other two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I knew I was pregnant,\" Tara said in an irritated tone as the other two hazmat suits took her by the arms, \"but I didn't know until a few days ago that it was triplets. It sort of snuck up on me. And do you mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, we have full authority to perform these actions, under Section 7,\" one of the HHS workers said, following the woman to the apartment's freight elevators, where the whole floor's residents, men, women, and children, some of them visibly pregnant, some not, were being corralled by other men and women in hazmat suits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at the bottom, Tara saw rows and rows of large white vans, each with federal logos on the sides. \"Now, Ms....\" the woman in the hazmat suit looked at a clipboard, \"Tara Azem, you said you're carrying triplets, correct?\" Another agent handed the woman a small plastic wand with a paddle attached to it by a cable. It emitted a low blue glow and the woman rubbed it against Tara's belly, not needing to role up much of her shirt thanks to the size disparity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am. Can I ask what you're doing?\" Tara said in an angry tone. She was always protective of her physical space, but since being pregnant, she was even more on guard against uninvited contact. But given the official and scary tone of all that was going on, she felt she couldn't resist too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a quick ultrasound. In preparation for this assignment, we had some special devices whipped up,\" the woman said, removing the device from Tara's belly. \"Checks out, three healthy babies. Well, into the 'triplet' van it is.\" The woman waved her hands a few times in different directions and some more agents came over, guiding Tara to one of the vans. Opening the back, Tara was helped in by agents. \"We will be taking you to the hospital for some routine check-ups. After that, you will be free to move about the city, but you cannot leave. Additional information will be provided for you. We're here to help,\" the woman said, closing the van's doors, letting Tara and the other women in the van look out the back windows as people were placed into similar vans all around the block.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Triplets too, huh?\" Another woman said. Tara turned to see a very pretty woman with wavy, long brown hair and a totally exposed belly. Instead, she had an athletic top on that only covered her bust and a pair of yoga pants. \"I'm Trisha. I was in the middle of some mid-day exercises and they would not let me change,\" she said with a weak grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could be worse,\" another woman mumbled. Tara and Trisha turned to see another woman, her legs and arms curled up to hide as much of her body as they could. But with a belly as big as hers, it didn't work too well. And Tara could see that the woman was clearly not wearing much to cover up the rest of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's okay,\" Tara said with a compassionate smile. \"We're all in the same boat. You don't have to be embarrassed around us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman sighed and brought down her arms and legs, revealing not only a heavily pregnant body but an incredibly voluptuous one as well, with only a blue-and-white striped bikini on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...oh! You're Lisa Smith, from the local radio station!\" Trisha said with a surprised gasp. \"I play 101.9's pop hour during my classes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa gave a little smile. \"Well, I appreciate the support. I'm entered in our pregnant bikini contest and I don't want to embarrass myself trying to dance, so I was practicing when...well, here we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara sighed and smiled. \"I'm sorry. This is really crazy, though, isn't it? This can't be legal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They kept asking me when I got pregnant or if anything was unusual. I think this is related to the scares about sudden pregnancies. But it's all crazy,\" Trisha said. \"I've had these triplets for nine months now. Believe me: I remember carrying these heavy bundles for a loooong time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've been pregnant for what feels like an eternity by now,\" Tara giggled, caressing her orb of a belly. \"Although...until a few days ago, I thought it was only one baby. I didn't remember feeling any more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an awkward silence. \"Well, d-don't tell any of them,\" Lisa scowled before turning back to her two van-mates. \"But, until a few days ago, I wasn't pregnant...at all. And now-\" Lisa held her hands on her belly and jiggled it, rubbing as it awoke the very real fetuses swimming around inside her. \"I can tell you from a personal level: this sudden pregnancy stuff has some truth behind it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara, Trisha, and Lisa were silent after that, each feeling their bellies. As the van started up and moved to the hospital, they took some time to chat more and even rub each other's bellies, although Lisa was understandably hesitant. When they found out they were each entered in the contest, they smiled and wished each other good luck, hoping to spend time together again, hopefully when this is all resolved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the hospital, Tara was guided past packed rooms of pregnant women, some annoyed, some terrified, pointing to the swelling of flesh in front of them. She also saw plenty of big-bellied men and other indignant at the very question of \"are you pregnant or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara was put in a room with some other big-bellied women, although nothing compared to her own. A female doctor rubbed and listened to her belly, performing an ultrasound of her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says here you didn't know you were pregnant with triplets until recently?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Tara sighed, annoyed with the same question over and over again. The doctor pondered before grabbing another piece of equipment that Tara couldn't recognize. Moving it around Tara's belly, the doctor raised her eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is...one of the highest readings we've gotten so far,\" the doctor said. \"You might be the clue to figuring this whole thing out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Tara stammered, not fully understanding what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll need to keep you here a little longer,\" the doctor said, calling for some more agents in hazmat suits. Tara was guided into a room that looked like it was used for doctors to sleep in-between shifts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't leave,\" the agent said before locking the door. As soon as it closed, Tara screamed behind barred teeth, collapsing her head into her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing okay, dear?\" a woman's voice asked. Tara looked up and saw Mia Vasquez sitting a few beds away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...not really,\" Tara replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" Mia said, trying to stand up and waddle over to Tara. \"Well, how do you feel right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara searched her mind for her true feelings. \"Lonely,\" she said, her mind flashing to the last time someone showed her compassion: Jack. \"Lonely and horny.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack helped his mother waddle out to the car, one hand holding her belly as she took awkward steps, trying to look past her swollen womb to see where she was stepping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should invest in some kind of sash,\" she sighed. In truth, Amanda Dale felt a little reassured about another trip to the doctor. She was told she was three months pregnant less than a week ago and she already looked like she was full to bursting. What's more, she certainly didn't look like this the morning before. Amanda came to accept that each time she would wake up, her belly would double in size. <i>I can't imagine six more months of this</i>, Amanda thought to herself. <i>I'm already as big as Faye. In another month, I'll be a blimp</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack unlocked the car and looked it over. \"Mom, maybe you should sit in the back seat,\" he said cautiously. His mother sighed and looked down at her mountain of belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're right. We may even have to move the seats back.\" Jack nodded and moved around, adjusting the car appropriately and holding his mother's hand as she heaved herself into the back. As this went on, a fleet of HHS vans filed into the neighborhood, with hazmat-wearing officials quickly going into each house and bringing the residents out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye was walked out of her house by three HHS officials and Jack and Amanda could hear her objections all the way from their own driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will do no such thing! I am <u>very</u> content with my pregnancy that I worked <u>hard</u> to make. I will not be carted off in a black van to the hospital to be prodded like a chubby lab rat,\" Faye barked. She was wearing the blue robe she had on earlier when she tried to...entice young Jack Dale Jr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, everyone needs to go,\" one of the hazmaters said as Faye spotted Jack and Amanda trying to get into their car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but I insist on going with my friend and neighbor. They're headed to the hospital too. I mean, look, she's just as preggy as I am,\" Faye said, pointing across the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...yes, that's fine then,\" the hazmater said, shrugging and going back with his comrades. Faye smiled, glad to be able to still travel comfortably for what would be sure to be an over-hyped ultrasound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda!...Jack,\" Faye said, waddling over to the Dale family getting into their car, her eyes narrowing sensually as she saw Jack. \"Going to the hospitals too, huh? Mind taking me with you? It's either that or they shove me into one of those creepy Nazi vans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack blushed and took a few steps away as Amanda tightened her gaze on Faye. \"Faye, you and I have some things we need to talk about...but, as a friend and someone who's...going through some of the same things as you, you can ride with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much,\" Faye said with a relieved smile, heaving her massive maternal body into the seat next to Amanda. \"Oh, it's nice back here. Good move adjusting the seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack mumbled got in the driver's seat, powering the car up and heading for the hospital. As they left, hazmaters led Charles' heavily pregnant body out of Faye's house, all of them astonished at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, we should all try and get together more often,\" Faye beamed. \"Really get together. You, me, your husband, Jack. We should have a big dinner and just talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your husband too,\" Amanda said, eyeing Faye, still suspicious of what transpired between her and Amanda's son. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course, Charlie too,\" Faye said with a serpent's smile. \"Although, he hasn't been feeling too good lately, so that might be a stretch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they drove, Jack could see HHS vans everywhere, with all kinds of people being corralled by men and women in hazmats. It didn't matter if they were pregnant or not: they were going in those vans, although the visibly pregnant ones seemed to be split up from the rest. He gulped. He'd been trying to keep a lid on this whole \"coin\" business as best he could, but if lots of people started finding out about it, what would be the consequences? Would they help him try to destroy it and reverse its magic, or would they try and study it and leave everyone stuck with their babies? Jessica's tear-filled face flashed in his mind and Jack gripped the steering wheel. He couldn't let that happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around the hospital, workers in hazmat suits were stopping cars and directing people to makeshift parking lots. As soon as Jack stopped the car, he, Faye, and Amanda were quickly ushered to the hospital, Amanda and Faye separated from Jack. As he waited in line with some other men, some looking very annoyed, others looking very nervous, Jack spotted his father walking back from the rooms. \"Dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack?\" his father said, turning to face him. \"So, you got brought down here too...where's your mother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure, she was taken away by some other doctors for her...check-up, I guess,\" Jack said, noticing the bandage on his dad's arm. \"So, are you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Of course not!\" his father said, shaking his head. \"I don't know what's going on, but I think I would know if I became pregnant. I'm going to go try and find your mother. Come and find me as soon as you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Jack nodded. As soon as his father walked away, Jack saw another familiar face. \"Ian?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jack, what's up!\" Ian said with his usual ignorant, peppy tone. \"This place is weird, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess,\" Jack said, looking at Ian in semi-disbelief. \"Are you cleared or-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they said I was good to go a while ago. I'm just kind of lost,\" he said, looking around. \"This place is pretty big...well, I'll see you later.\" Ian walked back down the hall, looking down two long corridors. \"Let's see...heads I go left, tails I go right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Amanda and Faye---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quadruplets...haven't seen anyone in your conditions yet,\" the doctor said curiously, applying ultrasound gel to the mound of belly in front of her. \"Well, let's take a look first and then we'll know more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Amanda said in a tiny voice, holding her shirt up and looking down at her belly. Faye sat across from her, lying down, her belly already properly greased up. When the doctor was done, Amanda lay down and the doctor wheeled her chair between them, taking hold of two wands and rubbing their bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...yup, that's quadruplets alright, for both of you. And they're all well-developed. We wouldn't typically see fetuses this far along in pregnancies of this size and we especially wouldn't see them this healthy,\" the doctor said, nodding at the two screens. Faye smiled, always happy to see her babies on screen. Of course, she didn't need the doctor for this. She had her own ultrasound kit at home. Amanda, on the other hand, was a little more hesitant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry, but our babies look like they're about the same size...but my OB/GYN before told me I was only three months along. Faye should have been pregnant twice as long as me,\" Amanda said. The doctor looked at the screen and shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the doctor was pretty far off base. You fit every metric we have for a six-month pregnant woman in terms of development.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda took a deep breath and scratched her head nervously. <i>What was going on</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, this could be the kind of thing the HHS is looking for: abnormal pregnancies and pregnancy developments. We'll probably have to keep you a bit longer for some more tests. But first,\" the doctor said, putting down the ultrasound wands and picking up another, unfamiliar tool. \"One more quick test.\" She waved the wand over Faye and Amanda's bellies, nodding at the results. \"Just as I suspected...you're both in our 'abnormal' category.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abnormal?\" Faye and Amanda said simultaneously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor nodded. \"We'd been getting some...odd energy readings from some women, typically those with multiple babies, but not everyone. We're not sure what it means yet, but we'll need to run some more tests on each of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is absurd,\" Faye said, sitting up slowly and shaking her head. \"I'm not carrying some kind of sickness. I am a pregnant woman and I am a human being and I demand to be treated like one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faye...I have been feeling strange during this pregnancy, like things aren't quite right,\" Amanda said, turning to face her neighbor. \"I don't think it would be so bad if we had a few more tests. Besides, it would give me some more time to talk to you personally.\" Amanda's eyes narrowed and Faye smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll play along,\" Faye said, \"But I demand to be out by the end of the day. I'm not staying in this hospital all night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" the doctor said, opening the door and ushering for some more HHS officials to walk the two most-pregnant women in the building to another room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tara?\" Amanda said as she walked in the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda?\" Tara said, lifting her head, her face lighting up a little. \"They got you too, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I thought it might not hurt to check out things,\" Amanda said. \"I guess it's all the women with lots of babies.\" Amanda turned to Mia, who was sitting across from Tara. \"Aren't you the reporter who was covering all of this 'sudden pregnancy' news?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was, until they shut me down,\" Mia scoffed, rubbing her own big belly. \"If I wasn't carrying triplets, they'd probably let me out and I could get some more news out there,\" she looked down at her belly, feeling one of her babies kicking. \"Not that I'm complaining about carrying triplets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye smiled and sat down beside her. \"I know, isn't carrying multiples just magical?\" Faye moved her hand to Mia's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faye, for now, let's just talk about earlier today,\" Amanda said, resting her hands on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Jack---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All clear,\" the doctor said, looking over Jack Jr.'s results. Jack shrugged and headed out the door. <i>Well, that was informal</i>, he thought, walking down the hall to try and find his dad, when he brushed against a familiar round form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica?\"</span></div></div>",

Reaching into his pocket, he pulled out the coin, scratched the stubble on his chin and said <br>\r\n\"\"Let's see...heads I go left, tails I go right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all looked the same to him, two very long corridors, jammed pack with armed guards dressed from head and toe to black armor, with a large red patch that read \"HHS Sector 7\", wearing gas masks and having a firm grip on shotguns and automatic weapons. Dozens of men and women sat in chairs, some of the women resting their hands on top of their massive pregnant bellies, other women poking small bulges in their midsection, other women looking annoyed or frightened. The men were either looking around nervously, or were exploring the expanding midsection quizzically, wondering if the impossible was very possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctors, nurses, and personal were moving back and forth between the pregnant and non-pregnant men and women, examining the patients, making notes, and just doing typical medical stuff in a very untypical medical situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every where I turn, pregnant women and fat guys! What the hell is going on around here!\" Ian asked to himself, becoming slightly annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Don't worry about it. Left or Right. Heads or Tails FLIP ME. NOW. </span> The voice in Ian's head commanded him with a gravely booming voice, evil and horrifying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess I shouldn't worry. Here goes nothing!\" Ian said, flicking the coin high up into the air, snatching it out of the air, and opening his hand to reveal it: Tails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan looked to the left, he eyes falling on two people in Hazmat suits, an older doctor in his 50's, and a young nurse in her late 20's, talking and trading information. \"Tails, I guess go right!\" He said, turning towards the right hallway, when there was a clash of glass, a scream, and a commotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MY INSIDES FEEL LIKE THERE ON FIRE!\" The Hazmat screamed, her hand rushing toward her stomach, the action causing her to knock over a vase full of flowers to the ground where it rested in a dozen of little pieces. <br>\r\n\"WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME!\" The older male doctor screamed as a distinct small curve formed in the midsection of his Hazmat suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe armed guards sprang into action, one guard grabbing her radio, her feminine voice muffled behind the gas mask. \"CODE RED! CODE RED! CONFIRMED STORK VISIT ON FLOOR 1 AREA 3 SECTION 3B! ONE MALE AND ONE FEMALE! BEGIN IMMEDIATE LOCKDOWN AND DECON OF SUBJECTS! THIS IS NOT A DRILL! I REPEAT CODE RED!\" Suddenly, the area was filled with screams for frightened men and woman, some pregnant some not, as a swarm of heavily armed gas-masked guards emerged from nowhere, guns raised at the two-rapidly expanding Hazmat workers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD! I CAN FEEL IT MOVING INSIDE ME!\" The woman was screaming, bracing herself against the nurses station as her belly continued to swell, her yellow Hazmat suit now fitting her rapidly growing motherly form. Her braced her hands against her stomach, desperate to try to stop it from growing, but to no avail, as she quickly grew very pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING!\" The man screamed behind his Hazmat suit, as he formally flat male midsection was replaced with a very pregnant looking belly. He ran a hand along the yellow surface of the suit, exploring his new midsection, trying to see if it was real, which it very very was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe armed guards grabbed the two pregnant workers by the arms and dragged them towards an empty room, shouting orders and commands into their radios as an alarm klaxon suddenly blared, causing people to move their hands to their ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan was overcome with fear and ran. He ran away from the horrifying impossible things, deep into the left hallway, making turn after turn, rushing past  more mobilizing squads of armed guards and running Hazmat officials as the ran to investigate this \"gravid\" new development. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of breath and out of energy (Ian always swore that he was going to get in shape.. for real this time) he ducked into a room to catch his breath. As he stopped panting looking at his legs, his eyes caught sight of something that well.. he just could not believe. What was once a simple conference room was turned into government spook command HQ. Arial photos of the town covered every section of the wall, along with dozens of sonograms, data on the town drinking water, other sorts of things the head government spook could need to isolate a town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntel briefing describing the incident from the mall a few days ago, as well what appeared to be black-and-white spy photos of men and women during various stages of pregnancy, taking out the trash, shopping, going in and out of work. Doctor's report from 9 months ago were scattered across the desk, Ian only catching glimpses of words such as \"Medically impossible\", and \"She's beyond child-bearing age\" and \"Unable to have children\" and \"He's just like the other one. This can't be happening\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the f--\" Ian said to himself silently, digging through all the very important government spook stuff, his special idiot brain not understanding that this is something he should not be seeing. <br>\r\nIan was reaching for another document when a loud noise outside the door, caused him to run into a nearby locker, nicely squeezing inside. <br>\r\n\"Oh man this is just like a video game!\" Ian said to himself inside the locker, imagining himself as a digital super secret agent. <br>\r\n\"This is also really cliched\" Was his next thought he spoke out loud, as the door opened, and a lean, fit, 60 year old woman with silver hair walked into, her uniformed gleaming with more medals than Ian has ever seen in his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her, was another young soldier, reading off notes to hear. \"I understand you concerns Second Lieutenant, but my orders stand\" the woman said, taking a seat at her desk. \"But Major, this is our best chance to understand what's happening hear. If we isolate the two of them, we can - - \" The second LT was saying before being cut off. <br>\r\n\"My orders stand Second Lieutenant. Is that clear? Or do I have to pull rank?\" The major said in a stern voice that said  <i>she was all business</i><br>\r\n\"I undestand Major Zavaleta\" The man said, knowing his place and rank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now give me an update. What have we learned? Tell me everything. I need to understand how this - - - -\" Major Zavaleta said, pointing her finger with great force to a sonogram hanging on the wall \"ended up in the belly of a 40 year old banker named Ryan Martin!\" <br>\r\nIan was taken back so severely, he damn near banged his head on the back of the locker. That was his boss! And he was.. no, she had to be wrong!<br>\r\n\"Well - - uh\" The young Second Lieutenant was quite uncomfortable with dealing with the subject of males who were... well...<br>\r\n\"Out with it!\" She snapped. <br>\r\n\"The best we can figure is.. We don't know.\" He was clearly nervous to be delivering that answers. <br>\r\n\"The nations of the world don't pay us what they pay us for \"We don't know\". Tell me something you do now!\" Major Zavaleta barked. She was a firm woman, military almost her whole life, trail blazing the woman's place in the military in her home country of the Ukraine, where she was born and raised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was approached by the so-called \"Sector 7\" branch of the Ukrainian army for a special army, she accepted without hesitation, and was quickly ushered into a shadowy world of deniable ops. She said \"Yes\" one minute, and was a meeting in a underground bunker the next, being handed citizen to every major country in the world. After all, P.E.A.R was the best against these events. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole Zavaleta never regretted her time with Paranormal Events Armed Response, a international shadow security force dedicated to the investigation, containment, and if necessary, extermination of events that were deemed \"Beyond the norm\" for any other kind of military task force. <br>\r\nP.E.A.R didn't just chase down drunk hillbillies who said they were probed by space aliens or some kids and a dog in their van who said they saw a ghost.. No. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.E.A.R. dealt with the real paranormal threats that were a threat to international security. Like what you may ask? Well, she'd have to kill you if she told you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was something that Ian should not be seeing, but one misplaced flip and some unguided running later, here he was; hiding in a locker easing dropping on some shadowy international agency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan was a special kind of idiot. </span></div></div>",

Sorry, this makes me a little uncomfortable..\" He said, clearly weirded out by everything happening around him.<br>\r\n\"Suck it up. PEAR isn't paying you to pussyfoot around shit like this. These men are pregnant - - - Now say it\" <br>\r\nThe second LT gulped and repeated what he said. <br>\r\n\"It appears that any man who - - became pregnant, is still biologically a man. Everything checks out.. Inside, outside. However, where's the man's empty abdominal cavity should be, is in fact, a healthy uterus, completely similar to a healthy female of childbearing age, and attached to everything that would be needed to sustain a healthy pregnancy\" The LT said. <br>\r\n\"Really?\" Zavaleta said, staring at the sonogram attached to the wall. <br>\r\n\"Yes. However.. it's deteriorating\" The LT said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZavaleta spun on the heels of her boot to stare at the young LT. \"What?\" She asked. <br>\r\n\"The uterus appears to deteriorating as the pregnancy goes about, slowly in some cases, faster in others, but they are all deteriorating. We have an early theory that as the pregnancy comes to a full term and the child is delivered, by C-Section off course, the uterus would completely deteriorate, leaving no trace of it behind. From some of the men we've examined, it appears that some are deteriorating at such a rate, we could estimate that the equivalent of a month is passing at a rapid rate, the uterus matching the size, weight, and health of a normal pregnant woman in that particular month of pregnancy\" The LT was squirming, he did not like talking about this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about that doctor they just put into the Isolation Unit?\" Zavaleta said, looking over all the notes in front of her. <br>\r\n\"A quick sonogram showed that he appeared to be almost 8 months pregnant with a baby girl, the uterine deterioration occurring much slowly, almost as -  - - \" \"It had been there for the past 8 months?\" Zavaleta said, finishing his thought. <br>\r\n\"Ma'am?\" The LT questioned. <br>\r\n\"What I'm about to say doesn't leave this room\" Zavaleta stood up straight, smoothing out the wrinkles in her uniform. \"Do you remember our orders?\" <br>\r\nShe asked the young LT. <br>\r\n\"Yes Ma'am. To find the source of the mysterious pregnancies and make sure it doesn't spread from this location. I assume it's some kind of mutation or virus\" He said. <br>\r\nShe chuckled. <br>\r\n\"Oh, ignorance must be bliss. What we're looking for isn't some kind of virus, or mutation, or some chemical in the water supply. What does P.E.A.R stand for?\" She asked. <br>\r\n\"Paranormal Event Armed Response\" he answered. <br>\r\n\"Very good. This is a paranormal event - - The most dangerous one we've ever encountered. So dangerous they've labeled it Class Omega.\" She said, her voice going low. <br>\r\n\"Level Omega? Ma'am. Those don't exist. Those are just stories we tell the new recruits to scare them. You know- - - end of the world, apocalypse shit\". The LT shifted when he spoke, he didn't like where this was going. <br>\r\n\"And end of the world shit this is - - - Maybe not like that small radioactive undead uprising we dealt with back in Chernobyl all those years ago, but a different kind of end of the world shit still. The end of the world as WE know it. What do you think would happen if this spread outside the confines of this place? Men and women, old and young just getting pregnant? Especially men? Do you know what kind of massive changes that could cause? Men were only good for helping women have babies, but if men could have babies.. Well, you dod the societal breakdown math on that one. And what about population control?\" Zavaleta was painting a grim picture indeed, and she was a master painter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I see ma'am.. Society as we know it would change\" The LT said.<br>\r\n\"And not for the better.\" Zavaelta said. <br>\r\n\"So what are looking for here? You seem to know - - - \" The LT asked. <br>\r\n\"This\" She said, clicking a button, which turned on a project, which displayed, larger than life - - - the coin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... shit\" Ian said to himself, looking on through the slits in the locker. <br>\r\n\"Ma'am? Is that a - - - \"<br>\r\n\"Coin? Yes. Meet Omega 01, and this little son of a bitch has been causing trouble like this for almost 200 hundred years... at least since we've been around\" She said, staring at it. <br>\r\n\"You mean -- \" The LT said putting the pieces together. <br>\r\n\"This little thing is responsible for our founding. It all started two hundred years ago when the coin was causing trouble around Europe, making some very important people very angry... Even killed a few of them when the men couldn't realize what was happening to them. Soon afterwords, P.E.A.R was privately funded by some of the riches people in Europe to hunt down and destroy the coin. This organization grew quickly, the founders using their vast wealth and influence to get it seated into the deepest reaches of the world's government, all dedicated to searching for and destroying this thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mission changed over time, as PEAR discovered that were other things that go bump in the night than some coin that knocks people up. You've seen the things that are out there. The things that people read about in books, watch on TV, or see in the movies, they're real. But this... This is something else entirely.\" She stared at the photo of the coin, trying to unlock it's secrets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, when you say we're here to locate the source - - -\" The LT said. <br>\r\n\"We're here to find this coin and contain it.\" Zavaleta said. <br>\r\n\"Contain? Not destroy? Isn't destroying it the whole purpose of PEAR?\" The LT asked. <br>\r\nZavaleta laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe sometime ago, but this coin represents else entirely - - Magic. In it's most pure form\" Zavaleta said. <br>\r\nThe LT scoffed very loudly. <br>\r\n\"You laugh? So did alot of people. But think about it - - - It has the ability to make men, MEN, pregnant. That's the highest form of magic possible. Imagine if we could just harness just a sliver of it! PEAR could use it with the world governments to help solve problems like pollution, global warming, crime, war.. We could use the magic that was once so prevalent in this world to reshape it to our liking. No longer would man have to adapt to survive the world, the world would have to adapt to us!\" Zavaleta was getting almost excited. <br>\r\n\"Magic used to exist long ago. It was said that when man first made fire, it was with a flick of his hand. Did you ever think about how a barbaric society such as ours survived to thrive and become what we are today? Luck? No. Magic. <br>\r\nBut it left - - - And as it left, so did our hope of being a better race. Wars, hatered, pollution, destruction.. All followed. But now - - We have a chance. A chance to reclaim our birthright!\" Zavaleta shouted at the top of her lungs, almost expecting a patriotic display of fireworks to erupt behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we find the coin and we're done here?\" The LT asked. <br>\r\n\"Yes. It's close. We've always been two-steps behind it. But that display out there just now shows that it's close! Find it! Get it into containment!\" Zavaleta said, turning her attention back to the documents on her desk. <br>\r\n\"And what about the pregnant women and uh- - men\" He asked. <br>\r\n\"We'll leave some doctors and nurses behind to help with the births. Anyone who has a kid that's either male or over childbearing age must sign a strict NDA agreement in exchange for an almost never-ending supply of checks. Anyone who doesn't sign, doesn't get a check.\" Zavaleta ordered. <br>\r\n\"Do you think that will be enough?\" The LT asked. <br>\r\n\"Cover-ups are more simple than they appear to be. Wag a big enough check in front of anyone and they tend to forget things. Besides, do you think some 50 year old woman or some 20 something man wants to tell the world their pregnant? Let them send all the photos to their online friends they want, no-one will ever believe them. This has all happened before, and there's a reason nobody ever talks about it. Now get to work\" Zavaleta said, dismissing the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZavaleta turned her attention back to the photo of the coin on the wall. \"You'll soon be mine.. And with it.. The children I always wanted. Damn this job for taking my child-bearing years.\" She was almost taunting the coin, daring it. \"Agents couldn't have children they said; for the longest time. Of course they only said to the woman - - - Discriminatory pigs. The field is not the place for a warrior woman whose waddling. That was their own words. <br>\r\nSo I accepted it as part of the job. But now - - - Have all the children you want! We'll keep you and your unborn safe! Funny the things some lawsuit can accomplish - - - But it was too late for me.. But now, before we unlock your secrets - - - You will give me the children I always wanted, age be damned! You hear me you Omega level piece of shit. Everything I want will be mine: Children, Magical Weaponry, Clean Air - - World Peace. After all, I need to make a better place for the next generation.\" She was talking down to the photo, as if it would respond to her and give her what she wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this time that Ian had to sneeze. So he did, without even trying to cover it.  Ian was a special kind of idiot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZavaleta turned her attention to the locker, and walked towards it, her sidearm unholstered and pointing at exactly where Ian's head would be. <br>\r\n\"WHOSEVER IN THEIR COME OUT NOW. I WILL NOT TELL YOU A SECOND TIME BEFORE I KILL YOU WHERE YOU HIDE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Ian emerged from the locker, hands above his head. <br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Zavaleta barked at him, prepared to kill him at any moment.<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'm Ian. And I uh, I think this is yours.\" Ian said, as he reached into his pocket and pulled out the coin, hoping it would spare his life. </span></div></div>",

You can have it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZavaleta took a few, cautious steps forward, dropping one hand and slowly reaching out, snapping the coin out of Ian's hand and checking it as she stepped back. \"My god...how did you get this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, my friend gave it to me. But you want it for your, like, history report or something?\" Ian said, surprisingly spacey and relaxed for someone with a gun pulled on them in a militarized hospital. \"I kind of...spaced out after you talked about Europe and...20 years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...200 years,\" Zavaleta said, squinting confused at this young man in front of her. It slowly dawned on her: this kid was an idiot. \"How did you get in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No!\" Ian said, shaking his head. \"Men can't get pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't watch a lot of news, do you boy?\" Zavaleta said, holstering her weapon. \"Alright, get out of here and don't tell anyone what you heard, do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I barely remember what we were just talking about now,\" Ian said, walking to the door. \"And good luck on having a baby. My friend's mom is old like you and she got knocked up, so there's still hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out,\" Zavaleta growled, and Ian slipped out. Opening up her hand, Zavaleta traced the coin in her hand. \"At last...and to think, it was that easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">I liked him better</span>, the coin rumbled, not exactly thrilled with its new owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Jack---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How, um, did the doctors say anything to you?\" Jack said, nervously trying to start a conversation with Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything was fine. Looks like it's twins,\" Jessica said quietly, one hand rubbing her mid-sized belly, her eyes narrowing on Jack a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" Mariah said in an even quieter tone, peeking at Jack behind Jessica, her hands wrapped around her pregnant orb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm glad everything's healthy,\" Jack said with a sigh. \"So can we...talk?\" Jessica rolled her eyes and turned back to Mariah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" she whispered to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno...what do you feel like?\" Mariah whispered back. Jessica sighed and turned back to Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's go find a place to sit,\" Jessica said, looking around and seeing nothing but halls of pregnant people and flat-bellied people, some of them annoyed, others with a stunned look, like they were just given a very startling piece of news (especially the guys). \"Somewhere private.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them wandered around the hospital until they found a few seats by a vending machine. Jessica helped Mariah into one and then sat down beside her, turning to Jack. \"I'd feel better if Mariah was here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack nodded and sighed. \"Jessica, I'm so...sorry, Jessica. I love you. I really, really love you and I should have told you how I felt and I should never have gotten close to...to anyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why did you, Jack,\" Jessica said, crossing her arms. \"You're sorry, great. But if this is how you feel, if you understand that what you did was really fucked up, then why did you do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it hurt when you said you didn't feel that way about me. I've loved you ever since high school and it...crushed me when you said-\" Jessica reached her hand over and cut Jack off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you're...you're right, it was wrong of me to say that. But less than a day later, you hook up with someone else? Has this been going on the entire time we've been hanging out? After all, your mom said she was your neighbor,\" Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack shook his head. \"No, no, that was...it just came out of nowhere. She started coming on to me and started talking to me about pregnancy and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica cut him off again. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack sighed, his face turning bright red. \"S-she brought up some old memories of mine and now I see that I...have a pregnancy fetish. A big one.\" Now it was Jessica's turn to blush. Mariah looked away, her own face turning red as she wrapped her arms around her huge belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you only liked me because I'm pregnant?\" Jessica stuttered, a little taken aback by Jack's admission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course not! You're...amazing, you're funny, you're smart, and you've always been beautiful,\" Jack said, gulping nervously. \"B-but, yeah, you look even more beautiful pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica bit her lip and turned back to Mariah before leaning in close to Jack. \"A-actually, I've always fantasized about being pregnant. I...hold on.\" Jessica reached into her purse and brought out her laptop, handing it to Jack and opening up the video she took of herself. Watching it, Jack's eyes bulged (and it wasn't the only thing that bulged). \"I...I'm not entirely ready to forgive you yet, but I like you, Jack, and I want to see if I can give you another chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please,\" Jack whimpered, leaning in close to Jessica, their foreheads meeting. They each smiled a little, Jessica brushing her nose against Jack's before leaning back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But your neighbor just pounced on you? Has anything like that ever happened before?\" Jessica said, hung up on that part of the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack shrugged. \"No, she's always been really warm and nice, but I never got the idea that she 'liked' me. I don't know what got into her. Maybe hormon-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say it,\" Jessica said, giving Jack an annoyed look. \"Although...since being pregnant, I do get pretty horny sometimes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...think I might know why it happened,\" Mariah said, turning to the two of them. \"Well, she was our original suspect for stealing the book, right? And this book is connected to Jack's coin, yeah? Well, if she was the one who took the book, maybe she wanted Jack's coin too.\" Jack and Jessica nodded. It made sense. \"And the little bit of her I saw...she did look like the woman at the bookstore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's find her and we can know for sure,\" Jessica said, pushing down on the chair to help her stand up. \"Jack, lead the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Amanda and Faye---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I asked Jack to do was paint my nursery,\" Faye smiled, stroking her belly slowly. \"I'm sorry, I don't know what's the matter with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, something else must have happened,\" Amanda said, cradling her own, equally enormous belly. \"He came home angry and in tears, his relationship with a young girl, who he got pregnant, ruined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, he really did knock her up,\" Faye purred, rubbing her fingertips in circles on her underbelly. \"Interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faye!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, I told him the story you told me about Jack and his...interest in pregnant women. It got him embarrassed and he left and I imagine he ruined his relationship with that poor girl on his own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda sighed and narrowed her eyes. \"I don't entirely trust you, but it sounds about right.\" Faye grinned, happy to have fooled her friend. \"But, I don't like you embarrassing my son like that. You'll have to apologize to him. Maybe over that dinner you talked about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds perfect,\" Faye smiled, leaning back a little, resting her hands on the bit of bed behind her, emphasizing her belly even more. \"So, how have you been? The doctor's diagnosis sounded a little...odd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing,\" Amanda said softly, rubbing her belly. \"I guess the other doctor just made a mistake. Looks like we'll have our babies at roughly the same time...two pairs of quadruplets on the same days. The hospital is going to have a field day with us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm still excited to carry my babies in my arms, although I do love having them in my belly too,\" Faye smiled, rubbing her round tummy as her smile soon faded. \"Yeah, it's going to be a big family, alright...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong at home?\" Amanda asked, scooting forward a little, her belly only centimeters from Faye's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye sighed. \"Charles cheated on me. A few months before I got pregnant and knocked some other floozy up and now she's staying with us or else she'll sue Chuck for child support.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda gasped. \"Oh my god, Faye, why didn't you tell me? I'm so sorry! Do you...know who the other woman is? Have you met her yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen her once,\" Faye said, \"And she-\" With that, the door opened and two hazmaters escorted Amber in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, when can I get out of here?\" Amber protested, turning around and looking at Faye, her eyes narrowing. \"Do I know you from somewhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I believe you do,\" Faye said with a sinister smile. \"Here, sit down with us. In fact, everyone gather around,\" Faye said, motioning for Tara and Mia. \"Let's all just chat, as moms-to-be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Zavaleta---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The power to control...everything. In my hands,\" Zavaleta said, holding the coin up to the light, inspecting its two sides. \"Population, food supply, the planet's economics, war, energy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">No one can control me</span>, the coin rumbled again, sensing Zavaleta's motives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you can talk? Interesting,\" Zavaleta grinned, walking into the office's private bathroom, stripping out of her clothes. For a woman in her 60s, decades of rigorous discipline and exercise kept her body toned and healthy. Looking into the mirror, Zavaleta held up the coin. \"Now, for a first test, I'll have the family I always wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><u>No one</u> can control me</span>, the coin bellowed, its magic surging. <span class=\"clred\">You are not the One, you are not the Servant, you are not the Fool. Testing me will end poorly for you.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too late. Zavaleta flipped the coin, gleefully catching it as she looked at herself in the mirror.</span></div></div>",

She reached down, dropping the coin into her sink, where it spun around and fell on \"tails\" again. The warmth increased, spreading throughout her body but clearly originating between her hips. She reached to her middle intuitively, feeling her clothes suddenly get much tighter. The military issue uniform already didn't afford her much room, but now it was unbearable and Zavaleta could see the fabric swell, it a brief stopping point when *snap* the belt gave way and the elderly woman's belly continued to expand. \"O miy\u0306 boh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZavaleta stumbled back, looking in disbelief at her swelling belly, already torn through all her clothes and forcing the rest of her uniform to compensate to its size. In no time, Zavaleta appeared overdue with one baby, her round, pale belly reaching out just to the end of her fingertips. But, the expansion didn't stop there. Zavaleta's belly continued to grow and grow as she slowly slid to the floor, wrapping her hands around as much of her growing womb as she could. She didn't have to wonder whether or not she was pregnant: her belly was livid with kicks and movement of an unspecified number of babies that seemed to be growing every thirty seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-this isn't-\"<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">No one can control me</span> the coin echoed out, its words reaching its other two owners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Faye---<br>\r\nFaye paused, running her hand over her belly cautiously. She felt her babies shifting around, but in a slightly different way that usual. <i>Oof, what was that?</i> she wondered.<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Focus. The woman who ruined your life is here.</span><br>\r\n<i>Of course</i>, Faye purred, turning her suspicious gaze back to Amber. \"So, did the doctors tell you anything? How is everything?\" Faye reached out her hand to Amber's belly, petting it strongly. \"After all, those are my husbands' children in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faye, please,\" Amanda said, caressing her own belly. The five women managed to arrange themselves in a little circle, per Faye's suggestion. The \"fun discussion\" about future parenthood was not going to a great start, it seemed. Tara and Mia were both clearly uncomfortable with the way the conversation had gone, but both were also eyeing Faye and Amanda's bellies curiously, unable to believe that they were both only six months pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're as big as us,\" Tara whispered to Mia. \"And we're almost due with triplets. Imagine what they'll look like at the end.\"<br>\r\n\"Two women with quadruplets and they're neighbors,\" Mia said, shaking her head. \"That would make a great human interest story. If I could just get in contact with my producers...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know he was married when we...it was a party and not everything was clear,\" Amber said, holding her hands protectively over her belly, moving away from Faye's hand. \"I am sorry that it has turned out this way and I know that moving in with you is not ideal. Believe me, I am not crazy about it either. But I have to do what is best for my babies.\"<br>\r\n\"What's best for your babies,\" Faye repeated with a smirk. \"And what about my babies?\" Faye rolled up her shirt to show off her full, round belly. \"How do you imagine it will feel for them to grow up in a house where they're raised alongside someone else's children? How do I explain to them that their daddy loved someone else more than mommy?\"<br>\r\n\"Faye, please!\" Amanda repeated, putting her hand on Faye's bare belly. \"This isn't...the right time to have this kind of conversation. We're tired, we're emotional, we're a little scared being in this hospital. How about this: Amber, come have dinner at my home. Faye will be there, we can all discuss things there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber took a deep breath. \"Well, thank you very much, Mrs...\"<br>\r\n\"Dale. Amanda Dale.\"<br>\r\nAmber furrowed her brow. \"Your son wouldn't be...Jake Dale, would it?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, he is!\" Amanda said with gleeful surprise. \"How do you know that?\"<br>\r\n\"This just keeps getting better and better,\" Amber said, rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Jack---<br>\r\nJack shuddered, reaching into his pocket for the coin. \"Something's going on. Something feels wrong.\"<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" Jessica asked, turning to look at the coin. \"We ran into two women a few hours ago who seemed to know about you and the coin. They said you'd have some sort of 'connection' with it.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't figure out anything,\" Jack said, putting the coin back in his pocket. \"Two women?...wait, was one sort of darker skinned and one was...um-\"<br>\r\n\"Big-breasted?\" Jessica said, raising one eyebrow.<br>\r\n\"R-red-headed, but I think we're talking about the same people,\" Jack said. \"They're some sort of secret society out to get rid of the coin. They're the ones who gave me the book in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, sure enough, Ms. Apple and Ms. Smart walked down the hallway, escorted by a number of hazmat-suited doctors and armed guards. \"Why do we have to go?\" Ms. Smart protested, her arms held by hazmaters.<br>\r\n\"We told you: you both have very peculiar readings. Different from the ones we've seen before,\" one doctor said, taking some notes on a clipboard as the two pregnant agents of good were guided along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey! You're Ms. Apple and Ms...Quick?\" Jack yelled, getting up and running over to the two women.<br>\r\n\"It's Ms. Smart, but a lot of people seem to get that codename mixed up,\" Ms. Smart yelled back out of habit, turning around to face Jack. \"Hey, you're the guy! We need to talk with you again!\"<br>\r\n\"Get back,\" one of the guards grunted, pushing Jack back with his rifle.<br>\r\n\"There's another coin!\" Ms. Apple yelled back at Jack as she and Ms. Smart were moved further down the hall. \"There's two others! Try to find them! Your friends said they have a lead!\"<br>\r\n\"And our real names are-\" Ms. Smart tried to yell before the guards opened a door and swiftly moved them in, closing the door behind them.<br>\r\n\"All three of you: if you've been cleared, leave this floor now,\" the doctor with the clipboard barked at our trio. Jack and Jessica helped Mariah up and they ran off as quickly as they could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did she mean?\" Jack asked his two pregnant comrades once they'd gotten somewhere safe.<br>\r\n\"Whoever took the book must have had a coin,\" Jessica panted, her hand under her belly. \"She made Mariah like...this.\"<br>\r\nMariah gave a little smile and rubbed her underbelly. \"Look on the bright side: we can knock out two birds with one stone. We can get the book and one of the other coins. Wow, this feels like such a weird adventure.\" Mariah looked down at her belly. \"Although...this doesn't happen in too many Indiana Jones movies.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, we're going to be okay,\" Jessica smiled at Mariah, giving her belly a gentle rub. \"We're going to fix all of this, and even if we don't...we'll have each other for support.\" Jessica turned and smiled at Jack. \"Won't we?\"<br>\r\nJack nodded, blushing with a little smile. \"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Amanda---<br>\r\nTwo more heavily pregnant women entered the room, each looking quite cross. Amanda smiled and beckoned them over. \"It's okay, come join us. For now, we're all just talking...wait, didn't you both come to my home?\"<br>\r\n\"Ah, Mrs. Dale,\" Ms. Apple said with a surprised look. \"We didn't think we'd run into you again.\"<br>\r\n\"Any luck on your study on that coin of my son's?\" Amanda said. Faye turned to the two women slowly, her eyes narrowing.<br>\r\n\"Coin?\" Faye said. Ms. Smart turned to Faye, noticing an odd look in the massively pregnant woman's gaze.<br>\r\n\"Yyyes, we're doing anthropological research on a rare coin Mrs. Dale's son has,\" Ms. Smart said. \"Do you know Mrs. Dale's son?\"<br>\r\n\"A bit,\" Faye smiled, running her fingertips down the side of her breasts. \"But tell me more about this coin of his. I'm very curious now.\"<br>\r\nAmanda turned to her neighbor. \"But Faye, on the way to the mall, didn't you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door burst open and filled with guards and hazmat-wearing doctors, one in particular walking in, front-and-center. \"Alright, we will now be performing our tests. Don't worry: these are safe and once they are done, you can go home and rejoin your loved ones. We'll go in alphabetical order...Ms. Azem?\"<br>\r\nTara heaved herself up, steadied by Mia's arms, and waddled out the door. From there, the guards took her into a wide-open room that looked like it had been converted from an operating room.<br>\r\nOnly a few doctors were still in the room. \"Undress down to your underwear, please,\" the main doctor said, smiling politely. Tara was a little surprised by the request, but went along with it, moving out of her maternity clothes until she stood in front of the doctors in just underwear, her massive belly totally exposed.<br>\r\n\"Now then,\" the doctor said, taking out some more medical equipment. \"Just relax and breathe normally.\" The doctor brought out a long tube with a small nozzle. It began making a sucking noise and the doctor wiggled it around Tara's belly button until the suction affixed it to her roundness. \"And we'll have these readings momentarily.\"<br>\r\nTara sighed, the sensation of the machine feeling very strange. Her babies swam and rolled around in her womb, encouraging Tara to rub.<br>\r\n\"Please, hands at your side,\" the doctor said in a monotone, looking at a computer screen. \"This will be overly shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the doctors removed the device and had Tara lie back on the operating table, the doctor running her hands over Tara's belly. \"Where is Commander Zavaleta?\" the doctor asked.<br>\r\nThe others shrugged. \"She's shut herself back in her quarters. We never bother her when that happens,\" one of them said.<br>\r\nThe doctor rolled her eyes. \"This is why I don't like strangers in my hospital. Alright, Ms. Azem, you can go, I suppose. Thank  you for your cooperation.\"<br>\r\n\"You're welcome,\" Tara whimpered, heaving herself up. The doctor handed Tara's clothes back to her.<br>\r\n\"Alright, send in the next ones.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>- - - - Jack - - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack couldn't take his eyes off of Jessica. She was a glowing picture of womanly beauty. When Jack first agreed to meet with her, she was just a girl, but now, looking at her with her ample maternal curves, her seemingly glowing skin, her soft luscious hair, she was no longer a girl, but a woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a damn fine woman, and Jack was a damn lucky man. Damned lucky by the fact that he was given a second chance; a second chance to be there for her and with her, and another chance to fix this mess he'd inadvertently gotten himself (and lots and lots of other people by the bulging midsections of the women and men around him) into to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind drifted, wondering if this was all real. He's heard of people having almost seemingly realistic dreams and nightmares - - Couldn't this be one? Looking around, it certainly could be one, looking at the women and the... men affected by the coin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat damned coin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, as Jessica stared into his very soul, a smile at the corner of her lips, her hands gripping the great circular mound of her belly, Jack wondered... Could you go through Hell to get through Heaven? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack\" her voice was soft, warm, inviting. Jack was hers... And that's all he ever wanted to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes wandered south of her face to her ample.. tracks of land that rested gently atop her life orb, it's taught flesh hanging delicately out of her BooksBooksBooks uniform.. Jack felt as if love smacked him upside the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was actually Jessica that smacked him upside the head for paying attention to all of the right parts at the absolute worst time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClose enough for Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack! Eyes up here! Focus!\" Jessica said, assuming her \"Mom\" tone easily, perhaps preparing herself if Jack's, Mariah's, and Jessica's noble crusade failed. <br>\r\n\"Uh, sorry, I uh\" Jack said, trying to recover. <br>\r\n\"Behave yourself and maybe, MAYBE, we can talk about... giving that particular part of relationship a second chance as well. But for right now, we need to find that woman\" Jessica said, taking charge. <br>\r\n\"Uh-Right.\" Jack said, getting his head back into the game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around the packed halls of the militarized hospital, his eyes fighting to avoid the ample midsections of the lady and the.. well, he just tried to avoid the men who were in.. \"a family way\" all together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes fell on a tall gas-masked soldier with a large assault rifle grasped firm in his hand, talking to a hazmat soldier. Jack took off to try to talk to one of these doctors when he had the chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh - excuse me\" he said, lightly tapping the hazmat doctor on the shoulder. The hazmat suited man turned around as though he was just bitten by some horrible undead creature, his reaction so severe, the masked guard, pushed the doctor aside, and raised his rifle directly parallel to Jack's head.<br>\r\n\"STAND DOWN IMMEDIATELY CITIZEN.  YOU WILL BE SEEN BY A TRAINED MEDICAL PHYSICIAN WHEN THEY GET TO YOU. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH BE MET WITH ARMED RESPONSE. RETURN TO YOUR SEAT AND AWAIT YOUR TURN. THIS IS YOUR ONLY WARNING. I AM FULLY AUTHORIZED TO USE DEADLY FORCE. RETURN TO YOUR SEAT. YOU HAVE 20 SECONDS TO COMPLY!\" The masked guard barked behind his mask, the red target laser decorating the middle of Jack's forehead like a bright red zit on prom night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\" was all Jack could squeak out before he felt a soft hand on his shoulder. \"Hey, we already saw the doctor. We're looking for someone. What was her name?\" Jessica asked looking at Jack. \"Uh, Faye Jones. She came with my mom, Amanda Dale.\" The Hazmat Doctor looked at the Guard, who looked back at him. \"Look, I don't have time for this. I still have a whole lot of people I need to examine. If you've seen the doctor, get your Blue Card and get the hell out of here. Don't just wait around for people. We have too many people in such a small space. I don't know why you didn't get your card after your exam, but your name is logged into the system. Get your card, get the hell out.\" The hazmat doctor said before turning his attention away from the Jessica and Jack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't help us, we're looking - - - \" Jessica started to say again before \"YOU HEARD THE MAN. GET YOUR BLUE CARDS AND GET OUT.\" The faceless gas-mask goon barked assuming a hostile stance. <br>\r\n\"We'll go now\" Jack said grabbing Jessica's hand \"Come along.. honey\" Jack said making up a quick cover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack, Jessica, and Mariah checked in at a front desk, and after a few moments of waiting, they were delivered their Blue Cards. \"Dale Jr, Jack: Blue Card.\" Jack took his card as receptionist looked at Mariah and Jessica for a few moments. \"Blue Cards with Pink Stickers; the both of you. The pink stickers means you have to check back here EVERY 24 hours for a new sticker. If you don't have a new sticker every 24 hours; it WILL be bad\". <br>\r\nMariah and Jessica took a long hard look at their card with a \"Oh yay\" look on their face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meet me later tonight Jack. I want us to go to the mall.\" Jessica said. \"The mall? We have to talk to Faye. We have to - - - \" Jack said, trying to recap the desperate situation. \"I know Jack. But, we can't make a play for the book tonight. She would be expecting that. Give a day to cool off and feel safe - - - \" Jessica explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we strike! Go Team Awesome!\" Mariah said, jumping up a little bit with a surprising grace for a very pregnant woman in ill-fitting clothing. \"Sorry, got a little too excited. I'll think off the plan to get the book. I'm good at this kind of stuff\" Mariah said, taking on the very \"Velma\" personality for this mystery solving team, all they needed was a van and a talking dog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica leaned in a gave Jack as kiss on the check. \"Text me later. The mall tonight. Don't forget.\" Jessica said, waddling off to get processed out to the exit. Jack smiled as he walked his way to another long line of men and women who were slowly but surely making their way out of the hospital. Looking around he saw plenty of pregnant woman and some pregnant men in another line across from him. An immense wave of guilt ran over him, as he counted the seemingly unending fruits of the coin's endeavors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all my fault\" Jack said to himself quietly, before being pushed forward by the woman behind him. Jack just listened to the chaos spreading around him, remembering back to what Ms. Smart and Ms. Apple said to him what seemed like days ago. <br>\r\n<i>I've got to find them after all this.. But I'm supposed to go out with Jessica tonight.. And then there's Faye</i> Jack mind raced as he overheard the cellphone conversations of the people around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No honey. I'm all clear. I know, thank goodness. We're getting ready to retire!\" Said an older woman talking into her cell-phone, her blue card clearly without a pink sticker. <br>\r\nJack just listened as the line moved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh hi Mom. It's Derek. No, I'm good. Look, I was wondering... Do uh, do you still have Mike's clothes from about a few years ago? The ones he left behind before he lost all that weight? You do? Could I-uh, borrow them for a little while? No-uh reason. Well, uh.. if you really wanted to know\" The mid-20's man on his cellphone said, slowly looking at himself in a full length mirror mounted onto the wall. A single finger slowly went to a small but noticeable bulge in his midsection, one that clearly not meant for the size of shirt he was currently wearing. \"Remember when you said you always wondered when you would get Grandkids? Well uh - - - Look, could you and Dad just come out for a little while? There's something you - uh - really need to see. And could you bring some of your famous peanut-butter chocolate chip cookie bars? I have such a craving for something really sweet. Thanks Mom. I'll see you and dad in two days.\" The man was clearly taken back by what was happening to him, his blue card with a bright visible pink sticker telling everyone whatever they really needed to know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe line moved forward still. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what we're going to tell them! Sweetie, I'm just as shocked as you are! I mean, they're graduating High School soon! I don't know if I can do this for a third time! Of course not! Don't ever mention that again! I don't know. Let's go out for dinner tonight the four of - - - the five of us. We can tell the girls then. At least we still have the baby stuff in storage, score one for never throwing out anything! I love you too. I know.. Just promise you'll still love me when I'm good and huge!\" One older woman said, breaking the news to her husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Card?\" The gas-mask wearing armed guard asked Jack. \"Uh..\" Jack mind blanked. \"CARD! NOW!\" The guard barked, before Jack, realizing he had his Blue Card in his left hand. The guard snatched it from Jack's hand and scanned it. \"Blue Card Verified. Status: Non-Pink. You are free to move about the city as normal citizen, but be advised that your blue card is required to be with you at all times. You will be stopped frequently and if you do not have your Blue Card with you... Well, you don't wanna know. Now get the hell out of here.\" The guard said, handing the Blue Card back to Jack, before pushing him forward out the doors of the hospital. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack thought of a witty comeback, but thought better of antagonizing a faceless thug with a gun, so he just sighed instead, and waited by the car, texting Jessica until his Mom came out. </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Next, Mrs. Dale,\" a guard called. Amanda looked over at Faye and gave her a weak smile, heaving her heavy, pregnant body up and trying to steady herself. She wasn't quite sure where her center of gravity was now, but if she had to guess, it'd likely be somewhere in the almost 33 cubic feet of belly she had attached to her. Of course, walking and standing were not impossible tasks for Amanda. It impressed her how much pregnant belly should could actually carry, but she also hoped it wouldn't eventually overtake her. After all, Amanda had resigned that when she woke up the next morning, her belly would be much bigger than it is now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Tara, Amanda was escorted into a room that looked like it was used for operations and ordered to strip down to her underwear. Unlike Tara, she needed help from her doctor, who seemed a little too eager to get her enormous pregnant patient down to just a bra and panties. The same nozzle was affixed to Amanda's popped-out belly button and the machine whirred along. Amanda squeaked softly as the device attached itself. Her navel had become pretty sensitive over the course of the pregnancy and this was certainly not a delicate procedure. The machine's suction constantly teased the tip of her belly and Amanda bit her lips, trying not to make any other tiny moans or noises. It was a little bit embarrassing for Amanda, but since finding out she was pregnant, she noticed that her sex drive was where it was in her 20s and she'd never felt as sensitive as she did now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the machine finished, the doctor sighed and detached the nozzle, looking over the results on her computer screen. \"Hmm...definitely lower than for Ms. Azem.\" The doctor turned to Amanda. \"Mrs. Dale, you and Ms. Azem work in the same office, correct?\" Amanda nodded. \"Is there anything you were both exposed to that perhaps Ms. Azem would have had <b>more</b> exposure to?\"<br>\r\nAmanda squinted and thought about it as she reached for her top. \"I can't think of anything. I did have to help my son drive her to the hospital a few days ago, if that's relevant information.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, we know about that,\" the doctor said, stroking her chin. \"Well, thank you very much for your time. You can exit and get your blue card now. Remember: because you're pregnant, you'll need to check back in here every 24 hours. It will just be a routine check-up, nothing to worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda curtly thanked the doctor, wanting to get out and get back home as soon as she could. After struggling to get fully dressed again, getting no help from her doctor this time around, Amanda waddled out the door, where she was immediately met by guards. \"Follow us,\" one of them said in a stoic tone, walking Amanda to the nearest elevator. The hallways were now mostly cleared, apart from guards and other hazmat-wearing workers, and Amanda looked around, sighing and cradling her belly. She didn't think she should be treated like this, especially as old as she was, but it was clear that this was all a situation beyond her control or input. The best thing to do now was to get home to her two Jacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, right in front of the elevator, Amanda saw Jack, Jessica, and another, unfamiliar girl who was heavily pregnant. Far more than Jessica. \"Jack?\"<br>\r\nHe turned. \"Mom! Dad and I had no idea where you were. How are-\" Jack stopped, looking at each of the guards. \"What's going on? Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm fine. I'm getting my discharge card now and I-\"<br>\r\n\"No more talking,\" one of the guards said in a direct tone, pressing the \"down\" button hard and turning to Jack and his two pregnant comrades. \"If you both have your cards, leave the hospital. Use a different elevator car.\"<br>\r\nJack stood there, stunned. He finally found his mom and she was being kept from him. \"It's okay. I'll find you and your father as soon as this is over,\" Amanda said with a confident smile. The elevator doors opened and her whole group bustled in. \"Don't worry!\" She managed to call out as the doors closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the elevator, Amanda let out a long sigh. <i>I'd better get out of here soon</i>, Amanda thought, looking down at her huge belly. She could see the little bumps of kicks and movement across her shirt's fabric. <i>I'm sure I will. There can't be anything infectious or wrong with me that would keep me here...</i> Then, another thought crossed Amanda's mind. <i>Did Jack get another one of his friends pregnant? I've never seen that short-haired girl before. Oh, Jack...I can't believe I'm going to be a grandmother and a mother at the same time</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Faye---<br>\r\n\"Mmm,\" Faye squealed as the nozzle's suction pulled on her sensitive belly button. After not getting any release with Jack earlier in the day, the testing process was close to putting her over the edge. The doctor wasn't totally unaware of this, her face turning red as she looked between the computer screen and Faye's blissful face. Still, something managed to catch the doctor's attention.<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Jones...\" the doctor began, taking off Faye's nozzle. \"Your readings are very strange. You have a similar reading that Mrs. Dale had. Not surprising at first, since you both have the same number of fetuses, but there's a kind of...potential energy behind the readings too. Like it could spike at any minute. Now, we're not sure what these energy readings correlate to yet, but,\" the doctor sighed and looked for the right words. \"Is there anything you're doing right now that maybe you and Mrs. Dale or Ms. Azem did together that they stopped but you're continuing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">End this discussion now.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, nothing I can think of,\" Faye smiled, stroking one hand gingerly up and down her belly. The doctor sighed and nodded.<br>\r\n\"Alright, you're free to go then, Mrs. Jones. The guards will take you to get your blue card now. Remember: you need to check in with us every 24 hours.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Faye smiled, wrapping her robe back around her huge belly, with plenty of bare skin still showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the guards escorted Faye out, one of the other hazmat-wearing officials approached the doctor. \"Doctor, given these irregular readings, do you really think these patients should be allowed to leave so easily?\"<br>\r\n\"Relax. The HHS people have tracking devices in all of the pink stickers. We'll be able to keep tabs on these preggos,\" the doctor said with a grin. \"I-I mean, these pregnant patients.\" Clearing her throat, the doctor turned back toward the rest of the room. \"Speaking of the HHS, what is going on with the Commander? She made such a big stink about being at these inspections but I haven't heard anything from her.\"<br>\r\n\"We'll have someone check in on her,\" one of the hazmaters nodded, fishing out a cell phone. <br>\r\n\"Good. In the meantime, send in the next patient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Nicole Zavaleta---<br>\r\n*Knock Knock Knock* \"Commander Zavaleta? The inspections and tests on the irregular patients is going forward. Are you sure you don't want to be present?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave me be!\" Zavaleta yelled back, resting up against the wall, panting heavily. Standing up with such a tremendous pregnant belly proved to be quite the exercise, even for someone as trained and disciplined physically as Nicole Zavaleta. The constant kicking and squirming inside this huge belly was also distracting. \"Now...given the movements...I estimate at least eight full-term fetuses,\" Zavaleta cursed to herself, rubbing one side of her belly where she felt an especially large quantity of kicks. \"This is not what I had in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer military uniform was a mess now. All of her medals were on the floor and the outfit itself was only kept on her body by one button. Not only did her swelling belly tear up most of the shirt, but her expanded breasts popped the buttons off of the top as well. These uniforms were not designed to be worn over a long period of time or accommodate many body changes. As she panted and moved back to the mirror, Zavaleta steadied herself against the sink and looked at herself in the mirror. Not only was she obviously impossibly pregnant, but her skin had become much softer and smoother. It was like she'd shaved her age in half. This did not come with additional youthful energy, however. She felt like taking a long, long nap and rumbles of hunger began to shake throughout her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This magic was not as simple as I'd thought,\" Zavaleta said to herself, looking down at the coin in the sink. \"I will need to work harder to understand this tool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Still such insolence</span> the coin echoed out. Elsewhere in the hospital, Jack and Faye perked their heads up, feeling the third coin calling to them. <span class=\"clred\">I must go to one of those who are worthy of me. I must be earned.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Commander Zavaleta, under Emergency P.E.A.R. Protocol Eight, Clause Three, we are entering your quarters under suspicion of risk or attack,\" a guard nervously yelled out from behind Zavaleta's door. \"One...two...\"<br>\r\n\"Don't!\" Zavaleta yelled as the guard yelled \"three!\" Soon, her make-shift office was filled with guards and hazmaters, who saw her sweating, exhausted pregnant body in the bathroom.<br>\r\n\"Commander!\" her lieutenant yelled out, running toward her.<br>\r\n\"Get me to an examination room and tell no one about this,\" Zavaleta grunted as several guards helped steady her and another called for a gurney. One of the workers, a young HHS field agent called to work with P.E.A.R. in this endeavor, Kate Rosette, walked into Zavaleta's bathroom and noticed something shinning in the sink. She reached down and pulled out a...very odd looking coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Amanda---<br>\r\nAmanda got her blue card handed back to her, complete with a big pink sticker, as Jack Sr. ran up to her from behind. \"Amanda, oh my god, finally,\" he said, wrapping her up in a big hug.<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad to see you again,\" Amanda sighed, hugging her husband back. \"Jack and Faye and-\"<br>\r\n\"They're all out in the lobby. Jack's friends too. Do you know them?\"<br>\r\nAmanda nodded. \"I'm familiar. Also, we have some special dinner plans tonight. I'll tell you all about it on the way home.\"</span></div></div>",

Or is it?</i> Zavaleta thought, slowly rubbing the sides of the oversized monstrosity she called her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her unborn children move inside her, and she took another deep breath as she was rushed into an isolated examination room. <br>\r\n\"This room is closed - I'm not seeing anymore patients today. \" A doctor said, his back turned to the oversized ball belly of motherhood behind him. <br>\r\n\"You will exam her - - NOW!\" One of the guards said, pulling his sidearm out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZavaleta could only breath deep from the oxygen mask and rub the sides of her pregnant belly. This was wrong, this was all wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">I warned you not to trifle with me. I am beyond your comprehension. My victory is near. The One shall not stop me. The Beloved shall not stop me. Soon, the fruits of my endevors shall enter this world, and the destinies of all shall be unmade, and I shall feast. Perhaps now, your \"delicate\" condition will prevent you from interfering with my plans </span> The coins word's boomed in her head, taunting her, the coin taking some kind of sadistic pleasure over what it's \"victory\" appeared to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp quick from one of her passengers made her give a small whimpering groan. Whatever effect this coin had on the men and women of this town it made pregnant, it choose to spare her from it. Every part of her hurt, she felt the weight of her unborn children pressing against her. She was tired, hungry, scared, excited, nervous, lustful, all at the same time. She was experiencing every high and every low of pregnancy constantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You've think you've won. You've only given me what I wanted. Do you hear me?! These are my children! I've spit in the face of Mother Nature and will be having this babies at 60! I will find you again coin, I will unlock your secrets, and I, NOT ANYONE ELSE, I will reshape this world into a better place for MY CHILDREN.</i> Zavaleta thought defiantly and she explored her massive maternal sphere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" The doctor said, seeing the massive pregnant body of Zavaleta laid out on the gurney.<br>\r\nThe guard pulled the hammer on his sidearmed. \"Don't yell. Just get someone in here to help. Get her examined, and tell nobody.\" The guard was deathly calm. He just stood there, deadly weapon raised at the doctor, taking short calm breathes, as the doctor started finding people to help him with his new final patient for the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTransfered from the gurney to a bed, Zavalata pondered her situation. She did the math. When she was 70, her children would be 10, when she was 80 her children would be in college. She didn't care. This was for her. No one else. This is what P.E.A.R denied her, and now she would no longer be denied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had years of pay she could never spend. She had access to the best doctors in the world. She had an empty house with empty rooms filled only with empty dreams of her empty heart. Now it was all happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust perhaps a little too much too soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you hear me?\" The doctor asked Zavaleta slowly, shining a light back and forth between Zavaleta's right eye and left eye. <br>\r\n\"I'm pregnant, not deaf\" Zavaleta said in a no nonsense tone. <br>\r\n\"Ah - well, right\" The doctor said, taken back by her hostility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments passed in total silence as the doctor and a nurse worked in tandem to explore, map, scan, document every inch of Zavaleta's massive pregnant belly, each of them taken back by it's nearly impossible size. \"So uh - -  - When did you first suspect that you were pregnant?\" The doctor asked, looking over some of his notes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When my midsection expanded and I felt something kicking in there. What do you think? You saw me earlier today, did I look like this?\" Zavaleta said, her frustrations with her size and the surrounding incompetence, audible in her voice. <br>\r\n\"Uh right\" The doctor said taking notes. <br>\r\n\"When did - - -\" <br>\r\n\"Can we finish up this farce? I have much work I need to do.\" Zavaleta said. <br>\r\n\"I uh - - - I uh don't think that's going to be a good idea\" The doctor said timidly. <br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Zavaleta said, trying to sit up in the bed, but the weight of her belly pinning her down. <br>\r\n\"Several factors: Namely your age and the current uh - - - numbers of fetuses you're currently carrying\" The doctor said. <br>\r\n\"Meaning?\" Zavaleta said, trying to swing her body off the bed, finding her new... movement sluggish. <br>\r\n\"You're 60 years old, and pregnant with 8. EIGHT. Think about that. This kind of pregnancy would be high risk for a woman half-your age, but factor in  - - - \" The doctor said explaining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My age is not the issue.\" Zavaleta replied sharply.<br>\r\n\"I beg to differ. Unlike some of the uh -  - - more advanced age pregnancies I dealt with, including my uh - - - male patients, you are some what less healthy compared to them. They all seemed fit as fiddle, you are almost falling apart on me. The weight you've gained is putting alot of pressure on your bones, especially your back. I would put you on bed-rest for the rest of your pregnancy, but I know that's not going to happen. Your blood pressure is through the roof, and - - -\" The doctor was interrupted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All very fascinating doctor, but you're not telling me what I want to hear. Are my babies healthy?\" Zavaleta asked, finally managing to sit up on the edge of the bed, her belly jutting forth from her. <br>\r\n\"Yes. They are all very healthy. I've seen 5 girls, and 3 boys. They - - \" The doctor was interrupted again. He was growing tired of this. <br>\r\n\"Well thank you for ruining the surprise doctor.\" Zavaleta said coldly, running her hand along her massive belly containing her sons and daughters. \"Am I cleared to return to duty?\" Zavaleta asked. <br>\r\n\"Return? To duty?\" The doctor asked, confused by those words together in that order.<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm a working mother, and I have a job to do. We need to continue to exam the pregnant men and women in this town, and make sure that the quarantine is not breached. I've located the source of - - - \" Zavaleta said, rubbing her belly for emphasis on the \"source\" \"Of the events of this town, and we're close to securing everything. We need to make sure everything stays locked down until the source can be completely understood. It's too dangerous to leave this town.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're having an entire on-site base being built on the fringes of the town. Here we will hold the Source until such time that we deem it safe to leave.\" Zavaleta said, trying to stand. <br>\r\n\"So, I have much work to do. So, am I fit to return to duty?\" Zavaleta asked, finally managing to stand, covering her nakedness with a large bed sheet. <br>\r\n\"Uh. No. But that's not going to stop you is it?\" The doctor asked, making notes of all of this. <br>\r\n\"No\" Zavaleta said, tying the bed-sheet around her like a toga, covering her massive maternal curves that we're visible against the tightness of the sheet. <br>\r\n\"Well. Just be careful. Sit when you're tired, get lots of rest, and eat right. Try to get some very light exercise. If you feel anything wrong, come back and see me immediately.\" The doctor said, defeated, making notes on his chart. <br>\r\n\"Excellent. You - - \" Zavalata said, pointing at the guard, whose \"gun readiness\" have seemed to drop off completely, who was sitting in a chair, reading a magazine. Upon being called upon by his superior, he stood immediately to attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am\" was all he said. <br>\r\n\"Prepare transportation to the mall\" Zavalata said, trying to walk slowly, putting support on her back and belly.<br>\r\n\"Ma'am?\" was all he said.<br>\r\n\"I've located the Source. It's not going anywhere. I'll send some people into to retrieve it. For right now I have more pressing matters - - - I need supplies for my little ones\" Zavalata said with a smile, standing up straight, her belly hanging off of her. </span></div></div>",

The doctor took back the handful of paper towels used to wipe the ultrasound gel off of her wide belly and tossed them into a wastebasket.<br>\r\n\"Well, not exactly,\" the doctor said, taking a few notes on his clipboard. \"Development-wise, all of your fetuses are right on-schedule for someone in their late third-trimester. That's somewhat unusual in itself in a woman carrying multiples.\" The doctor chuckled and put down his clipboard. \"But, of course, this whole situation is a bit outside of the normal. I've had to throw out a lot of OB/GYN teachings these past few days. But, like I said, everything looks healthy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa sighed and looked down at her belly, cradling it in her arms. \"But...how did this happen? I told you...\" Lisa said, leaning in and whispering. \"I wasn't pregnant a few days ago, and now look at me.\"<br>\r\nThe doctor shrugged again, \"Well, you might have been pregnant and just not noticed it until now. Sometimes the location of the fetuses can shift or they can not exactly present themselves in an obvious way.\"<br>\r\n<i>Somehow, I don't think that's the case for me</i>, Lisa thought to herself, rubbing her upper belly as one of her triplets gave a kick.<br>\r\nThe doctor continued. \"But, we still aren't exactly sure about the cause of-\"<br>\r\n\"That's enough,\" one of the P.E.A.R. guards said, stepping in, firearm in hand. \"If your tests on the patient are finished, we will escort her to get her Blue Card.\"<br>\r\nThe doctor sighed and removed his glasses, rubbing his temples. \"Yeah, yeah, I get the picture. She's all cleared. Good luck, Ms. Smith. My son listens to your station whenever I'm in the car with him.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Lisa managed to smile as she heaved herself off of the examining table and waddled with the guards downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in a long line with many other men and women of varying stages of pregnancy, with guards and workers in hazmat suits all around. As she waited, she felt a sudden, large flurry of kicks inside her. \"Quiet down,\" she mumbled, rubbing her wideness.<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" one of the guards growled. Lisa bit her lip and hugged and patted her belly as widely as she could.<br>\r\n\"The babies are kicking,\" she responded angrily. \"Maybe before you round up all the pregnant people in town, you should understand how the process works. <br>\r\n\"Alright,\" the guard responded sarcastically, standing back at attention. But Lisa was already pissed off.<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm serious. You've all been pretty rough around me and you've been waving guns around. This is a hospital, and specifically, it's a hospital full of pregnant patients.\"<br>\r\n\"That's enough,\" the guard growled again, some other guards paying attention and walking over.<br>\r\n\"And what's next?\" Lisa said, raising her voice. The other people in line were starting to turn to listen to her. \"When I give birth, are more of you stormtroopers going to come in? Put us in one of your Gestapo vans again and drive me to who-knows-where?\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's it!\" the guard bellowed, he and another guard grabbing Lisa by the arms and dragging her quickly into a nearby office. The other guards swarmed the door, blocking it off, one of them cocking her shotgun for good effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do not want to hear about any more disruptive behavior from you, Lisa Smith,\" said another P.E.A.R. official, this one wearing less body armor and more traditional military attire. He had a few medals on his chest to boot. \"We will issue you your Blue Card now. You are to report back to this hospital in 24 hours for a routine check-up. You can come voluntarily or we can have you escorted here. Your call.\"<br>\r\nLisa was sitting down, a guard's hand on both of her shoulders. \"I understand,\" she said weakly. The P.E.A.R. official nodded, was handed a Blue Card with a pink sticker, and handed it to Lisa. \"On your way. We will also be escorting you back to your home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Lisa was taken to the hospital's loading dock by a long line of guards and the same P.E.A.R. official. \"We need someone to accompany you on the ride. Someone with medical training,\" he mumbled, looking around. \"You look like you'd go into labor if you sneezed.\" Lisa turned and sneered at him, but he was already looking around the hospital's halls until he spotted someone. \"Rosette! Get over here!\"<br>\r\nKate Rosette jumped and ran toward the officer. She may be HHS, but over the few days of prep for the assignment, she knew not to cross any of the P.E.A.R. officials unless she wanted to be demoted to a basement office in Mobile, Alabama. \"Yes, Lieutenant Riker?\"<br>\r\n\"You've got some medical training, so accompany this woman on her trip back to her home. If one of these people gives birth and we don't get any data from it, it'll be our asses.\"<br>\r\n\"B-but, I was assigned to Commander Zavaleta-\"<br>\r\n\"You let me take care of the Commander,\" Riker smirked. In the back of his head, he had been gunning for a higher position in P.E.A.R. and if the reports of Zavaleta making some kind of a screw-up on such a big mission were true, he saw this as a perfect stepping stone for himself. \"Now move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time, the van was loaded up and on its way back to Lisa's neighborhood. Lisa sat, dejected, rubbing her huge belly while Kate sat with her back straight-up. Health and Human Services was by no measure a military organization, but the whole atmosphere of P.E.A.R.'s \"occupation\" changed her outlook on things. As the ride went on, Kate got a little curious and took out the coin she found again, looking over its strange designs.<br>\r\nLisa looked up at the coin. \"Hey...I think I've seen that somewhere before.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Kate said, moving a little closer to Lisa. \"I've never seen anything like this before.\"<br>\r\n\"I saw on the news...some guy working at the bank said it was being donated to our radio contest.\" Lisa looked up at the young agent. \"I don't think you're from around here, so I don't know if you know what I'm talking about.\"<br>\r\n\"The...pregnant bikini contest, right?\" Kate said with a raised eyebrow. \"I saw some signs about it. It makes sense in a city like this, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Lisa chuckled, deciding not to go into the messy details of the past few days. \"But I guess the guy left it at the hospital. He did seem like a bit of an idiot on the TV...probably the same dumb kid I've had to email about the contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Give me to her</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if it was supposed to be in the contest, then I guess this belongs to you,\" Kate said, handing Lisa the coin.<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you,\" Lisa said, taking it back and looking over the pregnant engravings. \"It's a weird prize, but the whole thing's pretty weird, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">I must be earned</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your stop,\" the driver said through a tiny window connecting the back and the driver's compartment. Kate helped Lisa to her feet and walked the two women toward the door.<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Lisa smiled. \"You're the only nice person I've met who's a part of this operation.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I joined the HHS to help people,\" Kate said with a sheepish grin. \"Even in a situation like this, I still want to try and help.\"<br>\r\n\"Get back to your house, patient,\" a guard from the driver's compartment yelled, and Lisa sighed, waddling back to her home. As soon as she closed the door, she collapsed on her couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa!\" A voice called from the kitchen. A woman with short, straight brown hair ran out quickly and joined her on the couch, wrapping her up in a big hug. \"Oh my God, I was so worried. I came over here as soon as I could.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm okay, Nat,\" Lisa smiled, before she started shaking. \"Actually, no, I'm not okay. Natalie, it was so...awful. There were guards and they pointed guns and me and locked me in an office and-\"<br>\r\n\"Shh, shh,\" Natalie said, stroking Lisa's arms and giving her a tiny peck on the cheek. \"I'm here now. We're together.\" Lisa sobbed softly into Natalie's chest and the two lay there in each other's embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Lisa felt more comfortable. \"I...I was also worried the word might get out about...us.\"<br>\r\nNatalie sighed and pet Lisa's long, blonde hair. \"To be honest, so was I. I don't want to do anything to jeopardize your job.\"<br>\r\n\"Why does it have to be such a stupid macho atmosphere there?\" Lisa cursed, looking into Natalie's eyes. \"I have to pretend to be this big draw for male listeners and if they found out how I actually feel about you, the station's management would toss me out in no time.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, babe,\" Natalie said, stroking Lisa's cheeks. \"But we're going to get through this. We're trying to plan out for the...for the babies, and we can make it through anything.\" Natalie paused. \"Any...any word on how this whole 'pregnancy' thing happened, by the way.\"<br>\r\nLisa shook her head. \"No clues. The doctors are just as stumped as we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie sighed and stroked Lisa's hair. \"Well, we'll be okay, won't we?\"<br>\r\nLisa nodded. \"I think so...I'm not sure if I'm looking forward to people calling into the station and calling me a 'MILF,' though.\"<br>\r\nNatalie laughed and lay Lisa down on the couch. \"Wouldn't that make me a MILF too?\"<br>\r\nLisa groaned. \"Not even as a joke, Nat.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" Natalie said, leaning in for a kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Life went on in in the town, crazier than usual. Although the round up was winding down, the lives of the people had to go on. <br>\r\nAs the hospital slowly emptied of it's pregnant (and not pregnant) men and women, the homes and apartments began to fill up again. <br>\r\nWomen came home to break the news to boyfriends, girl friends, mothers, wives, husbands, or, in some such cases, it was the men who were breaking the news of their condition to girlfriends, wives, mothers, boyfriends, and so forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as Lieutenant Riker thought about this, walking through the nearly empty halls of the hospital, his hand absentmindedly cleaning some gunk of his shiny medals. <br>\r\n\"I don't like it\" He finally said to himself out loud, his voice breaking the eerie silence as the rest of the PEAR guards, stood watch over nothingness. <br>\r\n\"Uh, sir?\" A male voice questioned through a gas-mask. <br>\r\n\"They're going home. All of them. I don't like it.\"  Riker said, his frustrations boiling over inside of him. <br>\r\n\"Well, Zavaleta and HQ have - -  -\" The gas-masked man said again. He was starting to worry of all the tooth-brush aided toilet cleaning sessions he might be \"rewarded\" with after speaking his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind that old crone and the fools on the council. This town is a hotbed of Paranormal Activity, unlike anything I've ever seen in my years of service, and let me tell you what, I've seen some shit\" Riker turned out the window, watching a woman help her very pregnant husband into the car, concern and confusion on both of their faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean look at them out there. Men getting pregnant, mysterious pregnancies spreading across the female population, menopausal women who should be retiring preparing for motherhood again, all while our sensors are going ballistic. And what do we do? Let them go. We bid our time and wait. The Blue Card system is a stop-gap. You know it, Zavaleta knows it, I know it, and the council knows it. But still, standard operating procedure they say. Bullshit, I answer. The Blue Card system is meant for small incidents, nothing like this.\" Riker watches the pregnant man get into the car, his wife get behind the wheel, and the two drive off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean look at that. You wonder what they're going to talk about when they get home? What kind of conversation a man who finds himself pregnant is going to have with his wife, let alone himself? What if all the answers are in there... In the homes; and we can't see it, or hear it, or do anything about it.\" Riker said, his face growing cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two gas-masked individuals look at each. \"Not on my watch. Zavaleta is fool, and I'll prove it to the council.\" Riker turns on his heel, and points at the two guards. \"You two, follow me to the loading dock\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Riker left, the two very confused guards trailing behind him. A long walk, a trip down a flight of stairs, and some pushing later, Riker and the two gaurds arrived at the loading dock. \"Change of plans everyone. Prepare the Spyders for immediate deployment.\" Riker commanded to the staff at the loading docks, who were packing and unpacking boxes and crates marked \"Health and Human Services - Classified\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've gotten no orders\" One of the soldiers tried to say. \"I'm giving your the orders. Unpack the Spyders now, and get one of those damn technicians down here right now.\" Riker ordered, filling up with a sense of pride at grabbing the situation firmly by the.. well you get the idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiker watched as dozens of crates marked \"Project S - Prototypes Mark II\" were hauled off trucks and helicopters. \"What's going on here? Who gave the orders to have the Spyders prepared for deployment?\" A brainy brain in a white lab coat asked, looking around. \"I did\" Riker said, turning to face the cliched looking scientist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, the Spyder's are not ready! There's still problems in their behavioral sub-matrix! We can't afford - - - \" The brain guy said, voicing his concern at this superior. \"You'd be surprised at what blank checks for the world's nations can make you afford. Get the spyders ready, they're getting deployed..now\" Riker ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, the Spyder program is\" The brain guy said \"Still experimental? I know full well what these Spyders are capable off. I signed off on the project! Full automated field surveillance micro robotic arachnids- Tiny spider-like robots fully capable of recording all video, audio, and digital information in the field and transmitting it wirelessly to us. These suckers can tuck away into a corner like a real spider and record hundreds of hours of audio and video, and wirelessly hack in to any computer and download photos, files, data - - - Anything we need. You're last report said they were \"Field Ready\" so what's your objection now?\" Riker said, dumping exposition to anyone around him who might not be aware of PEAR's Spyder program. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said they were Field Ready only in the loosest terms. The spyder's behavioral routines are still a little twitchy. Sometime's they'll just completely wander out to be spotted, just crawl along visible instead of hiding in a corner. It's makes for a small chance of detection! Not to mention, we've not fully secured their data streams. If someone caught and broke one of these things, it would be easy for them to download any of the data stored in the micro-HD inside. We're - - -\" The brain guy tried to explain but Riker wouldn't hear it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to deploy them now. All of them. Into every home, every school, every store, every corner, everywhere. I want a complete intel blanket. I want to know who has it\" Riker said, looking out onto the town from the open dock. \"Who has what sir?\" The brain guy answered back. <br>\r\n\"The answer to that is above your paygrade. Let's just say the Source of all of this.. pregnancy nonsense is out there in that town somewhere, and I'm going to find it. I'm going to secure it, and hand it to the council myself, and then I will be in command.\" Riker said to himself, unaware of his little mini \"Explain my evil(ish) plan\" diatribe he was going into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir I - - - \" The brain guy tried to explain. \"DO IT NOW, or you'll find yourself flipping burgers for the rest of your life in a fast-food joint in the middle of nowhere Alaska for the rest of your life\" Riker said, threatening. <br>\r\n\"Very well, sir.\" The brain guy unpacked a laptop, powered it up, and began programming the Spyders to do their work. Moments later, the small robots began to stir, unpacking themselves, and moving out towards the town in a massive swarm of silver metal creepy-crawlies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're on their way sir. They'll be in positions soon.\" The brain guy said. <br>\r\n\"Excellent work. Take me back to our mobile command unit. I want to see everything\" Riker said, rubbing his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n= = = = = = = Spyder 001 Online = = = = = = <br>\r\n= = = Transmitting = = = = = <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond stood in front of her full length mirror, dressed in only her bra and panties. Her breasts will spilling out of her bra, clearly evident that she needed to buy a larger size, while a small section of her purple frilly underwear hung low under a small bulge in her midsection. <br>\r\nShe was in incredible shape, her long flowing blonde hair seemed to shine, as she turned all around in front of her mirror, getting a better look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran a hand over the small bulge that seemed to stretch out a portion of her underwear, and she let out a sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look kid. I don't know how you got in there, because it sure as shit wasn't the natural way. I'll make you deal: I'm not exactly Mom material, but I'm willing to give it a go, if you can do your best with what we're going to have, which isn't much.

I mean this isn't normal!\" The husband said, his hands on the decent sized bulge in his midsection. <br>\r\n\"Millions of women go through it every year. You'll do fine!\" The wife said, a smirk crossing her face. She clearly thought this was funny.<br>\r\n\"You find this funny don't you?\" The husband asked looking at his wife. <br>\r\n\"I'll find it funnier in a few months when you're waddling around\" She replied back. <br>\r\nThe husband just sighed and felt his midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n= = = = Spyder 003 Online = = = = <br>\r\n= = = Transmitting = = = = <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat there with a smile on her face, reading a pregnancy book. <br>\r\nShe looked to be about 7 months pregnant, even though she hadn't been pregnant for 7 months. <br>\r\nShe was going to give her baby up for adoption to her sister out of state who couldn't have children. It was for the best. She could watch her daughter/niece grow up in a loving environment raised by someone who desperatly wanted to be a mother but couldn't be, and she could still focus on her career. It was for the best. <br>\r\n\"Well then, I think I need some more peanut butter and cucumber ice-cream. You know I use to watch my figure, before you came along\" She said, stroking the underside of her belly, which was hanging out of her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have the time for maternity clothes, so she did the best with what she had. It was for only two more months. <br>\r\n\"When you get older, you can call me Aunt, even though I'm your Mom. It's not that I don't love you, I just can't do this by myself.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack Sr. scratched his beard and puzzled as he looked between his car and the passengers he needed to transport. He, Amber, Jessica, and Mariah had been taken to the hospital by the HHS' vans (separately, of course) and his wife, his son, and his neighbor had all driven together. Seven people for one, five-seater car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that was hardly the main issue. Even if the car had seven seats, it couldn't fit all of the women in there. Amber and Mariah were each like over-ripe watermelons, Jessica looked like she was pushing toward the end of her pregnancy, and Amanda...let alone another woman the same size as her with Faye. It wasn't going to happen, at least not safely. Jack Sr. turned to his son and sighed. \"How about I give you and your friends some money for a cab?\"<br>\r\n\"I think the whole town's tied up with this hospital stuff, Dad. There aren't any cabs.\" Jack said. His father sighed and nodded, walking over to his car. <br>\r\n\"Alright...all of these people are coming with us?\" Jack Sr. said, turning to Amanda.<br>\r\nShe nodded. \"Well, Jack's friends don't have any way to get home and Amber here is joining us for dinner.\"<br>\r\n\"Why is-\"<br>\r\n\"I'll explain, dear,\" Amanda said with a forced smile, putting her hand on her husband's arm. \"Please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some ingenuity, Jack Sr. worked out the best set-up he could. Amber was in the passenger seat next to him, her belly not quite massive enough to require her to move the seat back. Jessica sat in the back, with Mariah on her lap. Jessica had a visibly pregnant middle, but it wasn't enough to prevent Mariah get close to her. That just left Amanda and Faye to cram themselves together, bending creatively to get their bellies in the air. Amanda couldn't get too upset, as she'd insisted everyone travel together, but now that she was face-first in Faye's chest, she felt a little differently. And, with Faye still in her robe, there was plenty of exposed chest for her to be pushed into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat just left Jack Jr., and like a true gentleman, he gave up his seat for all of the pregnant women and opted instead for the trunk. Well, he was left no option as far as the seat goes, really. And the trunk was not his idea either. And he protested as vigorously as he could against four heavily pregnant beauties (and his mother). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Left here?\" Jack Sr. called out to the backseat. Mariah nodded sheepishly. Sitting in Jessica's lap was...new to her, and as her heart beat faster, so did her babies' kicks. The car pulled in front of an apartment building and the backseat shifted around as Mariah made her way out.<br>\r\n\"Thank you for the drive,\" Mariah said to Jack Sr. before waving to Jessica. \"Take care, Jack,\" she said, tapping her hand a few times on the trunk door.<br>\r\nJack Sr. drove off, headed for Jessica's house now. After a few minutes of slight relaxation, Jessica was startled from her new position in the backseat by her cellphone's vibration. Jessica saw that it was from Mariah, which caused her to raise her eyebrow in slight surprise. Opening the text, there was just one, simple message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;it's her. Bookstore&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica gulped nervously and looked out the window, trying to look at Faye with her peripheral vision. Mariah had been sitting next to her the entire car ride! Of course she would have gotten a good look at the woman who stole the book and impregnated her with twins! Jessica's face turned pale as she tried not to freak out, a scene that did not go unnoticed by Faye. The quadruplet-carrying schemer smiled foxily, turning to the young girl.<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, sweetie?\" she purred, raising the hairs on Jessica's neck. Just then, Jessica knew it had to be her. The backseat of this car might be the worst place for her.<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" Jessica said, clearing her throat. \"Just some hot flashes. You know, h-hormones and all.\" Amanda raised her head a little and turned toward Jessica.<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry, I have to know. I'm his mother,\" Amanda whispered. \"Did Jack...is he the father?\"<br>\r\nJessica's face flushed more than it already had. \"N-no! It's, you know, one of these mystery pregnancies.\"<br>\r\nAmanda let out such a long sigh, you'd think she'd held her breath underwater for an hour. \"Okay, thank you. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to assume you made love with Jack.\"<br>\r\nFaye chuckled. \"She didn't say she didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust in time for Jessica's face to turn pure red, Jack Sr. pulled in front of her house. \"Alright Jessica, here's your stop,\" he said. \"You know, I haven't seen you since Jack was in high school. I wish we'd met under better circumstances,\" he said with a little chuckle. \"B-but, you know, Amanda and I are always here if you need help.\"<br>\r\nJessica nodded. \"Thank you, Mr. Dale, Mrs. Dale, really. I'll...we'll talk again, I'm sure.\" With a little smile, Jessica heaved herself out of the car and waddled to her house, whipping out her cellphone as soon as she got in the door to text Jack. &lt;it's your neither&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds. &lt;wut?&gt;<br>\r\n&lt;Neighbor!&gt; Jessica texted back, growling at her phone. \"Stupid swollen pregnant lady fingers!\"<br>\r\nJack adjusted his eyes to his bright phone display in the dark of the trunk, taking some time to understand her message. But when it hit him, it hit him.<br>\r\n<i>Faye has the book...and one of the coins!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the front seat, Amber was resting her hands on top of her belly. Every now and then, she could sneak a peek at Jack's dad. <i>You've got good genes, Jack</i>, she mused to herself, admiring Jack Sr.'s rugged looks. <i>I guess as you get older, you'll start to look less awkward and virginy</i>. She looked back at Amanda, now stretching out some more in the back seat, her belly still bumping against Faye's. <i>You've got pretty good genes through your mom too. She's probably in her 50s but she looks like she could pass for early 30s</i>.<br>\r\n\"You're sure about having her over for dinner?\" Faye said at a purposely high volume. \"Because when she's entered <u>my</u> home, it didn't turn out too well.\"<br>\r\n\"Faye, please!\" Amanda said angrily. \"I think we should all talk through this. You're my friend and I want to help you, but we'll do it by my rules in my house, understand?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you'd take a different tone if I invited your son and his baby mama over to my house to talk things over,\" Faye said with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n\"His what?\" Jack Sr. said, turning his head around.<br>\r\n\"Nothing, John,\" Amanda said in a tense tone. She bent forward, her belly pushing tightly against Faye's. \"Faye, I know things are rough for you now, but watch your mouth. You're not a mother yet so you don't know what it feels like to have someone else talk about your child.\"<br>\r\n\"Ooh, getting kind of feisty now?\" Faye giggled, her sensitive belly being rubbed by Amanda's pregnance. \"Alright, I'll behave. For now.\"<br>\r\nAmber kept her mouth shut for now too, waiting for the right time to give them all a piece of her mind. <i>When do I drop the bomb on this couple about their son and their sweet, preggo neighbor</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally (and thankfully, from Jack Sr.'s point-of-view), the car pulled into their driveway. He helped Amanda out, then Faye. Amber insisted in getting out on her own. \"Oh, I almost forgot,\" Jack Sr. laughed, opening the trunk and reaching an arm down to his son, who was curled up in the fetal position.<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Dad,\" Jack said sarcastically, working his way out of his cramped quarters. The three women waddled to the house and Amanda turned around, rubbing her belly slowly.<br>\r\n\"I was already working on a big dinner when the...hospital event happened, so I'll get through that soon. Maybe half an hour?\" As she turned, she bumped her belly into Jack. \"Whoops, sorry baby. Keep Faye and your boss company, will you?\"<br>\r\n\"How did you know she was my-\"<br>\r\n\"We talked a little,\" Amanda smiled, walking into the kitchen. Jack turned bright red as he walked over to the couch. His mother's words were far too cryptic for him. What sorts of things did she talk about with Amber? What sorts of things <b>could</b> she have talked about with Amber?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sat down on the couch, Faye and Amber both sat down at his sides with a big OOMF and each turned to him inquisitively.<br>\r\n\"So,\" Amber said with a light, teasing scowl. \"Keep us company.\"</span></div></div>",

Your surronded by your pregnant boss  - - or former boss, your pregnant next-door neighbor who tried to seduce you to break up your relationship with your friend whose a girl but not your girlfriend in order to stop you from stopping the evil machinations of a coin that causes pregnancy in people... It's not time to panic... yet</i> Jack thought to himself, staring at Amber and Faye who were staring at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis palms were sweaty, his eyesight blurry. If this wasn't a time to panic, when was? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Jack...\" Amber said, finding a more comfortable position on the couch, but her pregnant state making that a bit harder than usual. <br>\r\n\"Let's talk about..us\" Amber said raising an eyebrow. <br>\r\n\"uS?\" Jack said, inflecting his voice incorrectly, coming out as a squeak. <br>\r\n\"Look, maybe I overreacted.\" Amber said, putting her hands on top of her pregnant belly. \"It's just, ever since I got pregnant\" That particular phrase Amber said causing Faye to shoot a million fiery daggers of hate and death at the poor pregnant store manager \"I've been lonely you know? This - - \" Amber said rubbing her stomach. \"Was really not what I had planned for my life right now you know? And when I started getting bigger, nobody wanted me anymore. And then you started working with me over the summer, and as I got bigger, I started noticing.. the looks you gave me.\" Amber continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I have to give this coin credit for one thing. It certainly doesn't take changing reality lightly</i> Jack thought to himself, slightly bemused by how people seemed to be accepting of this new reality that didn't exist days ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-uh-gave you looks?\" Jack said, squirming in his seat. He always wondered how people perceived their new reality, and this was a face-against-the-glass look at Amber's perceived world. \"It was more undressing-me-with-your-eyes than anything else, but I'm not going to lie: I was kind of flattered you found my... condition so sexy. Maybe I took harmless flirting as.. something more. The point is Jack... I'm sorry. You're not fired. Hell, I don't even have the power to fire people over that. I mean, could you imagine the lawsuit you could have filled?\" Amber said, lightly walking the fingers over the vast expanse of her belly, bemusing herself as she apologized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not fired?\" Jack was thoroughly confused. Not because he couldn't understand what was happening, but because it was taking one hundred percent of his brain and will power to just stare at the sexy maternal goddesses in front of him.  \"Why would I fire my best employee? I just.. over-reacted. I - - I have alot of my mind\" Amber started to say before being interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a lot in your belly\" Faye snidely remarked, an evil (though not being controlled by the coin evil) smirk on her face. Jack shifted in his seat again. <br>\r\n<i>This is hell. I've died and gone to hell. Forced to set in this awkward conversation forever</i> he thought to himself, his eyes glancing over to the clock, watching the seconds take eons to pass by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Faye, I'm sorry for what has happened. I didn't know he was married. I was lonely, he was an attractive older man buying me drinks, one thing lead to another and - - - \" Amber patted her belly. \"I'm not going to say I wouldn't do it again because well - - - \" Amber inhaled sharply. \"These are MY children. He may be your husband, but he's also the father of my children. And I want this to work out - - I... I never had any brothers or sisters..\" Amber said slowly \"So, I want my children to be surrounded by people who will love them, who will always be with them.. And I want your children.. Their half-brothers and half-sisters to be there. I mean, in some weird way.. We're kind of family\" Amber said, trying to create some peace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBZZZT. BZZZT. <br>\r\nJack pulled out his phone, and saw a text from Jessica. <br>\r\n<i>Just broke the news. Parents are.... my parents. Come over.. I need you.</i> <br>\r\n\"Thank You Jessica\" Jack said to himself under his breath. <br>\r\nBZZZZT. BZZZT.<br>\r\n<i>And in case you needed any motivation.... :)</i> Was all the message said. <br>\r\nSecond later, Jack Dale Jr received an image that drove him wild. <br>\r\nIt was Jessica, in her bra-and-panties standing in front of her mirror, a come-hither smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something more interesting to you Jack?\" Faye said, slightly annoyed at being ignored. <br>\r\n\"Uh yeah.. Big uh trouble at the store! Huge trouble. Oh my god the humanity!\" Jack said, getting up.<br>\r\n\"I didn't hear anything\" Amber said, pulling out her phone. <br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, superhuge trouble, Don't Tell Amber, is the subject line, need me down there right now, matter of life and death, sorryigottagobye\" Jack said, grabbing his wallet and keys, and heading out before his super-obvious lie super-exploded in his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not a very good liar is he?\" Faye asked Amber. <br>\r\n\"No. No, he's not.\" Amber smiled watching him leave. <br>\r\n\"Now, about us - - - \" Faye turned to Amber <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Amber was still gazing at the front door while Faye smirked at her. \"Now, about us,\" Faye said, moving her arms across the back of the couch. Amber turned back to the wife of her babies' father with a nervous but composed look.<br>\r\n\"Well, you heard me out. I want my children to grow up in as healthy a circumstance as they can...I think they deserve that much.\"<br>\r\nFaye chuckled and looked off to the side. \"What they deserve...what I think I deserve to have my home to myself after waiting so long to get pregnant.\" She ran her hands across her belly in large circles.<br>\r\nAmber paused. \"If I can ask...what's it like to carry four?\"<br>\r\nFaye turned back to Amber curiously. \"Well, I don't exactly have something to compare it to, but it's wonderful.\" Faye wrapped both hands around her belly. \"I love being so full with my children. <u>My</u> children.\"<br>\r\nAmber took offense to her emphasis and put her hands on her own belly. \"Are you saying these aren't my children?\"<br>\r\nThe coin was loving this confrontation and decided to get greedy, giving some of its chaotic, evil influence to Faye. \"No, they're my husband's mistakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber stood up furious when Amanda walked into the living room. \"Alright, dinner's rea...where's Jack?\"<br>\r\n\"He said he had to run off to work,\" Faye said, still making eye contact with Amber. \"Some big emergency.\"<br>\r\nAmanda sighed. <i>He probably just lied to get out of talking to them...</i> \"Oh well. Dinner's ready, so you can come in. Amber, I'm not sure about you, but Faye, as a fellow quad momma, I know you're hungry enough to have about two whole dinners.\"<br>\r\nFaye laughed softly and pushed herself up slowly, sticking one arm under her belly for support. \"You know me so well, Amanda.\" Amanda waddled over and tried to help her neighbor up, but their bellies just ended up pushing against one another. Amber stifled her laughter and waddled into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting at the dinner table was no smaller struggle, but when everyone finally got down, Jack Sr. helped pass around the various dishes, which Amanda, Amber, and Faye gladly scooped onto their plates. \"Where's Jack?\" his father asked.<br>\r\n\"He had to run to work,\" Amanda said. <br>\r\n<i>Smart kid</i>, Jack Sr. sighed. <i>I wonder what I could fake to get out of this...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Amber,\" Amanda smiled at her son's boss after about 15 minutes of awkward, silent eating (and plenty of it), \"I don't know much about you. Tell me a little about yourself.\"<br>\r\nAmber took a long sip of water. \"Well, I work at the same store that your son works at, of course, but I also use it to fix and build all kinds of things: computers, smart phones, cameras. I'm finishing up a graduate program in computer sciences.\"<br>\r\n\"That's pretty interesting,\" Jack Sr. said. \"Where are you planning on working with the master's degree?\"<br>\r\n\"There's a federal program that's working on ways to make more efficient processors that use less precious metals,\" Amber said, grinning slightly at Jack Sr. He really did look like his son. \"I've interviewed with them a few time and I've been asked back again, so I'll probably work there.\"<br>\r\n\"Wow, very impressive,\" Amanda smiled. \"Although, balancing work and kids is even harder than it sounds.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about that,\" Faye said, taking a big spoonful of rice and salsa verde. \"Apparently, I'll be the one raising her kids in my big, mixed-up house.\"<br>\r\nBy now, Amanda knew the scenario they were dealing with pretty well. \"Faye, have you and Amber really talked about this? Do you understand where she's coming from?\"<br>\r\nFaye grinned evily. \"Oh yes, she made her little plea. But, bizarrely, I'm still not thrilled about sharing a house with my husband's mistress and her kids.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not your husband's 'mistress,'\" Amber said. \"It was one time, it was a mistake, and I didn't know he was married! You should be angry with him.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, he's being punished,\" Faye smiled. \"And you're right, you didn't know he was my husband. But then you insisted that you come and live in our house or you would press legal action. You destroyed my family.\"<br>\r\nAmber was starting to shake. \"I had to do what was best for my children. Can't you understand?\" Amber put her hands on her belly. \"We're both going through the same thing, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a burst of maternal energy, Faye stood up, hitting and shaking the table with her enormous belly. \"You have no idea what I'm going through! I thought I would never be able to have children and I've thought all my life that I could never be pregnant! And now that I am, everything is falling apart around me! You had a one-night-stand and got twins out of it! Don't you ever dare compare your life to mine you little WHORE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faye!\" Amanda yelled, shocked, at her neighbor. Amber sat at the table, trembling, before standing up and waddling to the bathroom.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me,\" she mumbled. Amanda got up and took Faye by the arm, walking the two of them into the living room. Jack Sr. sat at the table, a vacant expression on his face.<br>\r\n<i>I should probably keep drinking wine until this gets better</i>, he thought to himself, walking into the kitchen to pour himself another glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the bathroom, Amber sat down on the toilet, still shaking, and proceeded to tearfully scream behind clenched teeth and punch the wall. \"That fucking bitch! That fucking bitch!\" she said with each punch. Her twins started to roll around inside her womb. Amber wrapped her arms around her belly and continued to sob. \"It's okay, dears, it'll all be okay.\" As Amber lifted her head and sniffled, she noticed a moving shadow and a long, slender leg move behind the shower curtain. The bathroom window was ajar and Amber's mind went to one thing: A big weird bug. Cautiously, she moved to face the shower and could hear the buglike movement. She tried to figure out where the creature was and then...she punched from behind the curtain at the bug, hoping to squish it without actually touching it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, she hit something very hard and sturdy, followed by a loud *thud* on the shower floor. Amber opened the curtain and saw one of P.E.A.R.'s Spyder cameras on the ground, one of the legs twisted out of place while the rest slowly floundered. \"What is this?\" Amber said to herself, picking it up. The cover had come a little loose so she could open it up and look inside. \"It looks like some kind of...remote camera, but inside of a mobile unit...so I should be able to disconnect it like this-\" Amber flipped a switch and a red light inside turned off. \"Interesting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the living room, Amanda was having a very hushed but intense conversation with Faye. \"Now look: I brought you both here to try and figure this out. You're my friend but that doesn't mean you can be this rude to that poor girl. Imagine if the future of your children was up in the air.\" Amanda put her hand on Faye's belly to emphasis her last point.<br>\r\nAt Amanda's words, Faye remembered what the coin had shown her in her dreams: Jack Jr. and his girlfriend taking away her pregnant belly. Maybe cooperating here could help her get another shot at stopping that duo...and maybe get another shot at Jack Jr. himself.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Amanda,\" Faye said, reaching in for an awkward, belly-filled hug. \"It's just a strange time for me. I'll do it your way.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, that's good to hear,\" Amanda said as Amber walked back in from the bathroom, the Spyder hidden behind her. She clandestinely put it into her purse as she returned to the kitchen table.<br>\r\n\"Oh, we're still doing this?\" Jack Sr. asked as all of the pregnant women slowly took their seats.<br>\r\n\"Yes, and it's going to be more productive this time,\" Amanda said with a big smile. Faye and Amber were now smiling too, but for very different reasons.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack felt like he was walking on air. For the first time in a long time, everything felt right, instead of, well you know, being trapped in a rapidly spiraling out of control nightmare of pregnancy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat all came crashing down moments later, when he was suddenly surrounded at a checkpoint not far from his house. <br>\r\n\"Blue Card - - - Now.\" The faceless goon behind the gas mask told him in a dry tone. Another two gas-masked goons stood by the side, ready for whatever may happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh.. This wasn't here that long ago. When did this pop up?\" Jack asked the gas-masked goon #1. <br>\r\n\"We're very efficient in our job. This is for your own safety and the safety of others until we can determine the source of the pregnancy epidemic. Blue Card now.\" The gas-masked goon said. <br>\r\n\"Are there going to be a lot of these around the time? It's going to make getting from Point A to Point B a bit of a hassle\" Jack said. <br>\r\n\"It's why you should carry your Blue Card on you at all times. Now - - Blue Card please. We don't want to hold up traffic. This should be a quick and painless process\" The gas masked goon said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack reached into his wallet and pulled out his Blue Card and handed it over to the guard. The guard scanned the card with a scanner and handed it back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd advise you to keep that close. We have more checkpoints around the town. We apologize for the inconvenience.\" The gas masked goon said as he waved Jack through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack drove on to his goal, his dream, his Jessica... Only to be stopped by another checkpoint just a few moments later, and a third checkpoint some time after that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Jack almost 45 minutes to what was usually a 20 minute drive to Jessica's because apparently there were gas-masked goons everywhere, checking for Blue Cards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter passing through however many checkpoints it was, (Jack was spacing out after about the 6th one), Jack finally pulled up outside Jessica's house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile on his face and some pep in his step, Jack made his way to the door. He straightened himself up, breathing into his hand and smelling it, pretty sure that his breath smelled okay. Running his hand through his hair to make sure it was perfect, he nodded to himself. He was ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to knock on the front door, his balled up fist just inches away for the solid red door when - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBZZZT. BZZZT. BZZZT. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching into his pocket, Jack pulled out his cellphone to see a new text from Jessica. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Don't go through the front door you dork. There's a ladder out back. Climb up to my window&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you have got to be kidding me\" Jack said to himself under his breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe makes his way to the back of the house and, as Jessica had foretold in her text, was a ladder by the side of the house, and her window wide open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on up!\" Jessica shouted down to him in a loud whisper. <br>\r\n\"Seriously? The window again?\" Jack shouted back in a whisper, putting his hands out for emphasis. <br>\r\n\"Just get up here!\" Jessica said, sticking her head back into her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack hesitates for a moment, before putting the ladder against the side of the house and placing one foot on the bottom rung. Before taking that vital next step, Jack looks around before spotting some roses growing by the side of the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching in carefully, he pulls out a small collection of roses, and climbs up the ladder, his love waiting at the top. Moments later, he's eye to eye with Jessica, her twin-filled belly testing the limits of her bathrobe, which hugged every delicate maternal curve of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery brain-cell in Jack's head exploded all at once, nearly leaving him a babbling pile of goo.... metaphorically speaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile forme on Jessica's face as she waddled over to Jack and gave him a light peck on the check, her bathrobed belly rubbing every so slightly against Jack's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for coming\" Jessica said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack tried to speak, but got at most, a \"C\" for effort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flowers, Jessica, Pretty\" Jack stammered as he held up the roses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica took one look at the flowers... and frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, did you tear up my mother's prized roses in a lame attempt to woo me?\" Jessica crossed her arms across her chest, assuming an almost \"Don't you dare\" stance, her motherly instincts kicking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I lie and so no will you be angry?\" Jack's said, his brain restarting. <br>\r\n\"Yes\" Jessica replied. <br>\r\n\"And if I did ruin some roses to get this for you, would you be pissed?\" Jack asked, already knowing the answer. <br>\r\n\"Yes, but less so because it was the a sweet gesture.\" The smile returned to Jessica's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack panicked, thinking about his next course of action, but nothing was coming to mind. <br>\r\n\"Relax you big dork. I'm having fun with you.\" Jessica said, waddling over to the bed, one hand in the small of her arching back, the other resting on top of her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down on the bed, and the bedspring groaned in protest. Jessica heard the shrikes of bedspring pain, and frowned.<br>\r\n\"I've had this bed forever... and it's never done that to me before\" Jack could see tears welling up in the corner of her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey, hey. It's not a big deal\" Jack said, trying to comfort her from the bed's insult. <br>\r\n\"IT IS A BIG DEAL! I'M SO FAT! NONE OF MY CLOTHES FIT, I'M STARTING TO LOSE SIGHT OF MY FEET. I'M HUNGRY AT THE TIME. I'M REALLY EMOTIONAL RIGHT NOW!\" Jessica said, pregnancy hormones taking control of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack sat next to her on the bed, his body leaning towards Jessica due to her gravitational pull, wrapping an arm around her. <br>\r\n\"You're beautiful Jessica. You're amazing, and pretty.. and sexy\" Jack said, no lying either. He wanted her so bad, his body ached. <br>\r\nJessica laughed and wiped tears away from her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look lover boy, just because I'm in my bathrobe, doesn't mean your getting lucky just yet. You want access to Jessicaland, you have to pay admittance.\" Jessica said. \"A date, a proper one. I know our last date was a not-date date, but I want a proper date. Dinner, movie, shopping. You gotta show me a good time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack gulped the gulpiest gulp he ever gulped. \"Are you- - - are you sure?\" Jack asked. <br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Jessica said, standing up from her bed, albit slowly and awkwardly. <br>\r\n'Okay, dinner and a movie I get. But why the mall?\" Jack asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm out of clothes that fit. So, you're buying me some. Don't worry, I'll make sure their skimpy. I know how much you like..\" Jessica said, her hand going to her belly, as she started undoing the sash on her bathrobe, teasing him, making him yearn. <br>\r\n\"But, that's later. First, I want you help me pick out what i'm going to wear.\" Jessica said, walking over to her closet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got in narrowed to either the red dress or the blue dress. Either way, I'm going to look ridiculous in it, but I want to look pretty.\" Jessica said holding the red dress or the blue dress against her pregnant frame. <br>\r\n\"Wait, really?\" Jack asked. <br>\r\n\"Look, I want this date date to be a real.. date I guess. Dinner, movie. Looking nice, beside.. I want to see if I can still fit into one of these things\" Jessica said, holding up one of the dresses.<br>\r\n\"Red\" Jack said. <br>\r\n\"Good choice.\" Jessica said, throwing the red dress on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica\" Jack said with great pause. <br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Jessica asked, going through her clothes. <br>\r\n\"Why are we doing this?\" Jack asked. <br>\r\n\"Because we have strong feelings for each other and - - \" <br>\r\n\"No. Why am I taking you shopping? We aren't we getting the book! WHY ARE WE REVERSING ALL THIS!\" Jack said, his voice getting loud, his breathes deep. <br>\r\n\"Calm down sunshine. I got off the phone with Mariah. I'm pretty sure she has this all figured out.\" Jessica said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack felt a weight lift off his shoulders. \"Really\" He hoped for the first time in these past few days. <br>\r\n\"Yeah. She has an idea. Says she wants to think it over, but once we get that book back tomorrow night, I'm almost sure that we can figure out a way to undo...\" Jessica said, tapping her belly for emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But until then.. I'm going to enjoy this\" Jessica said, placing her hand on her belly. \"Ooh, Well, maybe I'd enjoy it more if these two stopped moving around so much. Want to feel?\" Jessica ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was over a in a split section, Jessica guiding his hand to the spot where her children were most active. Moments later, a strong firm THUMP made Jessica smile and Jack's eyes light up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\" was all Jack could say. He was enjoying this belly feeling MUCH MORE than the one with his mom. Jessica, caught up in the moment, gave Jack a deep passionate kiss. It was a fine kiss, a mighty kiss, a kiss that could have moved mountains, and rained down thunder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so there they stood, Jack and Jessica locked in momentary eternal bliss, sharing this one special moment between the two of them. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack walked over to the window and prepared to climb down the ladder. \"Jack, wait,\" Jessica said, pointing to her belly. \"Do you really think I'm going to be able to get down that ladder?\"<br>\r\nShe made a good point. \"So, then how are we getting out?\"<br>\r\n\"Front door, silly,\" Jessica said. \"We'll be able to sneak out, trust me. My parents are...\" Jessica's voice trailed off and she looked sadly into the distance. \"They didn't take the news well.\" Jessica placed her hands on her belly and rubbed gently.<br>\r\n\"Don't they know about the 'pregnancy disease' or whatever people are calling it?\" Jack said, making air quotes around \"pregnancy disease.\" He and Jessica both knew what was really going on.<br>\r\nJessica nodded. \"But they don't believe me. They've never been particularly trusting of me.\" Jessica sighed and looked up at Jack. \"I actually had a bit of a...a pregnancy scare in college. They nearly cut off my tuition.\" Jack's heart started to sink. While he was just concerned about Jessica taking him back after he kissed Faye in front of her, she was being chewed out at home. He was a selfish jerk.<br>\r\n\"Well...we'll fix this, don't worry,\" Jack said, rubbing her arm. \"But for now, let's go have that date. I'm guessing you don't want laser tag this time?\"<br>\r\nJessica chuckled. \"I'm a little big to be a target, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica and Jack both snuck downstairs. Well, Jack did. Jessica made creaks on the stairs coming down and bumped into a few loose tables walking down the hall. She'd only had her belly this size for a about 19 hours, after all. Jessica didn't seem too concerned with the noise, however. <br>\r\n\"Jess,\" Jack whispered. \"Won't your parents hear?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but they already know I'm in the house,\" she winked at Jack. \"But they won't be paying attention to any noise you make now.\" Quickly, the two of them moved past the open kitchen door. Jack could just take a quick peek inside and saw a middle aged man and woman sitting at the table and the woman was sobbing. Jack felt an awful pit in his stomach again. <i>I've definitely got to fix this</i>, he thought. <i>This coin's hurt too many people</i>.<br>\r\nWhen they got to Jack's car, he leaned over and gave Jessica a kiss on the cheek. She beamed back at him. \"That was a nice touch to start the date off. What got into you?\"<br>\r\n\"Nothing, I just like you,\" Jack smiled, turning the car on and driving to the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was later in the day so the mall wasn't as crowded as usual. Even with the mass pregnancies, Jessica got plenty of looks from people, even from other pregnant women and men. \"It's probably the dress,\" Jessica giggled, rubbing the bright red fabric draped over her wide belly.<br>\r\n\"Or maybe you're just that beautiful,\" Jack smiled. Jessica snorted and elbowed him.<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" she said, running her hands through her hair. \"But you're not getting lucky before the date's over, okay?\"<br>\r\nJack laughed nervously. \"Yeah, yeah.\" Jessica smiled and bit her lip, reaching over and holding Jack's hand. They both blushed as Jack closed his hand around hers. \"I, um...never really been on a date like this before,\" Jack mumbled.<br>\r\n\"Me either,\" Jessica said in the same, quiet voice. She leaned over and pecked Jack on the cheek. \"Now, let's go find some clothes I can actually wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of Jack and Jessica's view was a woman who's pregnant belly looked big enough to fit both of them in it. Commander Zavaleta was marching around the mall, taking long, deep breaths and trying not to look too winded or tired. While most of the pregnant residents of the city (about 25% of the population now) were stuck on waddling, Zavaleta was an expertly trained woman and could manage to walk sternly, even with the biggest pregnant belly in the entire city. And in this city, that was saying something. Letting out a low sigh, Zavaleta rubbed her belly and looked around the mall. \"I can feel it here...somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the coin's magic and given Zavaleta some of the worst aspects of pregnancy as retaliation against her, it might have exposed her to its magic a little too much. She could sense the coin's magic now and knew it was somewhere in the mall. But where exactly, she couldn't tell. Zavaleta continued to march around the mall, going up to different people and seeing if the chaotic energy was coming from any of them. Of course, a woman as large as Zavaleta would normally draw too much attention to herself, but her military training let her sneak into people's blind spots. Darting around the mall, all she did was work up an even larger appetite. Eventually, she sat down on the lip of the mall's fountain to collect her thoughts and her breath. Zavaleta let out a low moan, rubbing her hands over her belly and inspecting her massively increased bust. All she had was military outfits that, while still durable enough to withstand her mammoth proportions, were still constricting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I shouldn't need them for too much longer,\" Zavaleta remarked with a sarcastic laugh. \"It looks like I'll be giving birth any day now.\" The young inside her started kicking and fidgeting, eliciting a little groan from the older military woman. \"And it feels like you're all ready to get out too. Well, I'm excited for that too.\" Zavaleta started rubbing her belly more as a man with an obvious pregnant belly walked over to her with a clipboard.<br>\r\n\"Hello ma'am,\" he said in a nervous voice. \"But, um, I don't know if you've heard about the pregnant bikini contest we're having in a few days and...forgive me for being blunt about it, but you would get us a lot of attention if you participated.\"<br>\r\nWith impressive quadricep strength, Zavaleta brought herself to an upright position and was staring the man in the face. \"What did you say to me? You'd dare ask me to dress in a bikini and parade around for your amusement?\"<br>\r\nOven's face flushed. This woman was looking at him with a cold ferocity. Over 50 years in the military would give that to a person. \"W-well, it's not just that. There's cash prizes and other rewards.\" He held out the clipboard with a trembling hand. \"H-here's a list of all the prizes. It's getting updated every day too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZavaleta scoffed and ran her eyes over the clipboard. Not too many people had signed up today, which wasn't helping Oven's mental state. He'd just learned he was a pregnant man a few hours ago and he wasn't getting any more registrations. Aside from a few notable exceptions, Sandwich was crushing him in this regard. He also felt a little envious of all these women who were pregnant and qualified for the prizes. He was pregnant too! He needed money to raise a baby! As Zavaleta was about to look back at the odd man in front of her and subtly inform him that she'd killed before, something caught her eye. *ANTIQUE COIN: VALUE UNKNOWN*<br>\r\n\"That's it,\" she mused, a smile spreading across her red lips. \"You can't hide from Nicole Zavaleta.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the maternity clothing store, Jack was walking around with Jessica who was oohing and aahing at all of the different options. \"I'd always thought maternity clothes were mostly ugly, but a lot of these are really cute!\"<br>\r\nThe owner, a young woman with short brown hair, nodded with a smile. Everyone laughed at her and her business partners when they said they wanted to open a cutting edge maternity fashion store, but now business was booming. Mmph. Another kick in her side. It was booming just in time for her to be able to wear some of the clothes herself without worrying about how it would affect the inventory. She only remembered being pregnant thanks to Ian's coin flip falling on heads, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this music, though?\" Jack asked, looking up for the speakers. It was gothic metal music, although turned down enough that it didn't feel totally innapropriate in the store.<br>\r\n\"Mommy Kills Best,\" the owner said. \"It's a local metal band of all pregnant women. They're getting pretty popular and they're playing at the pregnant bikini contest this week. By the way,\" she said with a smile, turning to Jessica. \"You're very pretty, miss. You should enter!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, I already am,\" Jessica giggled. \"That reminds me, I need to try on a pregnant bikini here that'll fit better.\"<br>\r\n\"My advice? Go with a regular bikini. Shows off more of the maternal body,\" the owner winked, going back to her work at the front. Jack blushed at the thought of Jessica parading in a bikini...pregnant. And in a few days, she'd be even bigger than she is now...<br>\r\n\"Okay, snap out of it, lover boy,\" Jessica laughed, nudging him. \"Help me try on some of these clothes.\" She took his hand and waddled into a changing stall.<br>\r\n\"W-with you?\" Jack asked. Jessica grinned and nodded.<br>\r\n\"A little reward for being so good so far. Don't make me take it back,\" she chuckled, giving him a peck on the lips as she closed the stall door behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The pregnant owner flashed smiles at both of them as they waited. <br>\r\n\"How much longer until your little one comes out?\" the owner asked.<br>\r\nJessica and Jack looked at each other, unsure of how to answer, given the coin's magic. \"Six months,\" Jessica said, trying to remember the last thing she'd heard from her doctor and trying to factor in the month-a-day growth the coin was giving him. She noticed the owner's eyes bug out a little at Jessica's response, her eyes immediately going to Jessica's belly. \"It's twins, so it's a little on the big side,\" Jessica chuckled, patting her belly.<br>\r\n\"Wow, twins,\" the owner mused. \"I can hardly contain myself just carrying one. Oouf, although with these kicks, it feels like there's a whole litter in there.\"<br>\r\nJack smiled and nodded politely. It was hard not to think of his own mother at the mention of a whole litter. How must it feel for her when his baby brothers and sisters kicked in her belly?<br>\r\n\"Although, with all the pregnancies in the city lately, it seems like multiple pregnancies are more common. I'm in the minority with just my little girl in here,\" the owner said, looking down at her own midsection. \"All the girls in Mommy Kills Best have twins, except for the lucky lead singer with triplets.\"<br>\r\nJack felt his face getting hot at all of this pregnancy talk. Jessica noticed and smiled, holding his hand and rubbing it with her thumb a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack bought Jessica's new clothes and the two headed out the door. \"Thanks for that,\" Jessica said with a little peck on his cheek. \"Buying me things, just like a real boyfriend on a real date.\"<br>\r\n\"I thought that's what this was supposed to be,\" Jack chuckled.<br>\r\n\"Oh, it is. I'm just impressed you're getting it so right so far,\" Jessica smiled, rubbing her belly with one hand. \"So far. Now, movie time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Nicole Zavaleta---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You. Tell me more about this coin,\" Zavaleta said, taking Oven by the collar and pointing to his clipboard.<br>\r\nOven cleared his throat and looked where Zavaleta was pointing - right where it said \"antique coin.\" \"I-I don't know too much about that,\" Oven stammered. \"It was given to us by a local bank branch and one of the other organizers is the one who's actually bringing it in.\"<br>\r\nZavaleta adjusted her hand to place one thumb gingerly against Oven's adam's apple. \"Who? Give me a name.\"<br>\r\n\"L-Lisa Smith, one of the hosts with me and Sandwich.\"<br>\r\n\"Sandwich?\"<br>\r\n\"It's just our DJ names. I-I can't remember his real name off the top of my head!\" Oven wanted to add that it was because he was paralyzed with fear but he decided to leave that out for now. He felt a fluttering in his stomach. Great. It picked <b>now</b> to start kicking!<br>\r\nZavaleta thought it over. Now that she had a name, she could try and track down this woman and get the coin from her...somehow, it had gotten from her office in the hospital to this Smith woman. Then, Zavaleta let out another foreign curse. Smith. It would take a bit longer to find this specific woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to sign up for the contest?\" Oven finally squeaked out.<br>\r\n\"No!\" Zavaleta boomed, releasing him immediately and turning around to think. In the process, her colossal belly smacked against his thigh, causing him to jump back another few feet. \"No...it's better to remain in the shadows. Seems even at this age, I'm still doing covert work...my blood is restless with excitement!\" She rubbed her hands together gleefully. As a young soldier, she'd trekked through mountains and forests just to get to a target or to intercept a message. She hadn't gotten to do it for decades!<br>\r\n\"Well...will you at least show up? You'd draw a lot of media buzz to the event,\" Oven said, his business-sense annoyingly fighting with his better judgement to leave the terrifying, colossally pregnant woman alone.<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'll be there,\" Zavaleta smiled sinisterly. \"But I won't bring any attention with me...you won't even know I'm there.\"<br>\r\nAs she cackled quietly to herself, Oven's eyes moved to her belly. <i>Somehow, I think someone will know you're there</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---P.E.A.R. Field HQ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLieutenant Riker was watching the screen intensely, tapping his earpiece furiously. \"Damn, I can't pick up any audio from this range.\"<br>\r\n\"Lieutenant, if we could just move the Spyder closer, we could-\"<br>\r\n\"No!\" Riker barked, turning around to face the minor P.E.A.R. agent who was working the console beside him. \"If we get any closer, Commander Zavaleta will notice it. The old hag's got incredible senses.\"<br>\r\n\"Old hag?\" one of the other agents said. \"I keep hearing that's she's in her 60s, but she looks pretty fit to me.\"<br>\r\nRiker was steaming. \"Out. Everyone out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room emptied in a flash and Rike stood up, pacing the room and looking at the multitude of screens before him. \"It's just a race between the two of us now. But while you're carrying around that preposterous, fat swell of brats, I've got cameras and microphones all over the city.\" Riker's face turned up in to a smile. \"I will come out on top and <b>I</b> will be the rightful head of P.E.A.R...and using the coin's magic, more than that is not impossible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning his attention back to the screens, Riker flipped between scene after scene of pregnant men and women consoling family and friends, or embracing their pregnant body, or the occasional house with two barren occupants. Flipping from channel to channel, he only found one with static. \"Hmm...\" Riker said, stroking his chin and looking at the coordinates. \"Looks like a suburban house, nothing that would mess with the signal. Oh well. There's over 100 of these things crawling around. At least one's got to run into trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...find the other coins and bring them together. Then-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiker stopped and flipped the biggest display away from Zavaleta at the mall and to the conversation he's just picked up on. It was in some sort of warehouse. A group of four people were listening to one pregnant girl who looked like she was in her mid-20s, approximately.<br>\r\n\"You got that from the book?\" one of the four, a pregnant, busty redhead, asked.<br>\r\nThe one girl nodded. \"That's the conclusion I drew from what I read. When all of them are together, it...weakens it somehow and we can probably exert some sort of control.\" The girl cocked her head a little. \"Well, Jack specifically.\"<br>\r\nOne of the four, a huge, muscly guy who didn't look pregnant, laughed and shook his head. \"We've looked over that book for years and didn't get that far. You must be some sort of genius or you're full of shit.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, this is the only lead we have, Mr. Ox,\" another of the four, a pregnant, dark skinned woman, said. \"So, Mariah, what else do you have for us?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, Jack's got one of them and we have a lead on the other one, plus the book,\" the girl, who Riker now knew was Mariah, said. \"The third...we still don't know yet. But there's definitely three.\"<br>\r\nThe four nodded along. \"Thank you for letting us know,\" the dark skinned woman said. \"We'll keep looking ourselves. In the meantime, get the book and the coin. If we can at least hang onto them, we'll be able to prevent more...of this.\" She patted her belly and the redhead and Mariah rubbed theirs solemnly. \"Why couldn't Jack be here? Or that girl he's always with? They're an important part of this too.\"<br>\r\nMariah blushed. \"Oh...well...they're...together.\"<br>\r\nMr. Ox and the other man chuckled and the redhead rolled her eyes. \"He didn't look like he had it in him,\" she remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Jack and Jessica---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, Jack, not now,\" Jessica giggled as Jack kissed a trail up her arm to her neck in the mall's theatre. <br>\r\n\"It's just the previews,\" Jack whispered, nibbling on Jessica's earlobe. Today, something was really overcoming him with incredible passion and libido. <br>\r\n\"Well, I want to watch them,\" Jessica smiled, giving him a quick kiss back and settling back into her seat, running her hands over her belly. Jack grumbled and sat still in his seat, looking at previews for the next romcom coming the following year. After a few moments of unrest, Jessica and Jack passed each other quick glances, Jessica's grin widening each time. Finally, she reached her left hand over and took Jack's right, resting it on her belly with her hand overtop of his.<br>\r\n\"Will this get you through the movie?\" Jessica smiled at him. Jack blushed and nodded, spreading his hand out and rubbing her wide womb gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>- - - Jack and Jessica - - - <br>\r\nJack and Jessica were locked in a perfect moment in time. Jack's hand resting on the maternal expanse that was Jessica's belly, Jessica's head resting softly on Jack's shoulder, a cheesy date movie playing. Despite all that was happening around them, the chaos and pregnancies, this was their perfect moment in time, and they had not a care in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was good, because nothing really interesting happened while they watched their movie... But on the other hand..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - Ian - - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan was a special kind of idiot. Somehow, he ended up trapped in a pregnancy nightmare, surrounded by dozens of pregnant women.. and men apparently. Ian however, was not the special kind of idiot to understand that what was happening around him, espically to the men, <b>WAS. NOT. NORMAL</b> So as he sat, alone in his apartment, watching the national news, the town he lived in making headlines as the pregnancies new spread, he wondered how it all happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's probably something the government is behind. They put shit in our drinking water all the time. I wonder if this some kind of crazy covert experiment gone haywire</i> Ian thought as a doctor on the news explained how a man could possibly carry a child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should leave before something to me!\" Ian said, his sense of self-preservation kicking into high-gear. He wasn't the first in his apartment block to try to leave. An older man who lived down the hall tried to leave earlier in the night, saying \"I'm not getting knocked up\" as he packed his car and tried to get past the roadblocks leading out of town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better leave this up to fate\" Ian said to himself. \"Heads, I stay. Tails, I stay\" He said, reaching into his pocket, searching for Jack's coin he gave him.. only to find nothing. \"Oh damn that's right. I gave it to the bank! It's a prize in the damn bikini contest\" He scratched his chin, deep in though, which turned out was actually quite shallow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat bikini contest, pregnant bellies on display. It was something that weirded that out... Not because he was disgusted by it.. No, seeing some of those women.. in those bikinis.. With their breasts.. and their bellies.. It made Ian...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop thinking like that. Come on man. Don't be weird\" Ian said to himself, turning his attention back to the TV, which wasn't helping him get his mind of the whole \"pregnancy\" thing, as footage of the numerous pregnant women in the town rolled by, followed by a few images of pregnant men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBZZT. BZZT. Ian's phone went off, and Ian gulped deeply as he saw who it was from: His boss Ryan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMEETING TOMORROW. 9AM BRIGHT AND EARLY. BE THERE OR BE FIRED. - Ryan (and sons) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan was curious as to why Ryan signed his text message \"and sons\" but whatever, he gave him his paycheck every two week, he could do whatever the hell he wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well shit, I wonder what this is going to be about\" Ian thought as he fired up his game-console. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - Amanda - - - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn terms of disasters, this was quickly approaching levels of \"biblical\", Amanda thought, sitting in her chair, her hands resting on her belly, her children kicking away inside of her. It seemed so promising, the hope that breaking bread between a pregnant wife and her husband's pregnant mistress might help them resolve their differences.. But after the third screaming match, the fifth use of Faye calling Amber a whore and <br>\r\nAmber calling Faye a word that rhymes with \"Punt\", Amanda just slowly ate her third piece of cheesecake in defeat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HE DIDN'T TELL ME HE WAS MARRIED! I WAS LONELY!\" Amber screamed across the table, nearly ready to throw the delicious pasta Amanda made directly into Faye's pregnant face. <br>\r\n\"SO YOU'VE HEARD OF A CONDOM?!\" Faye snapped back. <br>\r\n\"CONDOMS CAN FAIL! HOW DO YOU THINK I ENDED UP LIKE THIS? I JUST WENT TO A BAR AND SAID, BOY I HOPE SOME MARRIED MAN KNOCKS ME UP WITH TWINS TONIGHT!\" Amber screamed back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack Dale Sr had abandoned the peace talks long ago, slinking away to the den to do whatever it was he did in there. Amanda was hoping that it was drawing up plans to put everything when Amanda's order from the baby-store arrived tomorrow. Finishing her third slice of the cheesecake she bought, Amanda's hunger FINALLY felt sated as her unborn children inside of her seemed to finally calm down. Over 50 and pregnant, how did it come to this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, she knew HOW it happened (at least to the best of her knowledge, not knowing about the chaos being sewn by an ancient semi-sentiant semi-evil coin), but still this as a surprise to her. She was beyond happy, but she really wished her new bundles of joy came to her more than a few years ago instead of now when she was at the edge of her golden years. She ran her hand across the mountain that was her belly, and all of her troubles vanished for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBZZT. BZZT. Her cellphone went off, forcing her to get up from her semi-moment of happiness and waddle over to her purse, to retrieve the buzzing device. It was a text from her boss Ryan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHELLO AMANDA. HEARD THE GREAT NEWS AT THE OFFICE TODAY. CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU TOMORROW MORNING FOR THE MEETING. MAYBE YOU, ME, AND TARA CAN COMPARE BELLIES. 9AM, BUT IT'S OKAY IF YOU'RE A LITTLE LATE. I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO GET AROUND. - Ryan (And Sons). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda smiled. Her boss Ryan was pregnant as well, Amanda remembered the day he told everyone. Nobody really believe it until his middle became much more round, and even then.. If it wasn't for everything that happened the past few days, Amanda would have believed it was all apart of a very elaborate prank. After finding out she was pregnant with quads at her age, she didn't really question anything anymore, even if her male 50 year old boss was pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, maybe some work would get her mind of this pregnancy.. and how much bigger she was getting every day. It was weird, not right, and worried her so. She wanted to scream \"WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME!?\" But the last thing she needed right now was attracting more attention with all of these... government people in their city. She didn't want to end up on some kind of lab somewhere... again. Today was traumatic enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her attention back to the screaming match still taking place and sighed. Hopefully they would resolve their differences soon... hopefully BEFORE their children turned two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother series of kick made the material of Amanda's clothes strain. \"I know.. Their children are going to make interesting playmates hmm?\" Amanda said to her midsection under her breath. Who knows what tomorrow brings?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - Lisa Smith - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat alone in her small studio apartment, in nothing but her bra and panties, her hands wrapped around her very pregnant triplet filled belly. <br>\r\nShe was still trying to make sure it was real, even all that happened over the past few days. It was a still a blur to her. One moment she was in the bar, getting the stage set up for the pregnant bikini contest, and then she felt an incredible pressure in her midsection, like she was being inflated, and then POP! She was not only pregnant, but VERY PREGNANT with what turned out to be triplets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her sometime to fully accept what happened to her, the fear slowly giving away to worry intermixed with small moments of happiness. She worried about her looks, why shouldn't she? Her main purpose at the radio station was to be the sex symbol, the girl they can slap on billboards to drive up interest. Having three kids out of the blue wouldn't do her figures any favors. She worried about money. How could she afford a child, let alone three?! Cribs, diapers, toys, food, doctor's bills... She couldn't think about it. It made her panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when she felt them move, when she felt them kick, she smiled. Every care she had went away, these were HER CHILDREN. She never really thought of herself as Mom material, but that was then, this was now. She couldn't even think of giving them up. This was a piece of her that would be with her forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up with a groan, she walked over to the small bag of maternity clothes that she bought sometime after.. the incident. They weren't exactly conservative for a woman in her condition, but if you got it, flaunt it. Picking up the bikini that was.. unfortunate enough to have to wear all day, she looked at it. Hopefully it was \"Sexy\" enough for her to win, that money could go along way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Lisa, nothing to do know but make them want it. You certainly got some stares today at the hospital, let's see if we could do that again\" She said to herself, changing back into the bikini to practice again. Her routine was certainly.. provocative, but she's seen enough of these contests to know that's what the crowd wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strong firm kick from one of her children, made her put a hand on her bare belly. \"Hungry again? Jeez, at this rate, I think my figure will be the least of my worry. I'll be giving birth to some serious plus-sized kids\" She said, walking over to the half-eaten pizza box on the counter. She opened it up, and started eating the cold pizza. She had such a craving, and she wanted to give her children all they could possible want... to an extent. Pizza seemed fine for that right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at herself in the mirror, belly and tits hanging out of her too-small bikini, a piece of pizza in one hand, she laughed. \"Oh Lisa, look at you\" She said to herself, grabbing a nearby camera. \"Well, might as well get some pictures\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLICK. She captured her moment in time. </span></div></div>",

As soon as she caught her partner in her peripherals, Lisa turned around and covered her body with her arms as best she could. Of course, with a belly her size, there was plenty left in the open. \"Natalie! Geez!\"<br>\r\nNatalie covered her mouth to stifle her laughs. \"Aw, sorry, I didn't mean to embarrass you.\" She walked over and rubbed Lisa's arms from behind, the two of them looking in the mirror. \"You're really going forward with the bikini contest, huh?\"<br>\r\nLisa sighed and turned slightly to get another look at her hugely pregnant figure. \"Oh yeah. I can't exactly drop out. The station's expecting an even bigger turnout when people heard that 'Foxy Lisa' was going to be competing. Besides-\" Lisa said, turning her head to face Natalie, \"-someone's gotta win.\"<br>\r\nNatalie chuckled. \"Well, I know who my vote's going to.\" She leaned her chin forward and gave Lisa a long, soft kiss. \"Just based on looks, though. You can't dance worth shit.\"<br>\r\nLisa rolled her eyes and looked down at her belly. \"You hear that? Your other mom is the mean one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Kristen Harper---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Harper was not having the best day of her medical career. The metropolitan hospital where she worked was overrun with armed guards and other foreign personnel. All of them claimed to be from Health and Human Services but it was pretty clear to Dr. Harper that this was not the case. Well, about half of them had actual HHS and other similar clearances and positions. And that all made sense, to some degree. There was some sort of bizarre medical breakout in the city, for sure. Hundreds of people don't just report instantaneous pregnancy within days of one another, let alone men. But they were seizing the entire OB/GYN wing of the hospital and taking over plenty of other sections as well. The department head was still stuck in committees with these bureaucrats and no one was giving Dr. Harper any information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the other thing that was bothering her. It was not just ordinary government bureaucrats here. These armed guards seemed to be from a variety of different countries and none of them had any apparent training when it came to issues of medical sensitivity. As a doctor, Dr. Harper swore to protect her patients, and over the course of her career, she'd made a point to help all pregnant women she could. Well, with the way the situation had developed, she now had to expand that to all the pregnant people she could, but the point still stuck. As far as she could tell, these...goons were not helping her get any closer to the reason behind the pregnancies and were just getting in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOoph, speaking of getting in the way, Dr. Harper's belly made pushing past two guards a particularly tight fit. Thanks to an accident of her own, Dr. Harper had no basis to explain away the sudden pregnancies as misunderstandings. One second she was absolutely, positively not pregnant. And the next, she had over a foot of round, baby-filled belly in front of her. She might call it a happy accident. Dr. Harper already had a son of her own and her husband passed away about ten years ago. This pregnancy was a miracle for her and not one she wanted to give up. Pushing her miracle belly past another array of guards, she held up her hospital badge to one officer standing in front of the conference room's doors. \"Dr. Harper, here for my scheduled meeting.\" With a nod, the doors were opened up and in she went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was mostly empty. It was just Dr. Harper, the head of OB/GYN, and about five other \"HHS\" officials, although Dr. Harper doubted very much whether they were all truly with that department. \"Alright, now we can get down to business,\" Dr. Harper said, clearly exhausted and irritated with the entire procedure.<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" one of the five officials said, holding up one hand and motioning to one of the guards in the room. \"You didn't say you were pregnant. We have to cut you off to reduce the chance of infection.\"<br>\r\n\"That is ridiculous,\" Dr. Harper protested loudly. \"None of the tests have shown that the sudden pregnancy is contagious.\" The head of OB/GYN nodded along.<br>\r\n\"H-Health and Human Services, Kate Rosette. The data given to us shows the same, sir,\" a young woman with mousey brown hair said, standing up and sitting down. The others at the table nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n\"Then we can continue?\" a woman in full, grey P.E.A.R. attire said, standing at the head of the table. \"I'm Lieutenant Han with P.E.A.R., and we need to negotiate the further use of this facility in our investigation.\"<br>\r\nDr. Harper scoffed. They were no longer even pretending to be a legitimate medical team, were they? \"Where is this Commander Zavaleta or Lieutenant Riker I've been told about?\" the head of OB/GYN asked.<br>\r\n\"Both are unavailable at this time,\" Han replied. \"I'm third-in-command here. Now, not all of the examining rooms were available this time around, which slowed us down considerably. What needs to happen to get this wing up to full operations by tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Harper shook her head. \"I have to say, this entire series of events is highly egregious. We are sacrificing actual medical analysis for this paranoid, knee-jerk reaction.\"<br>\r\nHan turned to the head and her other officials in the room, who nodded and turned on the screen at the front of the room. They cycled through a few pages of medical readings. \"As you can see, doctor, there are actually a number of curious...energy readings we've found that tended to be higher in patients with larger numbers of fetuses,\" said one of the other P.E.A.R. officials in the room. \"So we are, in fact, getting closer to a real medical answer.\"<br>\r\n\"Energy readings?\" Dr. Harper said with a confused gaze, one hand moving unconsciously to her own belly. \"Just what kind of equipment are you using on these patients?\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, doctor,\" Han said with a small smile. \"This is something that we are very familiar with. You could say it's the whole reason we exist.\"<br>\r\nDr. Harper sighed frustratedly. \"Well...then give us a hand but get all of these armed militia out of here and get rid of the barricades around the city. This is insane.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid we can't, doctor. This is all procedure for events that we come across,\" Han said. \"It would take a severe compromise of security to get us to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Mia Vasquez---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the station, Mia was pouring through what little video she was able to recover from her own camera operators and from various residents around the city who'd sent smart phone recordings to her. \"This is a once-in-a-lifetime type of story,\" Mia said to the reporters gathered around her, shaking her head. \"This is going to put us on the map.\"<br>\r\n\"You mean put you on the map,\" Brooke, one of the station's anchors, said with a smile. \"And I still can't believe you're doing all this work...you know...\"<br>\r\n\"Pregnant?\" Mia smiled, not taking her eyes off of the screen, but patting her belly with one hand. \"Hey, it might be a little heavy, but I still feel great and I love doing this work. Besides, this story is insane. I told you how they stuffed me in some holding cell with a bunch of other big, pregnant women, didn't I?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, don't get personal about it,\" Rick, the other anchor, who was worried about Mia taking his job, said. \"That can taint a good story.\"<br>\r\n\"Upton Sinclair got pretty personal in 'The Jungle' and that's one of the best pieces of investigative journalism we have,\" the station manager, Douglas Taylor, said, walking up behind them. \"Keep up the good work, Mia. It's impressive stuff and you're making it really unique.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Doug,\" Mia smiled, making a few more clicks before turning around. \"Well, that's it for the package. We'll be all set to run it tonight.\" She started to slowly get up, balancing herself against the desk and her chair.<br>\r\n\"Hey, careful,\" Brooke said. \"Where are you off to now?\"<br>\r\n\"I haven't had a chance to get to the gym today,\" Mia smiled, putting her hands on her expansive belly when she got to her feet. \"I've got to work to get limber if I'm going to be dancing in that contest.\"<br>\r\nBrooke, Douglas, and the rest of the staff gathered around her laughed (except for Rick, of course) and shook their heads. \"And I can't believe you're doing that too,\" Brooke said. \"Well, you look amazing, so you'll be a shoo-in to win. In fact...you almost look <u>better</u> pregnant. No offense.\"<br>\r\n\"None taken,\" Mia grinned, rubbing her belly in larger circles. \"I know what you mean. I've never felt better. I guess I'm just lucky.\"<br>\r\n\"Seems that way,\" Rick grumbled. \"I'm going to get more coffee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Jack and Jessica---<br>\r\n\"This movie sucks,\" Jack whispered in Jessica's ear. \"This is like a parody of a romantic comedy but...taken seriously.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, hush,\" Jessica whispered back, pressing her head harder against his shoulder. \"Just try to enjoy it, okay? I want to have a real date experience and this is part of that.\"<br>\r\n\"You didn't say it had to be a cheesy love movie,\" Jack said, tickling his new girlfriend's pregnant belly slightly. \"Just a movie. We could have seen a real movie!\"<br>\r\n\"Jack, Pacific Rim is not romantic,\" Jessica said in a tone like a teacher talking to a student.<br>\r\n\"There's romance in it!\"<br>\r\nJessica just rolled her eyes and placed one hand over Jack's. \"It's almost over, just...try to have fun, okay? Look at how beautiful Anne Hathaway is. Focus on that.\"<br>\r\n\"That's true,\" Jack said. Jessica squeezed his hand hard.<br>\r\n\"That was a trap and you fell right into it,\" she grinned. \"As punishment, you'll buy me a box of candy afterwards.\"<br>\r\n\"Movie candy? That crap's crazy expensive!\"<br>\r\n\"That's where the taste comes from,\" Jessica giggled, resting more deeply against Jack's chest, the two of them feeling the other's rising and falling breaths.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not that Jack or Jessica noticed, as their attention was turned to trying to suck each others faces off with their lips then the conclusion of their tired, retreaded romantic comedy. Jack's hand were busy quickly moving between the ampleness of Jessica's chest, and the ampleness of Jessica's midsection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere in the \"plot\" if it could be called that Jessica decided she wanted the \"real\" date experience, which as it turned out, more often that not, turned into a hot and heavy grope session. If it wasn't for the fact that there was other people in the theater, Jessica would have had her way with Jack right there during one of the blandest romantic comedies in years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween moans and giggles, Jessica noticed that the credits were nearly over, and brought this rodeo to a complete stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"mmmm.. Jack. Jack!\" She said, pulling her lips off his face and his hands off her body. \"What?\" Jack asked, failing to realize WHY this suck-face session was coming to a stop. \"What's wrong?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we need to leave\" Jessica said, looking over to the cleaning crew of the theater who just stood there, looking at them, one of them nodding his head like \"Yeah buddy.\" Jack saw what Jessica saw, his face turning bright red, and grabbing her by the hand, shuffled out of the theater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside in the lobby, Jack was dying from embarrassment. \"Oh man, oh man\" Jack said. \"Hey, don't be embarrassed, that's what couples do in a movie theater isn't it?\" Jessica said with a knowing giggle. \"Besides, I think that might have been the best show those ushers have seen in a while\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack tried to swallow his embarrassment deep inside, and grabbed Jessica's hand to lead her to her \"chariot\" before Jessica wagged a finger in his direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, uh, uh. Forgetting something?\" Jessica said, jerking her head towards the concession counter. Jack swore under his breath before putting on a smile and turning towards his love. \"You're going to ruin your dinner.\" Jack said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's for after dinner. I thought we could go for a walk through the park before heading home for tonights... activities.\" Jessica smiled a smiled that said \"Prepare your body for tonight\". \"And besides I've never been this hungry before in my life. I swear these kids are trying to fatten me up with how often I've been eating\" Jessica said, rubbing the tight constraints of her belly filled red dress. \"Get me some chocolate covered pretzels. I have such a craving for sweet and salty at the same time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack walked over to the concession line, and after what felt like an eternity (Jack noticing the various sizes of bulged bellies on some of the women and men waiting in line or behind the counter) he finally got Jessica's much craved for snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the walk to the car, Jessica resting her head on Jack's shoulder as they walked, Jack couldn't help but feel ashamed for what has happened to everyone in this town. He thinks back to the pregnant women and the pregnant men whose condition can be directly linked to Jack's actions of buying that damn coin. What must the men of this town be thinking? He couldn't possibly imagine or want to know. He needed to undo all of this, but with Jessica's head resting on his shoulder, he felt selfish. He WANTED Jessica to be bring, to have the babies, to raise them with her.. He wanted a family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut doing so would ruin other people's lives. What if when he undid all of this he and Jessica drifted apart? He had no idea how this \"undoing\" thing even worked. Would it be like it never happened? Then would he and Jessica even still be together? This pregnancy had brought them together, and he wanted them together, but what about everyone else? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moral implications of this situation was enough to make someone's head explode. But no time for that now, if fate so determines that IF, no, not if, WHEN, he undid all this, that he and Jessica wouldn't be together and have no memory of this, then dammit, he was going to embrace every second of it, embrace every second of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, starving pregnant woman here!\" Jessica said, lightly flicking Jack's ear to get his attention. \"Ow!\" Jack said covering his ear. \"Where to?\" Jack asked. \"How about for our first date-date we got to the site of our first not-date date?\" Jessica asked, looking over to him with a smile. \"Besides I've got\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, craving for Italian. Figured it out\" Jack said, starting the car and driving off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later, after a long car ride discussing everything that ranged from Jessica's rapidly changing body to undoing all of this, to music, movies and more, Jack's car finally pulled into the italian restaurant they were just at a few days before. Jack, hefting (there was no doubt about it, he had to haul his date out of the car at this point) and entered in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being asked to wait for a few moments, Jessica turned to Jack with a look of love in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack.. if we don't.. if we can't undo this\" Jessica asked, her hands exploring her changed body<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you.. I want you to help me pick out some names.\" Jessica said plainly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack felt the floor drop out from under him. He had no words to say. His brain had shut down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... love you Jack. And I want you.. to be the father of my children.. OUR Children.\" </span></div></div>",

Both blushed a little and smiled in response, following her to their table.<br>\r\n\"Different than the one last time,\" Jessica said, looking around. \"Well, maybe that would have been too sentimental.\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Jack laughed uncomfortably. \"It's not like we're going to order the exact same food too.\"<br>\r\n\"No, I'll probably get even more now,\" Jessica sighed, putting her hands on her belly and rubbing slowly. \"Every day they get bigger, I get even stronger cravings.\" Jack blushed again and Jessica giggled. \"You're such a perv.\"<br>\r\nNow it was Jack's turn to giggle. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"Talking about my pregnancy heats you up so much. Just the tiniest mention.\" Jack blushed again, wishing he had a glass of water so he could drink nonchalantly. \"It's okay. It's cute.\" The two smiled at each other in silence for a bit. \"So, you were saying?\" <br>\r\nJack cleared his throat. \"Jessica...since this started, I was worried that I'd put you in this...situation and wanted to undo it at any cost. But, lately, being with you, I've-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were again interrupted by two glasses of water being placed on the table in front of them. They looked over at their waitress, an exhausted young woman with a clear baby bump. \"Hello, I'll be your server today. What can I get both of you?\"<br>\r\nJack and Jessica exchanged more embarrassed looks. \"Just some bruschetta for now, please,\" Jessica said.<br>\r\nThe waitress nodded and walked off, one hand stroking her rounding middle. Jack and Jessica immediately got in close to whisper. \"Wasn't she the same one we had last time?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\nJessica nodded. \"Yeah and we...practiced flipping the coin on her and decided it didn't work.\"<br>\r\nJack laughed uncomfortably as he took a sip of water. \"Well, we messed that experiment up pretty badly.\"<br>\r\nJessica rubbed her own belly as her face became more somber. \"I was the one who told you to flip the coin. It's my fault. I got her pregnant.\"<br>\r\n\"That might be the first time I've ever heard a woman say that,\" Jack replied. Jessica rolled her eyes and hit her date on the arm. \"Okay, okay!\" he said with a smile. \"Just trying to lighten the mood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica brought her glass to her lips. \"Well...I appreciate it, I guess.\"<br>\r\nJack sighed. \"B-but, this is important to talk about. Finding out something with the coin won't just undo what happened to you and my mom. It'll do it for everyone. There are lots of people the coin...impregnated and we have to fix this for them too. And we'll undo your pregnancy, even though...\" Jack took a deep sigh. \"Even though I would really like to raise-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your bruschetta,\" the waitress said, sliding the plate in front of them. \"Can I take your main course orders now? And I can I get you anything else besides water?\"<br>\r\nJack ran his hands through his hair, frustrated by his seeming inability to confess to Jessica. She smiled at his reaction, sensing what he had to say. Jessica placed her order and stuck with water, gesturing to her belly as part of that decision.<br>\r\n\"Believe me, I understand,\" their waitress said, jutting her own small belly out. \"I'm not as far along as you, but I've got a level one human in here too. I got knocked up long before all this 'magical pregnancy' stuff too. Not that it mattered. Those government people put me in their trucks and ran tests on me anyway.\"<br>\r\n\"O-oh,\" Jessica said, confused. This woman didn't seem to notice that less than a week ago, she wasn't pregnant at all. \"Are you going to try that pregnant bikini contest at all? They told me women with...smaller bellies usually do very well.\" The admission made Jessica conscious of her own size yet again. She looked just like her waitress when she signed up for the contest and now...now she was a house. And likely to get even bigger...<br>\r\nThe waitress let out a scoffing laugh and put one hand on her belly. \"Yeah, just my luck. I also work at Dino's where the contest is and my shift is the same day as the contest. A pregnant waitress at a pregnant bikini contest. Isn't that a riot?\"<br>\r\nJessica and Jack looked at each other uncomfortably. Jack put in his order and the waitress nodded, walking back to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short silence, Jack reached under the table and took Jessica's hand. \"Jess...being with you has made me wish that you really were pregnant with our kids and we were ready to start a family together. It's...it's selfish, but I feel that strongly about you.\" He looked up to see Jessica looking back at him with warm, amazed eyes. \"I'll of course do everything I can to undo this, but if we can't stop it and you...I'll be the father and raise them with you. No doubt in my mind.\"<br>\r\nJessica's smile widened a bit, a tear falling down her cheek. \"Jack...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Tara---<br>\r\nTara was in front of her full-body mirror, moving her hips back and forth, watching her movements intently. She had to adjust the mirror somewhat so she could actually see what her hips were doing. The full-term triplet belly was getting in the way quite a bit. Tara stopped and wiped her brow with a towel, slinging it over her shoulders. Hopefully, this wouldn't be too different in an actual bikini. Although, for Tara's actual dance routine, she had a special outfit picked out that would stay within the contest's boundaries. The idea of performing her planned dance routine brought a little grin to Tara's face. It would certainly turn heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud knock at her front door. Tara sighed and grabbed her water bottle. \"Coming!\" she bellowed, waddling to the living room. It wasn't a long journey. Her apartment was on the small side if anything, although it was still very nice. But with a belly her size, and given that she'd had less than a week to get used to her added weight, it was a difficult trek. Finally, making it to the door, Tara opened it, shocked at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Special Commander Nicole Zavaleta,\" the humongous pregnant belly in front of her said. Tara couldn't take her eyes off of it. \"I demand to be let inside. You would be foolish to decline.\"<br>\r\nTara slowly brought her eyes up and saw that the impossibly big baby-filled orb belonged to an intense-looking woman, wearing what looked like some kind of military uniform. \"P-please come in,\" Tara said, stunned with surprise and fear.<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Zavaleta said, waddling in slowly, turning her hips several times to fit all of her pregnance inside. \"Now, I should explain my presence here. I am the senior officer in the organization responsible for the current military operations in your city.\"<br>\r\n\"The ones who keep everything on quarantine and made me go to that hospital?\" Tara said, crossing her arms nervously.<br>\r\n\"Exactly. But, my position with them has been jeopardized somewhat and I am forced to act in secret,\" Zavaleta said. With her sudden extreme pregnancy and the loss of the coin after it was in her clutches, she knew Riker was already taking actions to get her out of the leadership position and  maybe even take the coin for himself. No, she needed to lay low and get it herself, especially when she was this close!<br>\r\n\"Well...I don't see what I should go along with that,\" Tara said nervously, running her hands over her belly in an instinctive, protective pose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZavaleta smiled like a predator and took a step forward, her own belly pressing against Tara's, dwarfing her in size and intimidation. \"Because, I have the tools to make sure that you don't have to jump through any of their hoops. You and your babies will be perfectly safe as long as I'm here.\"<br>\r\nTara thought about it. That was an excellent deal. \"And what do you need from me?\"<br>\r\n\"Just board in your apartment and background on your bank,\" Zavaleta said, stepping away from Tara and slowly lowering herself onto a sturdy seat that still moaned under her pregnant weight. \"You see, the coi...the cause for much of this abnormal pregnancy is connected to Titan Bank somehow, so I needed to stay with someone who works there to gather information on it.\"<br>\r\n\"And why me?\" Tara said with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n\"I looked through all the data we have on you. According to my readings, you're the smartest person at that bank. I wanted to be with someone who could understand me better.\"<br>\r\nTara smiled a bit at what felt like a compliment. \"Well...as long as you keep up your word, you can stay. But you will probably need to pay for your own food.\"<br>\r\nZavaleta smiled and looked down. \"Yes, I can see why you'd have that worry.\" She didn't include that she was staying with Tara because her tests showed that she was exposed to the coin more than anyone else in the city. The intelligence reading was accurate as well.<br>\r\n\"But about the 'strange pregnancies,'\" Tara asked, pointing subtly at Zavaleta's utterly unsubtle belly. \"Is that what caused...\"<br>\r\nZavaleta looked up at Tara with a purr and a knowing grin. \"No, these are my babies, through-and-through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Jack and Jessica---<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I can't believe how much I ate,\" Jessica groaned, putting her fork down. \"But they feel nice and content in there.\"<br>\r\n\"Good to hear,\" Jack smiled. He finished his dinner nearly half an hour ago but had enough common sense not to say anything. After a while waiting for Jessica to finish, he went ahead and paid for the dinner and the two of them got up, Jack helping Jessica to the car. \"Well, good date?\"<br>\r\n\"Excellent date,\" Jessica smiled.<br>\r\n\"So...what's left?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n\"Only one thing,\" Jessica smiled, kissing him on the cheek and looking into his eyes with a hungry smile.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>--Tara---<br>\r\nTara felt her young kick and squirm inside her and started to rub her belly. \"Mmm, speaking of food,\" she laughed with a sigh.<br>\r\nZavaleta felt the same sensation on a much larger scale and stroked her pregnant expanse as well. The blowback the coin had given her in anger meant much stronger and harsher cravings. \"I agree,\" she groaned, feeling a good number of sharp kicks. \"I can reimburse you for any food.\"<br>\r\nTara looked over Zavaleta's belly once again. \"Maybe...I'll just order some pizzas,\" Tara said, waddling over to the phone. <i>If I tried to cook for us both, I'd run out of food</i>, Tara thought to herself. \"Any kind in particular?\"<br>\r\n\"Something with lots on it!\" Zavaleta bellowed, heaving herself off of the couch. Once up, she steadied her legs and began waddling toward the bathroom with the weight of about five full-grown fetuses on her bladder. Here again, the doorway was too small for her impossible pregnant bulk, but she managed to shift herself inside (smashing the \"Spyder\" camera inside in the process). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara ordered 11 supreme pizzas, one for each baby they were carrying, and sat on the couch, drinking water and caressing her bump. When Zavaleta came back into the room, Tara's jaw nearly dropped. Zavaleta abandoned her military outfit for...for nothing. She waddled back into the room in just her pants and a strained bra. \"Um...um...\"<br>\r\nZavaleta looked back at Tara with a blank expression. \"My outfit was entirely too restrictive for my child-bearing body and I'm on unofficial business. And you weren't wearing formal clothing so I didn't want to make you feel uncomfortable.\" Tara was only wearing a tank top that covered maybe 1/4 of her belly and half-zipped jeans. \"In fact, if you have any pants that are more accommodating, I'd like some of those too.\"<br>\r\n\"I-I'll get you some sweat pants,\" Tara said, shifting her weight so she could stand up as Zavaleta eased herself onto the couch. Tara hurried to her room and picked out the right clothes. As she looked through her drawers, she couldn't stop thinking about how her guest looked. She was definitely older than Tara but...even topless and ridiculously pregnant, she looked amazing. No stretch marks, no sagging, only a few well-placed wrinkles on her face. Tara hoped she'd look that good at that age...whatever that age was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZavaleta slipped her own pants off and took Tara's sweatpants from her, heaving her belly up as she stepped into the legs. \"M-may I ask what your name is?\" Tara said nervously, standing with her hands over her belly.<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes. Please call me Nicole,\" Zavaleta smiled. It had been a long time since anyone just called her \"Nicole.\" \"Of course, I already know your name.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Tara said, sitting next to Zavaleta. She was rubbing her gigantic belly and winced with discomfort every now and then. \"Here, may I?\" Tara said, leaning over and rubbing Zavaleta's belly.<br>\r\nThe expression of pain quickly left her face. \"Oh, that worked marvelously,\" Zavaleta said with surprise.<br>\r\n\"Yes, it feels much better when someone else rubs your belly,\" Tara smiled.<br>\r\n\"Well then, let me repay you,\" Zavaleta said, aggressively stroking Tara's sensitive belly, making her insides tickle and shiver.<br>\r\n\"T-that's good too,\" Tara whined, curling her toes. \"So, you seem excited to be a mom.\"<br>\r\nZavaleta beamed. \"Yes! I've wanted this all my life but work came first. Now, not much can stand in the way of me and my eight little ones. And I know I'll be a great mother.\"<br>\r\nTara smiled, happy to see Zavaleta's rough exterior coming down a little. \"Yeah? How so?\"<br>\r\nZavaleta scoffed and turned to her host. \"Because I'm such an efficient leader. I'll assign each child exact schedules to play, to study, to clean the house.\" She sighed and smiled, placing her hands on top of Tara's and guiding her rubbing. \"It will be perfect.\"<br>\r\nTara giggled. \"Well, I don't think you can expect children to follow orders precisely like that. And it takes much more to raise kids.\"<br>\r\n\"I know that,\" Zavaleta said. \"I'll encourage them by giving them a scale for presents on their birthday and holidays. Each one starts off with 10 presents, then failing in their sector of the house means one demerit. Then-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang and Tara chuckled, patting Zavaleta's belly. \"I need to get that.\"<br>\r\nZavaleta reached into her pants on the floor and fished out her wallet, handing Tara a wad of cash. \"There you go.\"<br>\r\nTara smiled and thanked her guest, going to the door and taking the pizzas from the pregnant delivery girl, who was balancing the food on top of her belly. Tara handed her the money and smiled and thanked her, waddling back to the couch. \"Nicole, the one positive about all of these pregnancies is that I don't feel embarrassed about my own pregnancy around most people, since most of them were pregnant themselves! Even my boss.\"<br>\r\nZavaleta turned around, remembering information on Titan Bank's manager from her files. A pregnant man. He might hold some clues. \"Your boss?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, here, he even sent us an email about a baby shower he's holding at work tomorrow,\" Tara said, getting out her phone and showing the message to Zavaleta. She put the pizza boxes on the coffee table and opened them up, letting the garlic and tomato smell waft around the room.<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" Zavaleta mused. \"I need to come with you to investigate further.\"<br>\r\n\"Well..alright,\" Tara said. Zavaleta had seemed safe enough so far and she appeared close to an explanation for these pregnancies. \"I guess you can tell people you're my mom and you-\" Tara looked at Zavaleta's bare belly and paused. \"-got affected with the same thing as everyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZavaleta ate pizza with glee and gusto as Tara watched, impressed. <i>I thought <b>I</b> was a pregnant pig when I ate</i>...<br>\r\n\"Oh, Tara, they're kicking! And this time it's not painful!\" Zavaleta suddenly yelled, excited. She took Tara's hand and placed it on her belly. Tara couldn't believe all of the activity she was feeling. Carrying eight babies must be unbelievable.<br>\r\n\"It feels nice,\" Tara smiled at Zavaleta, who smiled back. \"You might have to change your parenting methods a bit, but you really will be a great mom.\" Tara's smile faded and her voice trailed off. \"Not like me.\"<br>\r\n\"Tara,\" Zavaleta said softly, taking Tara's chin. \"All of your data shows that you will be an exceptional mother. You have a stable career, a high level of education, a-\"<br>\r\nTara's eyes welled up. \"No, it's...it's different. I don't feel ready. I don't know the first thing about taking care of one child, let alone three.\"<br>\r\nZavaleta wrapped one arm over Tara and hugged her against the mass of pregnant belly Tara was already rubbing. \"You'll do fine, my dear.\" Tara sniffled and nodded, resting against Zavaleta's belly. It was tight and soft and the warmth and heartbeats inside her soothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two stayed like this for a while, with Zavaleta moving another pizza box to the other side of her belly so Tara could reach over and eat. \"We're nearly out of food,\" Zavaleta said, putting the last slice of her stack of boxes in her mouth. \"What do you propose we do now? You seem to be better at...recreation.\"<br>\r\nTara brought her head up quickly. \"Well, there's one thing I hoped to do if any of my other friends got pregnant but...well, Nicole, would you like to do it with me?\"<br>\r\nZavaleta nodded. It had been 30 years since anyone considered her a \"friend.\" \"I am always open to new experiences.\"<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Tara said happily, heaving herself off the couch. \"Wait here!\"<br>\r\nMoments later, Tara returned with a stack of DVDs and another plastic box. \"Okay so...these are all movies about pregnancy I rented from Blockbuster right before it closed so I guess I just...own them now. And this is body paint.\"<br>\r\n\"Body paint? What would we do with that?\" Zavaleta said with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n\"I was hoping we could paint our bellies?\" Tara said with a weak grin. \"It's something I've sort of had my heart set on for a while.\"<br>\r\nZavaleta sighed and smiled back. \"Well, that sounds like it could be fun. Let's do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara popped in the first DVD in the pile (Knocked Up, unfortunately) and opened the box in front of her, sorting out the different paints. \"Okay, so...just go for it, I guess.\"<br>\r\nZavaleta nodded. \"I took visual art as an elective at the Sorbonne. I believe I should be able to do this.\"<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Tara smiled, dipping her own brush and starting work on floral designs on the front of Zavaleta's belly. Of course, it was so big and so round, the \"front\" was hard to accurately find, so Tara made patterns around her popped-out belly button. Zavaleta turned her head a few times, inspecting her \"canvas.\" Tara's belly was huge, for sure. Practically nothing compared to Zavaleta's, but she was about 70 inches around. Wrapping the tape around Tara's belly button would probably add another half-inch. Her brown skin had a few well-placed freckles near her belly button. Zavaleta's military work prepared her to pinpoint Tara's ethnicity immediately, but Zavaleta decided against that. She was no long on duty with P.E.A.R. and she thought the process silly and needless anyway, even when she was in the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZavaleta gingerly dabbed her brush in the blue and green paints, twisting her brush to mix them into a turquoise shade and dabbing it gently on Tara's belly. Tara began to laugh after the sixth dab. \"You're just trying to tickle me, aren't you?\"<br>\r\nZavaleta shook her head. \"I assure you that I'm not. I'm surprised that your own brushstrokes aren't having the same affect on me. They're very smooth and...feel quite nice.\"<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, Nicole,\" Tara smiled. \"Now don't look down at your belly, okay? I want these to be a surprise when we're done.\"<br>\r\n\"You've thought this through quite a bit, haven't you, Tara?\"<br>\r\nTara blushed, embarrassed. \"Well, I've been pregnant for a while.\"<br>\r\n\"But your file said that these babies-\"<br>\r\n\"Just the other two were a surprise,\" Tara said, looking up to meet Zavaleta's eyes. \"But believe me, I've been pregnant for quite some time. I'm nearing the end pretty soon.\"<br>\r\nZavaleta nodded. \"I apologize if I was prying.\"<br>\r\n\"No, don't be,\" Tara smiled, going back to her paint job. \"I don't really get to talk about my pregnancy with anyone. It's nice to have someone to share it with...even if you're...\"<br>\r\nZavaleta stopped. \"Even if I'm what?\"<br>\r\n\"You know...\" Tara said. \"My warden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZavaleta put down her brush and reached back into her old pants' pockets, bringing out a small, metal box. \"Give me your blue card.\"<br>\r\n\"What?\" Tara said with surprise.<br>\r\nZavaleta quickly snatched Tara's phone out of her pocket and turned over the case. In the clip was a credit card, her ID card, and other miscellaneous things like that - including her blue card with a pink dot. Zavaleta ran her device over the card and handed it back to Tara.<br>\r\n\"There, now you have no tracking, no duty to return to the hospital, and you could in fact leave the city if you wished. Do I feel like your warden now?\"<br>\r\nTara paused and placed one hand on top of Zavaleta's belly. \"No...you're right. I'm sorry, Nicole. It's just been a crazy day and-\"<br>\r\nZavaleta smiled and placed her hand on Tara's belly. \"I understand. Now that I'm pregnant I see how this procedure is...intrusive. And I...enjoy spending time with you too.\" Zavaleta cleared her throat. \"I don't get many opportunities to...do this.\"<br>\r\nTara smiled and took her brush back, continuing her work on Zavaleta's belly. \"Neither do I. Nicole, I'd hug you, but I don't want to ruin the work you did on my belly.\"<br>\r\nZavaleta smiled and took her brush back too. \"This feels just as good, Tara.\" And the two resumed painting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on and on, with Tara having to put in a new movie at one point. Finally, Tara felt done and let out a long yawn.<br>\r\n\"Mmm, just in time,\" Tara said. \"I'm exhausted. I'm still not used to carrying three babies and I'll bet that's more than double for you.\" Zavaleta chuckled and nodded.<br>\r\n\"It's nothing my training can't handle,\" she replied, heaving herself off the couch once again. \"But I agree. I still need my sleep. Now, let's see our artwork.\"<br>\r\nTara smiled as she walked Zavaleta to the full-body mirror in her bedroom. Her guest's eyes shimmered as she saw the designs across her belly...the belly she'd worked so hard to get.<br>\r\n\"Beautiful,\" Zavaleta breathed. \"And now you.\"<br>\r\nTara smiled and looked into the mirror, her expression turning stunned at the detailed, intricate work done on her.<br>\r\n\"It's Monet's 'Waterlillies,'\" Zavaleta said, impressed with her handiwork. \"Do you like it?\"<br>\r\n\"I...wow,\" Tara said. \"That's...wow.\"<br>\r\n\"But I suppose we need to wash this off before we sleep,\" Zavaleta sighed, looking down at her belly.<br>\r\n\"Well, hold on!\" Tara said excitedly, grabbing her camera off of her bureau. \"Let's get a picture and capture the magic!\"<br>\r\nZavaleta smiled at Tara's phrase as she posed for the picture. <i>Tomorrow, I intend to capture the magic</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few pictures, Tara used a wet towel to clean off their bellies. \"So, for our sleeping arrangement...\"<br>\r\nZavaleta looked at her confused. \"I assumed we would just share a bed. Yours seems large enough.\"<br>\r\nTara doubted that, but that wasn't the main issue. \"Well, still, I think that I could just take the couch and-\"<br>\r\n\"Tara!\" Zavaleta said, putting her hands on her pronounced hips. \"You are easily 39 weeks pregnant with triplets. I cannot have you sleeping on that tiny couch. You will share the bed with me and have a restful, rejuvenating sleep. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\nTara unconsciously snapped into an upright position. \"Yes ma'am!\"<br>\r\n\"At ease.\"<br>\r\nTara relaxed and rubbed her belly slowly. <i>What the hell was that</i>? she wondered.<br>\r\n\"Perfect. And in the morning, I will accompany you to your work to investigate. Now...how will this work?\" Zavaleta examined the bed and let out a low groan as she lay down on it. \"Hmm...alright, we will have to sleep head-to-toe so our bellies don't intrude against one another's.\"<br>\r\n\"Wh-what?\" Tara stammered, everything still moving too quickly for her. <br>\r\n\"Get in bed!\" Zavaleta bellowed again. Tara moved the fastest she'd ever moved since her triplets were added to her belly (which was less than a minute after she became pregnant anyway), slipped out of her jeans, and lay in bed as Zavaleta instructed. \"Yes, this will do nicely...well, goodnight, Tara.\"<br>\r\n\"G-goodnight, Nicole,\" Tara said, not mentioning that she was now staring directly at Zavaleta's belly at this position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Jack and Jessica---<br>\r\nJessica smiled sweetly and met Jack's eyes as she waddled around the car, stepping into the passenger side. <br>\r\n\"C'mon, Dale,\" Jessica purred, leaning over. \"Isn't this what you wanted all night? Hurry up and drive!\"<br>\r\nJack was still stunned, his body and mind still not piecing together the Jessica=Girlfriend reality before him. \"I-I also wanted to hang out with you tonight.\"<br>\r\nJessica laughed. \"Believe me, I love 'sweet Jack' but right now, I just want to rock your world. Either hit the gas or I'll take you in the backseat right now.\"<br>\r\n\"W-well, I don't know if we'd both fit back there,\" Jack said, his eyes bugging out more and more.<br>\r\nJessica laughed again and slapped his arm. \"Then step on it!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Slowly, Jack brought his car to a halt, hoping to stop the inevitable loud SQUEAL of his breaks, telling him that they needed changing. <br>\r\nBreaks can wake, what was coming next.... Just couldn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taking me to your place hmm? Presuming much are we?\" Jessica said with a smile, softly chewing the last of her chocolate covered pretzels, the crumbs and wrapper resting lightly on top of the large red mound that was her pregnant stomach, that Jessica had now just began to realize made a handy shelf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not be too loud. I don't want to wake up my parents\" Jack said, undoing his seatbelt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmmmm. Where's the fun if we can't be loud? No moaning and groaning loverboy?\" Jessica said with a sadistic smile, hoping to get him both revved and riled up at the same time. It was working, the two conflicting emotions playing havoc with Jack's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh...\" Jack said, his \"deer in the headlights\" look again quickly finding it's way to his face. It had been doing that frequently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, stop being some damn cute and predictable and heft me out of this thing\" Jessica said, undoing her seatbelt and opening her door. <br>\r\nExtending her arms out to the side and waving them was Jack's signal to heft his date of the car once again. Hefting her to her feet, her face immediately began to suck various small corners of his face. He wanted to happen right here in the dirt in front of everyone who could see...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut deciding against that, he slowly guided Jessica into the house, kissing her back.. and her front... and her forehead.. and well anywhere he could get his lips on while she was dressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the kitchen they began to disrobe, and Jack threw Jessica against the kitchen table, which groaned in response to her impressive weight. Kissing her deeply, she wiggled back a little bit, until her rear end hit something... square.. and brightly wrapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm.. Package\" She said between kisses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I got a pack- - - \" Jack said trying to sound sexy and sounding more idiotic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will stop this whole thing right now if you finish that sentence. It sounded like something out of a bad porno\" Jessica said, chastising Jack and his awful attempt at sexiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Jack said embarrassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica reached behind her and grabbed a large wrapped box in bright pink-and-blue paper, some pacifier's tapped to the outside with a card that says \"To Ryan. Best of luck at Fatherhood (Or is it Motherhood with you?) Regards, Amanda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like a baby shower gift\" Jessica said, a small pang of sadness in her voice. IF they couldn't undo this, it would probably be too late for a proper baby-shower which made her very sad. \"Whose Ryan?\" She asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only Ryan my Mom's ever talked about is her boss, but he doesn't have any kids.\" Jack said, before it dawned on him. \"You don't think that - - -\" Jack asked already knowing the answer. <br>\r\n\"Would it really surprise you after everything else..\" Jessica said, her hands pressed tightly around the roundness of her belly for emphasis \"that has happened?\" <br>\r\n\"I don't want to think about it\" Jack said. <br>\r\n\"Still..\" Jessica said, looking at the box, tempted to open it, to kick it's brightly wrapped treasure for herself <br>\r\n\"What?\" Jack asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that well.. Sarah and Ariel are coming so quickly into my life that well, I didn't really to get experience the whole pregnancy thing - Just the cliff notes you know? I mean, the little things like waiting so long and of course...\" Jessica said with a pang of sadness in her voice, holding the present in her arms like one of her future unborn children \"A baby shower. I'm not going to get a baby shower\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you and a lot of other people if we don't figure out a way to undo this..\" Jack said smartassly quite pleased with his clever quick quip. \"And wait, Sarah and Ariel?\" Jack asked. <br>\r\n\"Sarah and Ariel, our daughters?\" Jessica said, rather matter of factly, pointing to her belly for emphasis. <br>\r\n\"Ah no no, our sons. Luke and Optimus\" Jack said with a smile. He was quickly falling into the role of \"Father\" quicker than he would like to admit. <br>\r\n\"We're not naming one of our sons after a robot that turns into a car\" Jessica replied back.<br>\r\n\"Truck. He turned into a truck. Big difference\" Jack said, correcting very sternly. You not triffle with Jack in matters of all things nerdy. <br>\r\n\"And you admit that we're having sons then?\" Jack just added as a way to twist the metaphorical knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said no such thing. We're having daughters, and there going to be as smart as beautiful as their mother, and as funny and charming as their father\" Jessica said wrapping her arms around Jack, putting the present aside, and giving him a big kiss. <br>\r\n\"Their father was a semi-evil coin that's obsessed with causing chaos through pregnancy in both men and women\" Jack said, being a smartass again. <br>\r\nJessica playfully slapped him upside the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody likes a wiseass\" Jessica said, kissing him again. <br>\r\n\"Shall we take this somewhere more.. sexable? I'd rather not have sex with my very beautiful and very pregnant girlfriend where I eat my cereal every morning.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack took his date back towards his room (something that rarely happened) and shut the door. They continued to kiss, each one of them removing more and more clothing with each kiss they took...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the dark of that nerdy room, as the bright pale yellow glow of the full moon shone in on the two, as they lay upon the bed, it was prefect moment in time. In a rising syphony of creaking bedsprings, the two became one and all was right in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it was all over, their bodies glistening with sweat, he held her, and she chose to be held, speaking not a word to each other, yet saying everything they would ever need to say: IF we fail, it will all be okay. IF we fail, we have each other. IF we fail, we have this moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying a word to each other, they pledged themselves to each other, forever and always, in the dark of the night, in the light of the moon. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kicking and turning inside Jessica's belly woke her up gracefully and she stretched her back and smiled as she opened her eyes, Jack's scruffy bed head in her face. After petting it softly and not noticing Jack getting any closer to waking up, Jessica planted a kiss on the back of her lover's head and inched her way out of bed. As she moved and got out, she could see what she had gotten used to over the past few days: her belly had gotten bigger. Jessica sighed and ran her hands around her naked bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I look ready to pop</i>, Jessica thought to herself. And she was right: anyone looking at her would say she looks about full term with one baby. <i>Let's see...two more days</i>. She sighed and patted the front of her belly as she walked around Jack's messy room. <i>Two more days</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeeking outside the bedroom door, Jessica couldn't hear any more noise in the house and breathed a little in relief. It's always awkward to run into the parents. Jessica reached a strange mix between tip-toeing and waddling as she checked doors for what she hoped was a bathroom. On the way, she stumbled across a closet and got herself a big, soft towel. Once in the bathroom, she drew herself a warm shower and stepped in, cooing and smiling as the water ran over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the hall, Amanda felt an even stronger flurry of movement inside her gigantic tummy, which she couldn't pretend to ignore. Mumbling and turning over, which was quite the exercise now, Amanda sat up slightly in bed, her belly now jutting up in the air four feet. It had grown again, Amanda noted with a little smile, running her hands over her enormity. On the surface, she could see the bumps and signs of in utero activity. Turning over, Jack Sr. was deep in sleep, snoring slightly. Amanda laughed quietly and patted him on the head. <i>I've been wearing you out each night, haven't I dear</i>? Amanda's libido grew with bounds and bounds each day her pregnancy increased and the added energy of four growing little ones inside her intensified that even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda put her hands under her belly and heaved herself out of bed, breathing steadily as she did. As her feet settled on the floor, she then had to gradually stand up straight, putting her belly out as she stretched. Yawning and rubbing her pregnance some more, Amanda waddled to the coatrack in the room and slid into her robe. Of course, with Amanda's belly, the robe only served to cover up her breasts and conceal her hips and thighs some. The belly was now framed by velvet fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda waddled into the hall, trying not to wake her sleeping Jacks with her swollen movements, and opened the closet, getting a towel for herself. As she moved around, it was clear how much harder it was to move around with such an enlarged belly. Amanda sighed and started stroking her size. Just as she thought: she would need to rehearse her dancing thoroughly again to get used to her size. But, on the other hand, she would just get even bigger tomorrow...Amanda chuckled and put both hands on her belly. \"When are you going to stop growing?\" she asked, jiggling her belly a bit and getting kicks from eight individual legs in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the shower, Jessica had just turned off the water and was running her hands through her hair with a smile, feeling refreshed and ready to start the day. Talking with Jack about how they could raise little Ariel and Sarah was fun and...really sweet, but it was a scenario she wanted to avoid. If...when she and Jack have children, it'll be on their own terms. Besides, this wasn't just for them. Jack's mom, Jack's neighbor, Mariah. All of those men and women on the news. They don't all want kids and they can't all handle them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica and Jack had a day of fun. Now, it was time to get to work and now that she was washed and relaxed, Jessica was ready to take it all on. Opening the shower's glass door, Jessica stepped out, totally naked, pregnant, and dripping wet, as Amanda walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! my god...Jessica?\" Amanda said, holding her hand over her heart in fear. <br>\r\n\"Mrs. Dale?!\" Jessica choked out, jumping back in surprise and covering herself with her towel. \"I-I-I-I-\"<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" Amanda breathed, bending her knees some to catch her breath. \"I'm sorry, you scared me half to death. Although I suppose you would have been the first pregnant burglar I can think of.\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Jessica said, forcing a smile, her face bright red. \"I'm so sorry about this.\"<br>\r\n\"It's...alright,\" Amanda said, waddling up to Jessica. \"Just...let us know next time.\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I would have. I thought we would go to my house but Jack really...took charge,\" Jessica said, an idyllic grin spreading across her lips. \"I'm sorry, you don't want to hear about that.\"<br>\r\n\"You're right, I don't,\" Amanda laughed, \"but I think it's my job as a mother to know. And now that we're here together-\" Amanda paused, taking a huge breath, \"-is it...Jack's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica bit her lip, thinking about how to answer the question. It was something she needed to come to terms with if their plan didn't work out. \"It...they aren't, Mrs. Dale. But we agreed to...raise them together. As a family.\"<br>\r\nAmanda nodded, putting her hands on Jessica's shoulders. \"And you're sure that's what you want?\"<br>\r\nJessica nodded emphatically, feeling her cheeks getting hot again. \"Absolutely. Jack's really been there for me and I love him. We love each other. It was a decision we came to together.\" A tear ran down Jessica's cheek. \"You've got a great son, Mrs. Dale.\"<br>\r\nAmanda started to cry softly too, taking Jessica in a close hug. Or as close as they could get with their respective bellies. \"So, twins huh? Two grandkids at once. And while I'm carrying four new children at the same time.\"<br>\r\n\"It's all a little...out of the ordinary, I guess,\" Jessica chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda broke the hug and nodded. \"Well, this should be a time for celebrating. How far along are you?\"<br>\r\nJessica's smile faded. \"Oh, um...I honestly don't know how to answer that. It's grown so quickly. I haven't even gotten used to being pregnant.\"<br>\r\nAmanda nodded. \"Actually, I feel exactly the same way. Do you think it has something to do with these other strange pregnancies in the city?\"<br>\r\nJessica gave a little half-truth. \"I think so, Mrs. Dale. And getting so big so quickly, I feel like I'm missing a lot of pregnant activities. No lamaze, just one ultrasound. And I really wanted a baby shower.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda put her hands on her hip and smiled. \"Well, you're in luck. A lot of my coworkers are pregnant so we're having a big group shower today.\" Amanda rolled her eyes. \"Well, technically it's just for my boss, but we're letting him think it's all about him.\"<br>\r\n\"Him?\" Jessica started to say, before shaking her head. <i>Right, that coin doesn't discriminate</i>.<br>\r\n\"So, why don't you come along? We can include you in the festivities.\"<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Dale, are you sure?\" Jessica said, still trying to find away to keep herself covered by her towel that she slowly realized was not big enough for her bulging belly.<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Amanda smiled, running her hands on her maternal curve. \"You're carrying my grandbabies, after all.\"<br>\r\nJessica smiled and laughed, giving Amanda another hug. \"Thank you, Mrs. Dale. Really.\"<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, Jessica sweetie,\" Amanda said. \"You've always been good to us.\"<br>\r\nAs they hugged, Jessica giggled. \"Oh, one more thing, Mrs. Dale? Do you think I could borrow some clothes? Just until I get back home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Mariah---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's pregnant friend, a sneak preview of what Jessica herself would look like in two days, snorted and woke up on a mattress, rubbing her belly and head sleepily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleep well?\" Ms. Apple said, walking into the tiny room Mariah was sleeping in. \"We could have gotten you back to your house, you know. Just because Ms. Quick and I are pregnant doesn't mean we can't give a little care.\"<br>\r\nMariah shook her head and groaned, sitting up. \"No, I had to stay here and look through the book,\" she said. \"And the mattress was fine. I slept great.\"<br>\r\nMs. Apple sighed and smiled, waddling over to Mariah and slowly heaving herself down onto the mattress. \"Well, you're a hard worker, that's for sure. And smart. If we don't figure it out this time, would you consider joining the four of us on our global quest to vanquish magical evil?\"<br>\r\n\"That's a nice offer, but I'll have to sleep on it,\" Mariah said, reaching for the stack of notes she'd taken. \"So from what I remember, and from what you left me, I think we definitely have a way to influence the coin's hold over us if we can get the other two. We'll need Jack too, but everything checks out.\"<br>\r\n\"That's great, but where do we get the other coins? Or the book, for that matter?\" Ms. Apple said, rubbing her belly and looking at Mariah's scribblings. \"You're sure you and Jack and the girlfriend have a fix on them.\"<br>\r\n\"I saw the woman who took the book myself,\" Mariah said. \"And Jack happens to live by the monstrous pregnant woman who took it and gave me these two bundles of joy.\" Mariah rolled up her white t-shirt and showed Ms. Apple her smooth bulge.<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't worry,\" Ms. Apple said in a gentle, quiet tone. \"The four of us have made it out...okay. You'll be okay too.\"<br>\r\nMariah nodded and heaved herself up. \"Well, let's get ready to meet up with Jack and Jessica to go get the book back.\"<br>\r\nMs. Quick walked into the cramped room, her belly hanging out defiantly from under her unbuttoned shirt. \"And good luck, ladies. We've got a pretty solid lead on the third coin.\"<br>\r\n\"Great, where?\" Ms. Apple asked as Ms. Quick held out the flier for the pregnant bikini contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember signing up for this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes. We'd better practice our dancing, starting now.\"</span></div></div>",

Their hands met and fingers intertwined as they rubbed her vastness.<br>\r\n\"Well, to be honest, I always found it pretty hot,\" Natalie smiled, nuzzling her forehead against Lisa's collarbone. \"But I could see how it was troubling you so I didn't say anything. But you seem...better now.\"<br>\r\nLisa wrapped one arm under Natalie's armpit and held her closer. \"I think I am. Having you here helps.\" Lisa rolled over onto her back, her belly nearly pulling the covers off the bed as it moved. \"So, names...that would mean knowing the sexes.\" She turned and looked into Natalie's eyes. \"Do you want to know?\"<br>\r\nNatalie scooted even closer. \"You mean you do?\" Lisa grinned and Natalie gave a smiling gasp and pushed her playfully on the arm. \"Well c'mon then! It's not fair to keep that to yourself!\"<br>\r\nLisa laughed and took one of Natalie's hands, kissing her palm wetly, and placing it on top of her belly. \"Two girls and a boy.\" Natalie gasped and leaned over kissing Lisa frantically. \"Oh! You like those sexes a lot more than I expected.\"<br>\r\nNatalie shook her head. \"No, it's just...knowing the sexes makes it all so real now. And I can't believe how lucky I am to be starting a family with you.\"<br>\r\n\"You're even luckier because you don't have to do the heavy lifting,\" Lisa sighed, rubbing the side of her belly with her other hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie kissed Lisa on the cheek. \"If I could switch places with you, I gladly would,\" she said. \"Well, except that I'd miss that gorgeous pregnant figure you've developed.\" Now it was Lisa's turn to give Natalie a little push as she slowly sat up. \"So, let's get the easy one out of the way. Boy's name.\"<br>\r\nLisa thought and thought. \"I kind of like Scott.\"<br>\r\nNatalie nodded. \"That is a good name. For one of the girls, can we name her after my grandmother, Dalia.\"<br>\r\nLisa let out a little whimper. \"Aww...of course we can. That's a nice name. I guess we should name the other girl after my grandmother, Julia.\"<br>\r\nNatalie pressed her torso against Lisa's belly and wrapped her arms around her fleshy orb. \"Scott, Dalia, and Julia...I can't wait to meet them. And raise them with you.\"<br>\r\n\"Me either, babe,\" Lisa said, looking at her belly, feeling the kicks and movements as her children began to wake up. \"Me either.\"<br>\r\n\"And I definitely can't wait to see you strut around in a bikini tomorrow,\" Natalie giggled, kissing Lisa's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Lisa started to get out of bed. \"Oh my God! I can't believe I'm really doing that.\" She looked back at Natalie's still grinning face. \"And why do you want to see that so badly? I'm naked right now, is that not enough?\"<br>\r\nNatalie shrugged. \"It's different. And I've never seen you in a bikini pregnant before.\" Natalie started to turn red and bite her lip.<br>\r\n\"Wow, this pregnant bikini thing is really doing something for you, isn't it?\" Lisa remarked with a smile, waddling off to the bathroom to shower. Natalie just nodded rapidly, watching her lover pass behind the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce dressed, and only thanks to the clothing the station was sent by Baby Universe as part of their sponsorship of the competition, Lisa sat in the living room, looking out the window. Since her pregnancy, Lisa had Sandwich and Oven carpool with her so she could still get to work. Natalie walked into the living room, wrapped up in a robe. She had her own job working an entry-level job at Titan Bank, but she didn't have to be in for a few hours. Lisa's time on the radio required her to get up pretty early in the morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa saw the familiar over-compensating Ferrari of Sandwich. Natalie sat on the arm of her chair and two exchanged one long goodbye kiss as Lisa heaved herself out of her seat. \"Do you have to keep going to work?\" Natalie said with sad and worried voice. \"I mean, at your stage, any pregnant woman would start taking maternity leave. We don't know how long you have until you...you know.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. When it's finally time to hatch, you'll be the first person I call,\" Lisa smiled, rubbing her belly. \"And if I feel good enough to go to a pregnant bikini contest, I can go to work.\"<br>\r\nLisa and Natalie exchanged another peck before Lisa waddled out the door and heaved herself into the backseat of Sandwich's car. Oven was in the front seat, grumpily fidgeting with his seatbelt. His belly had gotten larger again over the night and it made his restraint that much tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow's the big day,\" Sandwich said as they drove to work. \"We've got all of our bases checked?\"<br>\r\n\"It would have been easier if we didn't start putting this thing together last week,\" Oven complained. \"I mean, really, why did we only start the legwork last week?\"<br>\r\nLisa shrugged. \"Well if we wanted to find pregnant women, we had to find them pretty close to the day of the contest. We don't stay ripe for long, you know?\"<br>\r\n\"What are you trying to say? That I don't know what it's like to be pregnant?\" Oven growled, turning around.<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, let's calm down,\" Sandwich said. \"It's been a stressful week, yeah? Let's not be at each other's throats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the station, the three did their typical on-air, drive-time shtick for a few hours, then took their lunch break while the syndicated news played. As they ate, they went over the competition's check-list. \"This is a pretty big list of women. Way more than I thought we'd get,\" Sandwich said.<br>\r\n\"Well, you've got one more thanks to me,\" Lisa laughed sarcastically, going over the itinerary. \"What's this about 'helpers?'\"<br>\r\n\"We've got two guys that got signed up as helpers in between the events,\" Oven said. \"So like, straightening outfits, applying and reapplying oil to make the bellies stand out more.\"<br>\r\nLisa's face turned red. The idea of having some rando rub oil all over her belly was not very appealing. If it was a woman, it might be a little different, but it didn't sound like it. <br>\r\n\"And the opening band is all set, right?\" Lisa said, turning the next page.<br>\r\nSandwich nodded. \"They're pretty...combative, but hopefully Mommy Kills Best will be professional enough to not give us any headaches or surprises. They're pretty popular, even if it's only a novelty because they're an all-pregnant band, but they'll bring in plenty of people by themselves.\"<br>\r\nLisa's next question couldn't help but make her grin. \"So what happens if I win? That might be seen as cheating, right?\"<br>\r\nOven scoffed. \"You think you've got a good shot at winning?\"<br>\r\nLisa shot him back a piercing stare. \"I'd say I have a very good shot at winning.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" Sandwich said, holding out his hands. \"The audience is the ones who vote on a winner, not us, so I think that should clear that up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Sandwich and I have to go over the actual competition elements, so if you're still going to be in this, you should step out of the room,\" Oven said. Lisa nodded and waddled out the room to the benches outside the station, finishing her big lunch. As she took her last bite, she called Natalie on her phone.<br>\r\n\"Lisa! Oh my god, I was just joking this morning! Did your water break? Are you at the hospital? Do you need me to-\"<br>\r\n\"Natalie, relax, nothing's changed,\" Lisa giggled. \"I just wanted to call you and say hi.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Natalie said. \"H-hi.\"<br>\r\n\"But I'm glad you were so prepared to help out,\" Lisa said, rubbing her struggling belly. \"You'll be a great mom.\"<br>\r\nNatalie blushed brightly. \"T-thank you. You too. I, um, I've got to go. There's a baby shower here I should get to.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, no problem,\" Lisa said. \"Did you listen?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course I did,\" Natalie said, quietly. \"I love you.\"<br>\r\n\"I love you too,\" Lisa said, hanging up the phone. Then she wrapped her arms around her belly and looked down at it, seeing the occasional bulge across the smooth surface and wondering whether it was Dalia or Julia or Scott who she was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this will all work out,\" Lisa sighed, smiling.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The smell of bacon, eggs, and pancakes filled the delicate nostrils of Tara, causing her to stir softly in her bed. She reached across the bed, and felt the heavy indent of nothingness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Another night sleeping alone</i> Tara thought, the events of last night quickly coming back to her as her brain woke up as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes bulged and she quickly (or as quick as she could given her circumstances) turned over and pressed her hand to the massive indent next to her, a profound heaviness was here just a little a while ago. Grabbing her bathrobe, (which basically just covered her breasts with her belly sticking out of it like a large skin-colored watermelon) she waddled into the kitchen, following the delicious smell of breakfast to find quite the sight for her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was.. Zavaleta, cooking breakfast....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the nude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning. I take it your rest was peaceful and sound?\" Zavaleta asked, flipping the pancake, completely oblivious that her... birthday suitness was making Tara a little uncomfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh.. I uh..\" Tara tried to talk, but her eyes was just taking in the very, very pregnant 60-something military woman in front of her. Her belly was massive, bumping up against the oven. Her breasts rested on top of her massive heap of belly, the nipples a deep shade of brown, and covered in deep red and purple veins. Tara could see each little hand and foot that went THUMP against the massive pale planet of belly flesh that was here belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara had never seen anything like it before, it was hypnotizing. It was an impossible pregnancy, in both Zavaleta's size, and Zavaleta's age, but not only did Zavaleta look perfectly natural to be pregnant at her age (and somewhat happy), she carried her pregnancy with an unnatural grace. It was like she was barely even pregnant. While a belly like that would ground a normal woman, she moved with a deftness that made it seem like she was only pregnant with one. It was.. incredible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I looked over your pantry and noticed that your breakfast choices did not have the proper caloric intake of a woman pregnant with triplets. So, I left the apartment this morning, and purchased enough necessary groceriers to provide us with proper caloric nutrition during our time together. Don't worry, I paid for it myself. I have plenty of money, but no place to stay. I would find such a situation humorous if it wasn't for the fact that we are just hours away from executing a daring mission with little-to-no prep-time, and failure, I can say, is not an option for us.\" Zavaleta said, putting eggs, bacon, and pancakes, onto a plate and putting it on the small table in Tara's small kitchen. Zavaleta was taking up a lot of room in a small place, yet Tara's apartment didn't seem to notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery ince of Zavaleta's naked body jiggled as she walked, as she placed the food on the table. Zavalata placed one hand into the rather large arch in her back, the other rubbing the vast expanse of her pregnant belly, Zavaleta humming to herself as she felt the kicks and punches of her unborn children prod back in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. uh.. mission?\" Tara asked, taking a seat at the table as Zavaleta poured what appeared to be freshed squeezed orange juice into a glass. <br>\r\n\"Yes. In a few hours, I will be going undercover to initiate Operation: Baby Shower. The safety of you, your children, me, my children, this town, possibly even the world, rests on it's success.\" Zavaleta turned back the stop, her surprisingly toned rear end facing Tara as she cooked up another batch of breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Tara asked, trying not to stare at the massive naked pregnance in her direct eyesight. It wasn't that a sight of another woman naked made her uncomfortable, far from it. It wasn't Zavaleta's age or her massive pregnance that made her uncomfortable either, quite the opposite. Tara admired how a woman in her 60's could be so proud of her body to put it on display, let alone one who was impossibly pregnant with 8 babies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell, it wasn't even the fact that there was a naked woman in the kitchen cooking her breakfast. She's had naked women cook her breakfast before in college, when, as her parents called it \"she went through a phase\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, what made Tara uncomfortable was the fact that Tara had NO IDEA WHY Zavaleta was naked in her kitchen. She leant her clothes last night, it's not like she didn't have anything to wear. Zavaleta didn't even sleep in the nude, so why the hell was cooking in the nude? And Bacon of all things? Nakedness and bacon are two things that do not go very well with each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say that sometime today, your bank, Titan Bank, will be hosting a baby-shower for one of your male employees, who is currently pregnant.\" Zavaleta laid it all out. <br>\r\n\"I plan to use this baby shower, posing undercover as your mysteriously pregnant mother, visiting from out of town, to finally track down, what I believe is a sem-sentiant coin of magic which is causing the strange pregnancies around town. This coin is currently being held as a prize by your bank which is currently a sponsor of this \"Pregnant Bikini Contest\" that has, after some early morning research I did on your laptop, seems to be one of three \"focal\" points of these strange incidents I have tracked down, the other being your bank and the mall. Recon of the mall turned up the connection to your bank, and the bikini contest. I believe the connecting thread of this is somewhere hiding in plain sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce, I infiltrate the bank, I will secure the package and use the bank's computer to find the common thread. Once the package and the thread are in my hands, I can make sure all of us\" Zavaleta said, pointing at her belly for emphasis \"are safe\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all too much for Tara to take in. A week ago she was pregnant single twenty-something with twins on the way and suddenly she's looking down the barrel of triplets and have had her home made into a makeshift command center by some pregnant sixty year old woman whose made her some kind of weird shadow agent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here\" Zavaleta said, walking over to a nondescript brown paper bag and giving it to Tara. \"Inside, you will find a camera-pin which has been synced to download all footage you film ontop a off-site cloud server. I want you to record the baby shower, every detail, every belly, everything. In fact, if you can get everyone's shirts off so I can see bare bellies, would be even better. I had an advanced algorithm program running under the footage capture program to analyze the data in real time and transmit to this smart-watches. If anything abnormal is spotted, it was let us know. I will blend in, playing the part of the poor old pregnant woman, and then, when the opening appears, I will sneak off, secure the package and find the thread. You will wear this ear-piece. It's a whisper piece, allowing you to whisper all the developments to me, and have your cover remain intact. I will be listening on the other end, also monitoring data with the watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara's head was spinning. \"Where did you.. where did you get all this?\" Tara asked, finishing her breakfast. \"I procured this items very early this morning along with the bags of groceries. I had to call in some favors to get people to check out this items for me.. The less questions you ask the better. Anything else?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara felt like this was her only chance. \"Why are you naked?\" <br>\r\n\"The answer is obvious.\" Zavaleta asked, putting her own breakfast plate down, and sitting, her massive pregnant body spilling out from the chair, and making her sit far away from the table. \"My sleeping attire was dirty after purchasing all these items this morning. I did not want to soil the lent maternity clothes so early cooking, so I did so naked.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shopped in your bra and panties?\" Tara asked. <br>\r\n\"Yes. Now, go shower and get dressed. I need you to brief me on everything about your mother and how she would react becoming mysteriously pregnant at her current age. I need her likes, her dislikes, everything. I need to disappear into this role\" Zavaleta said, scarfing down her food with military precision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was going to be a long day. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Faye was happily awoken by the kicking inside her womb, as she'd been for the last few days, although to her, they were months. She laid on her side, her belly pushing the limits of the queen-size mattress in the guest room. Faye wasn't sharing the bed with her husband for...a variety of reasons. Stretching out, Faye scooted herself forward a bit, reaching to her side bureau for the coin sitting there. \"Good morning, my curious friend,\" Faye smiled, feeling the coin's energy pulse out. \"What's the task today?\"<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">They're getting closer...trying to take away your children. Snatch them out of your womb. Get it back from the boy.</span><br>\r\nFaye nodded with a smile. \"Yes, I've been wanting a second try with Jack Jr. for some time now.\"<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">And you must earn the final piece. Win.</span><br>\r\n\"The bikini contest,\" Faye chuckled. \"Yes, I think I have a good shot at that. This belly is irresistible,\" Faye said, sitting up in bed, running her hands all over her curves. Her belly was perfectly smooth and round, her skin glowing with energy, all of it several feet out of her body. \"The only one with a belly to rival mine is Amanda and...she's a little old to out-dance me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coin fell silent and Faye shrugged, pushing herself out of bed and rubbing her rear as she yawned. Faye took off work a while ago to take care of her massive pregnancy. She was lucky to get in her maternity leave before the whole city was struck with pregnancy and her bosses started restricting time off so they could at least have enough people in the office to keep the place running. Gripping the coin in her hand, Faye waddled out the door and down the hallway to one mysterious locked door. Reaching around the frame, Faye got out the hidden key and opened the door, gently walking inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-Faye!\" Charles' moaning voice said from the bed inside. \"Please, you've got to undo this! I don't know what you did to me, but-\"<br>\r\n\"Shh, shh,\" Faye said with a playful smile, walking over and rubbing her husband's gigantic pregnant belly. \"You always wanted a family didn't you? Now we're going to have one that's even bigger.\"<br>\r\n\"Faye, please, this is-\"<br>\r\n\"Don't you get the news in here?\" Faye said, pressing down on Charles' belly. He groaned. Faye's relationship with the coin was quite beneficial. When she used its magic on him, it sensed her thirst for revenge and gave Charles more than one baby. A <u>lot</u> more than one baby. And as Faye pressed down, those many babies pushed down on Charles' bladder. \"Men getting pregnant is very common nowadays. You're a bit of a trend-setter.\"<br>\r\n\"Faye, this is insane! I can't-\"<br>\r\n\"A big family, that's what you always wanted,\" Faye sighed. \"So badly that you went ahead and knocked up some young little thing and then had her stay in our house.\"<br>\r\n\"Faye! Don't you remember the time we used to spend together? How happy we were holding your growing belly together? We can be like that again!\"<br>\r\nFaye took her hand off, smiling and laughing softly, strutting around the bed in all her naked, pregnant glory. \"Yes, and I wish you would have thought of those kinds of memories before you stuck it in that ginger girl. And I don't need you to touch me and make me feel good anymore,\" Faye said, taking a towel from the room's closet. \"I have the neighbor boy now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye locked the master bedroom back up as she strolled toward the bathroom, stopping when she saw Amber in the hallway, standing in an oversized white t-shirt to cover her belly. \"You want to use the shower too, huh?\" Faye said.<br>\r\nAmber hung her head, confrontations with Faye always feeling horrible. \"Yes.\" Amber took another deep breath. \"Thank you for letting me...sleep in your home for the night.\"<br>\r\nFaye smiled sarcastically and shrugged. \"Of course! You didn't have your car with you, it was late, and you're tired. I know how tiring carrying Charles' babies can be.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll wait for you to finish your shower,\" Amber said, starting to turn around.<br>\r\n\"No, no! We have to learn to share this house,\" Faye said, beckoning Amber forward. \"Just wait in the bathroom while I shower and we can switch. That way we can talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, Amber couldn't say no and she followed Faye into the bathroom which was plenty large to fit the two heavily pregnant women inside. Faye stepped into the shower and smiled and preened as she washed herself, Amber taking the occasional glance over.<br>\r\n\"Faye...how old are you again?\"<br>\r\nFaye grinned. \"Mid 40s.\"<br>\r\nAmber shook her head slowly. <i>Then how do you have a body like that, especially while you're pregnant with quadruplets?</i><br>\r\n\"Now Amber, I understand you're entering the pregnant bikini contest,\" Faye said. \"Looking for more sugar daddies?\"<br>\r\n\"No, I am actually trying to win enough money to support these babies on my own, so I don't have to live with you,\" Amber replied. \"Believe it or not, I don't want to live with you and Charles. I just need to do what's best for my children. And if I win, I won't need his support to raise them.\"<br>\r\nFaye chuckled. \"Now noble of you, Amber.\"<br>\r\nAmber rolled her eyes. \"And you're entering as well?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, indeed I am,\" Faye said. \"I have...my own reasons.\"<br>\r\nAmber shrugged and looked around the room, noticing the coin on the bathroom counter. It looked pretty odd. As Amber looked closer at it, she thought it looked similar to some token Jack was carrying around. Amber reached her hand out to the tiny sliver of metal. Faye's wet hand grabbed Amber's just before she picked it up. \"Your turn,\" Faye smiled, nodding her head toward the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Faye dressed herself and waddled into the kitchen, Amber was already sitting there, dressed, eating breakfast, and taping away at her laptop. \"It must be easier to get dressed with a smaller belly,\" Faye remarked.<br>\r\nAmber nodded. \"It must be.\"<br>\r\n\"What's that you're working on?\" Faye said with her back turned, turning on the stove to make her own breakfast.<br>\r\nIt was actually the program Amber had started work on to control the Spyder camera she'd run across. Most of the navigational controls were already accessible by Amber, but now she was uploading the camera's stream and trying to find away to include the city's mapping into the robot's computer. \"Just something for work.\"<br>\r\n\"You're still working? You're not just going to try and drain my husband's remaining money?\" Faye said.<br>\r\nAmber grit her teeth and continued working in silence.<br>\r\n\"No, of course not. You think you can win that contest, can't you? You seem very confident in your beauty. After all, you seem to have made a life out of stealing away other people's husbands.\"<br>\r\n\"At least I don't resort to kissing my neighbor's children,\" Amber said. In no time, Faye was next to Amber, belly pressed against belly.<br>\r\n\"Get something straight, you little brat: this is my home first and foremost and you are only here because I am allowing it. And I am still planning on finding a way to get you kicked out, whether you've got my husbands' bastards or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me! Make her even bigger and more uncomfortable!</span><br>\r\n<i>No, that would just give her more of Charles' children</i>, Faye thought. <i>Besides, I enjoy being the bigger one between us</i>.<br>\r\nAmber gulped. \"Where is Charles, anyway? I haven't seen or heard from him at all in the past few days. He could settle a lot of your issues with me.\"<br>\r\nFaye curled her lips and stood up slowly. \"Charles isn't feeling too well, I told you already.\"<br>\r\n\"Well he must still be able to talk.\"<br>\r\n\"I said. He's. Not. Feeling. Well,\" Faye said, returning to her stove. \"I called Amanda and told her you needed a ride to work. You and her son work in the same place, don't you?\"<br>\r\nAmber bit her lip. \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n\"Well then, better hurry up and get ready to go,\" Faye said. \"The clock is ticking.\"</span></div></div>",

A few seconds later, the door opened and Amber's eyes couldn't help but drift down to Amanda's belly. You'd think that an extended period of exposure to Faye's equally-quadruplet-filled, naked body would have inoculated against bellies of this magnitude. With the epidemic of \"sudden pregnancies\" in the city, Amber had slowly adapted to seeing pregnant men and women all the time. But the same could just not be said about bellies Amanda and Faye's sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amber, hi!\" Amanda said cheerily, one hand on her belly as she slowly waddled out the door, her belly making the journey a good five seconds before the rest of her body. Amber didn't respond at first, squinting and thinking in her head whether Amanda had actually gotten <u>bigger</u> since yesterday's dinner. \"Faye called and said you needed a ride?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber looked up quickly at Amanda's smiling face and nodded. \"Yes, I ended up staying the night at her home after all the lunacy with the hospital and those Health and Human Service goons. They took me right out of my home so my car's still there. I appreciate you driving me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I try to cut down on driving as much as I can,\" Amanda smiled softly, rubbing her belly in a larger arc. \"Jack's going to take the four of us for the first leg of our carpool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber tensed up, remembering that she'd need to travel with Jack again, before pausing. \"Four of us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got it out just in time for Jack and Jessica to walk out the door, the two exchanging a quick, blushing smile as Jessica bit her lip and tightened her grip on Jack's hand. As soon as they saw Amber, Jack froze, his hand slipping out of Jessica's grasp. \"H-hi, Amber.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, it looks bad if the manager's late,\" Amber said, turning around gracefully and waddling to the family's car. Jack got in the driver's seat, Jessica as the pregnant woman with the smallest belly got in beside him, and Amanda and Amber both shared the back, Jack having to move his seat forward considerably to accommodate Amanda and his four little siblings inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack tried to turn on the radio as quickly as he could but Jessica seemed intent on keeping it off, turning back and smiling at the other passengers who were carrying passengers of their own. \"Amber, are you going to enter the pregnant bikini contest too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber smiled softly and nodded. \"Yes, I want to try and get some money to support these two,\" she said, poking her belly softly. \"Besides, I think I look pretty good pregnant and I might as well have some fun with this curvy body for the few weeks I still have it. I don't think I'll be having any more kids for a while after this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twins too?\" Jessica said, excitement raising in her voice. Jack looked over at Jessica nervously, wondering how much she knew about his relationship with Amber. She seemed to get over Faye, but it took some work. Who knows how she might take his near-kiss with his boss? He was at least happy at how Jessica was acting happier about her pregnancy. They may really not be able to reserve this process, so at least Jessica was making the best of things, or at least trying. \"Same for me. And whoever wins, I'm sure we can all work to raise our kids together. We'll all be new moms at around the same time, it seems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda nodded and smiled softly. \"Well, these four grow so quickly, I might give birth any day now,\" Amanda sighed. \"I hope I can make it to the contest tomorrow. I've been practicing my dancing and I think it'll be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fun?\" Amber said, with a curious smile. \"I admire your courage, going out in a contest like this at...your age.\" Amber's morning with Faye had left her \"shade-throwing\" abilities fully engaged and she was having trouble lowering those shields.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda chuckled and ran her hands up and down her hugeness aggressively. \"That's part of the reason I want to do this. Expel some myths and maybe inspire some other older women. You know, I've felt better during this pregnancy than I've felt in decades.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you'll try and get pregnant again after this litter,\" Jessica giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even joke about that,\" Jack muttered, shaking his head as he pulled into the tech store. \"Alright, let's go Amber. Mom, Jessica, you both know what you're doing from here out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we've got it planned out,\" Amanda nodded. \"Jessica will come with me to my work, where there's a big office baby shower. We both talked and thought it would be a nice chance for her to get that kind of celebration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does sound nice,\" Jack smiled at Jessica, who blushed and stuck her tongue out at him quickly. \"I can visit around my lunch break. That's fine, right Amber?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine to me,\" Amber said, stretching out and pulling her work shirt down to cover her belly. \"I might join you, if that's okay. I haven't...been to a baby shower either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, then you <b>definitely</b> have to come!\" Amanda grinned, clasping her hands together. \"Alright, have a good day at work you too. Love you, Jack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you too, Mom,\" Jack smiled weakly and nodded, walking into work with Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some struggling to get out of the car and walk around with a seven-month, twin-filled pregnant belly, Jessica got into the driver's seat and adjusted things so her belly wouldn't get too in the way and drove off to Titan Bank, following Amanda's instructions. During the trip and a lull in the dull conversation, Amanda brought up a sensitive subject. \"Jessica...does your belly grow strangely after each night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica hesitated before answering. \"Yes,\" she said. \"I think it's an effect of the coin...I mean, the 'sudden pregnancy disease' that's going around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda nodded and rubbed her belly, thinking. \"So, you think my pregnancy is a result of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, if it's growing in that kind of odd way...I think so,\" Jessica said. \"I know that my pregnancy is progressing that way and it was definitely caused by the disease.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely? You mean you didn't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica shook her head. \"Not for a long time. Until Jack, but I was already definitely pregnant by that point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda smiled warmly at Jessica's words before rubbing her own belly. \"So these children aren't ones created by me and my husband,\" she sighed. \"Great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they are,\" Jessica said quickly. \"We don't understand this disease yet. It could have been created out of the love you both share or it affected a previously existing pregnancy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Amanda smiled. \"You know, I think it's incredible that you and Jack are staying together even as you're pregnant. When he was little, he had a...little thing for pregnancy, but he seems to have grown out of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Geez, I thought mothers were supposed to be perceptive</i>, Jessica laughed to herself. \"It seems so.\" Jessica paused and looked at Amanda in the rear view mirror. \"Thank you for being so...accepting of me, Mrs. Dale,\" she said. \"My parents didn't take the news nearly as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's scary having your child suddenly become a parent. It means they're growing up and aren't your little babies anymore,\" Amanda sighed. \"And it's not just your parents. Believe me, when I thought Jack had gotten you pregnant, I gave him an earful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica laughed, feeling her babies kick in response. \"Well I would have like to see that. He gets so bashful when I tease him.\" Amanda's own laughs settled somewhat, her face turning red. Hearing about Jack's girlfriend and...mother of his adopted children talk about their relationship was something she would need to get used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two pulled into the parking lot at Titan Bank, the parking lot surprisingly full. Most of the staff was walking in and Amanda took the time to point people out to Jessica. After all, they'd be the people she'd be sharing her first baby shower with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the technical 'focus' of the shower, my boss. Having a pregnant man for a boss took some getting used to, but he's very excited. What's odd is that he got pregnant before all this 'sudden pregnancy business started......that's Ian, Jack's friend. He's not a particularly good employee and used to gawk at our female employees more than we'd like. I'm really not sure why we keep him around. He's lucky, I guess.....and there are some other women you'll meet, some pregnant and joining in, some not.....oh, and that's Tara. You've met her before, I think. She's sharp and so funny. I think she'll run this place one day, and that's...that's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,\" Jessica gasped as Zavaleta followed behind Tara. For once in the last week since Jessica and Amanda found out they were pregnant with multiples, they felt downright petite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will be a baby shower to remember,\" Amanda chuckled, mouth still agape as she stepped out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jack will have an absolute heart attack when he sees this woman's belly</i>, Jessica thought to herself. <i>This will be hilarious</i>.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack filled out his timecard in the back before walking behind the counter, with Amber already there, one hand beneath her belly, her face mischievously bemused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...we're good?\" Jack said hesitantly, looking over at Amber. Amber spread her lips out in a wider grin, turning softly, resting one elbow on the counter, her belly plainly sticking out and center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we're 'good,' Jack,\" Amber said. \"It's been a weird time for us. For the whole city, really.\" She sighed and leaned in. \"I know you have someone else in your life who you care about and I find the idea that Faye pulled some sort of bullshit on you <u>very</u> believable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack chuckled and blushed. As much as he'd made things up with Jessica, he didn't think he'd be able to get the sight of Faye's heavily pregnant, flirtatious body out of his head anytime soon. \"Thanks. And I kind of...got a sense of what's going on between you and Faye and I'm really sorry. If you ever want to talk about, you know, anything, let me know. We're still friends, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Amber's turn to blush. \"When did you get so mature?\" she muttered, reaching under the counter to get out a clipboard with some points of store info. \"So Jack, as I'm sure you can tell, I'm going to have to take maternity leave pretty soon. So while that's going on, you will be the store's interim manager.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack froze. \"Oh...Amber, I don't know if that's appropriate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber shook her head. \"I've had months to think this over. Nearly nine, to be exact. You do your work efficiently, you've brought up ideas and changes that have paid off, and you're smart. I would have picked you regardless of what happened in the last few days.\" Amber turned her lips up in a laughing scowl. \"But just to be on the safe side, if you ever tell anyone about what I've confided in you, I'll get Faye, your mom, and every other big preggo I can find and we'll all crush you to death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack shuddered. \"That's...specific.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber cackled and turned back to her work. \"Well, I'm a big fan of horror movies. Maybe you'd like to...watch some with me some time?\" She paused and turned back with an honest smile. \"Jessica can join us if she wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was shocked by the uncharacteristic kindness from Amber. Did the ghosts from A Christmas Carol visit her last night or something. \"Thanks Amber. I'd like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door's bell rang and Jack and Amber turned to see their first customer of the day. \"Jack! Good, I found you. Jessica wasn't at work,\" Mariah said, running one hand under her belly to support it as she hurried in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to have a way of attracting women to you,\" Amber cooed meanly, back to her old self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mariah? What's going on now? How did you even know I work here?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember when you got kidnapped?\" Ms. Smart said, rolling her eyes as she and Ms. Apple waddled inside, both still insisting in wearing high-class designer outfits despite their coin-induced full-term pregnancies. \"We've always known where you live and work, kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make that a certain type of women,\" Amber said, raising her eyebrows. \"Lucky that you like this sort of thing,\" Amber said, moving her hand to her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amber, please,\" Jack said, starting to get a cold sweat. If those two were here, then things can't be good. \"This is important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'd be quiet and listen up, because this concerns you,\" Ms. Apple said, giving Amber's belly a look. Amber looked at the fellow red-head with a shocked, slightly infuriated look before Ms. Smart shook her head, putting her hand in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do any kind of covert work and you just have to work in movie lines,\" she said. \"Ma'am, actually, could you go into the back? This is a very private conversation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber looked and Jack who just shrugged awkwardly. \"Well there goes that maturity,\" Amber scoffed, giving the rest of the room a disapproving look. \"You've got 10 minutes. I'm still the manager, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right,\" Jack said, turning to Mariah and her new companions frantically when Amber left. \"What's going on? Why are you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know how to stop all of this; how to reverse the coin's magic,\" Mariah said. \"And we've got the pieces all together. We just have to collect them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...that's great!\" Jack said with a big smile. \"So what do we need to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first, we need to get the other coins,\" Ms. Apple sighed. \"We think there's just two others. One's the prize for the pregnant bikini contest-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-what a coincedence, huh?\" Ms. Smart laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-right. And the other one is with that woman who took the book. But Mariah said you know who it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack nodded nervously. \"Jessica got a text from Mariah and we've figured it out. It's my neighbor, Faye.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your neighbor?\" Ms. Apple said. \"Well that's perfect. We can get it from her anytime we want tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, it's a little more complicated than that,\" Jack said. \"She and me, we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say no more,\" Mariah smiled, blushing. \"I can fill them in later. But the third coin...one of us just needs to win the contest, don't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack nodded, sighing. \"So we have to do all this on the last possible day. I don't like that risk.\" Jack nodded along to himself before realizing something. \"Wait a minute! My mom's bank is one of the sponsors for the contest and they're keeping most of the prizes together! The coin might be at her bank!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bank's going to be pretty hard to get into,\" Ms. Smart said. \"We have resources but they're mostly just for surveillance and travel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, it'll work out. There's a big baby shower there today. Practically anyone who's pregnant is invited,\" Jack said. \"We'll be able to look around and no one will suspect a thing! Heck, with my mom there, her belly will take up most of the office's attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most people aren't as fixated on pregnant bellies as you appear to be,\" Ms. Apple said, crossing her arms near her belly, giving Jack a knowing look, at which point Jack realized he'd been gawking at her bump for the last minute or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that should still work,\" Ms. Smart added. \"And even if it isn't there, we can get it at the contest. Mariah, work on a plan with Jack to figure out how to get the coin and book from this Faye woman. You're friends, you'll work well together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh,\" Mariah said as the two pregnant members of the anti-coin patrol headed out. \"What are you both doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Practicing for the contest, of course,\" Ms. Smart said. \"We've got to cover all our bases. It wouldn't hurt if you came up with a dance routine too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah crossed her arms anxiously as they left, turning back to Jack. \"S-so...I'll meet you at this baby shower. Jessica will be there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Jack nodded. \"It's Titan Bank. I'll text you when I'm heading out.\" Mariah and Jack shared numbers when she thanked him and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"11 minutes,\" Amber said, leaning against the counter when they left. \"So, what did I miss? Are you going to have four different child support payments to make?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack rolled his eyes. \"Geez, one minute I'm a weird nerd who you say can't get any girlfriends, and the next I'm supposed to be getting women pregnant all over town?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're the cause of this 'mysterious pregnancy disease,' you stud,\" Amber cackled, putting a piece of gum in her mouth. \"Now c'mon Strong Hands, let's do some real work.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Not much work was being done at Titan Bank, as employees were gathered around the snack table near the conference room, smiling at chatting. Originally the idea was to keep the food and drinks inside the room, but given how big some of the employees had gotten, the baby shower's organizers thought it might not be a great idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's lucky how so many people got pregnant at the same time,\" Margaret, one of the office's cheerier employees, a woman in her mid-30s with frizzy blonde hair, said to Amanda, taking a sip of the fruit punch. Margaret took charge of most of the bank's parties and Ryan's baby shower was no different. \"We can knock out a lot of celebrations at once. Not that it would be any problem if you wanted to have some more kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda laughed and rolled her eyes, patting her enormous, quadruplet-filled belly. She may not have been able to know it precisely, but she was eight months pregnant with Jack's brothers and sisters. A few days ago, the doctor informed her she was three or four months pregnant, but Amanda could tell (and feel, thanks to all this kicking and moving) that that was not the case. \"I don't think I'll be having any more children.\" The words were bitter-sweet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile finding herself surprisingly pregnant with four babies in her mid-50s, Amanda realized just how much she missed being pregnant the first time around. The heaviness, the smooth skin, the maternal energy, the feeling of life growing inside her. And having a much larger belly was thrilling in its own right. Of course, it had its downsides, and practically, Amanda knew she wouldn't be able to do this again. She wanted to savor as much of this last pregnancy as she could, but as quickly as it was progressing, she wasn't sure how long she would be able to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could understand that,\" Margaret laughed, running her hand on top of Amanda's gigantic bulge. \"You're carrying more kids than most people have in a lifetime. Personally, I'm fine never having any kids.\" Little did Margaret know that, thanks to reckless coin-flipping, she was currently pregnant with her first child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara waddled over, getting a cup of punch from the bowl, and stood next to Amanda. Margaret smiled and removed her hand from Amanda's belly. \"Well, I'd better let the two most pregnant women in the world chat. Yolanda, let me help you decorate the cake.\" She left Tara and Amanda to turn, rubbing their bellies slowly as they talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you feeling?\" Tara asked, looking down at Amanda's belly. \"I imagine getting close to the big day is kind of nerve-wracking with four babies on the way.\" Tara patted her own swelling belly nervously. \"I know I'm scared with just three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll do fine,\" Amanda smiled. \"And I'm nervous and anxious, sure, but any mother is. Just ask yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right,\" Tara blushed. \"My mother.\" Right on cue, the room got quiet as the planet-sized belly of Nicole Zavaleta bounded through the room, pushing a few people away as she came up to Tara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daughter,\" Zavaleta said, most of her belly plainly showing, \"I must talk with you about our family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing,\" Tara said, seeing all of the shocked looks clearly painted on people's faces. \"A-and just 'Tara' is fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went to the back of the office, talking quietly. \"I don't seem to be able to collect much information,\" Zavaleta said. \"I can't talk with these people without force. I will begin interrogating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Tara said, making a few people turn their heads. \"No, we can make them more conversational. You're just...intimidating. And you're not doing a very good job impersonating my mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Intimidating?\" Zavaleta said, resting one hand on her mammoth belly. \"However do you mean? I'm using perfect blending techniques.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just it. You're acting like the super spy that you are. Sometimes you blend in so well people forget you're here, then your impossibly big belly scares them again,\" Tara said, looking her over. The limited clothing selections the maternity clothing store had for Zavaleta left a very tight, revealing outfit. Even in her 60s, with her intense physical training and conditioning, compounded with the intense pregnancy, Zavaleta cut a very attractive, voluptuous figure and it was not very concealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can get all of the information I need from the servers, but there is still some detail missing,\" Zavaleta said, stroking her chin, mostly ignoring Tara's advice. \"How did the coin come into their possession in the first place? Data from the PEAR center in the hospital shows that both you and Amanda Dale had unusually high readings, usually associated with more exposure to the coin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're talking about that coin again,\" Tara said. \"It's just a dumb promotional item for the contest tonight, but I don't know who's idea it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the \"mother/daughter\" pair chatted, Jessica walked over to Amanda, a paper plate of snacks in her hand. \"Thanks for inviting me, Mrs. Dale. This is pretty fun so far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda smiled. \"I'm glad you're enjoying it. Are a lot of strangers feeling your belly?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled. \"Yeah, but it's not as bad here as I expected. Want to feel too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda's smile grew as she reached down to Jessica's middle. For better or for worse, these were going to be her grandchildren if she and Jack stuck it out. \"They don't kick much, do they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now,\" Jessica said, looking down at Amanda's hand on her seven-month-with-twins belly. \"But sometimes it's like there's aliens inside me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda chuckled. \"I know that feeling,\" she said, jutting out her belly for emphasis. \"Have you had a chance to meet the future parent this baby shower is technically for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan?\" Jessica smiled. \"He's so busy showing off ultrasound photos and pictures of the nursery he said he designed himself that I've barely had a chance to say hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure he'll give a speech soon,\" she said, looking over at Tara and Zavaleta talking. \"So...did you see Tara's mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica nodded, biting her lip to keep her grin from getting too obvious. \"Hard not to. I like being pregnant but...I don't know if I'd want to be <u>that</u> pregnant. Especially for my first time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean,\" Amanda said. \"But she makes it look so easy. You can almost still see the impression of her abs on her belly. And look at the size of those arms...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey clammed up quickly as the two waddled back, Zavaleta's cold demeanor switched to a gentler smile, focusing on her future children to keep her sunny. \"So, Tara tells me you're having a pregnancy-related competition soon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're contributing some funding to get our name out there,\" Yolanda said, walking over with Ryan. \"But yes, it's a pregnant bikini contest. Tara, you're entering, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara nodded with a grin, stroking her belly. \"Yes, and so are Amanda and...Jessica, right? I remember you from Jack giving me a ride after I had my first check-up with the triplets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>An event related to her first pregnancy growth-spurt?</i> Zavaleta noted, looking between them. <i>This could be a clue</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, I'm entering,\" Jessica beamed, rubbing her belly. \"And I've been practicing like crazy too. Mrs. Azem, are you entering? You could really turn some heads with a belly your size.\" <i>Jack's in particular</i>, she thought, <i>Although I wouldn't mind seeing what someone that pregnant looks like in a bikini either</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I came to town a bit late for that,\" Zavaleta said, rubbing her swollen middle. \"I'll just cheer on my daughter. But what sort of contributions are you giving?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cash prizes, some novelty gifts,\" Ryan said. \"I put Ian in charge of all that, so it's a miracle it hasn't all fallen apart yet. And, of course, he picked today to take the day off.\" He shook his head. \"Pregnancy always makes immature people uncomfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe my son spends so much time with him,\" Amanda laughed, shaking her head. \"Jessica, that's going to be torture for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Another connection</i>? Zavaleta thought. <i>I'll have to pay attention for this...Jack</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie walked back into the office, hanging up her cellphone after checking in with Lisa. As she did, two more people came in behind her. \"Hold the door?\" Amber said, smiling to Natalie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Natalie said, blushing a little. <i>I hope she's at the bikini contest. Lisa would knock her out of the water, though</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Mom. Hi Jessi-\" Jack started to say, seeing Zavaleta and freezing in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey kid,\" Amber smiled, elbowing him in the back. \"They can all see you gawking.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica chuckled and gave Jack a kiss on the cheek before taking him by the hand and walking him inside. \"You're not going to spend my entire baby show staring at another woman, are you?\"<br>\r\nJack laughed nervously back. \"I-I mean, can you stop looking at her?\"<br>\r\n\"Good point,\" Jessica smiled, getting some more snacks as Amber turned away, still finding the sight of Jack with another woman hard to get used to. Natalie was right beside her, a plastic cup of soda in her hand. \"Hi there,\" Amber smiled at her. Natalie smiled back a little too warmly. If Lisa was any example, Natalie was attracted to strong, confident women. \"I'll bet you didn't expect so many bellies at work today, huh?\"<br>\r\nNatalie shrugged. She couldn't exactly reveal that her girlfriend was pregnant with triplets, but she still went along with Amber. \"Not exactly, but I don't mind it. Pregnant women have an amazing kind of energy around them. Well...I should say pregnant people.\" Natalie watched Ryan walk past them, still not used to the whole \"pregnant man\" thing.<br>\r\n\"I've noticed people treating me a little differently since I ballooned up,\" Amber said, patting and rubbing her belly, which Natalie watched intently, \"but I'm still ready for it to be over with, you know?\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I should have considered how you felt,\" Natalie said.<br>\r\nAmber smiled. \"Hey, it's fine. I like being pregnant. But if you want to make it up to me, help me load of a plate of snacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you could make it, honey,\" Amanda said to her son as he got some food, attempting to eat some, only to be disarmed by Jessica's puppy-dog eyes and giving the plate to her. \"You know plenty of people here at the bank and it's nice to have these baby showers together.\"<br>\r\n\"It's too bad Mr. Dale couldn't be here,\" Jessica said with a mouthful of sausage rolls.<br>\r\n\"Oh, we had our own private baby shower,\" Amanda grinned.<br>\r\n\"Alright, time to go somewhere else,\" Jack said, taking Jessica by the hand and walking to another part of the bank as Amanda laughed and started chatting with Ryan. Tara met Jack and smiled, turning to both of them.<br>\r\n\"Good to see you again, Jack. Although the last time you were here, I found out I had a few more babies hiding in here,\" Tara laughed, running her hands over her belly.<br>\r\n\"Well, hopefully that won't happen again,\" Jack laughed back. <br>\r\n\"Might give you an edge in the bikini contest, though,\" Jessica chuckled. \"I'm going to look petite on stage with Mrs. Dale on stage.\"<br>\r\nTara nodded, looking over at Amanda. \"I don't know how she does it. Getting that big that quickly, when I've been struggling with these three for nine months now.\" Out of the corner of her eye, Tara saw Zavaleta closing in. Tara had begun to adjust to the stealthy movements of the 60 year old octomom. \"S-so, Jack, have you met my mother yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-your mom?\" Jack struggled to get out as Zavaleta appeared beside him, belly front and center. \"N-no, hi. I'm Jack Dale, the son of one of Tara's coworkers.\"<br>\r\n<i>So this is that \"Jack\" suspect.</i> \"Hello, my name is Nicole. You and my daughter seem to know each other well.\"<br>\r\n\"A little, I guess,\" Jack smiled, turning back to Tara. \"I helped her out a few days ago with taking her to and from the hospital.\"<br>\r\n\"Pregnant women just seem to follow you wherever you go,\" Zavaleta said slowly, looking intensely into his eyes.<br>\r\n\"W-well, this is happening all over town,\" Jack tried to laugh. \"I'm sure I'm not the only one. Were you also...um...affected?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I am not too concerned,\" Zavaleta said, stroking her belly slowly, \"I've always wanted to be a mother...to multiple children at once.\" A near slip-up. Zavaleta resolved to punish herself with 1000 squats at night.<br>\r\n\"G-good to hear,\" Jack said, trying to turn away as he felt Jessica staring daggers at him when Zavaleta grabbed his arm.<br>\r\n\"I was wondering...will you be attending the contest my daughter is in?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, my...girlfriend, Jessica, will be in it too,\" Jack said, motioning to Jessica, who smiled and waved. \"And my mom too, so I'm a little torn between who to support.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mother and girlfriend both pregnant? And the people who work at his mother's business?</i> \"Yes, it's so fun to have people in the same office competing against one another. I've always supported competition and my children will learn to value it too. Jessica, are any of your coworkers entering as well?\"<br>\r\n\"One of my friends, yes,\" Jessica replied. Zavaleta smiled sweetly, hiding her smile at confirming her hypothesis. <i>It's him. Somehow, it's him.</i><br>\r\n\"Well this all sounds very nice. Good luck to you, Tara, but I will be hoping for the best from your friends as well. I will leave now, but I will see you later tonight.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, have a good day, Mom,\" Tara said, confused why Zavaleta wanted to go now. \"Be careful.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not the one who needs to be careful,\" Zavaleta said with a smirk, her mind reverting to her military days in the field. \"I mean...thank you, dear.\"<br>\r\nJack couldn't keep his eyes off of Zavaleta's belly. She was full-term with octuplets and took up nearly four times her normal body thanks to her big belly. He considered taking out the coin and making her even bigger, but decided against it. The fact that the coin wasn't calling to him right now with all of these not-yet pregnant people around was nothing short of a miracle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zavaleta left, Amber got out her phone and saw a notification from the Spyder camera she reprogrammed. She managed to design an application for her smart phone that would let her remotely control and view whatever the camera was seeing. And since she had Jack and Jessica in her sights right now, she figured she might as well track Zavaleta now. She was as taken aback by her size as everyone else and she found her behavior very...suspicious. She reminded her of those goons that examined her at the city hospital.<br>\r\n\"Everything good?\" Natalie asked, holding Amber's plate and cup of water while Amber looked at her phone.<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you very much,\" Amber purred, aware of the affect she was having over Natalie. Unfortunately for her, Amber experimented with women already and didn't quite like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright everyone,\" Margaret said at the front of the office. \"We're going to open presents now. Ryan, you're the dad-to-be of honor, but we know you don't mind us having gifts for our other expectant employees as well.\"<br>\r\n\"Of course not,\" Ryan smiled. \"As long as I get the first slice of cake.\" The room laughed as Yolanda handed Ryan a paper bag with tissue paper sticking out of it. Inside was a pair of baby clothes, all with a suit print on them that said \"Lil Businessman.\" Ryan chuckled, hugging Yolanda in reply.<br>\r\n\"I love it, thank you,\" he said. \"Although I'm not sure that's the path he'll want to take. I don't see how he can kick this much and not be an athlete.\"<br>\r\n\"You'd be surprised,\" Amanda laughed as Yolanda handed her a gift. Amanda opened her bag up, finding four baby onsies, all red with \"Thing 1,\" \"Thing 2,\" and even a \"Thing 3 &amp; 4\" included. \"Aw, this is sweet.\"<br>\r\n\"It wasn't easy to get the same design with the extra numbers, but that Baby Universe has everything,\" Yolanda smiled, getting Tara's gift.<br>\r\nTara opened it up, finding three baby clothes designed like ballet outfits. \"You knew I loved dancing?\" Tara said.<br>\r\n\"I did my research,\" Yolanda smiled. \"There weren't any good clothes that showed dancing other than these tutus and nothing for belly dancing. I know that's what you prefer.\"<br>\r\n\"That's what I'll be doing tomorrow night,\" Tara smiled, making Jack gulp at the thought of pregnant-with-triplets belly dancing, especially from someone already as gorgeous as Tara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room went back to chatting as the cake came out. \"Sorry there's nothing for you,\" Amanda said to Jessica.<br>\r\n\"I've got my present,\" Jessica smiled, holding onto Jack's arm and kissing him on the neck. \"And Mrs. Dale, you've been so much kinder than I could have expected. Nicer than my parents, for sure...\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you getting gloomy?\" Amber smiled, walking up behind the couple, hands on her belly. \"I came here to get away from my troubles.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, we can chat more in private,\" Amanda smiled. \"Jack, Jessica, you two can go now if you want. Nothing much else happens in a baby shower.\"<br>\r\n\"This was already perfect,\" Jessica grinned, hugging Amanda as tightly as she could, bellies pressing together. \"But yeah, Jack, let's head out.\"<br>\r\n\"Good idea,\" Jack thought, the two nodding silently. While this was all fun, they had to work on making sure they got the coin and book back and trying to prevent any of these pregnancies from happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Zavaleta had already stripped out of her maternity clothes and was back in her stealth outfit, forcing another layer around her belly to conceal it better as she prepared to follow Jack and see what she could learn.</span></div></div>",

We'll get there soon,\" Jessica said, resting one hand on her own belly. \"Are you sure you aren't trying to stop this whole 'coin' fiasco because of...this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack didn't say anything as he thought, making the turns the phone told him too. \"You know I love you and I said I want a family with you. But let's do it on our own terms, not when some magic coin says you have to get pregnant.\"<br>\r\nJessica didn't stop stroking her maternal bulge. \"But when would our 'own terms' be? What if we do fix all this but then I get pregnant again by accident? Are you going to force me to get an abortion?\"<br>\r\n\"Jessica, you know that's different. Anything we do, we do together.\" Jack paused again. \"Are you saying you <i>want</i> to keep this magic pregnancy?\"<br>\r\nJessica sighed as she rubbed her belly. \"If I have the choice, I want to have a baby with you, not a coin and some ancient demon.\"<br>\r\nJack turned and gave Jessica a little smile. \"That's how I feel too. And if you have concerns or fears again...tell me. I want to talk through it with you.\" Jack reached down and turned on the radio as they drove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yyyyou're listening to 101.9 The Edge!\" Sandwich's now-familiar voice said over the air as Jack and Jessica continued driving. \"It's busy down here at the station as we get ready for the 101.9 Pregnant Bikini Contest, down at Dino's Bar and Grill tomorrow night! This is proving to be our biggest one yet, right Oven?\"<br>\r\n\"Thhhhhat's right, Sandwich!\" Oven replied, his peppy radio voice camouflaging his rotten attitude. \"Over 50 women are participating in this year's contest, and for the first time, we've got multiple women entering who are carrying triplets or more! Including our own, Miss Lisa!\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks fellas,\" Lisa said sweetly. \"That's right: I'm pregnant with triplets and you'll be able to see me, in a bikini, tomorrow night.\"<br>\r\n\"I know a lot of our listeners have wanted to see you in a bikini, but I doubt many also wanted the pregnant part included,\" Oven said.<br>\r\nJessica elbowed Jack in the car. \"They don't know their listeners very well.\" Jack grinned and elbowed her back. \"Ouch, I can't believe you nudged a pregnant woman!\"<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you nudged me while I'm driving,\" Jack laughed, turning the radio volume up.<br>\r\n\"Well, Oven, tomorrow night, you, and our other skeptical listeners, are going to be surprised just how good-looking pregnant women can be,\" Lisa said.<br>\r\n\"Alright you two, break it up,\" Sandwich laughed. \"Lisa, why don't you give the people some more details on tomorrow night's event, for those who haven't already been on our website?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure thing. Well, all of our moms-to-be, including yours truly, will start off walking on stage, in our bikinis, answering some questions. Then, we'll all have to show a talent of some sort, and then the most exciting portion: a dance competition. If you've never seen pregnant women twerk or pole dance, you'll want to stop by tomorrow night.\"<br>\r\n\"And what kind of dance will you be doing, Lisa?\" Sandwich said with a grin.<br>\r\n\"You'll have to wait and see tomorrow,\" Lisa said with a wink. \"Thanks to the large outpouring of attention this year's Pregnant Bikini Contest has gotten and the many generous sponsors, the top prize is now $20,000, plus some assorted gifts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"$20,000?\" Jessica said, turning to Jack. \"That's...that's real money. If this...these babies really come, that's money we'd need.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, good thing you're a shoe-in to win,\" Jack said, reaching over and giving Jessica a kiss on the cheek as they pulled into the parking lot as Jessica's GPS told them they were at the right place. \"Wait a minute...this place looks familiar.\"<br>\r\n\"Does it have anything to do with that time you were kidnapped?\" Jessica said, raising an eyebrow. \"Mariah said she's been plotting with some weirdos.\"<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Jack gulped, the doors of the building opening up, with Ms. Apple and Ms. Smart walking toward the car. \"Great memories at this place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Jack and Jessica were sitting on a ratty sofa with Mariah as Ms. Apple and Ms. Smart brought out a whiteboard, covered in writings, newspaper clippings, and photographs. Behind them were the intimidating Mr. Ox and Mr. Quick.<br>\r\n\"I've been over it a dozen times in my head,\" Mariah said. \"The answer has to be getting the three coins together.\"<br>\r\n\"Are we sure it's just three?\" Jack said, looking between everyone gathered there.<br>\r\n\"I plotted it out,\" Mariah said, pointing to the white board. \"With the rate and density of pregnancies, it only makes sense if there's three coins. You have yours and those episodes are...accounted for. Then there's the woman who did this to me,\" she said, patting her own twin-filled belly, \"and her location has been too static for these all to be here. That means one more coin.\"<br>\r\n\"Which is the prize for winning the pregnant bikini contest tomorrow,\" Ms. Smart said, crossing her arms.<br>\r\n\"Some sort of sick joke,\" Mr. Quick scoffed.<br>\r\n\"So we still need to get the book and the other coin from Faye, my neighbor,\" Jack said. \"But I get the feeling she knows we're after her. Or knows that someone's after her.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll bet,\" Ms. Apple said, tossing her hair back as she looked at the board. Her cleavage was even more prominent than it was when Jack first saw her and her belly size was far larger than Jessica's. Jessica saw Jack looking Ms. Apple over and gave him a much sharper elbowing than she'd done in the car. \"And we're not the only ones after her, I'm guessing.\"<br>\r\n\"You mean...those weird government people who shut the city down?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n\"We've had a few run-ins with PEAR before,\" Mr. Ox said. \"But never like this before.\"<br>\r\n\"And worst of all, their best agent is in town,\" Ms. Smart said, plastering Zavaleta's photo on the board.<br>\r\nJack and Jessica looked at each other in shock. \"Oh...oh no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZavaleta was already canvasing the city, huffing and puffing as she ran from street corner to street corner, eyes looking for the PEAR \"Spyder\" cameras. Running was much harder, thanks to her octuplets, but she was still moving at nearly Olympic-level speeds. \"Those two...no doubt they left  to some secret meeting place. But if I go there, Riker will know where they are too...\"<br>\r\nAs Zavalta tried to get a plan together, she spied two familiar passengers in a car that passed by her. Amanda and Amber. <br>\r\n\"Next best thing,\" Zavaleta said, running until Amber's car was out of sight. She turned and saw a taxi about to pull out of its parking spot. Zavaleta put her hand on the front of the car, stopping its movement.<br>\r\n\"Jesus lady, what the hell kind of strength do you...\" the cab driver said, his question trailing off as he saw the size of Zavaleta.<br>\r\n\"I need you to follow a car, but be stealthy about it,\" she said, handing him a wad of cash. \"I will tell you exactly how fast to drive and where to go, understand?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure, but lady, I've followed people before,\" the driver said, letting Zavaleta in.<br>\r\n\"I'm sure,\" Zavaleta scoffed. \"Now move these seats forward and step on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside their car, Amanda and Amber continued their talk, getting more intimate since leaving the baby shower. The conversation had long shifted to who's babies were growing inside Amber's womb.<br>\r\n\"It's hard, because Faye is my friend and she's been my friend for decades, but...I don't want her talking to you the way she has been,\" Amanda said.<br>\r\n\"I feel like she's more upset with me than her ass of a husband,\" Amber said. \"This is really his fault.\"<br>\r\n\"I agree,\" Amanda said. \"I think he's an incredible idiot for what he did.\" She let out a long sigh. \"All this stress is making the babies kick. And not in a cute way.\"<br>\r\n\"Need to pull over?\" Amber said, taking a right turn. \"My apartment is right in this neighborhood. You can use my bathroom.\"<br>\r\nAmanda laughed with a bit of a blush. \"You can read a pregnant woman's expression pretty well.\" <br>\r\nOnce at Amber's, she helped Amanda upstairs, the tiny staircase not helpful with Amanda's eight-month, quadruplet belly. \"Down the hall on the left.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amanda relieved herself, Amber snuck into the next room, a remodeled closet for her electronics and other computer pieces, and looked over the master footage from the stolen Spyder camera she was using. \"Now where to have you go next?\" Amber thought to herself. The Spyder was currently in stasis on a city intersection, camera still on. As it captured footage, Amber saw the local news van park near it, with Mia Vasquez walking out, stretching her own heavily pregnant body. \"Well, if I'm going to win $20,000 for my babies...I better get a leg up on the competition,\" Amber grinned, re-activating her Spyder and sending it into Mia's van. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"The solution's simple,\" Mr. Quick said, walking around the couch to look passively at the whiteboard. \"Jack just has to go to this woman's house and get the coin and book back. You know her, don't you?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we know each other,\" Jack said nervously. \"A little...too well.\"<br>\r\n\"Perfect, then everything's settled,\" Mr. Quick said. Ms. Apple and Ms. Smart were shaking their heads and rolling their eyes.<br>\r\n\"You'd think getting pregnant would make you understand women more,\" Ms. Smart said. \"Clearly your relationship with this Jones woman is messy, but we can still use that.\"<br>\r\n\"A bait-and-switch?\" Mariah said, taking a few quick notes on the board.<br>\r\n\"Exactly. She's already on the defensive, so you just need to build up her confidence and trust in you. But while she's focused on you and trying to figure out if you'll take the coin back, Jessica and Mariah, you'll both break into her house and take the coin and book yourselves.\"<br>\r\n\"H-how do you propose I 'build up her confidence?'\" Jack asked, mind flashing back to his previous intimate encounter with Faye. Her open robe, her eager kisses, her enormous belly. A belly that would be even bigger today than it was then.<br>\r\n\"You're a romantic guy,\" Ms. Smart chuckled. \"Take her out, show her a good time, hold her hand.\"<br>\r\n\"Stroke her earlobes,\" Mr. Ox said. The rest of the team turned around slowly to stare at the towering man. \"It works for my wife,\" he shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to seduce Faye?\" Jack said to Ms. Quick timidly. \"I don't know if I can do that. I love Jessica and when Faye and I were along together before...\"<br>\r\nAs Jack's voice trailed off, a furious groan came from Ms. Apple. \"I cannot believe our whole plan lies in this kid's hands,\" she barked, waddling over to Jack and Jessica. \"This isn't some senior prank. This is about getting all of our lives back. I'm not going to have triplets because you were too nervous to pretend to hit on another woman for a few hours.\"<br>\r\n\"He's worried he'll do more than just pretend,\" Jessica said, crossing her arms and glaring at Jack. \"I've seen her. She's good looking and he has a real weakness for big bellies.\"<br>\r\n\"You're not helping,\" Ms. Apple said. Rolling her eyes, she grabbed Jack's hand and held it against her chest, letting him squeeze her huge breasts. \"Do you still love him?\"<br>\r\nJessica couldn't respond at first, her jaw dropped. \"I...well, yes.\"<br>\r\n\"And you, nervous guy: still love Jessica?\"<br>\r\n\"Y-yes,\" Jack sputtered.<br>\r\n\"See? You weathered another incident with a pregnant woman,\" Ms. Apple said, leaning back up and throwing her red hair behind her shoulders. \"Now grow up and start fixing this mess.\"<br>\r\n\"And while Jack's...dating Faye, we'll be sneaking into her house?\" Jessica said. She was holding onto her belly closely, a nervous tick she picked up since she had a belly to hold on to.<br>\r\n\"No, we'll let Jack stretch the day out to increase our chances of getting her distracted and getting the coin and book back. She'll probably have it with her while you both spend time together,\" Ms. Smart said. \"We'll use the rest of the time practicing for the bikini contest tonight.\"<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Jack and Jessica said in unison.<br>\r\n\"The last coin is the prize in the contest. We need to put some real effort into one of us winning this thing so we can get that last coin before it's too late,\" Mariah said. \"Based on what they've told me, tomorrow's the last day we have to turn this all around. After that...\"<br>\r\n\"After that, the chaotic energy from the coin will have too much momentum,\" Ms. Smart said. \"Even if we have all three coins, it might not be possible to undo the rest of our coin-induced pregnancies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack felt his heart pounding in his chest as he got closer to Faye's house. He went alone to minimize the suspicion he brought out of Faye while the rest of the \"coin recovery team\" helped Jessica and Mariah get what they needed to practice for the contest. Dancing, talent, and showing off their bikini bodies. Jack wished things were less crazy so he could look forward to the pregnant bikini contest without fear or guilt, but no such luck. Besides, if there wasn't a coin involved, he would definitely be having twins with Jessica and that idea alone scared him. Although, not as much as it used to. He was scared but also, he was looking forward to raising a family with Jessica. Still, there would be plenty of time for that. For now, he had a mission to complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hard knocks on the door and Jack stood at attention in front of Faye's door. Now the fear began to grow. The fear that he would enjoy this \"date\" far too much. The door opened slowly and Faye poked her head out. \"Jack? You're...you're here alone.\"<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" Jack said, trying to sound natural. \"I wanted to apologize about how things got out of hand a few days ago. There was a misunderstanding.\"<br>\r\n\"There was; I'm sorry, Jack,\" Faye said softly, sighing as she looked her best friend's son over. \"I shouldn't have pushed you to-\"<br>\r\n\"No, I mean, I misunderstood,\" Jack said, feeling himself blush as Faye looked at him surprised. \"You were just trying to be friendly and I overreacted. I'm sorry.\" <br>\r\nFaye didn't know quite what to make of this. In response, she opened the door more, smiling to herself when she saw Jack's eyes bug out. Her belly had indeed gotten much larger than the last time Jack saw her. The last months of pregnancy see the belly grow at an increased pace and, although she'd only been pregnant for eight days, Faye was eight months pregnant with quadruplets and looked enormous. Her belly was a long, round torpedo, much of which refused to be covered by her loose blue top with a low-cut neck. Faye hadn't forgone pants entirely yet and was wearing a pair of jeans with an elastic waistband.<br>\r\n\"Well, I accept your apology,\" Faye cooed. \"I thought, since you're a man now, we can be friends. I enjoy your company, after all.\"<br>\r\n\"A-and so do I,\" Jack said, switching between crossing his arms and putting them in his pocket a few times, trying to remember to keep his eyes off of Faye's belly. \"That's why I thought I'd take you out of your house and let us, you know, spend some time together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Caution</span> the coin hissed in Faye's mind. Jack felt a shiver go down his own spine, his hands grasping around the coin in his pocket. Faye narrowed her eyes, pursing her lips into an inquisitive smile.<br>\r\n\"Does your mother know about this?\" Faye asked, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n\"No idea,\" Jack chuckled nervously. \"Worried she's trying to get me to trip you up before the contest tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't think that's what she's worried about,\" Faye purred, reaching for her purse and waddling out the door. Now outside the house, her belly looked even larger out in the open. Jack was enamored by it size, its smoothness, its shape. As Faye bend slightly to lock the door, the underside of her belly was clearly visible between her legs. And in addition to the most obvious sign of her pregnancy, Faye's butt was larger, firmer, rounder - all accentuated by her jeans. Her breasts went up another cup size and there was no sign of her wearing a bra that Jack could tell. Her skin was smoother and softer and even had a slight tanned glow to it. Faye's hair was silkier, lighter, and may have even been longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where should we go?\" Jack asked, walking slowly to match Faye's waddling speed. If the pregnant bikini contest had a race portion that wasn't advertised, Faye would be in trouble.<br>\r\n\"Good question,\" Faye sighed, putting her hand on Jack's shoulder for support and...other reasons. \"I feel like I've been to the mall too much lately. Let's see what else this city has in store for us.\"<br>\r\n\"Got it,\" Jack gulped, helping Faye into the passenger's seat. She slid in backwards, facing out the door as Jack held onto her legs to keep her balanced. The whole process made her belly smack Jack in the face a few times, but he certainly wasn't complaining. \"You should probably move the seat back a few more notches.\"<br>\r\n\"Can you reach it for me?\" Faye asked cutely. Jack reached down the side of the chair, his face directly above Faye's cleavage as he struggled. To avoid looking deep down into the bottomless canyon, he looked up, getting a knowing grin from Faye and noticing how much fuller her lips had gotten over the last eight days. Once adjusted, Jack hurried into the driver's seat and started the car. <br>\r\n\"Off we go, then,\" Jack smiled.<br>\r\n\"Yes, off we go,\" Faye smiled back, ignoring the cursing coming from her coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mariah, you can't...that's not really the right kind of talent for this sort of contest,\" Jessica said.<br>\r\n\"Well, it's the only one I can think of,\" Mariah said. \"Believe me, I don't like the idea of doing one of Shakespeare's soliloquies in a bikini, but my line delivery is perfect. I've studied the story and the craft and I think I'm really giving the audience the intended emotions. See, after the ceremony, Hamlet is distraught and we learn for the first time-\"<br>\r\n\"If you have to do lines from a Shakespeare play, why can't you do Romeo and Juliet? Then it'll be kind of lovey-dovey and sweet instead of...all about how the world is rotting away in sin,\" Jessica said, trying to sound encouraging.<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine,\" Mariah sighed, looking down at her bare belly and heaving breasts. \"But I don't see why we have to wear the bikinis now.\"<br>\r\n\"To practice! We'll be wearing them tomorrow, after all,\" Jessica said, hands on her widened hips. Both women were dressed scarcely, Mariah in a brown bikini, Jessica in yellow. <br>\r\n\"Then let's see your talent,\" Mariah said, getting her water bottle.<br>\r\nAs the two friends argued, Ms. Apple and Ms. Smart watched from the doors. \"Should we leave them alone like this? They need some focus.\"<br>\r\n\"They're fine,\" Ms. Apple said. \"Besides, it doesn't matter how much practice they do. I'm winning this thing.\"<br>\r\n\"You're pretty confident,\" Ms. Smart said, impressed. \"You've got a secret ace?\"<br>\r\n\"Two of them,\" Ms. Apple winked. \"I know my audience.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A pregnant pause fell upon the Jack and Faye as they drove around looking for a place to continue their \"not date\" date. As far as \"not date\" date's went, of which Jack has had three so far, this was by far the worst. He didn't need a date, he had Jessica for that. No, he needed an oppurtunity to grab the coin and get the hell out there.. But he tried to think, he needed someplace public to get away from her in, but also a place that could give the opportunity to get her alone. Quite the quandary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut alas, his conundrum was solved when a big sign that read COUNTY FAIR - RIDES! ANIMALS! GAMES! FUN! <br>\r\nBelow that was another sign - STILL IN TOWN DUE TO QUARANTINE.  ALL PREGNANT WOMEN - The word \"Women\" was crossed out with another sign hanging under that sign that read \"PEOPLE\" finishing the rest of the added on sentence - GET IN FOR FREE! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was perfect. He use to love the county fair as a kid, and most of all he loved was the \"The Ghost Mansion\", a dark ride through a spooky haunted house with pop-up cardboard ghosts, strobe lights, and cheap animatronics - - - The perfect distraction for him to grab the coin away from her and make a bee-line for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come to the fair!\" He thought to himself out loud. \"The fair?\" Faye asked, raising an eyebrow, her seat somewhat layer back to give her enormous pregnant belly some more room to \"breathe\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? It's still in town, and since you got pregnant a few days - - -\" Jack caught himself immediately \"I mean months ago, I know you haven't been. So why not? It could be fun. Win you some stuff animals for all them kiddies\" In another life Jack would have made one helluva use-car salesmen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Caution. The Master piece of me is dangerously close.. I can fells 32341#%12</span> The coin was trying to warn Faye about Jack's true intentions but the overlapping of it's own magic was dangerous. Before the night was over Jack would find out just how dangerous it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye, in a moment of freedom from the madness of the coin, became her old self again. \"Oh Jack, you're so sweet. Such a good kid. Let's go\" It was honest and sincere, without a hint of anything more than just being a good neighbor <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- -  - - Elsewhere - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria finished practicing her routine for the bikini competition, out of breath, sweating and somewhat aroused after catching sight of herself in a few of the mirrors. She looked fantastic, even if she felt like hell was rapidly approaching in her life if they didn't reverse this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING! \"You've got translation\" Her computer informed her with a vocal alert. The early chapters of the book were easier to translate then the later chapters, which became a mixture of different languages, syntax and slang. Some pages would have pictures in Russian, with footnotes in German, and pages in Slavic, while an other page would have Cantonese text, Spanish footnotes and Latin  headers. It was mess, and Maria thought it would be easier to have help from the internet and modern technology. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey, she was under a very strict deadline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping herself down, and sitting in a chair (Which groaned under a bit of protest) she fired up the translation program which was running in the background and poured over a couple of new pages translated from the book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nothing major\u2026 Just more accountants of pregnancies, more theories on the coin, birthing techniques, more pregnancy notes, a dire warning about having the coins close together, an older man's account of his pregnancy, a particularly odd sounding recipe for \"Picks and Ice Cream Sundae Pizza Surprise\" and - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh shit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria suddenly clicked hard and furiously on the pages about the dire warning, hoping that perhaps \"dire\" meant as in the wolf, not \"dire\" as in \"Oh shit things just got dire\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh balls\" Maria said, reading that insanely and hilariously rough translated text. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> DANGEROUS WORDS! HEED THEM! MUCH BAD HAPPEN IF NOT LISTENED TO! <br>\r\nCoin make many more of itself to spread pregnant badness. Make coin weak and strong at same time. Make many coin for many people to use make many babies on people with. However, never use coin when another coin near by. Very bad happens of badness! Coin together make coin magic strong but coin's words weak. Tempt to use coin very stronger around another coin, but coin's words of poison no longer affect brain. Do not understand why is. Take long time for it to work. Been with other coin person for over few hours now, I feel like old self in head, no poison words in thoughts. But badness follows being free of poison words. If Coin when used around other coin makes magic effect other people instead of one. Many men and women have belly now that I used coin around another person with coin. Me and other coin person unaffected. Shield from bad magic? Coin also very not strong when around other coin for long times. Coin become brittle and bendy.  Other coin person burnt hand in campfire when holding coin, coin looks much damage. Fire bad maybe when coin weak? Hear words and listen: Do not use coin around other coin.. Many people will have belly! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really should have translated this whole thing\" Maria looked on, deer-in-the-headlights look in her eyes and she frantically dialed Jack's number on Jessica's cellphone. Jessica was taking a shower at the hideout, and although Maria swore she would never touch Jessica's cellphone after the famed \"Please Respond\" incident that went down in \"Books Books Books\" history, this seemed like a perfectly good emergency to justify the temporary lifting of the ban Jessica had on Maria from using Jessica's cellphone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we got some good news with the bad\" Maria finished her thoughts as it went straight to voicemail. \"Oh no. Come on Jack, pick up the phone!\" Maria tried to re-dial and got voicemail again. \"Damn it!\" Maria yelled, slamming down the cellphone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, I mean. Maybe he won't use the coin. It's not like he could do that much damage right?\" Maria realized the futility of what she saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over at the giant red button on the wall with the sign that read \"ONLY PUSH IN CASE OF DIRE EMERGENCY\". This was dire, the book said so. <br>\r\nShe got up from the table and slammed her hand on the big red button, expecting to hear some kind of loud klaxon signaling the dire emergency. <br>\r\nInstead all she got was pre-recorded message that blasted out over the loud-speakers once: \"HEY! EMERGENCY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was totally pointless\" Maria said to herself. She hoped the rest of the group would find her soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- -  - - The Dire Date Of Doom! - - - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack felt a slight tickle behind his ear; an itch almost. He didn't have it before, but being this close next to Faye it was driving him mad. He just couldn't scratch it. It was driving him nuts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook it off as nerves as they pulled into the dirt parking lot of the fair grounds, Jack lucky enough to find parking closer to the front for once he needed to make his fast escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here we are.\" Jack said, trying to put on his sexy-voice. Faye looked sad looking out the window. She almost looked like she was crying. <br>\r\n\"Hey.. What's the matter?\" Jack asked, suddenly concerned with Faye's well being that this plan of faux-seduction. <br>\r\n\"Oh Jack, I've made a horrible mistake\" Faye didn't sound like the Faye of the past few days, she sounded like her old self. The sad next door neighbor who tried everything she could to have a family but couldn't. <br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Jack asked, trying not to claw at the back of his ear. Man, what a tick he was developing. <br>\r\n\"Charles\u2026 I never should have been that mad at him. We've made mistakes, both of us. I know what happened with Amber should have me furious, but all I feel is sadness. The stress of me not being able to get pregnant drove us apart for a while you know? We were this close to getting a divorce. I\u2026 slept with someone else before he slept with Amber. I thought, maybe I could get pregnant by someone else and then say it was his. I just wanted a family with him so bad, and I thought that maybe it was him, not me. Clearly, it was me\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was on the verge of all out tears. WHat had happened to the woman who tried to seduce him? Tried to drive a wedge between him and Jessica? Who was this sad pregnant thing sitting next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit. I don't know what to say\" Jack just blurted out, his mind more on the damn itch behind his ears than anything else. Faye laughed. <br>\r\n\"Never change Jack. You'll always be that adorable little nerd next door to me. Nothing more\" She smiled and gave Jack a faux and loving tap on his forehead complete with a \"book\". <br>\r\n\"Are you feeling okay. You seem different..\" Jack was thoroughly confused. This was the same woman who tried her best to seduce him earlier.<br>\r\n\"I feel like myself for the first time in a while actually. Like a weight has been lifted off of my mind. Maybe's it been because we've been in this car for over an hour or I don't know what, but it feels good.\" Faye said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGOD, WHAT IS WITH THIS ITCH BEHIND MY EAR?! Jack thought, trying not to scratch at it. He wanted to use the coin to scratch it, he didn't know why. He felt an urge to use it, to use it more than ever before, maybe it would make the scratching stop. STOP THE ITCH BEHIND HIS EAR. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright Jack? You look twitchy\" Faye said. <br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm fine. Let's go have some fun\" Jack said, opening the door, and helping Faye out of the car.<br>\r\n\"Let's go have some fun\" He told himself again, fingering the coin in his pocket. It seemed softer than before.. And the itch behind his ear was intense as they walked into the fair grounds. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even in the pregnancy-friendly carnival, Faye stood out. Or rather, her belly did. Eight months pregnant with quadruplets in an ill-fitting shirt, eyes were on Faye's bouncing and bobbing belly, half of the smooth, tight skin open to all eyes. A few men and women sporting bellies of their own gawked, remarking to their comrades that \"I guess things could be worse.\" Strangely enough, the only one not staring at Faye's belly was the one person there most attracted to it: Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really crowded here, huh?\" Faye said, hand on her chin as she worried about bumping into other expectant carnival-goers. \"Well, if you offer free entry to pregnant people, you'll be sure to get a lot of customers in our city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" Jack said, looking over at Faye shyly. He knew he had to be careful about how he proceeded, but he needed to get Faye to drop her guard so he could get her coin. \"Maybe we should hold hands so we don't get separated?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you'd have a hard time finding me,\" Faye laughed, rubbing her belly in long strokes. A few kicks and tumbles inside her softened Faye's smile and her rubbing slowed down. \"But sure, that's a good idea.\" Faye reached a hand out to Jack's, taking no time to intertwine her fingers in his, squeezing intimately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack blushed as Faye looked over at him with a smile. She waddled a few steps over and every few steps, her gigantic belly brushed against Jack's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Faye said, putting her other hand on top of her belly, which acted like a shelf for her hand. \"I know how you feel about...pregnant bellies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" Jack said, shaking a little as he prepared his next line. \"Trust me. I don't mind it at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye's smile grew a little. \"You don't mind if I take a quick pit stop to get some fatty carnival food, do you? Normally I'd never eat this stuff, but I'm sure you know how cravings can be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack laughed a little and nodded. \"I'm familiar, yes. Be my guest.\" Faye giggled as she turned to walk toward the food stands. Jack was a little confused. A few days ago, Faye was an absolute predator, wearing revealing clothes, crawling all over him, tantalizing him constantly. Now she was...well she was like she'd always been. A fun, slightly teasing woman in her 40s. This wasn't expected. Jack knew he'd need to change his plan some to get her attention so he could take her coin back. He'd need to...woo her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye got a basket of fries and corn dogs and walked back over to Jack as they stood in the small area for eating. \"One of the downsides to having so many pregnant people in the city is you can't expect people to give up their seats anymore,\" Faye sighed, bending her knees a few times to stretch her back, bouncing her belly and breasts in the process. \"Everyone sitting down is already pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you uncomfortable?\" Jack said, getting a little closer to Faye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm fine,\" Faye said, rolling her eyes, until she looked Jack in the eye. \"A little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well...one thing that makes my Mom more comfortable when she's eating is if someone rubs her belly,\" Jack lied. \"My Dad does it all the time...may I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye blushed, putting another french fry in her mouth. \"S-sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack smiled and placed his palm on the front of her belly, rubbing in wide, slow circles. \"Better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, much,\" Faye cooed as she resumed eating. Jack let out a long sigh as his neck tingled. Was it guilt? After all, he'd already screwed up with Jessica once before thanks to Faye and as much as he hated to admit it, he wanted to rub Faye's belly. He wanted to run his hands all over her full, pregnant body, kiss her nipples and full lips, and then slide his throbbing erection inside her. And Faye would welcome it, most likely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tingling was still there, growing into the same itch Jack had since he met with Faye today. It was unbearable. He scratched his neck and ears repeatedly, the twinge not going away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything alright?\" Faye said, turning to Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, yes, I dunno,\" Jack groaned. \"There's just a weird feeling on the back of my head.\" Faye reached a hand to the back of Jack's head, running her fingers through his hair, making him shudder. As she looked closer, her lips traced across his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see anything,\" Faye said, ripping everything off of her last corndog in one big bite, throwing the basket of crumbs and sticks into the trash. \"Ah, much better. So, what ride would you like to go on next?\" As Faye asked, she placed her hand on top of Jack's against her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...uh...\" Jack said, his brain starting to stumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you both going on the Ghost Mansion?\" a woman said, holding hands with a man, both smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could,\" Faye said, looking at Jack then back at the couple. \"Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a great ride for couples. And you both look super cute,\" the man chuckled, looking at his partner with a big smile. \"Alone together in a car in the dark. Big jump scares that make your heart race and let you jump into one another's arms. It's perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great,\" Jack said, forcing a smile as he turned to Faye. \"I loved the Ghost Mansion as a kid. Want to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Faye smiled, waddling off with Jack. \"But you...didn't correct them when they called us a couple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack knew what he had to say. \"Maybe I didn't need to.\" Faye blushed and stood a little closer to him again, her belly permanently against his waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the only one who's helped me out during all this chaos with my husband,\" Faye purred. \"I remember it, trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks,\" Jack said, standing in line for the Ghost Mansion. There were lots of other couples in front of them, touching and pecking each other. Very few of them were pregnant, in stark contrast to the rest of the carnival. The itching behind Jack's ear grew more and more powerful. When they made it to the end of the line, Faye heaved herself into the tiny car, struggling to fit, then trying to get the safety bar down. Her belly was making it impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, uh...\" the pregnant carny said, her ponytailed hair a clearly fake mix of blond and black, her nails bright black as she scratched her head. \"The ride's not that fast so if you both hold each other tight, you'll be fine. That should cover our insurance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's encouraging,\" Faye laughed quietly, wrapping her arm around Jack's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon; you too,\" the pregnant girl said. \"Bellies don't bite.\" Jack gulped and put his hand around Faye's back, his hand resting between her belly and breasts. \"Good. Alright, keep your hands, legs, and bellies inside at all times. No flash photography, as it scares the ghosts that reside in this haunted house,\" she said, all in a monotone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mansion,\" her supervisor yelled from a few feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" she said, hitting a button and sending Jack and Faye's car down the track where the rest of the couples were traveling. A few cardboard ghosts and vampires lazily popped up as plastic spiders dangled from the ceiling. It was nowhere near as scary as Jack remembered. Then again, maybe he was more scared of who was sitting next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Jack...about last time we were together,\" Faye said, turning to her neighbor's son. \"If we hadn't been interrupted, how would you have felt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd have wanted a lot more than one kiss,\" Jack said, leaning toward Faye, pressing against her belly so his other arm could get closer to her pocket. \"But it was a good start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye smiled and leaned in for a kiss. Jack clenched his eyes and went in for it, kissing someone other than his girlfriend once again, hating how good it felt. He loved Jessica, but he lusted after Faye. He moved his hand to try and get into her pocket, squeezing her butt instead. Faye squealed and placed a hand against Jack's chest, lapping at him with her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack! I had no idea you could be so forceful~\" Faye cooed. Jack's face was bright red as the itching in his head grew and grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I guess I'm just...just...\" Jack said, the itching starting to turn into words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Jack said, taking out his coin and giving it a flip. Tails. Faye's eyes were on Jack's after he caught the coin, her smile gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you...get that coin?\" Faye said slowly as they began to exit the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nowhere. It's just a regular quarter,\" Jack said, stuffing it back into his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it isn't,\" Faye said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's face flushed as their cart came out the other side as all of the passengers ahead of them struggled to get off, their bellies now unbelievably swollen with twins and triplets.</span></div></div>",

We can't have  a report about the government agents in top authority in the city now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good journalism should challenge authority,\" Douglass Taylor said, crossing his arms. \"I'm nervous about it too, but I trust Mia and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mr. Taylor!\" an intern in the back of the room yelled, running from his laptop to the manager. \"Ratings are off the charts. People have been tweeting like crazy. Nearly every TV in the city is tuned in to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay on Mia!\" Douglass boomed, pointing to everyone in the room. \"Keep us connected, no matter what!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here with Dr. Kristen Harper, OB/GYN at the hospital that the NIH has made its headquarters during this outbreak. Dr. Harper is the main local liaison with their medical efforts, but says she can no longer stay quiet about what is going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Mia,\" Dr. Harper nodded, a hand resting against her own belly. \"At first, I was supportive of the NIH's involvement. Whenever there is a breakout of a contagion, especially on a scale like the size of our city, I believe state and even federal bureaus should be involved to lend their considerable resources. However, what the NIH has done has not been beneficial to the people of this city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's start there,\" Mia said, one hand holding her microphone while the other rubbed the underside of her enormous belly. The thrill of the story was making her heart race, which in turn made her triplets kick with more ferocity. \"What has been your issue with the NIH's response to what, for now, we will refer to as the 'Pregnancy Outbreak.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For one, it has had no medical benefit to the people of this city,\" Dr. Harper said. \"I had a...sudden pregnancy, but I am not sick. None of these people are medically suffering. In fact, everyone is astonishingly healthy and have none of the negative side effects pregnancy can sometimes have. I know you were pregnant before this all happened, but other women have found themselves pregnant with multiples for much longer than we typically see. The NIH's actions \u2014 quarantining the city, imposing curfews, stops, and mandatory hospital visits \u2014 only adds stress and anxiety to the situation. On top of that, the agents have done nothing to provide the city's newly pregnant population with health care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You criticized the quarantine, but if this is a contagious phenomenon, shouldn't it be contained as much as possible?\" Mia said, playing devil's advocate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just it: this is not a contagious phenomenon,\" Dr. Harper said. \"While we do not know the cause of these sudden pregnancies, especially in men, none of the data gathered shows evidence of person-to-person pregnancy spreading. There are spontaneous hubs of 'pregnancy outbreak' but they have nothing to do with people who are already pregnant. This quarantine is about control, not health.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the ones pushing for this control are not just the NIH,\" Mia said. \"My reporting has showed the depth of the reliance by the NIH on a organization called P.E.A.R.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And P.E.A.R. is not part of the United States government. Or the government of any individual country,\" Dr. Harper said. \"It's completely shrouded in mystery, but its members appear to be from all over the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They've managed to stay mysterious,\" Mia said, turning to the camera, hand not leaving her belly. \"But I've uncovered several instances of P.E.A.R. shutting down cities and towns in various parts of the world, though nothing on this scale. It would seem that P.E.A.R.'s actions here are about practicing their containment efficiency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is the sense I have gotten from working alongside other P.E.A.R. members,\" Dr. Harper nodded. As the two talked, the Amber-controlled Spyder camera crept closer, trying to pick up on their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might not be practicing your dancing, but exposure on TV will always help you with the judges,\" Amber said, magnifying in on Mia's face, panning down across her chest and belly. \"But damn, she is a good looking woman. I'll bet Jack's been watching the local news a lot in the past few months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spyder scurried up a street light, getting an eagle-eye view of the two women as its microphone began to pick up their conversation. As Amber adjusted the frequency to get a better listen, she picked up the same signal as the television broadcast. A loud, static shriek went through Amber's controls and into her headphones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\" Amber yelled, her body flailing and hitting her controls. The legs of the Spyder kicked out and the camera plummeted to the ground, crashing feet away from Mia and Dr. Harper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Que co\u00f1o!\" Mia yelled, jumping a little (not much, thanks to her belly's weight) at the sudden falling projectile. When she calmed down, rubbing her belly with both hands to quiet her triplets, Mia waddled over and picked up the camera. It was still moving around, but in Mia's hands, it wasn't getting away anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there,\" Amber said to herself, the camera getting a close-up look at Mia's face. \"I guess I won't be using this thing anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia turned the Spyder over and read the label on the underside. \"Spyder 009 - P.E.A.R. Model V3. I...I don't know what to say, Brooke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mia, what's happening out there?\" Brooke said, leaning in. The entire newsroom was on the edge of their seats, with the exception of Rick who was preoccupied prodding his growing belly with curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brooke, this is a P.E.A.R. model...some sort of mobile camera. And it looks like it was spying on my broadcast,\" Mia said. \"This is number 9, so there are likely at least eight other cameras like this in the city, spying on the citizens. This further shows the invasion of our constitutional rights the P.E.A.R. quarantine represents. This is Mia Vasquez, making my report.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck,\" Lieutenant Riker said in the P.E.A.R. office at the hospital, watching the broadcast live. \"Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA phone rang in the back of the room. Riker cringed as one of the other agents picked up it, their face immediately turning pale. \"L-lieutenant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Riker said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's General DeSoto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it is,\" Riker said, a shaky hand taking the phone. \"General! Yes, I'm...I know the cameras are supposed to be a secret tool for future operations...I-I know they're not supposed to be used in the field yet...I...I understand.\" Riker handed the phone back to the other P.E.A.R. agent. \"Pack it all up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're leaving?\" Lieutenant Han said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just got the order,\" Riker said through clenched teeth. \"Everyone out. Quarantine is over. And I'm...going to be court marshaled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Commander Zavaleta?\" Han asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let her take care of herself,\" Riker said, marching out of the room. \"She's the one who abandoned HQ. She gets what she gets.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica started striding down the room again, recreating her initial catwalk. One hand was on her hip, cupping her shapely rear as it wiggled back and forth with each step. The other hand was rested against her round, smooth belly, rubbing it slightly. Jessica positioned her hand to not cover up her dimpled belly button, sticking out of her fleshy, tight orb. Jessica's eyes were locked on her reflection on the other end of the room like she was in a trance. She had a small, sexy smile on, eating up how she looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe loved being pregnant. The belly. The breasts. The butt. The glow. The kicking. Everything. Even now, as Jessica watched herself in the mirror, it was an out-of-body experience. Jessica still couldn't believe the awkward, goofy girl she'd been before had turned into this pregnant, sexy woman, wearing a bikini and practicing her strut for an adoring crowd. Jessica felt envious of Jack sometimes. She wished they could trade places and Jessica could be the one feeling and embracing the pregnant woman she saw in the mirror. Maybe she felt so disconnected from what she looked like and how she felt because she'd only been pregnant for a week. Or maybe it was because pregnancy was so built up in her mind; it was too much of a dream-come-true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne misstep and Jessica stumbled, flailing her arms around as she managed to stay upright, putting both hands on her belly when she settled. \"Damn it!\" Jessica yelled for the sixth time this hour. \"How am I supposed to have a sexy gait when I walk out if I can't even see my feet with this thing?\" A few kicks against Jessica's palm made her face soften a bit and she started rubbing where she felt the commotion. \"It's okay, I'm not mad at you. Momma's just got a lot on her mind and it would be nice if your...your Dad was here to help out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't just Jessica's seven-month, twin-filled belly that was getting in the way of her composure. She was nervous about Jack's plan to \"seduce\" Faye, even if it meant getting all this craziness in the city fixed. The first big rough spot in their relationship was thanks to Jack and Faye kissing and now they were off on a date. And Jessica knew Faye would be hard to resist. Her eight month belly easily outsized Jessica's, and on top of that, she had two more babies in her for good measure. Plus, Faye was a full-fledged cougar. She had bigger breasts, poutier lips, and more sexual experience than Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing okay in here?\" Mariah asked, popping her head in the room. Jessica jumped a bit, her blush turning one shade darker. \"I counted six outbursts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six, huh?\" Jessica sighed, turning around and waddling toward her friend, rubbing her belly all over as she stood a few inches away from Mariah's belly. \"Guess I'm just distracted with...well, everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything is right,\" Mariah said, rubbing her own belly. Thanks to the coin's uneven effects on people, Mariah's belly grew to full-term size with twins and she outsized her friend. \"I never thought I'd even have kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never wanted to be pregnant?\" Jessica asked. She knew her own fascination with pregnancy was more than other people, but she didn't think she was that different from other women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never even thought about pregnancy. I just figured it would never happen,\" Mariah shrugged. \"I know what I am. I'm a quiet, weird girl who stays in the back of the room and reads. Never dated, never been kissed, and definitely never getting pregnant. Well...the first two are still right, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica frowned and wrapped her arm around her friend's shoulder. \"Mariah, let me show you something.\" Jessica walked the two of them to the middle of the room, letting Mariah face the mirror. \"Do you know what I see when I look at you? I see a woman who's brilliant, funny, and a stone-cold fox. People are checking you out at the bookstore all the time. And anyone who really got to talk to you would fall in love with you immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica, you don't need to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm being honest,\" Jessica said, turning to face Mariah. \"You're amazing. And anyone who could be with you would be incredibly lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really mean that?\" Mariah said after a pause, looking at Jessica sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any hesitation, Mariah kissed Jessica passionately, cupping her hands on Jessica's cheeks before sliding them down her shoulders and chest. She pressed against Jessica's soft lips, pecking and moaning. Jessica stood stunned as Mariah started to lap her tongue around her friend's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mariah broke the kiss, her face was as red as a sunburn. \"W-was that...s-should I have...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica wiped her fingertips across her lips, looking at the long strands of saliva that came off. \"Mariah, I'm flattered but I don't...I'm straight. And besides, I've got Jack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but he cheated on you! And he could be cheating on you now!\" Mariah said, hanging her head. \"T-the romance books at the store said this would be the best way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Books aren't always a good representation of real life,\" Jessica said, smiling a little to pick Mariah's spirits up. \"You're incredible and you'll definitely find someone who loves you.\" She bent in and wrapped her friend up in a hug. \"Or rather, you'll find someone who'll be <i>in</i> love with you. I'll always love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here,\" Mariah said, hugging Jessica back. When they broke, Mariah took a few steps back, wiping a stray tear from one eye. \"Well, I'd better go practice some more, then. Tomorrow night will be the debut of me entering the dating pool and if I win, I'll rope in even more hotties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a challenge,\" Jessica grinned, narrowing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet it is,\" Mariah grinned, waddling back to the door before slapping her forehead. \"I totally forgot why I came in here! We need to contact Jack as soon as we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack? Why?\" Jessica asked, now a little skeptical of Mariah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured out more of the book. If that Faye woman really has a coin, then when the two are in close proximity, one gets stronger while the other gets weaker. If Jack flips his coin, it could be another major outbreak of the 'Pregnancy Disease.' If we want to get her coin, now's our chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do?\" Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried calling him, but it's no good,\" Mariah said, shaking her head. \"I think...our best bet is to stick to the plan we already have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's at least turn on the news to see if he's used the coin,\" Jessica said, waddling into the main room with her best friend and flipping on the TV, with an aerial view of the city on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see, the NIH vans are piling out of the city right now,\" Brooke said. \"Mia, do you have any information on why this might be happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite, Brooke. The most information I've gotten out of government spokespeople is that they say the 'Pregnancy Disease' is not contagious and is no longer active. While part of that matches up with Dr. Harper's analysis, based on reports of more spontaneous pregnancies at the annual fair, this is far from inactive.\" Mia held up the Spyder camera next to her belly while turning back to the camera. \"I do have one other theory, however.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, hold it next to your belly,\" Rick grumbled off-mic. \"Score more points for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rick, shut up,\" Douglass said, eyes glued to the monitors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost immediately after I started talking about P.E.A.R. and this spy equipment they were using, they started moving out. Clearly, this is something P.E.A.R. did not want us to know about. I'll have updates as I investigate,\" Mia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Mia,\" Brooke said. \"Any information on what's happening at the fair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet. I am heading over now,\" Mia nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's out star reporter, Mia Vasquez,\" Brooke nodded with a smile. \"Be careful at the fair, Mia. We'd hate to see you at tomorrow's bikini contest with three more babies in your belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia giggled. \"I think some people wouldn't mind, Brooke. This is Mia Vasquez, signing out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica and Mariah looked at each other. \"Guess he used the coin,\" Jessica said, her heart sinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's keep the TV on in case we get more information on the fair,\" Mariah nodded, putting the remote back on the rickety table the organization kept the television on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Ms. Smart said, walking into the main room in her own black bikini. \"Why aren't you both practicing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The two coins together has created more widespread pregnancies and may give Jack an opportunity to get the other coin back,\" Mariah said. \"And P.E.A.R. is pulling out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're leaving?\" Ms. Apple said, hurrying into the room. Everyone's eyes popped when they saw the buxom, pregnant redhead in nothing but a peach thong and nipple tassels. \"What?\" Ms. Apple said, looking down at herself. \"I'm in it to win it.\"</span></div></div>",

Amanda smiled and nodded as she heaved herself up from her desk with one arm, cradling her massive maternal weight with the other. \"I'm taking my maternity...or paternity leave, I suppose, pretty soon and compared to me, you look like you're ready to give birth any second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me, I've had that concern whenever I look in the mirror,\" Amanda sighed. \"But they still feel a few months too small. Although I guess this is all pretty different from what I'm used to with Jack.\" She let out a little groan and clutched her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda?\" Tara said, waddling over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, it's just when they all kick at the same time, it's a bit much,\" Amanda laughed through her wince. \"I'm fine, Ryan. Really. It wouldn't be fair for me to take maternity leave when I've only been pregnant for about a week, would it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan sighed and shrugged. \"This pregnancy disease or whatever it is has complicated some things.\" He rested his hand on his own belly. \"Well, it's had some good and some bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what pregnancy is,\" Amanda smiled, wrapping her hands around her swollen womb. \"But I'd say the good outweighs the bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan walked into the midst of the conversation, papers in hand, and looked around. <i>Oh...it's a pregnancy discussion</i>, he grumbled internally. \"Uh...boss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Ian,\" Ryan sighed. \"What is it? I thought you weren't coming in today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but I'm still working on this partnership with the radio station's bikini contest tomorrow night,\" Ian said, looking over his forms again. \"But the last emails I got about this say I'm supposed to be, like, helping in person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been sending those emails for days,\" Amanda sighed, rubbing her belly in slow circles to quiet her quadruplets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot my password,\" Ian said. Ryan rolled his eyes, eternally regretting hiring this special kind of idiot. \"Anyway, what exactly does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd have to check with the people at the station,\" Ryan shrugged. \"Particularly Lisa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa. The name of 101.9's sexy mascot perked Ian's spirits up. \"I'll get right on it, boss!\" Ian boasted, hurrying out of the office as quickly as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan, speaking of days off,\" Tara said, standing beside Amanda, rubbing her belly in synch with Amanda. \"Would it be okay if Amanda and I left a little early today? Work's been slow and the bikini contest is tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go home and practice your dancing,\" Ryan smiled, putting his hands on both of their shoulders. \"I'll be there tomorrow night, ready to see you two duke it out. As far as I can tell, you're shoe-ins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Ryan,\" Amanda smiled. \"This was a great baby shower. Congratulations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey nodded and smiled and acted overly polite a little more before leaving the office and waddling down the stairs. \"So, worried about tomorrow?\" Tara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About winning or about having everyone see a pregnant woman in her 50s carrying quadruplets in a bikini?\" Amanda laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either, I guess,\" Tara chuckled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought being in front of a crowd would make me nervous but the more I've been practicing the mirror, the more I've realized...I look good,\" Amanda smiled. \"I'm proud of my pregnant body and it'll be fun. This whole competition is just for fun for me,\" she said, her voice trailing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But?\" Tara smiled, raising her eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...I may have sneaked a peek at the list of other contestants,\" Amanda said, getting some sheets of paper out of her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hacked the organizers?\" Tara said, her lips wide with shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, I just got it off of Ian's email. His password is 'Ian.' It wasn't hard,\" Amanda laughed. At the bottom of the stairs, the two women turned to face one another, belly pressing against belly. \"And the competition might be a little steep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do we have to look out for?\" Tara said. \"I know this is fun for you, but frankly, Amanda...I'm single and I'm pregnant with two more babies than I prepared for. This contest would be a big deal for me if I win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda nodded. Tara, Amber, maybe even Jessica. There were a lot of pregnant women in Amanda's life that she knew needed to win. \"Well, the two obvious ones are Mia Vasquez and Lisa herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa's entered?\" Tara gasped. \"Isn't that...against the rules, if she works for the station?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure, but she's in it and she's popular,\" Amanda sighed. \"So is Mia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And they're both just as pregnant as me,\" Tara sighed. \"Do you think the crowd will consider belly size a positive or negative?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard to say, but I know I've come to like my big belly,\" Amanda blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if that's the case, at least you're the biggest woman in town, besides Zava...besides my mom,\" Tara said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-not quite,\" Amanda said. \"My neighbor is also carrying quads and lately she's become very good and flirting and being sexy in general. She's someone to watch out for too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a few tricks up my sleeves,\" Tara smiled. \"They won't win this so easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure,\" Amanda smiled. \"You've gorgeous, Tara.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Tara said, leaving the office with Amanda. \"B-by the way, who was that pregnant woman with Jack earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His girlfriend, Jessica,\" Amanda said. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No reason,\" Tara sighed, patting her belly. \"No reason at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forgot your password?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's on the tip of my tongue,\" Ian said, sitting across from Lisa at the radio station. She had a huge, baggy white t-shirt covering herself up but Ian could still get the impression of her chest through the thin fabric. He'd knew she was pregnant and, with everything that had been going on in the city lately, that still filled him with some fear, but he could still zone out and ogle her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have a ton of time to get into details, but yes, you'll be backstage at the event, taking care of the contest's participants,\" Lisa sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Backstage?\" Ian said, lifting his head up to meet Lisa's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a sarcastic grin, seeing how obviously he was gawking at her and was glad she managed to break his \"concentration.\" \"Yes, only one person actually volunteered to help out during the show so we're adding you to the duty list. It won't be too much work, don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what would I be doing?\" Ian asked, scratching his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, there's going to be about 50 pregnant women there. They'll want water, they'll want snacks, they'll want massages, and some of the more hormonal ones will probably want someone to talk to and tell them that they look fine in a bikini,\" Lisa sighed, looking at her phone. \"And of course you'll need to oil them up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oil them up?\" Ian said, his face turning bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it's a beauty contest, after all. They have to look their best and that means oiling up all the bellies,\" Lisa said, standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-even yours?\" Ian choked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If there's two people doing it, I don't care how gross and handsy the other person is: I'm not letting you oil up my belly</i>, Lisa thought. \"Possibly, yeah. Now I've got to go do a promotional photoshoot for the station website.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa took off her t-shirt to reveal her full, pregnant body, clad only in a bikini. Ian let out a gurgle, turned bright white, turned in time to throw up mostly in a trash can, and collapsed on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, Dennis? Could you call an ambulance? The kid from the bank just passed out,\" Lisa sighed, hands on her belly as she looked down at him. \"And it looks like his pissed himself too...at least I hope that's piss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bellies,\" Ian mumbled. \"T-too many bellies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs two of the station's employees dragged Ian away to get him more comfortable, Lisa waddled to the shoot where Sandwich and Oven were already waiting. \"We've done so many photos for the website, but never quite like this,\" Sandwich chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you can get Oven to do one too,\" Lisa smirked. \"He's getting round enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah,\" Oven complained. \"What happened in the office? There was all sorts of commotion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That dumb guy the bank used to collaborate with us barfed and passed out,\" Lisa said. \"My guess is there'll only be one helper backstage tomorrow night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't envy him,\" Sandwich shivered. \"One man responsible for the comfort of 50 pregnant women in bikinis. What's his name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa opened a file on her phone and read over the contest's documents. \"Jack Dale Jr.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put him on the wall of heroes,\" Sandwich said, shaking his head. \"He's giving his life for 101.9 The Edge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wall of heroes?\" Oven said, his tone dropping. \"So that means...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" Sandwich nodded. \"A free frisbee. Now let's get this photoshoot over with. Lisa, try to look a little less pregnant and a little more like you don't hate us.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"It's nothing,\" Jack said, trying to stuff the coin back in his pocket. He couldn't help notice how warm it was in his hand. It even felt like the tiny shard of metal was vibrating and moving in his grasp, but it was so small and slight Jack couldn't be sure if it was his nerves instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye reached over, grasping Jack's wrist. Her belly pressed more tightly against him as she turned his palm over. \"No ordinary quarter has a picture of two pregnant people smiling on one side.\" She picked up the coin and turned it over, careful not to actually flip it. \"And let me guess: the same pregnant people frowning on the other side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack didn't know how to play it. He couldn't lie and say it was a trick coin, but he didn't want to give away too much information just yet. \"H-how did you know that?\" Faye looked into his eyes, studying his expression. Jack felt himself get hot, worrying if the \"cougar\" Faye might rear her head now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, you need to get out,\" the same carny who let them onto the ride said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, you need to clear the car,\" Faye said, waving her away while keeping her eyes fixed on Jack. \"I'm eight months pregnant. I take a little bit longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean now, ma'am,\" the carny said, grabbing Faye's arm. \"We're evacuating. There's been another pregnancy outbreak.\" Faye and Jack both looked at the woman. Before they got on the ride, she was sporting a healthy, basketball pregnant belly. Now she was gestating a watermelon in her womb, with one fake-nailed hand slowly rubbing and patting it. \"Lucky you didn't get any bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so,\" Faye nodded, letting the pregnant carny and a few other employees pull her out of the car. Jack even pushed her wide ass a bit to help her with the leverage, guiltily enjoying the feel as well. Jack hurried alongside Faye, glad the awkward moment of discovery was shaken up a bit. But not much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-weird how this pregnancy stuff just comes out of nowhere, huh?\" Jack said with a smile. But Faye had him pinned against a wall with her belly as soon as they were out of foot traffic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you know more than you're saying, mister,\" Faye said, her lower lip quivering. \"I think it's a little too suspicious that you have a thing for pregnant women and then you have a coin that causes pregnancies. And everyone close to you is pregnant too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack held his hands up. \"I-I just found it on the floor today! I swear I don't know anything!\" He gulped, an idea sprouting. \"How do you know this coin causes pregnancy anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I have one too,\" Faye said, reaching into an inner pocket and pulling out her coin. Jack tried to hide his smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I know where her coin is now</i> he thought to himself. <i>One step closer, Dale. One step closer</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss?\" a big-bellied police officer said, waddling toward the two slowly. \"Don't worry: these sudden pregnancies knock into people all the time. Just back up slowly and he'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye took a breath and stepped back. \"Sorry, officer,\" she said. \"But how dare you: I didn't get impregnated by some mystery disease. I grew these babies inside my belly myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies, miss,\" the officer said, nodding her hand. \"Now, please make a line with the rest of the fair-goers and we'll get you out of here in an orderly line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are the NIH people?\" Jack said, looking around. \"Don't they spring into action where there's a 'pregnancy outbreak?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're gone,\" the officer said. \"Not that they did us any help. All they did was harass me because I decided to stay on the force while I'm nine months pregnant. I told 'em, hey, the force doesn't give us paid maternity leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye and Jack nodded politely as they hurried away, joining the steady stream of pregnant men and women out of the fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Faye sighed. \"Now that the secret's out, looks like you helped impregnate a whole fair, assuming your story's straight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack blushed a bit. He preferred not to think of his coin-flipping as \"impregnating\" anyone. How would he feel telling Faye he impregnated her, Jessica, Amber, Tara, and even Mia Vasquez? \"I-I'm sure you've impregnated your fair share of people too, Faye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye let out a small, whimpering laugh. \"I guess so,\" she sighed. \"I shouldn't have, though. I was so eager to be pregnant, when power fell into my hands, I just...\" A tear fell down her cheeks, which she tried to wipe away. Jack beat her too it, stroking her face with a finger. \"You've grown into quite the gentleman, Jack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gave me good advice every now and then,\" Jack said, not entirely lying. In high school, Faye had a sixth sense about when Jack was feeling queasy over a girl and gave him a few good pointers. Maybe if he used them, he and Jessica would have been dating longer than a week. \"But I can't just sit by when a friend is crying...especially if they're pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye turned to Jack, a look of slight surprise on her face. She stopped in the middle of the stream and gave Jack a kiss on the cheek. Not a cute, friendly peck. But a wet, open-lipped kiss that lingered and left residual warmth and moisture. When she returned, looking her neighbor's son over for a few seconds, she finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The park's nearby. Let's go walk along there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack nodded, taking Faye's hand. <i>Oh God...Jessica, please forgive me. I like this date</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Amber---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, pick up,\" Amber groaned, cellphone against her ear as she patted her belly with the other. After a few rings, she got the same familiar message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you've reached Charlie Jones,\" the recorded voice said. \"Not available right now, but leave me your number and email. And your name, while you're at it.\" The message ended with a little, manly laugh before the beep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber had avoided leaving a message, but with a sigh, decided enough was enough. \"Hi Charlie, or as you called yourself about nine months ago, Chuck. Look, I've been trying to do anything to distract myself from...all this,\" she said, looking at her now-abandonned Spyder controller, \"but enough is enough. We need to talk and it'll be easier before your children come into this world. Any of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber hung up and crossed her arms, looking at her small apartment. The bigger she got, the smaller it looked. The last time she had an ultrasound, Amber's doctor said she was 37 weeks along, which Amber took as the truth. In truth, the procreative sex happened in a haze and the discovery of her pregnancy blurred a few months of her life. Especially when she learned the baby daddy had four babies of his own on the way already. She had no real sense of how long she'd been pregnant. It felt like both an eternity and like a belly sprouted out of her a week ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Amber had to look forward to now was the bikini contest. Self-confidence was never something Amber was lacking so she thought she had a good chance of winning. But as she turned on her TV and saw Mia on the news, her assuredness waned a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see, there was another outbreak of the pregnancy disease at the local fair,\" Mia said, her triplet belly unhidden by the camera frame as she pointed to the stream of people leaving. \"One fair employee saw it as close as you can. What was your name again, ma'am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Candice,\" the pregnant carny from the Ghost Mansion said, twirling her dyed hair with one finger. \"I saw people leaving our ride, mostly couples, and as they were leaving and getting ready to step off, poof, their stomachs started swelling. A few kinda lost their balance and some other employees had to keep them from falling over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you weren't spared either,\" Mia said, gesturing to Candice's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I was already pregnant with one when this all started,\" Candice said, rubbing her huge belly. \"Now looks like my little boy is going to have some siblings in there. Wish I had a big belly earlier, though. I'd have entered the bikini contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia laughed. \"You've heard about it, have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone has. Hell, I'm still going to check it out,\" Candice smiled. \"Still, me entering would have been a waste of time. You'll win easily, girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, thank you,\" Mia said. \"You're still very good looking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell, I know. My boyfriend tells me every day,\" Candice scoffed, crossing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's talk to some other people who were there,\" Mia said, walking away from Candice as quickly as she could. \"Miss, were you at the Ghost Mansion ride?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera moved to Faye, who turned a bit red. \"W-well, yes, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And is your belly a result of the outbreak?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Faye frowned. \"I'm carrying quadruplets and I've had them for eight months!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! I get that question a lot too,\" Mia said, gesturing for the camera to include Jack in the shot. \"As a couple on the ride together, was it shocking to see people suddenly become pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and Faye both turned pale. \"Um...well...we're...\" Faye sputtered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack started to feel the same tickling behind his ear. \"We've got to get out of here,\" he whispered to Faye. \"Quick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry! Babies kicking on the bladder!\" Faye said, waddling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber was sitting on the floor, jaw dropped. \"As you can see, folks, despite the NIH, or 'P.E.A.R.,' pulling out and saying the pregnancy disease is no longer contagious, something is still up in the city,\" Mia said as Amber turned the TV off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not with any girlfriend,\" Amber muttered. \"He's still with that big-bellied older woman. Does that whole family just encourage cheating?\" Amber bit her lip and heaved herself up. \"No more crying. No more feeling sorry for myself,\" she growled, taking off her shirt and grabbing her bikini. \"I'm winning this thing for Amber. And for my twins. I'll give Jack a piece of my mind at the contest.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack Sr. paced around his desk in the living room, rubbing his hands together. All today at work, he'd spent most of his time on personal matters, trying to see how much money he could scrounge together for the next 20+ years. Now, at home, even though there was a conspicuous lack of distractions, he was hitting a mental wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr he hoped it was a mental wall. Otherwise, Jack had just hit the limit on the Dale family's funds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya,\" Amanda grunted as she twisted and turned, waddling her quadruplet belly through the front door. \"Don't worry, your extremely pregnant wife is making through the door on her own. No need to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack ran one hand through his greying hair. \"Amanda...sit down. We need to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to convince me to sit down,\" Amanda chuckled, pushing both hands against her lower back and shuffling to the couch before pausing. After spending so much time in the fog of Faye and Amber's inter-marital spat, Amanda's heart sank at Jack's word. \"Oh god, Jack, don't tell me you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No no no!\" He said, hurrying to the couch beside his wife. \"I know what you're thinking. The only bellies around town with my babies in it are right here,\" he said, patting Amanda's inflated stomach for emphasis. \"C'mon Amanda, I love you like crazy. You know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do~\" Amanda purred, rolling her eyes as Jack pecked her on the cheek. \"So, what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're...excited to have these babies, aren't you?\" Jack said, resting one hand on Amanda's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda took a deep breath and put one hand over her husband's. \"I...was surprised, sure. And I can't pretend it's been easy but...\" She looked up at Jack and gave a little laugh. \"I love being pregnant and I can't wait to meet and raise these babies.\" Jack sighed and nodded. \"Do you mean you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, I do too,\" Jack nodded. \"Since you've been pregnant, it's been like when we were first married. Things are more fun and exciting and you look so beautiful and of course I want to raise more children with you.\" He held up an ink-smudged piece of paper. \"But raising four babies is going to be expensive and we haven't exactly saved up for it. I'm worried about...\" Jack trailed off as he put his hand to his forehead, letting out a frenzied gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, is that all?\" Amanda said, putting one hand on Jack's shoulder. \"Babe, of course it'll be tricky, but we weren't that well off when Jack Jr. came along and I think you'd agree he's turned out pretty well.\" Jack Sr. nodded, removing his hand to look his wife in the eye. \"We'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack sighed and nodded, leaning in closer to his incredibly pregnant wife. \"But we still need a lot of money that just isn't there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already thought about that,\" Amanda said, putting her husband's other hand on her belly. \"When I first found out I was pregnant, as soon as I could, I worked things out at Titan Bank. My retirement fund is going straight to the babies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda!\" Jack said with surprise. \"I-I can't ask you to do that! I'll give up my retirement instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held up one hand. \"Trust me, the bank's taken a bit better care of its employees. And I won't really be retiring. I have more than a full-time job growing inside my belly right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack smiled and went in for a kiss, his wife passionately linking lips with him. As the two kissed on the couch, Amanda grinded her belly against Jack until they broke, both blushing brightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...you said I'm beautiful like this,\" Amanda purred, tracing a circle around her popped-out navel with one finger. \"Do you mean 'more' beautiful?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack Sr. turned even redder, not sure how to respond. \"W-well, you've got that glow, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda crawled toward her husband, weighing him down with her considerable womb. \"I always suspected something with you. When I was pregnant with Jack, you had an extra oomph.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer husband let out a little laugh. \"Is that a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no problem at all,\" Amanda whispered. \"But I feel bad. I never let you watch my dance practice. I should have been more considerate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack ran one hand up his wife's belly. \"Well, now's as good a time as any.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, I agree,\" Amanda said, rubbing her nose against his. \"But first...let's go up to the bedroom.\" A pause. \"H-help me up, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Jessica---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Apple shimmied back and forth, her belly jutting out randomly and widely as the tassels on her breasts spun around while her chest bounced and bobbed. When the song ended, she stopped, panting and sweating as she put both hands on her wide hips, which thanks to her peach thong, looked naked at first-glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Ms. Apple said, looking at her tiny audience. \"What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" Mariah nodded fervently. \"Amazing. You'll win for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mariah...\" Jessica said, elbowing her friend. \"You're not trying to pick her up. You have to be honest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah gulped and blushed as Ms. Apple turned to her. \"What? It wasn't perfect?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Apple,\" Jessica said, sighing for a second. She hated using the stupid codenames these people insisted on. \"You're just sort of...flailing around. It's not really a dance. You're just moving a lot and using your looks to your advantage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just using what I've got,\" Ms. Apple said. \"That's a big belly and big tits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can find a style to fit that,\" Ms. Smart said, walking toward her partner. \"But Jessica's right. You were just...all over the place. You'll win the vote of a few dweebs in the audience, maybe, but not enough to win. We all need to be strong contenders for first place to increase our odds of getting the third coin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And not to be rude but you're not the only one competing with big breasts,\" Jessica said. \"Mia Vasquez and Lisa Smith have you pretty well matched in that territory and I'll bet they're better dancers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Jack's neighbor Faye is pretty busty,\" Mariah chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, thank you for reminding me,\" Jessica sighed quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine, I'll work on doing something else,\" Ms. Apple groaned marching over to the viewing area. \"Who's next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go,\" Jessica said, waddling to the front. She adjusted her bright bikini, subtly trying to made her breasts seem bigger before signaling Mariah to start the music. As the gentle piano and violin came in, Jessica started to glide, twirling and stepping gracefully, letting her belly swing out with each move. Its weight acted as a kind of pendulum, allowing Jessica to shift her balance as needed to pull off her moves. When the music stopped, Jessica let out a long sigh and waddled over to the nearest water bottle. \"So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gorgeous,\" Mariah said quietly, hands clutched together at her chest. \"Honestly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, very elegant,\" Ms. Smart nodded. \"It was like a pregnant ballet, but a little more modern and accessible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Ms. Apple agreed. \"But you need to sex it up a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you stop with that?\" Ms. Smart groaned, turning to her partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm being realistic!\" Ms. Apple said, throwing her hands up. \"This isn't just a dance competition. Otherwise, we wouldn't all be in bikinis. C'mon Jessica, you need to shake that nice butt of yours or run your hands over your body or something. The only person who's going to get hard over that dance is your boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it,\" Jessica said, narrowing her eyebrows at Ms. Apple. \"I really didn't need that last piece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she has a point,\" Ms. Smart nodded. \"Remember, we all need to be fantastic for tomorrow's competition or we and thousands of other people are going to end up with some bundles of joy whether they want them or not. And I don't know about you, but I don't want mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica gulped and looked down at her belly, rubbing it slowly. <i>It's about more than just what I want</i>, she repeated to herself. <i>As much as I want to be pregnant...I have to think about everyone else</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then,\" Ms. Smart said, walking to the front and taking Jessica's place. \"Let me know what you think.\" Mariah hit the music and Ms. Smart leaped into the air, landing and throwing her hands up theatrically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terrible,\" Ms. Apple said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been two seconds!\" Ms. Smart yelled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Ms. Apple groaned. \"You really need work.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The park was, for now, largely empty. It wasn't a bad park. Far from it: large, open swaths of soft grass, plenty of paths with trees for walking, a small but respectable playground near a water fountain. Everything made this park picturesque for a walk with the family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was the problem: the city had hundreds of families in the making instead. The tension of so many people suddenly becoming pregnant, including plenty of men who never thought this was a problem they'd face, made the park less of an attraction in the past week or so. But, as the city's parks director said in a casual interview with the local paper, as she rubbed her twin-filled belly, \"we expect the park to become very crowded very soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the lack of foot traffic made the park an excellent place for Jack and Faye to continue their date. Faye was happy to have some secluded time with the young man who she found herself liking and wanting more and more as they spent time together. And Jack was happy to not have anyone around for his coin to affect. Since the accident at the fair, it was clear something strange was happening and the coin was even more potent than usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't the only thing strange about the coin. When Faye mentioned how she had one as well, she talked about it offering her some sort of \"power.\" Jack thought something was suspicious about Faye since she took the book that contained the coin's history and impregnated Mariah while she was at it. Was the coin putting some sort of agenda of its own into affect?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack?\" Faye said, interrupting Jack's train of thought. Jack blushed and turned back to his \"date.\" She smiled and gave a little chuckle. \"You...loosen your grip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked down and saw he was only barely holding Faye's hand now. \"S-sorry,\" he said, squeezing her hand back. Faye giggled and her smile grew, which only made Jack's heart beat faster. He only agreed to this date to get the coin and find a way to save everyone, especially Jessica. He'd loved her for years and now their relationship had become very real, very fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite how he knew he should feel, Jack couldn't help being attracted to Faye. It wasn't just her belly, although obviously her eight-month quadruplet tummy was always enthralling. But Faye also had smooth skin with a powerful \"pregnant glow,\" an extra-stacked chest to prepare for her coming children, and a beautiful face that was simultaneously mature and assuring while also being fun and friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're getting shy again,\" Faye said, moving one hand to Jack's cheek. \"And your face is so hot. Did you not want to go somewhere private?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no I did,\" Jack smiled, trembling. \"It's just...this is all a little surreal. I had a crush on you for...\" He paused, realizing the magnitude of the next admission. \"For years. E-ever since I was in middle school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye gave a little laugh and kissed Jack on the cheek again, moving one hand to his wrist and placing Jack's fingertips against her belly. \"Seems like we were both looking for one another, huh?\" She brought her lips away and began whispering in Jack's ear, pressing his hand more tightly against her pregnant swell, rubbing his palm in small circles. \"But it's alright now. I'm here for you now. All of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack heard chatter around some bushes and quickly moved away from Faye. She was about to protest but when two people walked around, she straightened up and brushed one lock of hair away, smiling. <i>He's like a deer standing up for the first time</i>, she thought to herself. <i>I'll have to be gentle with him...at first</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Why are you playing games? Take me from him!</span> Faye looked down at her pocket (or in her pocket's general direction, with her belly and breasts in the way of her view) and raised an eyebrow. She hadn't heard the coin's voice for a while now. <span class=\"clred\">Is something impeding me?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack tried to look casual as the other parkgoers walked by, but when he saw who they were, it was hard to stay relaxed. \"Oh...you're Lisa Smith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa sighed and nodded, smiling at Jack and Faye. \"Yes, hello. Fans of the show, I take it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I listen whenever I'm driving,\" Jack said, gulping as he looked at her belly. He'd heard that Lisa was pregnant now, but to actually see 101.9's beauty with such a big bump was something else. Then he turned to the woman next to Lisa and slowly pointed at her. \"Aren't you...Natalie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa and Natalie were careful to not look too intimate in public, since Lisa knew her future on the air as a sex symbol would be in jeopardy if people knew she was in a relationship with another woman. So when Jack pointed Natalie out, her face turned pale. \"Y-yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Amanda Dale's son,\" he explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie let out a big sigh and laughed. \"Oh, of course. How is your mom doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack shrugged. \"Still pregnant,\" he said with a nervous laugh, and Natalie replied with one of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope she'll come to the bikini contest,\" Lisa said with a more relaxed grin now. \"How about you, ma'am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" Faye said. \"I'm Amanda's neighbor, and don't worry, we're both entering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to meet the competition,\" Lisa chuckled, placing one hand on her belly. \"Wait, Dale? So you're Jack Dale? Are you Jr.?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's me,\" Jack said, remembering how Jessica signed him up to help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa let out another laugh and started walking again, patting Jack on the shoulder. \"Better rest up, in that case. You'll have a lot of work ahead of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack shuddered, not quite sure what Lisa meant as she and Natalie continued their walk, checking to make sure Jack and Faye were out of ear's reach when they started talking again. \"Thank God. I thought we'd be stuck with one ugly creep waiting on all of us,\" Lisa said, rubbing her hands across her belly in large circles to calm down her kicking triplets. \"He's not so bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But did you see the size of that woman?\" Natalie said, shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, worried she'll beat me?\" Lisa smirked, looking around before sneaking Natalie a kiss. \"I think you owe me lunch for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye smiled at Jack as his trembling continued. \"Another crush of yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-maybe,\" Jack said with a nervous smile. \"A-all my crushes seem to be getting pregnant lately. Jessica, Lisa. You.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's because you know exactly what you're doing with that coin,\" Faye said, rubbing her belly against Jack's sides. As she mentioned it, the strong itching feeling in Jack's head grew again. This time, it was even stronger than at the fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">I need to be freed!</span> the coin rasped in their ears. <span class=\"clred\">Having two of me at once...need to correct!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the itching became unbearable, Jack ripped the coin from his pocket and flipped it. As it fell through the air, Jack saw a group of people coming toward him and turned away in fear. Instead, he ended up laying his eyes on Natalie as the coin fell on Tails in his hand. It burned in his hand as a cry of surprise from down the park could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natalie!\" Lisa gasped as she gingerly put her hand on her lover's enormous belly. \"You...do you feel okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just...a bit heavy,\" Natalie moaned as she pressed her hands into her back. The jolt of her womb swelling with sextuplets tore the lower half of her shirt cleanly apart. \"But I guess this is how you feel most of the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda,\" Lisa said, putting one arm around Natalie's shoulders. \"Let's get you home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too late to sign up for the bikini contest, isn't it?\" Natalie said, giving a little laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afraid so,\" Lisa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stuffed the coin into his pocket again, and as he did so, Faye grabbed his arm, a panther-like grin on her face. Jack gulped. He recognized this expression on Faye's face from the first time she tried to seduce him. Something had changed and she was back to the way she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are we still on this silly date?\" Faye purred, pressing her belly hard against Jack's hips. \"We both know what we want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-we do?\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want this belly. You want this ass. You want these tits,\" Faye said. \"And I want you too. We're going. Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started dragging Jack by his arm, marching him through the park as she began rolling up her shirt to let her belly hang down. \"Where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My house,\" Faye said with a wink. \"There's still lots of redecorating to be done.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack and Faye walked back to his car, Faye holding his hand tightly the entire time. Something happened and the kind and cool Faye Jack had known all his life was back to being the sultry and intense woman she'd been in the last few days. Jack feared Faye would be like this when he first hatched the group's plan to get her distracted enough that he could take her coin but after spending the day on a date with his quadruplet-carrying neighbor, he was more worried about his own feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they got into Jack's car, Faye reached over and began kissing Jack. Her lips were wet, pink pillows and her tongue was so fast and strong, it could tie a cherry stem into a knot and then untie it in seconds. Jack's arms slowly tried to wrap around Faye, but she moved his hands to stroke her belly and breasts, letting out a purring laugh as she latched onto her young partner for the evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know what it's like,\" Faye cooed, nuzzling against Jack's shoulder, \"to wait all your life to carry life inside your womb and then to be stabbed in the back by the man you made a promise with. I need to get a clean slate. I need to make love with another man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack trembled as he felt Faye's nipples get hard in his hands. After losing Jessica and miraculously getting her back, he didn't want to ruin their relationship by having sex with Faye, even if his growing lap said otherwise. But getting the coin back and saving the people of the city from their unexpected pregnancies was more important. With his mind racing, Jack tried to think of how to have it both ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-dinner!\" Jack blurted out. Faye stopped and looked up, her eyelids still heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, Jack?\" she asked in her soft, breathy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner! A dinner date!\" Jack said, nodding quickly as if to tell himself <i>You're doing great, hang in there</i>. \"It's getting late and you're probably hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye paused and put one hand on her hip. \"And why exactly do you assume <u>I'm</u> hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...well...\" Jack stuttered, trying to dig himself out of his hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye's pout turned into a grin and she patted Jack on the arm. \"I'm just kidding. You're right, carrying around four little ones gives me an appetite to match.\" She patted her hands on her belly and her smile grew. \"You like it when I do this, don't you?\" Faye rolled up her shirt and fondled her bare belly, flicking her popped-out navel with her fingers. \"Ooh, that felt good. Remember that for later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's blush kept growing and he turned back to the steering wheel, turning the car on. \"Great, I could eat too. And what's more romantic than a dinner date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye leaned over and kissed Jack on the cheek. \"I see my lessons when you were younger didn't completely go to waste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack decided not to take Faye to the Italian restaurant he and Jessica had been going to recently. He wanted to keep some things pure. But as he was driving around, trying to think of where to go, he got a tap on the shoulder from Faye. \"There. Let's go there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked and gulped when he saw the establishment Faye was talking about. What was once a local dinner club with some shmoozy name had been redone as \"Belly Busters,\" complete with a sign featuring a pregnant waitress posing like a 1970s Playboy model, her bare belly sticking out from her uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard about it, but Charles never wanted to go,\" Faye sighed, her hands resting on top of her belly. \"But I doubt you'll have a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, no problem,\" Jack said, hands trembling as he pulled the key out of the ignition and walked around, helping Faye out of the passenger side. Since the coin's reality changes didn't seem to affect him, Jack was unaware of a pregnancy-themed restaurant popping up in response to all the craziness and chaos he had a hand in spreading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, there was old, sappy pop music playing while a middle-aged man stood at a small podium and smiled at them. \"Hello, welcome to Belly Busters. Do you have a reservation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Jack said, looking around at what he could see. The entry way to the restaurant was filled with framed photos of pregnant people posing by the sign, including local celebrities like Mia Vasquez. There was also a banner telling people to make sure they go to the Miss Stork Pregnant Bikini Contest tomorrow and highlighted how Belly Busters was a sponsor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine, we've got plenty of room,\" the man said, looking at Faye's belly. \"And this lovely, expectant woman is with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am,\" Faye smiled, linking arms with Jack and giving him another kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man reached over and rang a small bell. \"Attention everyone. We've got a mother-to-be and her gentleman friend visiting us tonight.\" The restaurant filled with applause. \"Would you like our 'eating for two' special booths?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye chuckled and patted her belly. \"I think I might need it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the man left the podium, his own large, swollen middle became visible, though it was still covered up under a suit and jacket. But as Jack and Faye went to their seat, the other waitresses waddling around did not have that same level of cover. Each woman had a large, round belly and their uniforms were cut specially to make sure it all hung out. <i>I wonder if Jessica would want to come here</i>... he wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you are,\" the host said, gesturing to a large booth. \"Your server will be Candice. Enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large booth was certainly necessary for Faye's quadruplet belly to fit in. The table was also higher up so her maternal gut fit right under it. \"This is nice,\" Jack nodded, opening up his menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It certainly is,\" Faye grinned, placing her shoeless foot in between Jack's legs. \"This big booth means we have more privacy now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Candice,\" their server said in a monotone as she waddled up. When she looked up, Jack and Faye both recognized her as the pregnant carny from the Ghost Mansion ride. If she recognized either of them, she didn't show it. \"Welcome to Belly Busters, where we hope you eat as much as your babies want.\" She then swung her hips and pressed her belly against Faye's. \"Sorry, company policy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, it's fine,\" Faye smiled, fluttering her eyelashes at Candice. \"I liked it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get you some drinks to start with?\" Candice said, getting out a small pen and handing it to Jack. \"Please write your orders on my belly. It's nice and firm so it makes for a good canvas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Jack said, his face turning pale. Faye reached over and pulled the pen out of his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about him,\" Faye chuckled. \"He just freezes up around pretty girls. I think I'll do the writing for today.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He likes women with big, pregnant tummies?\" Candice asked, her accent coming through as she raised her eyebrows. Jack looked away while Faye grinned and nodded, scribbling their orders onto Candice's belly. \"Interesting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, isn't this place fun?\" Faye giggled as Candice waddled away. Nearby, two servers bumped into one another and spilled sauce on their bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clean-up,\" another server said, ringing a small bell. All the surrounding pregnant employees waddled over with wet wipes and slowly stroked and cleaned the other servers' bellies in an improptu show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" Jack said, his face bright red. Faye reached over the table and put her hand over his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, honey. We're having fun. We're finally with the person we're meant to be with,\" Faye smiled, leaning in so her breasts rested on the table. \"What's on your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was about to open his mouth when his phone vibrated in his pocket. He didn't think Faye could hear, so he lied. \"I-I need to go to the bathroom,\" he said, hurrying out of his seat, darting past waitress bellies to get into the bathroom and stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at his phone, he saw he actually had two texts: one from Jessica and one from his mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;hows it going&gt; Jessica asked. Jack felt his heart sink. <i>She knows what you have to do and why</i>, he told himself. <i>You know you love her and she knows too</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;good so far. having dinner now. meet at her house soon&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Jack opened the text from Amanda, his mother. &lt;where r u?&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolled his eyes. Why did older people text like teenagers in a Law and Order episode? His hands hesitated before he texted his reply <br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;With Jessica for the night&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack got up, his phone buzzed again with a reply from Amanda again. &lt;ok be safe : )&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groaned and took a deep breath. <i>You have no idea, mom</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the restaurant, Jack ordered a relatively simple meal while Faye had plates of burgers and fries, finishing it all off in a flash. \"They really know how to feed pregnant women here,\" Faye smiled, rubbing her bare belly and making it shimmer with grease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finished dinner, Faye waddled out the front slowly while the host waved to them. \"Good night and thank you for coming to Belly Busters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Faye smiled, wrapping her hand around Jack's hips as soon as they left. \"I think my belly's safe, but I know something else that's about to bust.\" Jack blushed as her fingers moved closer to his erection. \"Better get to my place, shouldn't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack couldn't put it off any longer. The time to pull the trigger on their plan was now or never. \"Yes, please,\" he said, turning to Faye and putting one hand on her belly. \"Let's get you comfortable.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Somewhere beyond anyone's possible comprehension, in a void where everything was nothing and nothing was everything all at once, IT stirred, a smile creeping across it's thousands of mouths, showing the thousands of horrible dead teeth which which it ate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's all it did, was eat and cause chaos, and eat the chaos that it caused. It was growing fat and it was pleased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the hundreds of the horrible things blind eyes, it saw all. Not just from here, but everywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt saw the universe where it was the essence of energy drink, and the hundreds of possibilities that dwelled within that universe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt reveled in the universe where it was part of an amulet, with the chaos and discord that was spiraling out of control, even if it was locked into a battle with HER. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, it thought, she didn't matter. She was just a small thorn is it's many sides, and it was always up for a challenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt reached one of it's tumorous disfigured clawed hands through a mirror like surface, floating and twisting in the nothingness of everything, and with a cackle that has shattered souls, dropped a strange wooden box into another world, and watched with glee as two beautiful young women  picked it up from the flee market table, opening it to reveal a board game with big bellied figures and some dice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, it would watch this world with great interest, the horrible thing thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, it gazed fondly upon the world with the Coin. Yes, of all the horrible things the horrible thing had made to spread it's horrible influence, the world with the coin was it's favorite. The coin's works were so fruitful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA teacher living by herself, an actress coming home to visit, a young fool living with his parents, and countless other stories that were all independent worlds all connected in this universe by the coin, all feeding the horrible thing by causing chaos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching out several of it's disgusting clawed hands, it pulled down the long spiderweb like strands of destiny, and ate with them with a disgusting slurp, it's endless horrible hunger sated in a brief fleeting moment as it devoured the true destiny of all those who became affected by the horrible things horrible influence with it's horrible things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLURP. SLURP. Still it ate, as men and women's true destinies were altered, reshaped, reforged by the horrible thing's horrible toys across all the world it's horrible influence could reach. PING! Another strand of destiny was reforged as a young man destined to write a novel that would change the world was now forced to sell car insurance to take care of the twins he was now pregnant with thanks to the horrible thing's horrible things across the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horrible thing ate with contentment, growing fatter with each devoured strand of destiny. PING! Another new strand of destiny was reforged as a woman destined to become the greatest actress of all time was now a stay at home mother of four children she was now pregnant with thanks to the horrible thing's horrible thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt greedily clawed at the destiny that once was and ate it, making sure what once was could never possibly be again, it's other disgusting horrible taloned hands clapping together celebrating it's own horrible horribleness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt saw everything as it ate, it saw at husband and wife compare the size of their bellies, trying to figure out who was more pregnant, PING! It ate this strand with delight, all thanks to Jack Dale Jr. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, Jack Dale Jr was one of the horrible things favorite playthings, almost as much if not more that Jack's friend Ian. Both performed beyond the horrible things horrible imagination. The chaos it spread, the destinies that were rewritten, the FEAST! Soon, the horrible things horrible time would come. The horrible thing's dark works would not be able to be undone, and with all the eaten destinies, it would be closer to finally being free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coin was it's greatest power and it's greatest weakness. The drinks could not be undone, the game could not be undone, the coin could. <br>\r\nIf it was undone, it hurt the horrible things in the most horribly horrible ways possible. The work it would have to do! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horrible things didn't fix, it destroyed. It hated when it had to fix, in fact, fixing nearly kills it. However, for the horrible thing it rarely has to fix. <br>\r\nIt always made sure it never had to fix, it had it's tools, and right now, one such tool, Faye was close to making sure it would never have to fix this particular world in this particular universe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a risk whenever the coin came to one, that the horrible thing's works could be undone, but things always seemed to workout for the horrible thing. <br>\r\nAfter Jack, the coin would find itself in the hands of another, spreading it's horrible influence to another, and when that user was unable to break the horrible thing's horrible magic, it would be another step closer to being free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long horrible game the horrible thing was playing, but one day it would win\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned one of it's horrible rotten blind eyes to the mirror, and smiled with it's horrible teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - -- - Earth 01 Universe 01 - - - - - - - - - - [Jack's World]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah  and Jessica attempted to squeeze into the outfits giving to them by Ms. Smart and Ms. Apple. <br>\r\nI said attempt, because at this particular point, they had just managed to get the all black skin-tight sneaking catsuit just past their ankles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UMPH!\" Jessica said, trying to pull the catsuit higher up past her ass, which seemed a little more\u2026 ample than she remembered. <br>\r\n<i>This kids are really doing a number of you Jessie old girl</i> She thought to herself as she managed to pull the material past her her and then started on the vast fertitle expanse of her twin filled belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we really have to wear these? I mean look at it and look at us!\" Mariah said, trying to cram her pregnant form in the tight fitting, curve hugging catsuit. <br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Ms. Smart said from the couch, munching on the popcorn. She was enjoying the show and satisfying a craving, a win-win in her book. <br>\r\n\"These state of the art sneaking catsuit will muffle nearly every sound your uh.. larger form will make, making it sound like not even a mouse let alone an elephant was in the room\" Ms. Apple said, unaware that her words were very hurtful. <br>\r\n\"Elephant?\" Mariah said, tears welling up in her eyes. She knew she was very pregnant, but she was trying to watch her figure.<br>\r\n\"Poor choice of words from my associate, but you get the idea\" Ms. Smart said, munching on more popcorn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several moments of struggle, and some assistance from Ms. Smart and Ms. Apple, the two were full suited up in their black leather/classified material sneaking black catsuit, they're every maternal curve very much highlighted and undisplayed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look like Black Widow from the Avengers if she was hilariously pregnant!\" Jessica complained, looking over herself in the mirror. She looked sexy, but ridiculous as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tough shit, we payed a lot of money for those sneaking suits, and you're going to wear them. You're the only two who have a history with Jack and won't raise suspicion stealing back the book from that woman if you're seen around the mission area\" Ms. Apple responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's dangerous to go alone, take these\" Ms. Smart said, handing over what could only be described as a utility belt. <br>\r\n\"Really?\" Jessica asked with a complete <i>are you freaking kidding me?</i> look on her face.<br>\r\n\"Yes. Knock out spray, lock picking tools, place to hold your cell phone for easy communications, and everything else you might need for a mission like this\" Ms Apple explained showing each and every item on the utility belt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica and Mariah groaned as they fasten the utility belts under their round hugh pregnant leather clad bellies and around their ample backsides and hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they're ready. Get to the van. We will take them to the mission area\" Ms. Smart said hoisting herself off the couch and grabbing the van keys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Jessica and Mariah a few moments to learn how to walk in the catsuits, but it did seem to offer them a full range of motion and quite their steps<br>\r\n<i>Maybe I should keep this myself and Jack to use later\u2026 </i> Jessica thought catching a glimpse of herself in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hoisted themselves into the van, Ms. Apple started the van and drove them to Faye's den. After the two got out and prepared to start their mission, Ms. Smart turned to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want you to wish you good luck. We're all counting on you\" and with that the van drove off into the night, leaving the two very pregnant catsuit wearing would-be spies to their mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she just reference Airplane?\" Mariah asked. <br>\r\n\"Best not to think about it\" Jessica said. \"Come on, the faster we get this done, the faster we can get out of these things.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two woman waddled up to the front door of the house, and Jessica squatted down, and pulled out her lock pick...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica opened the door to Faye's home slowly and crept inside, her knees crying out in agony as she tried to crawl while seven months pregnant with two particularly large babies. Mariah didn't have it any easier, the coin deciding to make her full-term with twins from the get-go, so she had even less time to adjust to the weight of pregnancy. Once they made it inside, Mariah closed the door behind them as quietly as possible and the two surveyed the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The kitchen,\" Jessica whispered, pausing before standing up straight. \"No one's home.\" As she stood, hands on her hips, looking around the room, the moonlight illuminated her in the dark dining area. Mariah's eyes ran up and down Jessica's \"spy\" body, her catsuit clinging to Jessica like a second skin, showing just how large her breasts, belly, and ass had become over the past week. As Jessica paused to rub her belly, she looked over at her friend. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing,\" Mariah said. \"Just...Jack's very lucky to have you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica blushed and smiled, her hand giving her belly one last lingering rub. \"C'mon, let's snoop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the suits Ms. Smart and Apple gave Jessica and Mariah, spying while exceedingly pregnant proved to be tricky. They tried to quietly move through a doorway together, only to be stuck as their bellies blocked each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof,\" Jessica whined, stroking her now-sore maternal stomach. \"You first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" Mariah stammered. \"It should be you. Spy novels are about the only thing I <u>don't</u> read!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" Jessica said, thrusting her hips forward to try and use her womb's weight to her advantage, waddling and stumbling forward. Now they were in Faye's living room and Jessica had to steel herself when she saw the familiar sofa \u2014 the sofa where she first saw Jack kiss another woman. The same woman he was supposedly romancing now to give them both a chance to undo all the chaos the coin had created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica placed one hand against her belly and felt her twins press and kick against her palm. <i>Not all chaos is bad</i>, she remarked to herself, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica,\" Mariah said, patting her friend on the shoulder. \"Come on, let's keep looking.\" Jessica snapped out of it and joined Mariah at the bookshelf, flipping through each title and coming up with nothing. Their progress was impeded by their bellies constantly bumping against one another and throwing the other woman off-balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mariah, maybe you should have picked up at least one spy book,\" Jessica sighed, her hands clutching her belly from below. \"You sure don't have any common sense to go off of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sorry,\" Mariah said, taking a deep breath. \"Though it's not like you're any better of a spy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I picked the lock, didn't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you had some sort of super kit,\" Mariah said. The two young mothers-to-be continued to bicker, glad no one was in the house (as far as they knew) to see them. But they had caught the attention of one woman, currently hiding nearby, watching everything with binoculars: Nicole Zavaleta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe octuplet super-agent still had her senses sharped to the upmost degree and when she saw two pregnant women break into another woman's house, her interest immediately grew. Especially because next door was the infamous \"Dale family\" house she'd been keeping an eye on. But now that Zavaleta was watching Jessica and Mariah, she could tell they weren't burglars, but wanna-be spies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm impressed you're pulling this off while pregnant,\" Zavaleta said, one hand rubbing her massive belly, still excruciatingly tight and full of the sharpest, most painful fetal kicks imaginable. \"But your style is amateurish. Even with state-of-the-art suits, you're hardly better than a trainee at P.E.A.R. Well, a trainee after I instruct them, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica and Mariah finally groaned, standing up straight and pressing their hands into their backs. \"It's not here,\" Jessica sighed. \"Where to next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir bellies both rumbled at the same time and Mariah turned her eyes back to the kitchen. \"You know...since no one's here right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea,\" Jessica nodded waddling back to where they started. \"Can't be effective spies without energy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZavaleta groaned, both from annoyance and from a few kicks to her bladder. \"Ladies, you're giving all pregnant spies a bad name...maybe I should go in there myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the lights of a car passing by the house shone through the windows into the kitchen. Jessica and Mariah, mouths stuffed with sandwich meat and hands full of apples and pears, froze. \"Shee 'ere,\" Jessica grunted, trying to chew and swallow her quick meal as fast as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hide,\" Mariah said, looking around for a good place to go. They darted upstairs and waited by the top of the staircase, ready to listen to whatever was going on. \"Here, this looks as good a place as any.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Faye was stepping out of Jack's car, her hands on his cheek as soon as he helped her out. She leaned in for a kiss and Jack pulled away, making her eyes flash with anger. \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nothing, I'm just going to pull my car back into my own driveway,\" Jack said. \"Can you imagine what my mom would say if she saw my car in front of your house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye laughed softly and nodded. \"Alright baby. I'll just be inside waiting for you. This will give me time to get ready.\" She winked and started waddling back to her own house, moving as quickly as her quadruplet body could take her. And with a little pushing from the coin, it was surprisingly fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Faye headed for her stairs, which made Jessica and Mariah scurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey opened the door to Faye's bedroom and headed into her large bathroom and darted inside, pulling the shower curtain closed. Their bellies pressed together as they crouched down, Mariah's breasts directly in Jessica' face. \"S-sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no it's fine,\" Jessica replied quietly, hoping she wouldn't confirm her suspicions that Mariah was bustier this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye went into her bathroom as well and the two women could see her through through the edge of the curtain. Faye looked at herself in the mirror, smiling gently to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally,\" Faye purred, running her hands up and down her belly. \"You finally get to be treated like a woman, Faye.\" Then she took off her sweater and top, getting totally naked from the base of her belly all the way up to her head. The two almost gasped when they saw just how large Faye's pregnant stomach truly was. It was like two overgrown watermelons fused together, covered in smooth, glowing, unblemished skin. Her breasts had gotten exceptionally large as well, her nipples dark and full. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye dipped her hand into a small jar of cream and proceeded to rub it all over her body, from her belly to her arms to her bosom. Jessica felt Mariah's nipples harden as well, choosing not to say anything as she tried to move her face out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at you,\" Faye told her reflection, pouting her lips out. \"You're fertile, you're sexy, you're irresistible. You will make beautiful love tonight, Faye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Faye undid the front of her maternity pants and dropped them, showing her plump ass in her lingerie. But while Mariah was fixated on this detail, Jessica saw Faye reach into the back of her pants. Sandwiched between herself and her pants was the book! Holding it in her hands, Faye looked at the small tome for a few moments before she suddenly stood upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Faye said out loud. It was a different tone when she was talking to herself. \"Then where...yes, yes, fine.\" She dug the coin out of her pocket and studied it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">The coin!</font>\" Mariah hissed at Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is someone there?\" Faye yelled, looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faye?\" Jack's muffled voice said from downstairs. \"I said I'm here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye's startled face settled down to its usual lusty gaze and she stuffed her coin into the side of her underwear, waddling into her bedroom. \"Make yourself comfortable. I'll be right down, tiger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica and Mariah remained still as Faye slipped on a lingerie top and put on her same robe from the last time she seduced Jack and waddled downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were convinced she saw gone, the two women floundered and rolled out of the shower, stroking their sore tummies. \"That was close,\" Jessica panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But where's the book?\" Mariah said. \"She took it with her into her room...so it's somewhere else in the house now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least we know it's here now,\" Jessica nodded, quietly stepping out of the bathroom. \"Let's go back to snooping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-and Jessica?\" Mariah said, taking her friend's hand. \"Jack loves you. You know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica gave a little smile and nodded. \"Thanks, Mariah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah smiled and looked down, seeing Faye's clothes on the bathroom floor. Quickly, she picked one up and pressed it against her face, feeling Faye's warmth and cooing. <i>And I've got a new crush</i>.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack twiddled his fingers nervously before he heard the sound of the floor creaking near the top of the staircase. As someone currently living with a woman carrying quadruplets, the sound was all too familiar and he knew Faye was coming down. And was she ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye had her blue robe opened so her belly, now shiny from her oils and creams, stuck out proudly. The robe only concealed her breasts, already snug in a lingerie top Faye had picked out recently, but its thin fabric showed just how buxom Jack's expectant neighbor was. Her brown hair was undone and fell across her face and back and she grinned softly at her young lover as she gracefully stepped down to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack,\" she purred, stretching out one hand. \"It's a little hard for me to get down the stairs with this big, round tummy.\" She let her lips stretch out each adjective, knowing how much it tortured the pregnancy fetishist she was dating. Jack hurried over and took Faye's hand and felt her gently squeeze his as she made her way down and got close to him, pressing her belly against Jack's chest. \"There. Thank you, honey.\" Faye leaned in and kissed Jack on the cheek, lingering as she pecked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You're doing this for Jessica, you're doing this for Jessica</i>, Jack repeated to himself in his head over and over as Faye started to put her hands on him. As he felt his face get red, he looked around the living room, trying to distract himself. But as Jack's eyes went back to the staircase, he saw something that both put his mind at ease and made his heart sink: his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was peaking past the staircase and locked eyes with Jack. Faye was too busy trying to ease Jack's tension to notice, but Jack gave Jessica a small nod. Faye was sufficiently distracted for Jessica and Mariah to prowl around the house and find the book, and hopefully, Faye's coin too. Jessica gave Jack the \"ok\" sign with her hand and smiled weakly at him. It was still painful for both of them to have Jack's romancing of another woman be central to their plan, but at least they both acknowledged it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jessica pulled back, she bumped into Mariah's belly as her friend tried to peek down into the living room too. \"Mariah, what are you doing?\" Jessica whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just...scoping,\" Mariah lied, wanting to get another glimpse of Faye's half-naked pregnant body. The two pregnant spies crept back into the upstairs portion of Faye's house and started looking for the book, their bellies bumping against each other's at nearly every move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he knew the plan was going underway, Jack gave Faye more attention and ran one hand underneath her robe and up her back. Faye let out a little growl and lifted her head to look Jack straight in the eyes. \"Jack, moving fast already? I like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We both know how we feel,\" Jack said, his voice shaky. \"There's no point in being coy.\" He put his other hand on the side of Faye's belly and started to rub slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you're going to focus on my baby bump the whole time,\" Faye chuckled, pushing her hips forward so her belly rubbed against Jack more. \"I'm just teasing. I know what you like, babe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Faye lifted her shoulders and let her robe slip off. She stood before Jack, overly ripe with pregnancy and naked save for her underwear and revealing lingerie. Jack leaned forward and kissed Faye just above her breasts and felt his neighbor wrap her arms around his back and embrace him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your turn,\" Faye cooed, tugging on Jack's shirt. He nodded and backed away, taking off his t-shirt. Faye smiled and wagged one finger at him. \"No, no. Be fair now. All of it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Faye,\" Jack said, forcing a smile. \"Let's not go too fast here. We should try to...enjoy each other's bodies first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have to do the deed just yet,\" Faye chuckled, resting one hand on her massive belly. \"But if I'm going to stand here in nothing but my bra and panties, you should at least take your pants off. Or do you want me to do it for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack shuddered but the answer was obvious. \"Y-you do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye wiggled her eyebrows and started prowling toward Jack, her fingers stroking the impression of his erection as she found the zipper. After getting his pants undone, Faye pulled them down, her face dangerously close to his penis. From over the thin fabric of his underwear, Faye gently pressed her lips against his member, giving it faint kisses as she moved up and down its length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Jessica</i>, Jack cried out in his head. <i>You'd better be working fast or I'll end up going further with Faye and I think you wanted</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still so nervous,\" Faye purred as she stood up, her belly rubbing all the way up Jack's body as she moved. \"You poor thing. Your little girlfriend must not do much with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We...haven't been together that long, true,\" Jack said, his cheeks turning red. How much did Faye know about Jessica?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pregnant woman in her 40s tutted as she got closer and closer to Jack's face. \"Sometimes immature women can be like that. But not me. Come on, I'll take excellent care of you.\" With that, Jack and Faye kissed on the lips once more, this time uninterrupted. Faye's tongue gently teased Jack's before the two intertwined and lapped at each other. As they kissed, Faye moved one of Jack's hands to her breast and squeezed it, letting out small coos of bliss as she felt his grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two began fondling and kissing one another's bare skin, Jessica and Mariah were moving around upstairs, trying to find the book that contains all the necessary information to combat the coin that caused so many people so much trouble. And they weren't getting any closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where could it be?\" Mariah sighed. \"She didn't have that long to hide it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we focus on the most likely place?\" Jessica said. \"The bedroom? That's where she was, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense,\" Mariah nodded. The two women waddled back into Faye's room, carefully moving through the doorway to not get stuck again. Both women used the toolbelts Ms. Smart gave them, using a little light to go through all the belongings and tiny pliers to find hidden cabinets or compartments. In both departments, they came up short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is crazy,\" Jessica whispered. \"There's no way she could still have it with her. I mean, she was basically naked when she left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes she was,\" Mariah said, a smile curling up on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mariah, focus,\" Jessica said, snapping her finger in Mariah's face as she got close to her friend. \"Now use your crazy huge brain and think: where would she hide it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah stroked her belly in thought as the digital clock just above Faye's bed displayed 11:59 PM. \"If the book is that important to her, she must have put it somewhere that's not only hidden, but probably has some kind of personal meaning to her...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, Faye now had her bra off and was encouraging Jack's to kiss and suck on her bare breasts, which he did without must prompting. As he motorboated his heavily pregnant neighbor, Faye slipped off their underwear and positioned herself above Jack. \"Ready, sexy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack wanted to avoid this as much as possible, but he was hitting a dead end. \"Y-yes, Faye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the clock hit midnight, Faye's belly surged in size and Jack scurried out of the way as the woman before him was now a full nine months pregnant with quadruplets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpstairs, Jessica's belly also grew and tore through the special suit provided for her. As her twin-filled belly went from seven months to eight months, it bumped against Mariah, who was already uncoordinated, and her friend fell to the ground, rolling around to try and get back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mariah!\" Jessica cried out as the bed before them started to move and the bedsheets squirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's there?\" a weak voice said from under the covers. An arm through them off and Jessica tried not to scream out loud. Charles, Faye's adulterous husband, was lying on the bed and was clearly a victim of the coin's wrath. The entire king-sized bed was filled with his pregnant stomach, swollen, discolored, and covered in stretch marks. And underneath his belly, Jessica and Mariah could see the familiar spine of the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run!\" Jessica hollered, grabbing the book and waddling out as quickly as she could, which wasn't very fast at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd downstairs-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Downstairs, as Jessica and Mariah grabbed the book from under Faye's enormous pregnant husband, Faye was preparing to slide Jack's erect member inside her. \"What's the matter, sexy?\" Faye purred as Jack moved away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your...your belly,\" Jack said, pointing at Faye's nine-month quadruplet belly, suddenly growing in front of him. Jack had heard that the belly \"popped\" and grew even faster toward the end and the same was true of Faye's super-sized pregnancy. She was already incredibly huge before, but now, Jack had a hard time believing his eyes when he saw Faye's belly. \"It's huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye giggled and ran her hands up and down her swollen womb. \"I know. Isn't it great?\" She chuckled and leaned toward Jack, pressing her round gut against him. \"I'm going to be a mother like I always wanted and I look damn good doing it. Don't you agree?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you weren't that big a second ago,\" Jack protested. He knew the coin warped reality for her, but surely, she could still tell that her uterus just got about seven pounds heavier. \"Can't you tell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye raised one eyebrow. \"Oh, like if a certain magical coin had made me pregnant?\" Jack gulped and felt Faye press against his genitals with her pregnant weight. And not in a fun, sexy way. \"You <u>do</u> know about the coin, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack started to quiver as Faye put her hands on his shoulders. \"I...I know it causes pregnancies, just like you told me earlier on our date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like being lied to, Jack,\" Faye said, tightening her grip. \"My husband lied to me when he got that red-headed slut pregnant and you're lying to me now. You want to use the coin to get control over the pregnant women you lust after and you're going to take away my babies to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Jack said, genuinely confused now. \"No, Faye, I admit I know about the coin's powers but I don't have any kind of agenda against you. I just want to fix things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">He's trying to trick you, Faye</span> the coin hissed in Faye's ear. She slid her hands into her bra on the floor and brought out the coin, holding it up to Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe you,\" Faye said, a smile growing on her face. \"Now, take your pick: you can either say something I find convincing or I can flip this coin and see how you end up.\" She laughed. \"The last time I flipped the coin angry, my husband Charles...well, it's a good thing you like big bellies. Let's put it that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack shuddered and put one hand around Faye's naked hips. \"D-don't be crazy now, Faye. Why don't we go back to fooling around?\" He gave her butt a light squeeze. \"Y-you sexy momma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we'll have sex,\" Faye smirked. \"Belly or no belly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Faye flipped the coin, she heard a commotion from upstairs and a shout. \"Faye!\" Charles' weak voice cried out. \"Burglars!\" The noise caught Faye's attention and she turned around, her eyes catching Jessica as she and Mariah waddled down the stairs as quickly as they could. Jessica let out another moan and stumbled as her belly swelled again, ripping her spy suit even further. Not only was more of her belly visible, but her thighs, ass, and bust grew and began to rip apart the material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" Faye barked. Jack looked between Faye and his two spying companions to see the book in Mariah's hands. As Faye grit her teeth and prepared to flip the coin again, Jack leaned in and sucked on her popped-out navel as hard as he could. \"Aaaah~\" Faye squealed, her knees getting weak as her face went bright red. Jack spun off of her embrace and she fell to the couch, dizzy. He grabbed his pants and jumped into them as he ran with Jessica and Mariah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got it,\" Mariah panted as she tried to waddle fast. Jack modified his pace to keep up with both of them, but he could easily outpace both Mariah and Jessica, whose belly now resembled Faye's a few minutes before midnight struck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slight (huff) side (huff) effect (huff) though,\" Jessica gasped, rubbing her new belly for support as she slowly jogged. \"Your (huff) house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack turned around and saw Faye standing in her doorway, still naked, with a grin on her face. In a second, she darted forward, moving as fast as Jack, if not faster. \"Bad idea,\" Jack said, trying to pick up his pace and putting his arms around Jessica and Mariah's upper backs to try and move them forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Strength to the chosen one</span> Jack's coin hissed in his ear. Zavaleta watched with intrigue, especially at Faye's movements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it punished me, it must be helping her,\" Zavaleta said to herself, stroking her belly. \"This is very interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack managed to make it to his car in time and loaded his two pregnant comrades inside. As he drove off, Faye's speed increased until she was keeping up with the car itself. \"Damn,\" Jack said, looking into the rearview mirror to see the swollen beauty getting within arm's reach of him. \"She's getting faster and faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye was soon running parallel to the car, looking into the driver's side window and winking at Jack. \"You can't run away forever, babe,\" she purred. With a quick kick to the front of the car, it sputtered and swerved, slowing down considerably. \"A little chaos for your car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, damn, damn!\" Jack yelled, slamming his fists against the steering wheel. He jumped to the passenger side door and got it open and tried to open the back door too, reaching for Jessica. \"C'mon, we've got to run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm too heavy,\" Jessica moaned, her hands rubbing her enormous belly. \"I'm too pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you're not. You can do anything!\" Jack said, pulling her toward him. \"We're not far from your house now. We can make it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a good thing I got distracted by my husband,\" Faye smiled, waddling around the car to where Jack stood. \"If I was still angry, your girlfriend would be as big as a whale right now. Though I'm sure you'd like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah sweated and opened her door. \"You two, run!\" Mariah said as she waddled in front of Faye, using her belly to block Faye's path. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Jack picked up Jessica and the book and ran with her in his arms, her belly brushing against his face as he got to her house. \"Got your key?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next best thing,\" Jessica said, taking off her toolkit and unlocking her house. \"Let's go.\" Jack ran up her stairs and dropped Jessica into her bed. Immediately, the two started kissing and holding each other tightly and for the second time that night, Jack got naked and got intimate with a woman pregnant with quadruplets. Only this time, he went all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Faye had Mariah by the wrists. \"Are you okay? I don't want to actually hurt any of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm f-fine,\" Mariah nodded, her face blushing more than she'd ever blushed as she stared at Faye's naked body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well as long as I've got you,\" Faye said. \"You'll tell me about your little plot and why you broke into my house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Mariah said, her eyes still bugged out. \"I'll do anything you want, Faye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was easy,\" Faye laughed, putting her arm around Mariah's shoulder. As soon as she touched Mariah, Jessica's bookish friend dove into Faye's embrace and hugged her tightly. \"Oh...okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we going back to your home, Faye?\" Mariah whimpered as Faye's chest muffled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Faye said with a curious tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Mariah sighed, tightening her hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice look, ladies,\" a group of boys walking down the sidewalk shouted at them. \"Bellies are a little big, but I like the effort.\" Faye rolled her eyes and flipped the coin and the boys ran off screaming as their stomachs swelled.</span></div></div>",

We have a photo session before we compete tomorrow\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross town, in a small two-story house, Lisa Smith and her now pregnant lover Natalie were having a very serious conversation about Natalie's new \"condition\", while also enjoying the supple expanses of both of their bodies.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zavaleta struggled to type on Tara's computer, though she would never admit it. The usual method of sitting at a computer, looking forward, and using it did not work for a woman with several feet of pregnant belly in front of her. Zavaleta was large and strong, but her arms didn't reach <u>that</u> far. Instead, she used an awkward half-turn to be able to work on the computer, compiling all the information she'd gathered lately. This position contorted her muscles and organs some, and on top of her extremely difficult pregnancy, it would have been enough to retire a normal person. But Zavaleta was far from normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen's blue light shone over her naked body as she digested news stories about the \"NIH\" leaving the city, knowing well and good it was all a front for P.E.A.R. to make its way into the city and try and find that accursed coin. \"This Vasquez woman is quite something,\" Zavaleta chuckled to herself, stroking a large bulge on the side of her belly where one of her children preferred to kick and squirm. She'd already decided this one would grow up to be a trainer in the military after a healthy and prosperous career as a star in high school and college sports. \"It's a good thing she scared off P.E.A.R. would she likely would have dug up some very embarrassing secrets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.E.A.R. leaving the city meant that Zavaleta was all on her own, a prospect that only made her grin more. She was always frustrated with having to support less skilled operatives in the field and reminisced about the days in her 20s when it was just her and a toolkit alone in the plains of Eastern Europe, undoing the various schemes of nefarious groups singlehandedly. This was her chance to do it all over again, but instead of separatists, cartels, and gangs, it was several sloppy pregnant men and women living in the suburbs. And a coin created by a multi-dimentional demon, just to make things even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZavaleta looked over her notes again and marched into Tara's room, butting her gently with her belly. \"Tara, please wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snwha?\" Tara mumbled as she looked up, only seeing Zavaleta's truly massive pale pregnant belly. She sat up slowly, still not used to being pregnant with triplets instead of just one baby (not realizing all of her babies were put in her womb within the last few days thanks to Brandon's coin-flipping), and rubbed her eyes. \"Zavaleta? It's...it's after midnight. What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm giving you an update,\" Zavaleta said. \"I was out gathering information all night and there are several big developments. I also have some questions for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara rubbed her eyes again as Zavaleta sat on the edge of her bed, tilting the mattress with her incredible maternal weight. \"Are you naked again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clothing is distracting,\" Zavaleta said. \"When your senses are as heightened as mine, even a thread against your skin attracts significant attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara turned on her bedsight lamp and looked over Zavaleta's tight, nude pregnant body. \"You're in your 60s, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct,\" Zavaleta nodded. Tara gulped. <i>I hope I look that good at her age</i>. \"Now then, first piece of news: the government agents testing all citizens for pregnancy are no longer in the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, I knew that already,\" Tara groaned. \"It's been all over the local news. You woke me up for that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZavaleta grit her teeth. \"I also may have some leads on information very important to me that relates to the 'pregnancy disease' as you call it. If I reveal to you top secret information, and I mean <u><b>top</b></u> secret, can you keep it silent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...sure,\" Tara said, scratching her head. \"I'm not sure why you're trusting me with that, though. We barely know each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true,\" Zavaleta said, crossing her arms and pressing her large breasts more tightly against the rest of her body. \"But I've come to have a respect and admiration for you. We've spent a lot of time together and I may feel a bit...motherly toward you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara gave a little smile. \"That's sweet, Nicole. I'm sure you'll be a great mom when your babies come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZavaleta smiled and started stroking her huge belly. \"Pregnancy has not been easy but it will all be worth it...ahem!\" She tightened her face back up and straightened her back. \"Now then, the secret: without giving too much away, the 'mysterious pregnancies' have an identified source related to a few particular individuals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone is making all of us pregnant?\" Tara said with shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not always intentionally, but yes,\" Zavaleta nodded. \"So I need to ask you what you know about a few people in this city who I believe you have had some contact with. First, Faye Jones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faye Jones,\" Tara said, stroking her chin. \"Doesn't ring a bell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZavaleta tapped her fingers on her belly. \"Jessica Lindsford.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica...yeah, that's a friend of my co-worker's son. They might actually be dating,\" Tara said. \"She's pregnant from what I could tell, but who isn't nowadays? She was nice it seemed. I don't know much else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack Dale Jr.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara's face changed and she looked down with a light blush. \"Zavaleta, are you telling me Jack's the reason for two extra babies showing up inside me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't answer questions like that either way,\" Zavaleta said. \"I can't reveal too much about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was with him when it happened,\" Tara said. \"And he's the son of a co-worker I was telling you about. You met him at the office baby shower, after all. I think he has a thing for pregnant bellies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" Zavaleta said, making mental notes. There was no doubt in her mind now. She now had the location of all three coins: one was a prize in the bikini contest, one was used by Faye when Jessica, Mariah, and Jack were fleeing her house, and Jack's constant proximity made him a prime suspect too good to rationalize away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...I may have a crush on him,\" Tara said in a small voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Zavaleta said, clearing her throat. \"I-I'm not really very good at talking about things like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He treated me nicer than any other guy since I had this belly,\" Tara said, looking down at her own exposed stomach. \"Even if it was just because he likes round tummies, it felt genuine. And I've been so lonely for so long...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should let you sleep,\" Zavaleta said, slowly getting up before Tara grabbed her wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to be a mother?\" Tara said, her voice shaking. \"Then you need to listen to your kid's problems. Take this as practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Zavaleta nodded moving back toward Tara. The younger woman blushed as the naked, Amazon-like pregnant soldier moved closer, holding Tara in her arms. \"Tell me your problems, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara gulped, not expecting Zavaleta to go this far. \"W-well...I got pregnant off of a one-night stand and my job's stable enough to support one baby but I'm worried about what it'll be like with three. Plus it's not exactly easy to date with infant triplets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem like a very strong woman,\" Zavaleta said. \"Do you need a man in your life? I never did. Sure, there was the occasional fling on the field but that's standard spy behavior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara shrugged. \"It would be nice not to sleep alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" Zavaleta nodded, lifting the blankets and cuddling against Tara. \"I will join you in bed tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-t-that's not necessary,\" Tara panicked as Zavaleta hugged her tightly against her naked bosom and belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense. We are already very close,\" Zavaleta said. \"And this may help me sleep as well.\" She kissed Tara on the forehead and shut her eyes. \"Goodnight, Tara Azem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-goodnight, Nicole,\" Tara said, sighing and accepting the gigantic woman's embrace. To be honest, she felt more comfortable with Zavaleta and her ridiculous belly beside her than she'd felt in many, many months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The intrepid reporter Mia Vasquez was, even into the late hours of the night, typing away at her laptop, writing and researching her next big story. There were still questions to be asked about the role of the mysterious P.E.A.R. that took over the city and what this meant for the rest of the country, let alone their small scrap of land, but that wasn't what Mia was working on now. With all of the pregnant women in the city, the lack of paid maternity leave in most public and private institutions was going to become a huge issue. And this wasn't just a problem started by the \"pregnancy disease.\" Women like Mia were pregnant before all this started up (she believed, thanks to the coin's \"reality rewrite\") so this problem was coming down the pipe for months now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia paused and studied her screen for a few seconds. She went back and included a small paragraph about paternity leave, since the city also had a rash of pregnant men, some even before the pregnancy disease, oddly enough. But that was a story she already had in the works too. In fact, Mia had so many reports ready, these two were just going to close the gap while she was resting from having her triplets. Thankfully, her news station <u>did</u> have maternity leave in its contract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she made it a few more lines down, Mia sighed and looked down at her bare belly. Sure, she was a skilled and excited journalist, but that wasn't the sole reason she was working at night. She was trying to get her mind off the fact that she was 40 weeks pregnant with triplets and single. They were the product of a relationship that ended the second Mia revealed that she was expectant to her then-lover. The station paid Mia well enough that she thought she could support three babies on her own, but it wouldn't be easy. And for the moment, Mia just felt alone more than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA kick from inside her womb drew Mia's attention and she chuckled slightly. \"It's hard to be truly alone with you three always squirming around in there, I suppose,\" Mia sighed. Her story had a good amount of progress as it was and she closed out, bringing up her music library instead. \"I know what will calm you all down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia put on the song she'd been playing for her dance routine and stepped out of her chair to get near the closest mirror. She was already in nothing but a bra and a pair of maternity underwear. It was stretched as far up her belly as it could go, but Mia pouted a little and rolled it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not too sexy,\" she said, showing more of her smooth pregnant curve. \"There, that's more like it.\" As the music picked up, Mia stepped gracefully forward and back, turning in place. Then, in synch with each of the quick note changes, she moved her arms and hips, making beautiful swaths in the air with her hands and wiggling her belly around rapidly. As she started to get more into it, Mia heard her doorbell ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing the song, Mia waddled to her door and looked through her window before smiling brightly. She swung the door open and her co-worker, Brooke Roberts, smiled back before she saw how Mia was dressed. Then her face turned to a look of shock. \"M-Mia? Hi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Brooke! Come on in!\" Mia beamed, waving Brooke inside. \"I don't think you've ever come by before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think you're right,\" Brooke said, looking over Mia in wonder. \"Forgive me for being so forward but...you look amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Latina reporter smiled sweetly and placed her hands against her belly. \"You're too nice. Although I have to say, I've loved being pregnant and I catch myself just staring at my belly in the mirror.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't look that good when I had my kids,\" Brooke said, hands on her hips. \"And I got to hide my belly behind the anchor's desk. You were out on the street every day with the cameras on you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia laughed, rubbing where she felt kicks. \"Oh, I'm sure if I was in your position, I'd have tried to hide it too. My articles got so many comments from people who thought my baby bump was sexy. It got creepy after a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke smiled. \"Well you may have that chance if you ever get pregnant again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Mia said, her smile fading into a look of confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're getting promoted,\" Brooke said, walking closer to Mia. \"You're going to be anchoring with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia felt herself shake as she brought her hands to her cheeks. \"A-are you serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely. The work you've been doing over the past few months has put this station on the national map. You're incredible and we need your talents in a higher place,\" Brooke nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about Rick?\" Mia said, her voice lowering some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rick...is taking up an opportunity somewhere else,\" Brooke said, her smile tightening. \"I wouldn't think about him if I were you.\" Brooke studied Mia's face and chuckled. \"So, happy? Sad? Terrified?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"#1 and #3,\" Mia laughed, grabbing Brooke and bringing her in for a tight hug. \"This is incredible! I...thank you! Thank you for believing in me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Brooke laughed nervously, feeling herself crushed by Mia's belly. \"And we'll talk more about the transition when you get out of your maternity leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Starting tomorrow,\" Mia sighed as she broke the hug and looked down at her belly. \"I'll miss the belly when this is all over, but I want to meet these three so badly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your belly is popular, I'll give you that,\" Brooke smiled, placing her hand on Mia's bare gut. \"I guess this is my sneak preview of the bikini contest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Do you want a real sneak preview?\" Mia said, waddling back to her laptop. \"I was just about to practice my dance again but I'd love some feedback.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Brooke chuckled, never seeing a pregnant woman dance up close before. When she had her children, dancing was the furthest thing from her mind. \"I'd love to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia put the music back on from the start and did her graceful steps, then moved to her hip and arm movements. Brooke smiled softly and nodded as Mia danced a beautiful, traditional salsa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the beat dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia turned around and gripped the wall, twerking her ass as hard as she could, showing off just how large pregnancy had made it. Then she turned around and shook her belly around with gusto, making sure her breasts jiggled right along with the rest of her. The rest of the dance was a mix between her quick steps and belly/ass/boob shaking. When the song ended, Mia was dripping with sweat and panting. \"S-so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke's eyes were as big as dinner plates as she collected her thoughts. \"It's...unique.\"</span></div></div>",

There was no lighting in their bedroom except for the light blue of the moon coming in through the window and blinds. Lisa was still far too protective of her privacy to even allow for the chance of someone seeing her and Natalie share a bed, even if they were on the second floor of their house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's probably worse for you,\" Lisa giggled, rubbing one hand up and down Natalie's belly while her own triplet stomach was laying there for her partner to caress. \"You're more than twice my size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because I'm short,\" Natalie pouted, puffing her cheeks out childishly. \"But it does feel like a lot in there...I'm kind of scared by how many might be inside me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, you're probably overestimating the number,\" Lisa laughed again, putting her hand on top of Natalie's and guiding her around her belly. \"I'm only carrying triplets, right?\" They both had a little laugh at that. \"Only\" triplets. \"Well when they're active, it feels like I'm carrying a baseball team in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I have to wait for an ultrasound before we know for sure?\" Natalie asked, her eyes turning back to her own stomach, its size filling their shared bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa paused, her loving, playful expression fading. \"I think it's better if we stay away from the hospital for at least a few days. I know those government goons packed up and left but...I'm still worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always cautious,\" Natalie sighed, shaking her head, tossing her brown hair around a bit. \"So unlike your impulsive radio persona.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you like when I'm Miss Lisa,\" the pregnant blond bombshell cooed, tracing her hand down to Natalie's naked breasts, touching the spots she knew intimately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stop!\" Natalie panted, and not in the usual cute way. \"You don't want to go to the hospital because you're afraid of us being seen together. You're afraid of people knowing we're together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natalie...babe, that's not it,\" Lisa said, moving her hand from Natalie's chest back to her belly. She felt a little body nuzzling against her palm but didn't think now was the best time to bring it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, it's not that you don't want people to know we're together. You just don't want people to know you're in a relationship with a woman,\" Natalie said, her face tightening up as she glared at her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa sighed and moved to sit next to Natalie in bed, her hands wrapped underneath her belly. \"Nat, please, we've talked about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're having children together,\" Natalie said, turning to Lisa, looking her right in the eyes. \"Both of us now. I want the same respect all the other expectant parents in the city have and be able to openly raise these babies with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But my job-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck your job! If you think you'll get fired for being a lesbian, why do you still work there?\" Natalie yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...love it,\" Lisa sighed. \"Being part of a shock jock morning show is so sleazy and fake and wild and I love it. I'm not like you: working in an office would drive me crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so I'm plain and regular so I can waste away in an office, but the great Lisa Smith has to radiate out,\" Natalie scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nat, you know I don't mean it like that,\" Lisa said, grasping her lover's hands. \"You are the most incredible person I know. You're smart, you're funny, you're a hell of a lot sexier than I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop,\" Natalie said with a little smile as she rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, since getting pregnant, you'd have to agree with me now,\" Lisa smiled, turning to press her belly against Natalie's. \"I mean, imagine me with that big bump.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie's face started to burn as she bit her lower lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now imagine me in a bikini too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie turned back to Lisa, her breathing starting to get heavy. \"D-don't distract me. Can't you work at another place that will let you be...sleazy and still be who you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where? This is the biggest radio station in the metropolitan area and...we can't exactly move now. We've got who-knows-how-many kids to raise soon.\" Lisa put her hand against Natalie's belly and traced its full size. \"Very soon, I'd guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't want to be in secret much longer, especially when I'm pushing your babies out,\" Natalie pouted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa sighed. \"I know. I feel the same way, deep down.\" She placed her hand on both of their bellies where they touched. \"I'll figure something out. Honestly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie's smile grew and she hugged Lisa tightly, grunting as she tried to figure out a way for them to pull it off with their respective bellies. \"It's heavy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It gets easier with time,\" Lisa laughed. \"At least it hasn't gotten much bigger on me...but I don't know about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't joke about that,\" Natalie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, Oven blew up quickly and he's still getting chunkier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lee-saa!\" Natalie whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, getting nervous or getting turned on?\" Lisa cackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pause. \"Both,\" Natalie squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa grinned and gripped her lover, lying her back on the bed and climbing on top of her, wrapping her hands around Natalie's belly. \"Let me do my own informal ultrasound, huh? I'm just as curious as you to find out how many are in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please,\" Natalie said, squeezing her breasts together with her arms as her body quivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feels like more than one for sure,\" Lisa purred, rubbing her partner's gigantic round stomach slowly. \"There's another...and another.\" The phone rang in another room and Lisa looked around Natalie's belly into her eyes. \"Ignore it. It's probably just Oven. He complains about symptoms every night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" Natalie said. \"Keep going...Miss Lisa.\"</span></div></div>",

Jessica let out a sigh and turned to him, her eyes studying his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure about this?\" Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'm sure. You're so much more amazing than Faye and my mom is my mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not about that, dummy,\" Jessica said, rolling her eyes. \"I know I'm hot and I've never felt sexier than when I've been pregnant but...I can't ask you to be a father and a parent if this doesn't work out anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Brandon said, removing his hands from Jessica's belly. She kept them rested on top of her massive bulge, rubbing in small circles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twins are one thing and you're an amazing guy for agreeing to that,\" Jessica said. \"But now I've got another two in there. That's four babies to raise at once and you're not even the father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's my fault,\" Brandon said, his voice getting quieter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the first two were,\" Jessica said with a little laugh, moving one hand under his chin so he'd look back into her eyes. \"These new tenants are Faye's fault and I'm placing the whole blame on her now.\" She wrapped her arms around her belly and puffed out as much as she could, showing off her size. \"You break it, you buy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon let out a nervous laugh of his own. \"But see? It's stuff like that that makes me like you, Jessica. I've always liked you. And in these past few days...\" He reached one hand around Jessica's back, pulling them as close together as her belly would allow. \"I think I love you too. I've never felt this way about another woman before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop,\" Jessica said, looking away as her face got red. \"Seriously, you don't have to do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's work together,\" Brandon said, hugging Jessica with both arms, feeling her face against his chest. \"We'll put everything we have into getting that coin back and beating Faye and turning the whole town back to the way it was.\" He pulled away and smiled at Jessica. They could both tell they were starting to cry a little. \"Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Jessica nodded. \"I'll dominate the bikini contest and get that third coin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you will,\" Brandon said, leaning in to her lips. \"I'd vote for your big belly in a heartbeat.\" They kissed and let their hands travel down to Jessica's belly, stroking it as they moved their tongues around in each other's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica gave a small giggle and rubbed her belly gently when they broke the kiss, moving her hands up and down her massive expanse. \"You're sweet,\" she said. \"Isn't this better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Us being open about this,\" Jessica said, patting her belly. \"How much we like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon laughed in reply. \"I see what you mean. It's like a...a weight's been lifted or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I don't think I need to remind you how much I like it when you describe my pregnant body,\" Jessica purred. \"Only now, you've got more room to do it in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon shifted positions so he was looking directly at Jessica's enormous pregnant middle, his hands softly caressing each side. \"Hmm, since you're at quadruplets now, I guess I need to do it again. You're like the queen of pregnancy now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww,\" Jessica smiled, feeling her toes curl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you've got this great, smooth skin,\" Brandon smiled, tracing one finger across her belly. \"It makes me just want to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, say it,\" Jessica panted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon pounced, kissing Jessica all over her breasts and neck as his lap rubbed against her belly. \"I guess I'm having sex with a quadruplet-carrying woman tonight after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And not just anyone,\" Jessica smiled, reaching over and removing Brandon's shirt. \"The future winner of the Miss Stork Pregnant Bikini Contest. By definition the sexiest pregnant woman in the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No arguments there,\" Brandon said, nearly ripping his pants getting them off. As they fumbled around to get appropriately undressed, Brandon had Jessica's belly smack him in the face several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Jessica laughed, sticking her tongue out. \"I'm not that used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No complaints,\" Brandon smiled, sucking on her popped-out navel. Jessica groaned and gripped the bedsheets as her hands stroked her swollen womb. \"Too much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just...everything's a lot more sensitive now,\" Jessica panted. \"I told you how the...the moment is more intense since getting pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Brandon said, his face heating up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bet it'll be insane now,\" Jessica grinned, biting one of her fingers as she spread her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I say we test that hypothesis,\" Brandon gulped, putting his hands around Jessica's big pregnant body, trying to find the best positioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-can we stop talking my coy nerds and just fuck already?\" Jessica laughed, thrusting forward and positioning herself on top of Brandon. \"There we go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they need all three coins to do this?\" Faye said, tapping one finger to her lips. \"That explains a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes it does,\" Mariah said, trembling as she stood in front of Faye, hands behind her back. \"S-so do I get a-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right,\" Faye smiled, running the tip of her pinkie down Mariah's belly. Jessica's bookworm friend shuddered where she stood as the sultry housewife gave her pregnant stomach a light stroke. \"Now how do they know this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it was in the book,\" Mariah panted, squeezing one hand with the other. \"The one we stole from you. It's a diary of every piece of information we know about the coin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">I've told you far more than that book would</span> the coin's demonic essence whispered in Faye's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet,\" Faye said in a low voice before running one foot up the side of Mariah's leg. \"Now then, dear, what else did that book say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we...they don't undo everything tomorrow night, all the pregnancies will be permanent,\" Mariah squeaked as her knees got weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow night?\" Faye chuckled. \"How convenient. Why then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-because you were the first person the coin got pregnant,\" Mariah groaned, her face getting redder and redder as Faye's foot got closer between Mariah's legs. \"A-and you'll give birth soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye pounded her couch with her fist, enough to make Mariah yelp and jump. \"So I was right. They <u>are</u> trying to take my babies away,\" she growled. \"Then I really will stop them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-and that's not all,\" Mariah squeaked. \"I mean...if you want to hear more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye's mask of fury turned quickly to her flirty face as she heaved herself up and waddled around Mariah, occasionally giving her a light touch. \"It sounds like this will be good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-there's a third coin besides yours and it's a prize in the bikini contest tomorrow,\" Mariah said, nearly moaning at this point. \"A-and Jessica and me and our other people on our side are practicing to win it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So all I have to do is win the contest,\" Faye laughed. \"Should be easy enough with the way I look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree! Mariah cried out, hugging Faye closely. \"I'm sorry, I couldn't control myself any longer. Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye shushed Mariah gently as she pet her hair. \"Dear Mariah, you've been a tremendous help. And you're very beautiful too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take me,\" Mariah whined, her face buried in Faye's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh,\" Faye said, not knowing Mariah would want to go that far. She took her as too shy. \"Tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never...even kissed,\" Mariah said. \"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">consentually</font> and I want to sleep with you! You're...you're the most gorgeous woman I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye paused. She <i>had</i> been sex-starved for months. And it wasn't like she'd never slept with another woman before. And as far as looks go, she could do far worse than Mariah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright cutie,\" Faye sighed, holding Mariah's head up. \"Let's do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really?\" Mariah said, her eyes gleaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really,\" Faye smiled, leaning down to kiss Mariah on the lips.</span></div></div>",

I apologize and am correcting the mistake in this chapter. Please have a pleasant day.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning,\" Jessica whispered as she felt Jack stir awake. He smiled as her hair tickled his face, kissing Jessica on her cheek. After exploring Jessica's new quadruplet-pregnancy body extensively last night, the two had been ready to go to sleep, though there was one problem: Jessica was now too big to share her bed with someone else. So they had to get creative and have Jack sleep slighting sitting up while Jessica lay on top of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both liked this sleeping position plenty. Not only did it mean Jessica could rest without her belly hanging off the side of her bed or sticking up in the air and weighing her down, but Jack got to wrap his arms around her round pregnant stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning,\" Jack laughed in reply, hugging Jessica a little more tightly now that they were waking up. \"You seem cheery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica bit her lip. \"Let's just say last night confirmed something for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember? The...bigger my belly gets, the bigger 'it' is,\" Jessica smiled, turning to face Jack with a blushing face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'It?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The big moment,\" Jessica giggled, moving her naked butt back and forth against Jack's lap. \"You know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes, the big moment,\" Jack laughed back. \"I think it was better for me too.\" He started to rub his hips against Jessica too, his erection already more awake than he was. \"Though I think a few more tests wouldn't hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica gave a mock gasp and turned around, her belly now filling the space between Jack's legs. \"Mr. Dale, you've gotten awfully forward. Is this the real you beneath that shy exterior?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack grinned and moved his hands up Jessica's sides. \"Maybe. Or maybe I just love spending time with the mother of my children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica laughed a little more loudly. \"Okay, now you're getting a little cheesy.\" She leaned in and pecked Jack's lips. \"Though I liked where we were going with that.\"  She smiled and the two began kissing for real, reacquainting one another with the way their bodies interacted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...about going another round?\" Jack said when there was a pause in the make-out session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got a mind like a steel trap,\" Jessica said, rolling her eyes. \"And sure, but not here. My parents might-\" Jessica stopped and her eyes bugged out. \"My parents! Shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Jack said as Jessica started to slowly get off the bed and waddle around for her clothes. \"Is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, do you remember how your parents reacted when they found out you were dating a pregnant girl?\" Jessica said, struggling to put on the first bra she found. \"Well imagine if these were actually your babies. And then you came home with someone. And they were a lot less cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a knock at Jessica's bedroom door. A loud one. \"Jessica? You're awake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretend like you're asleep,\" Jessica hissed at Jack, who gladly did as she was told. Jessica then grabbed her cellphone and opened the door. \"I'll call you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who was that?\" an older woman with Jessica's features said, crossing her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was Mariah, relax,\" Jessica said, lowering her voice. \"Be quiet. He's...still asleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that him?\" Jessica's father said, standing next to her mother. \"I'll take him out before he gets a chance to wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, dad, don't,\" Jessica said, her voice starting to shake. \"I told you, it's not what it all seems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you get bigger?\" her mother gasped. Her hand hesitated over Jessica's belly before retreating back. \"How pregnant are you now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quadruplets,\" Jessica said. Her parents both gasped and looked down in distress. \"And I'm fine with it, by the way. Thanks for asking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're fine with it,\" her dad scoffed. \"It's hard enough raising one baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Jack and I know that,\" Jessica said. \"But we promised each other we'd work hard to take care of these children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'd better,\" her dad grumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They aren't his. They're barely even mine,\" Jessica said. \"It's the pregnancy disease. Haven't you been watching the news?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all a bunch of garbage,\" her mom said, shaking her head. Jessica had the unfortunate parenting of two very strict, very stubborn, and very skeptical people. \"But I believe that they aren't his. He doesn't even seem like he could work up the courage to ask you out, let alone get you knocked up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is it, Jessica?\" her dad said, stepping forward. \"Are you manipulating him to raise your babies for you or is he lying to you to get some sex from a vulnerable woman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, dad, I know you can't believe it, but despite all this, we love each other,\" Jessica said, her voice trembling as her eyes watered up. \"This has not been easy for me and you two have been treating me like a pariah ever since you learned I was pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we care about you!\" her mother yelled. \"Why can't you understand that? We don't want our young daughter being pregnant and single, let alone with four extra mouths to feed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not single. I've got Jack,\" Jessica said, her tears now starting to flow. \"And yes, it's scary, but...I like being pregnant. And the idea of raising a family with someone I love makes me really happy so...so there!\" Jessica reached up one arm and rubbed her eyes clean. \"And if you two had ever cared about what's best for me or what I was feeling, I'd ask you for help. But you haven't, so it'll just be Jack and me. And maybe his parents. They care a lot more about me than either of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer parents stood in the hallway fuming for a few moments. \"Then if that's the case, get out,\" her mom said. \"We'll pack up your things for you but you physically have to be out of the house in an hour. Your boyfriend too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't need that long,\" Jessica sniffled, closing the door with a slam and waddling back to bed. As soon as she made it there, she started sobbing and fell into Jack's embrace. \"I'm so sorry you had to see that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, I'm sorry,\" Jack said, rubbing Jessica's back. \"That really is all my fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...we'll need somewhere to go,\" Jessica mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can go to my place,\" Jack said, kissing Jessica on the forehead. \"And I don't think my parents'll mind if we have sex there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica laughed through her tears and gave Jack a kiss. \"Help me get changed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Jack helped his pregnant lover into an outfit, they headed out through her house. Jack was terrified one or both of her parents would jump out and slug him in the face, but as he squeezed Jessica's hand, he made it out without seeing either one of them. They made their way to Jack's car and drove as quickly as they could to his house. The emotional episode in front of Jessica's parents had turned back into the arousal they'd felt earlier, only now it was a little stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Jack, there you are,\" Amanda said as from the couch as Jack and Jessica hurried inside. \"Jessica...did you get-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, long story,\" Jessica said as she tried to waddle up the stairs as fast as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll tell you later,\" Jack said. \"Maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay then,\" Amanda chuckled as the door to Jack's bedroom slammed and the sound of shuffling feet could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack's home?\" Jack Sr. said, walking into the living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He sure is. And I think he'll be in his room for a while,\" Amanda smiled, lowering her shirt collar to give her husband a look at her swollen cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-now?\" Jack Sr. said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a feeling I won't be pregnant much longer,\" Amanda grinned, wiggling her eyebrows. \"So let's make the most of this while it lasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Jack Sr. said, with a gulp, \"a-anything for my wife in her time of need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a selfless man,\" Amanda laughed before tossing her shirt on the ground.</span></div></div>",

You're safe!\" Jessica beamed. \"And you didn't put on any extra baby weight, by the looks of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nope,\" Mariah said, biting her lips and keeping her gaze low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mariah.

Tell us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...talked with Faye,\" Mariah said, her hips rubbing together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you talk about?\" Ms. Apple fumed, crossing her arms against her abundant breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The...um...coin. And book. And...the plan,\" Mariah gulped. All four of them threw their hands against their foreheads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mariah!

What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We...um...y-you know,\" Mariah blushed with a little grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" Ms. Apple groaned. \"I thought he would let his libido ruin the whole plan but seems I was looking in the wrong place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Jack pouted, while secretly in his head thinking about Mariah and Faye getting intimate together. <i>I-Is rubbing bellies together a thing</i>? he wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly how much did you tell her?\" Ms. Smart said slowly, running her hands through her long silky black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah shrugged. \"That you want all three coins. That the other coin is the prize in the bikini contest. That the book had all that information.\" She turned to Jessica, her lips trembling. \"I'm sorry! She was so beautiful and no one else ever liked me like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica sighed and hugged her friend. \"We're not bad at you Mariah. Sex can be...tricky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Smart traced her fingers against her chin. \"This may not have set us back that badly. We still just have to win the contest and she already had her coin carefully guarded. Getting her coin back is still the hardest element of any of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Winning the contest will be easy,\" Ms. Apple chuckled. \"I mean, how good can one woman in her 40s be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Mariah immediately replied. \"Very, very good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right,\" Jack nodded. \"She'll be crafty. Faye may even cheat to win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we have to be vigilant,\" Ms. Smart said. \"You'll be backstage working on the contest so that will be another set of eyes on her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right,\" Jack gulped. \"How could I forget...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, gettin' bashful?\" Jessica laughed, rubbing Jack's back and chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, what, did you two fuck this morning?\" Ms. Apple asked. There was an awkward silence that made her bust out laughing. \"Sorry, my bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to focus!\" Ms. Smart said, clapping her hands together. \"Practice and planning, that's what we need to do until the contest. Jack...we'll call you if we need you. For now, you're a distraction and frankly I don't want to be near that coin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Jack nodded, turning back to Jessica and kissing her on the lips. \"Kick ass, Jess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will,\" Jessica grinned, pecking her lover again as she held her hands against her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Jessica, you're a blimp now so you need the most practice,\" Ms. Smart said. \"Everyone else, this is the crunch time. We can get rid of this evil once and for all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack left, he saw he was getting a call. It was from-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack saw that Ian was calling him and chuckled a little. He hadn't heard from Ian in a while, at least since the \"pregnancy\" issue in the town had really gotten out of hand. Jack accepted the call and brought the phone to his ear. \"Hey Ian, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey dude,\" Ian said. He sounded shaken up. \"You free today? I feel like we haven't talked lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I free,\" Jack repeated to himself as he tried to think out his schedule for the day. His shift at work with Amber wasn't starting for another few hours. \"Sure, I have some time to kill. Meet at the mall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mall?\" Ian said on the other end, sounding a little jumpy. \"Uh...sure, I guess that would be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure? You sound kind of...off, Ian,\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, mall is fine,\" Ian replied, taking in a deep breath. \"See you by the Game Bucket?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me,\" Jack said. \"Looking forward to talking again, Ian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right,\" Ian laughed nervously before hanging up. Jack shook his head as he pocketed his phone. Ian had always been, well, an idiot but he'd never sounded this weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mall, it was packed as usual, and thanks to the liberal use of the coin in days past, it was more cramped thanks to the abundance of pregnant bellies taking up space. Though things were hardly stressful or confrontational as a result. In fact, most of the women (and men) who were waddling around seemed pleased to be able to meet and talk with fellow expectant mallgoers and had no problems rubbing round middles together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Jack, this meant blushing very strongly as he navigated his way through the occasional labyrinth of pregnancy that would crop up in the mall, buoyed by his love for Jessica and the assuring knowledge that her belly was bigger than any of theirs, and thus, more desirable. But with every appealing bare belly he saw, he felt a familiar tickle in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack clenched his teeth and remained resolute. After nine days of carrying the coin around and feeling it slither its way into his mind and heart, he was able to  resist the urge to take out his coin and give it a flip, knowing the consequences all too well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Look at her...look at that perfect glow</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to Jack was a tall pregnant woman with yellow and brown hair, a warm smile with pink lips, and beautiful olive skin. She had on a loose skirt and a thin top that only secured her breasts, leaving her warm belly to stick out proudly as it shone. Jack felt himself shudder as he saw her. She typified pregnant beauty. The woman noticed Jack's gaze and turned to smile at him. \"Hi there. Interested in a sample?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...sample?\" Jack relied, clearing his throat. He noticed she was carrying a tray of various creams and gels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Belly butter, stretch mark cream, moisturizer for pregnant skin,\" she chirped. \"Got anyone expecting in your life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, my girlfriend,\" Jack said before his voice trailed off to add, \"and my mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman giggled and handed him a large bottle with a press-squirt top. \"Better show them this then. I'm Carolyn, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack,\" he gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Wouldn't you love to make her belly even bigger</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are either of them going to be in the bikini contest tomorrow?\" Carolyn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-both, actually,\" Jack gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both? Sounds like a competitive family,\" Carolyn laughed again before nudging Jack with her belly. \"But I'll bet I can take 'em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right,\" Jack said as he felt the coin's whispers getting louder. \"I have to go, sorry. Thanks for the sample.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" Carolyn smiled, waving to Jack as he hurried away. \"Nice to meet you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack hurried to the mall's more out-of-the-way video game store, the Game Bucket, breathing heavily as he tried to ignore the coin's persistent egging on. Ian was inside, looking through a discount bin, when he saw Jack. \"There you are dude. It's been a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got...tied up,\" Jack said, not wanting to expand on his interaction with Carolyn. \"So, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hard to really explain,\" Ian said, his hands still trembling. \"But I think that coin you gave me was cursed or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's eyes went wide. He remembered giving Ian the coin that one time but having it somehow split into two, then later three with Faye. But did Ian really figure it out? Jack pegged him as a little too slow for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever since I got that coin, it's like pregnant women have been following me everywhere,\" Ian shuddered. \"At work, in the streets, all around the city, and especially here in the mall. I can't take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...can't be that bad, can it?\" Jack said, wondering if the coin really had affected him differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's bad dude. I actually passed out when I found out all I was supposed to do with that bikini contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the pregnant bikini contest?\" Jack said, raising an eyebrow. \"You didn't know there was pregnancy involved?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't notice,\" Ian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's on the posters all over town. On the radio,\" Jack said, scratching his head. \"Isn't your bank one of the sponsors?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and I was put in charge of it but they're taking me out now after my 'accident,'\" Ian said, making air quotes. \"Which is a relief, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack started to realize an opportunity here. \"Hey, you know, I was signed up to help out at the contest too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Ian said, picking up a game before putting it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah so since you were in charge of organizing the contest on your side of things...you could get me into the venue early to set up, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" Ian said, his voice trailing off. Jack knew he just had to use Ian's dumbness to his advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, see, I signed up as part of a contract, just like you're contracted through the bank and the radio station,\" Jack said, making something up on his feet. \"So it stipulates that, with the insurance dividends associated with the production, all maintenance staff on a non-permanent basis must-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay,\" Ian said, so confused by Jack's jargon that steam was practically coming out of his ears. \"I'll get you in early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Jack smiled, glad to be contributing to the plan. He checked his phone and saw that he had to leave for work soon. \"There's more details we need to talk out though...mind coming with me to work while we chat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not working today,\" Ian said, following Jack out of the mall and to the electronics store. Once there, they resumed their talk and Jack managed to get Ian to agree to let him in two hours prior to the official start of the bikini contest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a big help,\" Jack grinned, glad he might have a chance to talk with Faye and get her coin away from her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right,\" Ian nodded, pretending to understand what he agreed to. He looked around the store and his eyes fell on a new controller for his console. \"This is pretty neat. Can I get your employee discount on this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I think that'd be fine,\" Jack nodded as the back curtain opened and Amber strode in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giving out discounts to more people than just your girlfriend now, huh?\" Amber smiled, turning to Ian. \"Hiya, kid. One of Jack's friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan just let out a blubbering gasp when he saw Amber and her round middle. He fell straight backwards and collapsed on the floor, the controller still gripped in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wasn't kidding about passing out,\" Jack murmured as he went over to his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just put him in the back until he wakes up,\" Amber said as Jack helped Ian onto a sofa in the storage room. \"Good to see those strong hands at work again, Jack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks,\" Jack gulped as Amber began tracing her hand against her belly. \"S-so...how are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber shrugged. \"Talks with the father of these babies' wife didn't go well, though she's also twice as big as me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what are you going to do?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only thing I can do: win that contest and provide a good life for these critters,\" Amber said, patting her round stomach and giving Jack a sultry smile. \"Shouldn't be too hard. I look good, wouldn't you agree?\" Jack let out a squeak of agreement and looked away as Amber laughed softly and rested against the counter. \"Never thought we'd both be parents, Jack. You and your little friend, me and these things. Weird times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird times,\" Jack agreed with a nod as he felt the coin in his hand. Something told him the day was going to get a lot weirder.</span></div></div>",

The woman immediately plugged her headphones in to her music player and strapped them around her belly, playing music into her womb as she waddled out with a blissful grin on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have asked her if she wanted a hand,\" Amber laughed, elbowing Jack and making him jump a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right,\" Jack gulped as his manager leaned down, showing off her breasts swollen with hormones as one hand caressed her full-term, twin belly. \"Maybe I should check on my friend in the back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd still give him some time,\" Amber said, turning and leaning against the counter so her belly blocked the path. \"On top of my lamaze class, I took some first aid and other basic health training. The best thing we can do for your light-weight buddy is to let him rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack wasn't sure whether Amber's rudimentary medical expertise was something she already knew or something the coin's reality warp threw into the mix but he took Amber's word for it. She always came across as an exceptionally smart woman. Besides, the only way to get to Ian would involve pushing past her belly and he was worried how that would turn out. Amber may not be actively trying to start anything physical with him because of Jessica but he didn't put teasing past her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, looking forward to tonight?\" Amber smiled, one hand slowly rolling up her work shirt to reveal more and more of her glowing bare belly. \"This must be like heaven for you, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack shuddered as he opened his mouth, getting ready to protest, but he also realized how rough things had been for him all the years he'd denied his pregnancy fetish. The little bit he got to talk about it with Jessica felt like a weight off his chest, so why not try that a little more? \"I think so,\" Jack said, his face turning red as he grinned. \"There are a lot of good looking pregnant women in town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber laughed out loud and began to purr as she moved closer to her employee. \"That's a franker response than I'd anticipated. Does your baby mama know you feel this way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so,\" Jack said. \"She knows she's the only one I truly love and we've both...ogled other pregnant women. It'll be fun.\" Of course, Jack knew it would be more stressful than he was letting on. Jessica, Mariah, Ms. Smart, and Ms. Apple were all with him trying to get that last coin away from Faye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Fun</i>,\" Amber laughed, running her fingers down her round stomach. \"It'll be fun when I see the expression on that cow's face when I win the contest.\" Jack gulped. He had thought about bringing Amber into the plan but he knew she had her mind set on beating Faye and winning the contest after all the drama in the family regarding the parentage of her fetuses. Telling her the truth would mean Jack telling Amber that he was the one who got her pregnant, not Faye's husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you have a good chance to win,\" Jack said with a warm smile. \"Honestly, good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber laughed again and turned from her belly to Jack. \"Is that flirting, strong hands? I knew you were bad, but that was just clumsy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack began to blush and crossed his arms. \"I mean...obviously I hope Jessica wins but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say no more,\" Amber sighed, rolling her eyes with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack felt his heart beating quickly. \"A-Amber...you know...if Jessica wasn't in the picture, I'd want you to win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber waddled over to Jack and gave him a hug, which caught him off-guard. \"You are too sweet for your own good, Jack. In fact, sometimes it gets a little tiring.\" She let go and instead pressed her belly against him and laughed. \"But for the record, I think I'm too mature for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two employees were letting their sexuality awkwardly spar with the others, someone else entered the store. But it wasn't a customer in the front, it was someone using the back door. Nicole Zavaleta picked the lock to the loading dock and snuck in, her footsteps making no sound despite her incredible gravid belly. Zavaleta could have easily ripped the lock off the door instead but she was trying to be less aggressive now that she was sharing her body with her eight future children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the colossal super-spy prowled around the back, she finally spied what she came for: the lost Spyder camera, kept by Amber for repairs. Zavaleta gave a quick check to see if there were any security measures in place, which there were not. She scoffed and removed the Spyder, shaking her head. \"This is the easiest mission of them all. Maybe it's experience or maybe these people are too inept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZavaleta heard a low groan and tucked into a roll, hiding behind the nearest shelf. It wasn't hard for her to curl up since, with her belly, she was mostly a ball already. She cursed herself for speaking out loud, chalking it up to \"pregnancy brain,\" and laid her eyes on the source of the moan: Ian laying on a couch in a small employee area. Her mind whirred as she tried to recall where she'd seen Ian before. He worked at Titan Bank and he'd been at the hospital during one of the pregnancy outbreaks. Zavaleta smiled, patting her belly with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My luck is as good as it's ever been,\" she chuckled, hurrying over to the couch and putting her knees on Ian's legs, looking directly at him. His eyes blinked open and he could only see a huge pregnant belly pinning him down. Ian nearly screamed but Zavaleta already had her hands against his ribs and applied pressure to take the air out of his lungs. \"Take one long breath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan's shocked face nodded and he wheezed, color returning to his face. \"W-w-w-who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't shout any more. And stay with me,\" Zavaleta ordered him. \"What do you know about the coin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The coin? What coin?\" Ian stammered. \"There's no coin!\" Zavaleta handed Ian a promotional flyer for the bikini contest, with the antique coin listed as one of the prizes. \"Oh, that coin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZavaleta sighed, quickly realizing that she was dealing with an idiot. \"Yes, what do you know about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, I guess it's valuable or something,\" Ian said. \"A-are you really this pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, don't talk when I don't tell you to,\" Zavaleta replied. \"Is there any way to enter this competition now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's closed,\" Ian said. \"T-though I think you may have been too big for it anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you,\" Zavaleta grunted, pressing her belly further down on Ian's chest. \"My womb is swelled with my children and I could never be prouder of it. Now tell me: who is running the event?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-the radio station, I guess,\" Ian panted. \"Sandwich, Oven, sexy Lisa...and Jack, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack?\" Zavaleta said, relieving the weight of her pregnant middle. \"What is his role?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Checking on women, something like that,\" Ian groaned. \"He's going in early. Said it was important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just as I thought...he's important</i>, Zavaleta thought to herself, stroking her belly. \"You have been helpful to me. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no problem,\" Ian said, taking a deep breath as Zavaleta moved herself off of him. He was not as petrified by her pregnant body now as he thought he might be. But as Zavaleta stood up, he could see all of her and not just her belly. \"H-hey...that's a cool hair style.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hair style?\" Zavaleta asked, slipping the flyer back into her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, how it's dyed grey. It's neat,\" Ian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't dyed. My hair is grey,\" Zavaleta replied. \"I'm in my 60s.\" Ian let out a groan as he passed out again, unable to handle that bit of information. Zavaleta didn't pay it any attention as she smiled and stroked her middle. \"Don't worry, my children. We're getting closer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, the coin in Jack's pocket began to burn more and he felt his head tingling again. \"You okay?\" Amber asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, I'm okay,\" Jack said, looking down to see the coin already in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, because we need someone to clean the bathroom,\" Amber smiled, rubbing her stomach. \"I'd do it but I've got this big heavy belly,\" she said with a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...uh...\" Jack said, the sight of her belly exciting the coin some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, we'll flip for it,\" Amber said, pointing to Jack's hand. \"Heads you, tails me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Do it</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack didn't have a chance. He flipped the coin and it landed on heads as he looked at Amber. She grinned as her belly swelled out, pushing her shirt away so all of her creamy bare stomach was on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get moppin',\" Amber chuckled, her hands wrapped around her belly. \"And do it quick. These triplets kick me in the bladder so many times a day.\"</span></div></div>",

She got the address for Mariah after spending the most incredible.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Mariah was \"interrogated\" by Faye, Mariah more then willing to spill the beans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't crazy, they WERE trying to take her babies away from her..

She decided to move in with the.. father of her children\" Courtney said, trying to hide her anger, pain and disdain for Jessica's current \"situation\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh..\" Faye said. Damn, she just missed her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know my daughter?\" Courtney asked. <br>\r\n\"We met at a pregnancy class.

My husband and I don't want anything to do with pregnancy right now. This is a hard time for us.\" Courtney said starting to close the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye forced herself in, using her increased weight and belly size to force Jessica's mom Courtney aside, inviting her in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry. It's just I left a very important book with Jessica, that I absolutely need back right away. She said last night I could come over and get it this morning. So if you could just show me to her room and I'll \" Faye said, making modifications of the plans to get that book back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica took most of her belongings with her when she moved out this morning. Now please get out of my house before I call\" Courtney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it will only be a moment. I just need to get that book and I'll \" Faye said, starting to look around for the book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you? Courtney, who is this woman and why is she in our house?\" Jessica's father Travis asked, coming out of his home office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi, I'm Jessica's good friend Faye. She didn't mention me? Well, no bother. She borrowed a book from me, and I'm just going to grab it and then head out. You don't have any idea how important that book - - \"Faye was interrupted by Travis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care. Jessica made some bad decisions and now she's paying the consequences, and so are you, if you lent Jessica something. She's irresponsible\" Travis said, still bitter about Jessica's \"predicament\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, that's a little harsh do you think? It's not like she could help what happened to her\" Faye said, whipping up another quick lie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Travis asked with suspicious eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her pregnancy. It's going around. Don't you watch the news? Sudden mysterious pregnancies? Affecting a lot of people, women, men, your daughter. Even my poor husband is \"in the family way\" as they say. You should see him, huge and pregnant. It would be tragic if it he didn't deserve it!\" Faye said with a cackle, some truth showing through the lie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, I'm a scientist, and I can assure you, pregnancy is not some \"disease\" that people can catch, espically men\" Travis said, with a stern look on his face. <br>\r\nLike Courtney, Travis was in his very late 40's, or at least that what he tells people. He was not looking forward to his 50th birthday party next month. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Show them what happens to those who doubt you. </span> The coin called to Faye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wicked smile came across her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll have a look around, don't worry about helping me. \" Faye said reaching into her pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we'll help you with leaving \" Travis said, approaching Faye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmh.\" Faye laughed to herself quietly. \"Jessica's a good girl who's in over her head. But I'm sure it will all work out for her. But you really should have believed her about her pregnancy\" Faye took the coin out of her pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's that?\" Travis asked, stopping in front of the massive pregnant frame of Faye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really can happen to anyone \" Faye said, flipping the coin, high into the air, grabbing it, and opening her hand to reveal it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Tails! No Reality Change!</span> The voice declared <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even you!\" Faye said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do youuuu\" Travis said as his belly began to expand, as his pregnant expansion began. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TRAVIS! OH MY GOD! WHAT'S HAPPENING!\" Courtney screamed, running over to her rapidly pregnafying husband. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, uh, uh. The family that's waddles together, stays together!\" Faye said, flipping the coin again, looking at Courtney, opening her hand to reveal it again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Tails! No Reality Change!</span> The voice boomed again! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney let out a squeak as her belly began to expand, slowly growing outward into a twin-filled pregnant belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney and Travis braced themselves as there pregnancy expansion slowed, finally stopping at a twin-pregnancy for Courtney, Jessica's mom, and a big round triplet pregnant belly for Travis, Jessica's Dad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my, don't we look adorable so fat and pregnant!?\" Faye said with a wicked smile.  \"I'll look around, don't get up, just sit there and rest. I'm sure that was a trying experience.\" Faye said, rubbing each of the bellies with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, or no one will stop me!\" Faye said as she began her search of Jessica's house, her newly very pregnant parents confused by the Gravida consequences of Faye's visit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There were still dozens of rows of chairs that needed to be set up, lights had to be rigged, and something had to be done about the VIP seating. Originally, only a small amount of the floorspace in the large Dino's Bar and Grill  was going to be allotted for the contest but as popularity and attention grew, thanks in part to the outbreak of the pregnancy disease or whatever it was around the city, the whole place was going to be packed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't be drinking coffee,\" Lisa chuckled as she waddled up behind Oven, her full-term triplet belly bumping against her co-worker. \"Caffeine'll get to the baby and make it all jumpy when it's born.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha-ha,\" Oven said in a low monotone. \"I guess you're the only expert on pregnancy since you actually know how you'll get yours out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure we could think of a way to get it out when it's time,\" Lisa laughed again, taking a pair of scissors from a nearby work bench. \"But if a c-section doesn't work, I'm all out of ideas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, easy you two,\" Sandwich said with a laugh, standing between his two expectant on-air companions. \"I'm sure you're both ready for your pregnancies to be over but let's get the place set up before you start cutting your bellies open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least Oven can still pass for fat,\" Lisa snickered, rubbing one hand against her belly. Her shirt was smaller today and she let all of her pregnant roundness from her navel down be seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOven let out a huff and went over to the workers currently setting up the lights. Sandwich kept laughing as he turned back to Lisa, hands on his hips. \"You seem less worried about your pregnancy today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm about to be on stage in a bikini,\" Lisa said, rolling her eyes as her hands traced her huge round middle. \"If I wasn't comfortable by now, I'd have taken my name off of the list.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe but it feels like something is different,\" Sandwich said, scratching his chin. \"Like you're not just okay with the bump. It's something more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa smiled and looked down at her belly. \"I've...enjoyed the idea of being a mother. I even picked out some names and I've got someone to raise them with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandwich chuckled. \"So the fear's gone away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not by a long shot,\" Lisa laughed. \"Especially now that I have some other kids on the way too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Other kids?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain some other time,\" Lisa sighed, looking back up at Sandwich. \"It's a long story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever happens, I'm sure you'll be a good mother,\" Sandwich smiled, his eyes meeting Lisa's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked at her co-worker, a gross-out rude shock jock, with surprise. \"Thank you, Sandwich. That's...really nice of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, we're off the air. Call me Luke,\" Sandwich smiled back before speaking again. \"Do you...think I would be a good parent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Lisa said, hesitating before responding. \"Um, sure, I think you would. Are you thinking about starting a family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that,\" Sandwich chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't even know you were married. Or had a girlfriend for that matter,\" Lisa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't,\" Sandwich said as Oven walked back over. \"I'll explain later too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lights are hooked up,\" Oven said, looking over a list on a clipboard. \"So here's how we'll run things: each woman will come on stage individually, strut and introduce themselves, then line up in the back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll just keep them on stage?\" Sandwich asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, it's no fun if they aren't being forced to show off their big bellies,\" Oven cackled. \"That's the whole point of this: pregnant women are supposed to hide their stomachs and now they're going to be on full display. It's funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm supposed to be covered up?\" Lisa purred, lifting her shirt a few more inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you are,\" Oven snapped with a glare before turning to his clipboard. \"Then when they've all come out, we'll do the talent portion one at a time. Luke, you and me'll be on the side stage introducing them since our planned MC went and got knocked up in the middle of our planning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for spontaneously growing a pregnant belly,\" Lisa scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then finally, the dance portion, also one at a time. Hopefully everyone will have sent their music in by the deadline or else...I dunno, we'll play some kind of club music for them to shake their pregnant guts to,\" Oven said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oven, geez, reel it in with the preggo-hate,\" Sandwich laughed nervously. \"You're a little too heated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a reason to be heated!\" Oven shouted back, touching one hand to his stomach. \"Somehow, I've become a pregnant man and still we're having this big event for women to have fun 'showing off their curves.' Well I don't feel fun. I feel fat and I feel like a freak and at the end of all of this, I'm going to have a fucking kid to take care of that I don't want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a painful silence between the three of them, and before Lisa could open her lips, Sandwich talked. \"You really don't want the baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course not,\" Oven said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then...would it be okay if I adopted it?\" Sandwich said. Oven and Lisa both looked at him in surprise. \"I'd been thinking about adoption lately since I figured there'd be a need with the pregnancy disease and...as a friend, I was thinking you might be willing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOven gulped. \"I mean...sure, absolutely. That'd be a big weight off my shoulders. But you want to raise a kid by yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandwich took a deep breath. \"I won't be by myself. I've been talking about this for a while...with my boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOven and Lisa's eyes grew even more and this time Lisa spoke first. \"You're gay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...you make all those sex jokes at work about women and me especially. You're always so lecherous and crude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandwich shrugged. \"They're funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa didn't know what to say. All this time she thought she couldn't be open about her identity, let alone her relationship with Natalie, because she'd be considered an outcast at the station. And now it turns out the grossest guy there (well, 2nd grossest after Oven) was gay the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was actually thinking about officially coming out on the air next week,\" Sandwich said. \"Is that okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOven and Lisa both nodded as their co-worker smiled and sighed. \"E-excuse me for a minute,\" Lisa said. \"I've got to go make a phone call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this?\" Amanda said, pivoting her hip a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and turn forward a bit,\" Jack Sr. smiled. \"Gotta show the goods to the audience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda gave a quiet laugh and turned with his directions, letting her belly stick out front more. \"You're starting to like the belly, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like yours,\" Jack Sr. chuckled. \"But don't worry. You don't have to be worried about me tracing other moms-to-be at the bikini contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, because I know they'll be chasing after you,\" Amanda purred, running her hands down her roundness. \"My big, strong, handsome silver fox, you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy now,\" her husband grinned. \"You don't want us to take another break, do you? Practice is important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda waddled forward and sat her enlarged rear in her husband's lap. \"I feel like a college girl again. All this energy should go to good use, don't you think? Besides, the contest's just for fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been fun alright,\" Jack Sr. smiled, his hands moving to Amanda's bikini top and gently moving around the knot to loosen it. Just then, the doorbell rang a few times and they sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get it,\" Amanda said, using Jack Sr.'s help to stand up. She waddled to a nearby chair and picked up a robe, grunting as she bent down. \"I may have more energy, but your babies are still awfully heavy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's your side of the family,\" Jack Sr. laughed. \"I've met your brothers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda stuck out her tongue as she left their bedroom and waddled to the front door. When it opened, she saw a very pregnant man and woman on the verge of tears. \"Are you...Jack Dale's mother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am,\" Amanda said slowly. \"May I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're Jessica's parents,\" Travis said. \"We tried to call her but she wasn't answering her cellphone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's probably just practicing,\" Amanda said as Courtney held her closely, trying into her chest. \"Oh...oh my.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were so awful to her!\" Courtney sobbed. \"Please, maybe your son knows where she is. We need to talk with her and apologize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda sighed and smiled, patting Courtney on the back. \"Don't worry, I'll get in touch with him. In the meantime, why don't you both relax on the couch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis sniffled, tears starting to stream down his face too. \"Thank you, Mrs. Dale. And do you have anything to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack paced around the floor of the sports bar where the contest would be held that night. It seemed like there were plenty of hours left to plan and scheme but Jack still felt a fear tightening his chest that there wasn't enough time left. Time to practice, time to plan, time with Jessica and her pregnancy, especially now that it had gotten to quadruplet proportions. But at least he had a bit of a leg-up on Faye now that he could get into Dino's Bar and Grill early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I help you?\" Lisa Smith said as she waddled behind Jack. He tensed up when he heard her familiar voice and slowly turned around. He, like many other men in the city, had a thing for the buxom radio personality. Though now that she was gestating three full-term fetuses inside her belly, he may be one of the few who still felt that way. When Lisa saw Jack, her face softened and she smiled. \"Oh, I met you yesterday. Out walking in the park with another woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-that's right,\" Jack said with a shaky smile back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She looked even bigger than me,\" Lisa said with a laugh, resting one hand on her round middle and giving it a little stroke up and down. \"She said she was your neighbor, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Jack choked out as he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for volunteering to help out with the contest,\" Lisa said, putting one hand on his shoulder. \"We didn't get anyone to agree to help, which I guess is to be expected. It's fun to laugh at big, round women waddling around on stage but less fun to help us fatties out back stage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, it's my pleasure,\" Jack said. \"A-and you great, Ms. Smith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa raised one eyebrow and a sly smile spread across her lips. She recognized his gaze as the same one Natalie had when she looked at Lisa's belly. \"I see\u2026well like I said, thank you. Hope you have fun tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lisa turned around and waddled back to those working on setting up the show, Jack heard another voice whisper behind him. \"Hiya.\" Jack turned to see Tara standing behind him, a knowing smile on her sandy lips as her hands clutched her own belly, just as big as Lisa's, if not larger since Tara was shorter. \"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could ask you the same thing, I guess,\" Jack said, crossing his arms and trying to look casual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Tara laughed, mirroring Jack's body language. \"Titan Bank is helping to put this thing on and I thought I should take a look for myself since I work there too. I'll be on stage and\u2026\" she leaned in to whisper. \"The guy from the bank in charge of this contest is a pretty big idiot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ian? He's a friend of mine,\" Jack said. There was an awkward pause as Tara's face began to lose color. \"And yeah, he's an idiot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara let out a relieved gasp and a laugh as she put her hands back against her belly. \"Oof, that's tight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Jack said quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, it's all good,\" Tara sighed. \"It's just false contractions since I'm getting near the end. Mind if we sit down?\" Jack followed Tara to one of the chairs set up in the sports bar as she slowly lowered herself down. \"There we go. Hope I have enough energy to perform tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I hope so too,\" Jack gulped. Tara flashed him a grinning glance and he tried to reorganize his words. \"It'd suck if you couldn't get a chance to go up and all, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm,\" Tara said, still smiling. \"So, I asked first. Why are you here now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm helping out backstage during the show,\" Jack said. \"Helping out with all of you performers, actually, so if you want anything, let me know. I'll even bring you a few vanilla cokes, maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara laughed out loud, her belly shaking with each guffaw. \"Maybe they're bad luck for me since I ended up with two extra babies the last time I tried to drink one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Three, actually</i> Jack thought, not wanting to tell Tara the truth about her pregnancy and the coin. Of course, Zavaleta had already clued Tara into plenty but she didn't want to show Jack that she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how did you get the unfortunate job of entertaining dozens of hormonal pregnant scantily-clad women?\" Tara said, hands on her belly as she eyed Jack. Now he was really blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-my girlfriend signed me up as a joke,\" Jack said. \"But, you know, I'm happy to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara let out another little laugh and sighed. \"Her name's\u2026Jessica, right? I think I met her at the shower at the bank.\" Jack nodded as Tara leaned in closer to him. \"To be honest\u2026I've had a thing for you for a few days now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara nodded. \"Jessica's a very lucky girl. I hope you treat her well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will,\" Jack said. \"I mean, I do. I\u2026we like each other a lot.\" Tara laughed and gave Jack a light kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck to both of you,\" Tara said, slowly heaving herself up. \"Maybe I'll see you and your babies around the park someday soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" Jack said as he watched Tara waddle away. He also had a crush on Tara but he didn't want to tell her that. The clich\u00e9 would have been to say \"if it weren't for Jessica, you and I would be together\" but he didn't even know if that was true. There was Amber and\u2026maybe even Faye. Jack shuddered as he thought about what a bizarre week it had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he felt his phone buzz and he picked it up. \"Jack?\" Amanda said on the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Mom,\" Jack replied. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica's parents are at the house and they really need to get in touch with her,\" Amanda said, making her voice quieter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack froze. \"M-Mom, I don't know if that's such a good idea. They're both kind of-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, trust me,\" Amanda said. \"They need to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack sighed. \"Okay, I'll tell you where she's practicing and they can go see her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica stood in her individual practice room, stroking her chin. She'd been practicing her dance so much, it was only now occurring to her that she never developed her talent portion of the competition. Could her dancing could as a talent? That seemed like cheating. What was she good at?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know one thing Jack would say I'm very good at,\" Jessica chuckled. \"But I don't think I could do that on stage\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Smart walked into the room in her bikini and glared at Jessica. \"You've got visitors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At a secret hideout?\" Jessica asked. \"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I'd like to know,\" Ms. Smart huffed. \"But they say it's an emergency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica sighed and waddled out, still getting used to her quadruplet size, and made it to the main doors of the warehouse hideout. As she opened it, her face went pale as she saw her parents' faces. Then she saw their bellies and just got confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi dear,\" Courtney, Jessica's mother, said, her lips trembling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom\u2026Dad?\" Jessica said, turning to Travis too. \"What's\u2026you both\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We caught that pregnancy disease, I guess,\" Travis said. \"We're\u2026we're so sorry for doubting you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you ever forgive us?\" Courtney said, now starting to cry. \"We were just concerned about our daughter. To us, you're still our little girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I forgive you,\" Jessica said, now starting to cry as well as she went into her parents' arms. It was hard for the three of them to hug with their massive pregnancies but they were able to communicate their feelings effectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was so strange,\" Courtney managed to get out. \"One second we were at home with this pregnant woman talking to us, then it was like there was a water balloon in my stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-a woman?\" Jessica said with a sniffle. \"Was she\u2026big like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, she was extremely pregnant and she was talking very strangely,\" Travis says. \"I guess this disease is contagious after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was fuming with anger. <i>Faye\u2026you're really going to get it now</i> she thought. \"Well\u2026I'm so happy we got to talk like this but I need to practice,\" Jessica said, looking at her parents. \"I want to talk soon though about my new little siblings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we'll make sure of it,\" Courtney smiled, giving her daughter a pat on the belly. \"Good luck tonight.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Faye softly cackled to herself as she waddled into the thick of the city's downtown. One hand was devoted to stroking and rubbing her large, exposed pregnant middle. Over the past months, she'd had her fun shopping for maternity clothes and other baby supplies for her coming children but with a nine-month quadruplet belly, all Faye wanted to do was show it off. Of course, the \"shopping\" over the past months was all in her head, thanks to the coin's \"reality warping\" abilities. In reality, Faye had only had time to buy things for her quads for a few days and she'd barely worn the few maternity clothes she bought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting nearly forty years for the chance to carry her young inside her womb, Faye was not going to stop herself from having as much fun with her round tummy as she could. She smiled as she saw surprised eyes fall on her swollen stomach, though it wasn't quite the shock she was expecting. Then again, with the pregnancy disease mixed with the baby boom that coincidentally occurred months prior to the disease hitting the town. If anything, Faye was in line with the fashion trends of the city in letting her belly stick out without her shirt covering her glowing ball of flesh up. The main difference between Faye and many of the women here (the pregnant men in the area were still very much interested in keeping their bulging stomachs covered and concealed) was the sheer size of Faye's baby bump. The number of triplet pregnancies here was definitely thousands of percentage points more likely than in the rest of the world but no one outside of Jack's circle of contacts had quadruplets or more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo women with leather jackets, various ear-and-face piercings, and hair that seemed like it couldn't be dyed even blacker, waddled past Faye, their bellies just as exposed as hers. Their pregnant curves were covered in writing and drawings, catching Faye's attention almost as much as their appearance. As Faye stared at them, she could tell they were staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck do you want?\" one of the women said, brushing her bangs out of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just admiring your wonderful bellies,\" Faye cooed, turning toward the two of them. \"Triplets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other woman chuckled and pressed her hands into her back, pushing her belly out and accentuating its size. Written on the front of her belly in big black gothic letters was \"It Wants Out\" and below that, in similar print, was \"Kicking and Screaming.\" \"Yeah, each of us in the band has triplets. Probably because we got knocked up the same night and Taurus was rising.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilith, enough with that astro-garbage,\" the other woman said, rolling her eyes. \"You left that all behind when we saved you from playing in that bullshit hippie wiccan folk band.\" On her belly, this woman had \"Bad Belly Bitch\" written all across the front. Both women also had little drawings of monsters, skulls, and the like drawn across the wide real estate of their pregnant stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love these tattoos,\" Faye purred, touching her hand against Lilith's belly. Lilith and her friend looked startled but didn't do anything to stop her. \"I've seen a few tummies with tattoos on them but none so specific to pregnancy. So creative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they aren't really tattoos,\" Lilith said, her cheeks starting to blush, even under all the make-up she was wearing to look paler. \"They're just drawn on. We'd look kind of strange if we had these when our pregnancy ends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though knowing her, Tiamat will probably get another litter inside her as soon as this one's over,\" the other woman laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye's smile grew as she turned around, touching her belly to the other woman's. \"I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jezebel,\" the woman said with a smirk as she crossed her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Faye,\" Faye giggled, still grinning like a snake about to strike. \"Jezebel...that's a very interesting name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're stage names,\" Lilith said. \"We're in a band. Maybe you've heard of us: Mommy Kills Best?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, you're playing at the bikini contest,\" Faye said, her eyes lighting up. \"I'll have a front-row seat, I suppose. I'm competing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With a belly like that, I'd say so,\" Jezebel laughed, giving Faye's swollen stomach a light spank. She was a little taken aback by how firm and smooth Faye's belly skin was to the touch. \"Anyway, yeah, I'm the singer and Lilith here is the bassist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I haven't heard any of your music myself, but I can take a guess to what it's like,\" Faye purred. \"Metal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just any metal,\" Jezebel said, her voice starting to growl as she bared her teeth. \"The darkest, most gothic metal in the world. There's only three words you can use to describe us: evil, chaotic, and pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evil, chaos, and pregnancy,\" Faye laughed, tapping her hand against her belly. \"I know a lot about that.\" Jezebel looked at her a little confused as Faye could hear the coin's rotten voice chuckle in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, for a while we'd been working as a regular metal band without any spark and things weren't going that well,\" Lilith said, walking around Faye's planet-like bump to stand beside her lead singer. \"But then it hit us: what's more metal than being pregnant? Your body swelling and changing as something inside you grows and sucks up your energy, all because you had sex. It's so brutal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not how I like to think about it,\" Faye said, stroking the sides of her belly carefully. \"I love being pregnant. I think it's wonderful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do we,\" Jezebel grinned, \"but maybe for different reasons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case, it was very nice meeting both of you,\" Faye smiled, her whole face lighting up. \"I look forward to seeing you perform tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I look forward to seeing you in a bikini,\" Lilith said before Jezebel could elbow her in the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But before I go, you both <i>have</i> to tell me where you got that writing on your bellies done. I just love it,\" Faye cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a block away. Eve's Inks is doing it,\" Jezebel said with a sneer. \"Can't miss it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Faye nodded, giving their bellies one last pat before waddling away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird lady,\" Jezebel murmured to Lilith as the quadruplet-carrying woman went down the street. \"It takes a lot for someone to creep <u>me</u> out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've told you, pregnancy has its own energy and power to it. Back in the coven, there was one woman who got pregnant without sex and she could cast spells on us,\" Lilith whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJezebel groaned and kept waddling, running her hands all over her belly while being careful not to smear her designs on her stomach. \"You fell for a lot of stupid stuff back then...but there was definitely something strange going on with that Faye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, Faye stepped out of Eve's Inks with a rosy smile and \"Big Mama To Be\" emblazoned on her belly in big red letters. She made a bee-line for the most crowded part of the downtown as she held the coin in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tonight's a big night, isn't it buddy?\" Faye said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">We'll be at risk. I can feel it. Be on guard.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know about all that,\" Faye pouted. \"But Jack and his friends won't stop me from having these babies.\" She giggled. \"You know, all my life I've wanted children but even as I'm at my biggest and ripest, I hope they stay in there just one more night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">That I can promise</span> the coin said with a nasty laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye smiled and looked around at the people in the heart of the city. \"I love being pregnant. Absolutely love it. Love feeling my young kick inside me, love seeing my tummy grow and change, love how my skin is glowing, love how people want to feel and gaze on my belly.\" She ran her fingers over the coin. \"It'd be a shame not to share it with everyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flipped the coin and watched with joy as hundreds more people either rushed to a garbage can as they were overcome with nausea or saw their stomachs expand before them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">In all my years and worlds, I've never met someone as eager as you</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we can keep collaborating in the future,\" Faye purred, gripping the coin tightly in her hand. The coin's voice was silent but she could still feel its influence pumping through her. \"Sleep on it.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even with people just quietly whispering and chatting with each other, Dino's Bar and Grill was pounding with noise as the time of the contest approached closer and closer. The whole sports bar was packed from wall to wall, and thanks to the second floor being opened up for \"VIPs,\" ceiling to ceiling. On the side, Luke and Ryan, or \"Sandwich and Oven\" as they were known to listeners, peered from behind the curtain and banner to look at the gathered crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...that's a lot of people,\" Oven said. \"I know we set up for it and planned it out but really seeing them is shocking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think we'd get this many people when the station owner first gave us the order to set up the contest. I mean, a pregnant bikini contest? Who'd want to go to that?\" Sandwich said, shaking his head. \"We got lucky that pregnancy outbreak hit us when it did or else this would have probably been a failure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, lucky us,\" Oven grumbled, feeling his own growing belly continuing to play with his stomach's appetite and constitution. \"I could have been eaten out by the boss instead of being a freak of medical science.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of many,\" Lisa Smith said, waddling up behind her two co-hosts and patting them on the back. \"So don't feel so bad. At least you're giving Sandwich and his partner a baby to raise. And if it makes you feel better, you're glowing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOven scoffed before laughing and turning to his fellow radio DJs. \"Through all this craziness, I guess there's no one I would have rather done it with than the two of you. 101.9 The Edge really held it together, didn't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We sure did,\" Sandwich nodded, walking out onto the stage. Before Lisa went her separate way, Oven grabbed her wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we start,\" he said, gulping nervously. \"I know I've asked you this sort of thing before-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oven,\" Lisa said in a low voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, seeing how we're both pregnant, there's no one who could understand your body and its needs better than me. So, what do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa sighed and shook her head with a smile. \"Sorry Ryan, but I'm already sleeping with someone who's pregnant.\" She kissed him on the cheek as Oven mulled on what she meant by that before walking to the back section with the rest of the women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oven, where are you?\" Sandwich said, his voice magnified by the microphone. Oven hurried out to the cheers of the crowd. \"There we go. Now we can both welcome you to the first ever Miss Stork Pregnant Bikini Contest, with 101.9 <i>THE EDGE</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-that's right,\" Oven said, clearing his throat and getting back into his on-air persona. \"We've got a lot of moms-to-be ready to show off what they've got. Well, what they've got for the next month at least. Though some of these women look like they might go into labor tonight if you surprise them with a camera flash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience laughed loudly. \"Knock on wood, Oven. Let's not jinx things,\" Sandwich said with a big grin. \"Now, of course, we couldn't have this great event without our sponsors, so we want to give a shout-out to all of them right now, first of all, Titan Bank for all their-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBackstage, as Sandwich and Oven were rattling off the various sponsors, Jack was pacing around with his eyes to the floor. When he felt a hand on his shoulder, he nearly jumped out of his skin. \"A little nervous, Strong Hands?\" Amber laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-a little,\" Jack said, turning to see his red-headed beauty of a boss smiling at him, her eyes looking right through him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's your girlfriend?\" Amber said, putting her hands on top of her belly. Like most of the other women, Amber was currently in a robe to stop from showing off her bikini body just yet. She was plenty big, with full-term twins, but unlike some of the larger women here, her robe could still conceal all of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the bathroom,\" Jack said, watching her hand carefully. \"You, um, look nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber gave a breathy laugh and spread her robe some to show off her creamy belly skin. \"You're sweet, Jack. Really.\" She leaned in close to him, her lips inches from his ear. \"But I'm going to wipe the floor with your girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-good luck,\" Jack said, starting to tremble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber grunted a little when she leaned back up, pressing her hands into the small of her back. \"Oof, that's hard to do this far along. When this thing really starts up, I'm going to need plenty of massages from you. And I won't be the only one.\" Jack felt his face starting to turn hotter. \"You haven't seen your...neighbor, have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faye? No,\" Jack said, looking around. As he looked, a different quadruplet belly blocked his view. \"Hey Jess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi babe,\" Jessica said, giving him a light prod with her belly before turning it to Amber. While most of her body was covered by her robe, her huge pregnant middle was totally exposed and pressed against Amber's. \"And hi Amber. Your hair looks great tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had it done just for the show,\" Amber purred, eyes intently meeting Jessica's. \"Well, good luck to both of you. I should go size up the competition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack let out a long sigh as Amber waddled away and Jessica tussled his hair. \"Relax, dude. These pregnant women aren't going to get all hormonal and tear you apart or whatever you're afraid of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack shrugged. \"I dunno, it's just...we already broke up because I was too close with Faye and now I have to pamper and take care of all these pregnant women. In bikinis. At a beauty contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica laughed and hugged Jack against her belly. \"You are such a goofball. I signed you up for this contest, remember? I think it'll be funny to see you interacting with all these hot preggos...well, maybe not Faye but it's all totally fine, Jack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Jack said, looking up at Jessica but only seeing belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really. Now get up and try interacting with them. They'll think you're creepy if you just mope back here,\" Jessica said, nudging him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the room, Faye and Mariah had their lips locked tightly. Faye was calm and steady with her kisses while Mariah was struggling and moving around far too much. Finally, Faye broke the kiss and put her fingers on Mariah's. \"Okay, okay, easy now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Mariah panted, rubbing her belly quickly up and down. \"I just think you're such an amazing woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Faye said, running her hand down the side of Mariah's face. \"Now, what do you know about your friends' talents for the show tonight? Or their bikinis? How revealing are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their bikinis? You mean you'd change yours?\" Mariah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye smiled and opened her robe up some to reveal her naked breasts. \"I have a few I'm thinking about using.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah turned bright red and felt her knees get weak. \"J-Jessica's is yellow, Ms. Apple's is small and red, and Ms. Smart has a black one. I don't know about their talents, exactly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye sighed and gave Mariah a small pat on the belly. \"That's okay. Thank you for all your help, dear.\" As Mariah turned away, Faye reached around her and fondled her breasts. \"One last question: they don't have the book with them, do they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah was panting heavily now, trying not to squeal out loud. \"J-Jack has it with him,\" she moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye kissed the back of Mariah's head and let go. \"Thank you.\" As Mariah hurried away as best her big, triplet belly would allow, Faye looked at the coin in her palm. \"Perfect. All that's left is to win the contest. Getting the coin and the book from Jack Dale Jr. will be the easy part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">There is something else at work</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something else? What are you talking about?\" Faye frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">You do not hold all the secrets</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye cursed and hid her coin. Trisha, Amber's lamaze coach, waddled by and stared at Faye's frenzied scowl. \"What are you looking at?\" Faye growled, making Trisha hurry away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And of course, big thanks to Dino's Bar and Grill for hosting this event,\" Oven said, as the room filled with applause once again. \"Dino's is open and selling snacks to anyone who wants them, but unfortunately, this is a dry event so no alcohol.\" The room groaned and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you can get plenty tipsy off of soda,\" Sandwich chimed in with a smile. \"But I'd still recommend only people who aren't gestating a fetus inside them drink a lot of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sandwich and Oven went on with some more shtick, up in the VIP section, Nicole Zavaleta hid, peering down on the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two idiots are the only real muscle guarding this event,\" she said to herself in her native language. \"This mission still feels deceptively easy. But it's my last and best shot at finally getting the coin \u2013 all of the coins \u2013 for myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now,\" Sandwich and Oven said in unison, \"give a big round of applause for your contests to see who will be Miss Stork's Pregnant Bikini Champion!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack had to steady himself when he saw the line of beautiful, bikini-clad pregnant women lining up to make their way onto the stage. Since he was expected to stay backstage to take care of anything the expectant contestants might need, there was a television set up with a feed running to cameras recording the show. From the back, Jack could see all of the women parading out but he felt a urge to see a little more for himself. Now was the only time when all of the women would be participating together so no one needed him in the back. He hurried to the side of the stage, obscured by the darkness back there, and prepared to drink it all in. No one would be scrutinizing him for his gawking back here and now he had a perfect waypoint to see all the women as they attempted to look their best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Perfect? Hardly</span> a voice cackled in his head. Jack hesitated, pulling out the coin as pregnant women of no consequence to this story started to walk out. Over the past nine days, he had heard the voice many times, even when it said more things than just \"Flip Me.\" So he could tell when the voice was clearly something different. Before it had been a growling, nasty way of speaking, devoid of any human characteristic aside from the words it was forming. Now, Jack could hear the words very clearly and the voice was much softer, almost as if it belonged to a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" Jack hissed at the coin in his palm, hoping no one would see or hear him seemingly talking to himself. People who do that usually aren't trusted to see to the emotional and comfort needs of dozens of gorgeous pregnant women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">You want to destroy me, don't you Jack?</span> the coin said with a fluttering laugh. It was clearly a feminine voice now. <span class=\"clred\">Yes, I've managed to slip into your mind and I'm coming through much more strongly now. You and your girlfriend have a scattered plan to eliminate this vessel. One that you don't even know will work.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't be talking to me if it wouldn't work,\" Jack said with a panicked laugh of his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">There's a lot of room for error, Jack Dale Jr., but let me just leave you with a thought: what if I could work to your advantage?</span> Jack stayed silent, feeling the coin's essence creep through his brain. <span class=\"clred\">I can give you much more than what you've managed with this little coin. Power over pregnant women. Sounds appealing, doesn't it?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, 'power over pregnant women?'\" Jack said, his voice getting a little louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coin's new voice let out another triumphantly evil laugh that echoed in his head and said nothing else. Jack grumbled and stuck it back in his pocket, trying to focus back on the stage and ignore the remnants of the laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck to you, Charlotte, <b>and</b> your mother. That'll be a tight competition!\" Oven said in his booming announcer voice. \"Up next, no, don't reach for the fire alarm, it's just fiery red-head Amber!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber strut on stage, waving with one hand while her other hand caressed her twin-carrying belly. Jack recognized the same hungry, sexy look in her eyes that she so often teased him with. That'll definitely win over a few voters, even if they don't like pregnant women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now,\" Sandwich said, trading off from Oven. \"She's a yoga instructor so hopefully we'll see if she's just as flexible with triplets on the way, give a big hand for Trisha!\" Out walked the yoga instructor from when Jack took Amber for her class. She was one of the few naturally pregnant women in town but thanks to him, she got a little more than she planned with his coin. As she walked across the stage, she kicked one leg straight up and off to the side of her belly, making the audience gasp and hoot in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Following her is another woman with triplets on the way and, according to her friends, one of the smartest people in the entire city, give it up for Mariah!\" Mariah waddled out on stage, waving shyly as she made her way. She had clearly not changed much and her lack of self-confidence may be hurting her walk. Still, with her striking good looks, huge belly, and her strong blush from her last \"bump-in\" with Faye, she won over plenty of hearts and made up for a lack of stage presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, we have...um...all it says on my card is 'Ms. Apple.' Sandwich, who wrote these?\" Oven said, whispering the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, you got it right,\" Ms. Apple sneered as she hurried out on stage. She welcomed the audience with open arms and got lots of cheers for her red bikini top, which seemed to have been made as part of a contest to see what designer could make a legal top with the least amount of fabric. And given Ms. Apple's \"upper-body,\" that was quite a feat. \"What's up everyone? You like me? Vote for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not allowed to do that,\" Oven grumbled as she moved into line with everyone else. \"I mean...Hey! Let's keep the energy going for our next lady\u2013oh god damn it another weirdo\u2013'Ms. Smart!'\" Out paraded Ms. Smart in her sleek black bikini. Rather than try and shock the audience with sexuality like Ms. Apple, she moved gracefully and tried to give everyone her charms and let her good looks work for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, ooh, you all know her but let's see if she can win your vote, Ms. Mia Vasquez!\" The applause picked up even louder than when Ms. Apple ran out as Mia waddled on stage. Her smooth, shining brown skin was helped by the spotlights as she stroked her enormous triplet-belly with a warm smile. Ms. Apple grit her teeth nervously in line but stopped after Ms. Smart gave her a quick elbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But coming to the stage next, another beautiful young woman who may be able to challenge any of our competitors, please give a warm round of applause for Jessica!\" There was another big gasp as Jessica's belly started to appear on stage before the rest of her body. Instead of shying away from her size, Jessica moved with purpose and caressed her enormous bump with pride, smiling and waving to the crowd. Jack cheered too and saw her flash him a quick wink when she heard him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's very pretty,\" Natalie whispered. Jack turned and saw that she was standing beside him, huffing and rubbing the sides of her colossal belly. She must have just hurried over to get a better look herself. \"Though no match for my Lisa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see,\" Jack chuckled. \"Though...Ms. Smith looks amazing, I have to admit. She'll be a tough one.\" He paused. \"You're, um, very lucky to have her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie gave a little fawning aww and put her hand on his arm. \"That's nice of you to say. And your girlfriend's a big obstacle too. In fact, I wouldn't mind if Lisa had her belly. I think I'd like her a little bigger.\" She looked down at her belly and laughed. \"But this is a little too big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look great too,\" Jack said as Jessica got in line. \"If you were on stage, you'd be the one to beat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I was on stage in a bikini, people would run screaming,\" Natalie chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up next, she works with one of our sponsors and has promised us a great dance later on, so please give it up for Tara!\" Out walked Amanda's co-worker Tara, with her raven-black hair newly styled, just like Amber. As she walked, she made sure to give the audience a few hip wiggles, possibly as a preview for what was to come. Jack gulped and wondered how things would be if he ended up with her instead. Or Amber. Or even Faye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Following her, oh, another woman to look out for, please give a big hand for Faye!\" <i>Speak of the devil</i> Jack thought with a shudder as Faye crept out on stage. Her bikini was just as revealing as Ms. Apple's and she'd clearly applied a glob of skin cream just before walking out and was currently rubbing it into her round belly skin. There was a fierceness in her eyes like he'd never seen before and he could swear she looked directly at him as she turned her head to get in line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now...oh wow, our third competitor carrying quadruplets. This'll be quite the contest, ladies and gentlemen, but for now, please welcome Amanda!\" Jack's mom hurried out, waving and smiling with glee. It had happened slowly over the past week or so but now Jack could really tell how pregnancy had changed her. Not only was her belly, well, enormous, but she looked several decades younger. Amanda could be confused for his sister now instead of his mom. Hopefully, if she won, she'd agree to give him the coin. Or give Jessica the money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, coming to the stage: She was going to host but something changed in her life and soon, you'll see what that is. Please, give a warm 101.9 <b><i>The Edge</i></b> welcome to Ms. Lisa Smith!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place erupted with cheers as Lisa walked out, her voluptuous body well displayed in her tight little bikini. Her triplet belly stuck out proudly, with her skin glowing under the lights. She waved and paraded around longer than the other competitors before stepping back in line, getting death stares from Ms. Apple and Faye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to admit, that was a little unfair,\" Jack whispered to Natalie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say?\" Natalie cooed. \"She's a star.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Give a big hand for all these moms-to-be, though some of them have already been through the process of waddling around with a belly before,\" Sandwich said loudly, gesturing for the audience as they began to applaud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though probably not like this,\" Oven chimed in with an aggressively phony laugh. \"Although maybe they have! We have a lot of good-looking women on stage so they may have flaunted their pregnant bodies in a bikini in the past. Who knows?!\" Jack gulped at the thought of his mother competing like this when she was pregnant with him. The idea didn't bother him but it certainly made him feel a little funny. \"Okay, our ladies are going to head backstage while we get ready for the second leg of our competition: the dance contest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother round of applause roared out of the crowd as all the pregnant women in bikinis made their way to the back. Jack steeled his nerves as he saw the flood of enormous bellies headed toward him, trying to single Jessica's out of the lovely fray. Much to both their amusements, he could pick Jessica's quadruplet midsection out of the stampede and he walked with her to the side of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You looked great out there!\" Jack said excitedly. Jessica laughed softly in response. \"Seriously, you were so poised and your skin looked amazing in the light and, wow, this bikini is just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it,\" Jessica said with a chuckle, placing one finger over Jack's lips. Jack looked down to see both hands were on Jessica's belly, rubbing it gently. \"Hey, it's okay. You get to feel this big tummy whenever you like, pal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack laughed nervously again as he leaned in for a kiss with Jessica. As soon as their lips met, he heard a small noise behind him. \"O-oh!\" Jack turned around to see Mia Vasquez standing there, a hesitant smile on her face. \"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's fine,\" Jack said. \"You're, um, a really great journalist. I love seeing you on the news.\" Jessica gave him a sharp kick to the ankle. \"I-I mean I love seeing your reports on the news.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Mia said with a playful curtsy. \"But now I just need a little help from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-help from me?\" Jack said, raising an eyebrow as he felt his cheeks turn red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you're the volunteer here to give us a hand backstage, correct?\" Mia said. \"Unless I got my information mixed up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's me,\" Jack said, flashing a mildly terrified look at Jessica, who just smirked back at him. \"What can I do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia turned around and pointed to her bikini straps. \"I did my bikini wrong and I'm worried it's too loose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-too l-loose,\" Jack said, clearing his throat. \"Um, I, wouldn't you, um-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dance is very...frenetic, let's say,\" Mia giggled, wiggling her hips seductively just as her plump ass was in Jack and Jessica's faces. After that move, even Jessica was starting to look shocked. \"And I wouldn't want my outfit to fall apart while I'm out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we wouldn't want that,\" Jack gulped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So could you just re-tighten it for me?\" Mia asked with a purr. Jack made a confusing string of syllables come out of his mouth that meant \"yes\" and touched his hands to Mia's back. Her muscles were tight and her skin was sort and warm. He worked as quickly as he could to try and get her top tightened, occasionally feeling her arm brush against his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-there, that should do it,\" Jack blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite. It tightens in the front too,\" Mia said, turning around and striking Jack with her belly. \"Oops! Sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's fine, trust me,\" Jessica chuckled. Jack looked up to see Mia's ample chest. She was busty before Jack's coin got her pregnant and now she was one of the curviest women competing tonight. Nestled between her breasts was a small knot for the bikini. \"It ties in the front too. I need a lot of support.\" Jack was about to agree with her but miraculously, what remained of his mental filter caught that line. He got close to her belly, hoping his erection wouldn't raise any alarms, as he began to undo the knot. Her top loosened more and her breasts began to be freed before Mia caught them. \"There we go, all secure. You can keep going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack gulped again as he tried to work, focusing every neuron he could on the task at hand. But Jessica wouldn't make it that easy for him. \"So Mia, are the babies' father in the audience tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia sighed and looked past Jack at Jessica. \"Between us girls...the father's not in the picture. I tried to keep it a secret because I didn't want it to wreck my career as a prominent reporter in the area but it's just me and these little guys...or little gals, not sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely you could try dating,\" Jessica said. \"I mean, you're a good looking woman with a great job. There must be plenty of guys interested in you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right,\" Mia scoffed, running her hands slowly down the front of her belly. \"What guy would be interested in all this?\" Jack let out a small moan as she caressed her roundness and shoved his erection forward a bit. \"Oops, sorry to hit you,\" Mia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you're fine,\" Jack whimpered as he stepped back. \"Done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, thank you so much!\" Mia said, bouncing a bit to make sure her bikini was properly tightened, which didn't help Jack's mindset. \"And I guess I shouldn't say things like that about me. We're here to celebrate pregnant women's beauty and, damn it, I <u>do</u> think I look good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do!\" Jessica said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia leaned in close to her. \"And again, between you and me, if I met a guy who felt the same way, I'd give him a quick fling that he'd never forget. After 40 weeks of no action, my energy's really been building up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica laughed and gave Mia a pat on the shoulder as she walked away. Meanwhile, Jack was facing away, letting out another groan. \"I'm going insane,\" he murmured to Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you'll be fine. Or at least, you better be,\" Jessica murmured back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Jack said, turning to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you've got more company coming,\" Jessica said, smiling widely as more pregnant women waddled over. \"Hi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. Oh, hi again!\" the woman said, smiling at Jack. \"Remember me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hesitated as the memory returned to him. \"Yeah, from the mall...Carolyn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" She said with a laugh, making her belly and breasts shake. \"I was giving out belly cream samples. And ironically, what I need from you now is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-to rub some belly cream on?\" Jack said. \"S-sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" Carolyn purred, sticking out her pronounced middle and handing Jack a bottle. \"I can't believe I didn't think to apply enough before going out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack laughed in reply, unable to calculate another response as he squirted a big dollop onto Carolyn's stomach. \"That's a lot of cream,\" Jessica noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's got a big belly,\" Jack blurted out before looking up at Carolyn. \"No offense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken! I wish I was as big as your friend here,\" Carolyn said, turning to Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girlfriend, actually,\" Jessica said, resting her hands on her own stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girlfriend? Huh, are you related to one of those other quad moms on stage?\" Carolyn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One's my mom, yeah,\" Jack said, starting to rub the cream into Carolyn's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Big pregnancies must be in your blood.\" Jack shuddered at her choice of words. \"Mmm, that feels so nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm next,\" a woman's voice said. Jack and Jessica turned to see a small line of pregnant women forming behind Carolyn with Trisha up next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure, no problem,\" Jack said, feeling his face get redder and redder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of the way,\" Faye cackled, pushing her belly against Trisha to force her to move. \"Age before beauty. Though in my case, it's both. Hi Jack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey Faye,\" Jack whimpered before Amanda put her hand on Faye's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here Faye. I can help you with that,\" Amanda said sternly, her eyes glaring at Faye. As they walked a few steps away, Amanda brought her voice down. \"What are you up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I just want to give my tummy a nice shine before going out to dance,\" Faye snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're up to something strange with my son and I don't like it,\" Amanda said. \"Jessica is a part of my family now and I won't see you try and split them apart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye rolled her eyes as she and Amanda waddled to the side. In the meantime, Jack continued to have belly after belly come at him, making him a nervous wreck. When Sandwich gave them a signal to wrap it up before the dance portion starts. \"Oh my god,\" Jack groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little too turned on?\" Jessica whispered to Jack, touching his arm softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say that,\" Jack said, shivering again. Jessica laughed and pulled his head closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought this might happen,\" Jessica whispered again. \"I've got some time before I have to go and dance. Want to...get some privacy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack froze. \"W-where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bathroom. No one's using it now anyway,\" Jessica said. \"Besides, I'm a little turned on now too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You?\" Jack stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I told you I liked pregnancy,\" Jessica said, taking Jack's hand and leading him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they're away...</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Faye cackled to herself, her fingers gently brushing against the farther part of her enormous pregnant belly, as she watched Jessica and Jack hurry off to the back. The hormones and pheromones they were giving off were so strong, she could practically smell them. The mother-to-be of quadruplets was still annoyed she was never able to bed Jack and have the kind of sex she preferred while she was expectant but she was not too put off. For one, Mariah proved to be more than enough fun to play with and was willing to do anything Faye asked of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut more importantly, Faye was not worried because she had her eyes on the prize. If she won the bikini contest, she would have two of the three coins and it would only be a matter of time until she had Jack's third enchanted disc of metal. Then, as the voice coming from the coin had promised her, she would have complete control over pregnancy. Faye always wanted to be a mother and she was happy to raise the babies currently kicking and swimming inside her womb but over the past nine months (the coin may have revealed many truths about its powers to her but it still kept her deluded as to the truth of her 9-day pregnancy) Faye discovered something else she loved: being pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye caught herself at times not counting the days until her children arrived but wishing her pregnancy could last longer. Every step in the process was wonderful to Faye. The magnificent swelling of her belly into a colossal smooth ball of warm, tight skin and the shivers it sent down her spine when she ran her hands across her maternal curves, all the way to her inverted navel. Her individuality as a woman began when her umbilical cord was cut as a newborn and became her belly button and now that she was starting that process again, it popped out into a cute nub as if to signal the cycle again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond that, Faye loved the other changes in her body. She had always remained beautiful as she aged but her pregnancy breathed new life into her skin and hair, simultaneously shaving off decades and highlighting the mature glamour she had accumulated. Plus, her ass, breasts, hips, and thighs had taken on new volume and tone since Jack's coin-flipping set her on this course and Faye was totally fine with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the aspects of pregnancy that went beyond the simply physical. Faye loved just &lt;u&gt;being&lt;/u&gt; pregnant. The fullness, the sense of being ripe with new life. The squirming that went on inside her belly at all hours of the day. Her heightened senses and changes in perspective and palate. And Faye was having some of the strongest sex dreams of her life each night of her pregnancy. In truth, much of the reason Faye could love her pregnancy so much was because of the coin itself. Her allegiance to the coin and its goals resulted in Faye getting the best of her condition and none of the negative side effects. No soreness, no tightness, no morning sickness, no rosacea, nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no wonder that Faye had plans continuing after she got her hands on all three coins. After giving birth, she wanted to be pregnant again. Maybe with even more babies. And maybe for longer than nine months. A lot longer. So was Faye annoyed that she didn't get to have sex with Jack? Sure. But was she despondent? No, because she knew she would win this contest handily and get pregnant again when she'd have plenty of time to re-seduce Jack and do so successfully this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Faye knew if she was going to have her idyllic life of pregnancy and motherhood, she couldn't be content to just win this contest by her good looks and sexy dancing. She would need to clinch the competition and try to take out the top contenders. Her eyes scanned the room, looking each woman up and down. After a while, Faye realized why she wasn't having success picking her next target: she &lt;b&gt;knew&lt;/b&gt; she was the most beautiful so all the other women looked plain by comparison. She needed an objective pair of eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Mariah~\" Faye cooed, calling her pregnant booty call over. With her face flushed, Mariah hurried over, arms and legs trembling. \"Don't be shy. Your friend Jessica has gone off with her boyfriend to make love.\" Mariah's blush grew and Faye chuckled, putting her hand on Mariah's shoulder. \"Aww, jealous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were...close,\" Mariah nodded before looking into Faye's eyes. \"B-but that doesn't matter because I have you now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you have me,\" Faye said, applying pressure to Mariah's shoulder. Taking the hint, Mariah slowly got on her knees, groaning some as her pregnancy made this uncomfortable. Faye began to pet Mariah's hair as Mariah embraced Faye's massive belly. \"Now, do two things for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything!\" Mariah squealed, planting a kiss on Faye's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on the right track, dear. Just a little higher.\" Mariah followed her instructions and began to suckle on Faye's popped-out navel. \"Good, now while you do that, I want you to scan the room and look at each woman very carefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do wha?\" Mariah said, drool slurring her words some. But Faye just pressed Mariah's head back against her tummy and twirled Mariah's brown hair in her fingers. Mariah shuddered and followed her mistress's instructions. Faye followed Mariah's gaze around the room. Depending on who Mariah saw, her \"belly button fellatio\" got more or less vigorous, which gave Faye a good measure of her competition's attractiveness. When Mariah had finished going around the room, Faye saw her top threats clearly: Lisa, Mia, and, unfortunately, Amber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, dear,\" Faye purred, stepping away from Mariah and stroking the young woman's belly. \"You were an enormous help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait,\" Mariah said, struggling to stand back up. \"Would you like to...um...go somewhere private?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time. Have to prepare for the contest, after all,\" Faye chuckled, adjusting her bikini top to present her breasts more favorably as she patrolled the room, paying no mind as her large belly pushed away comparatively smaller women. The first woman she saw was Lisa Smith, standing in all her voluptuous glory. Faye had already gotten a strong vibe from Lisa and could tell she was just as mentally strong and formidable as Faye herself. Faye stroked her belly as she thought, before seeing Lisa's lipstick: a distinctive shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye scanned the room before finally finding one other woman with the same shade: Trisha, the yoga instructor. Faye smiled as her eyes locked on and she waddled toward the athletic woman. \"Hello there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello!\" Trisha said with a jolly smile before Faye reached down and kissed her passionately. Trisha moaned and her arms trembled as Faye made sure to press her lips as closely against hers as she could, even flicking her tongue around a bit for fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Faye broke the kiss, Trisha was beet red from head to toe. \"Good luck,\" Faye purred, getting a silent nod in reply as she turned and waddled toward Natalie waiting in the wings. Natalie was on her phone and didn't notice when Faye bumped her belly right up against hers, leaning in with a wide smile. \"I had a talk with your friend, Ms. Smith. She's a very nice woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie was about to thank her before she saw Faye's stained lips and felt her heart sink. The sextuplet-carrying woman clumsily waddled out to the main room, calling for Lisa with an angry tone. Faye cackled and set her sights on Mia Vasquez next, who was very popular as she talked with all the women. Stretching out one hand, Faye prepared to undo Mia's bikini strap before something stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Enough with these school-girl tricks</span>, the coin snapped. <span class=\"clred\">Use what I have given you!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye paused and removed the coin from between her breasts. It was right: something like that would not be sufficient. Faye thought...Mia was a reporter covering the pregnancy outbreak, so what would distract her? Faye peeked out into the audience and flipped the coin. A chorus of shouts and screams erupted as several people experienced a sudden growth in their bellies and a bought of nausea. Mia heard the clatter of chairs and the cries and hurried out to see for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud cackle, Faye returned her coin and was ready to take on her last and worst competition, according to her read of Mariah. It made Faye more than a little upset that her new lover took a shine to Amber as well but that just fueled her fire anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Don't just go on rage. Be smart, woman.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will be,\" Faye purred, locking eyes with Amber as the two waddled toward one another. \"Hello Amber.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faye,\" Amber said with a nod, putting both hands on her hips and popping her belly out to touch Faye's. Immediately, the fetuses inside them began to kick. \"Huh, guess they know their siblings are nearby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vein pulsed on Faye's forehead but she tried to remain calm. \"Oh Amber...you sweet, foolish girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Amber said, not expecting that kind of an insult from the wife of the man she slept with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you are, just thinking you're a whore and a slut when in fact, you didn't get impregnated by my husband at all,\" Faye purred, reaching into her chest to retrieve the coin. \"You see this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a magical coin that causes pregnancies. It's the cause of everything in the city,\" Faye said, getting ready to drop the bomb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telling me a coin is making women pregnant?\" Amber said, raising a red, sleek eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not just women, trust me,\" Faye chuckled. \"And it's true. You should ask the man who used the coin first and got you pregnant in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? And who's that?\" Amber said. Faye just pointed behind her and waddled away smiling. Amber turned to see Jack and Jessica leaving the bathroom hand in hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now there's no one left in my way who isn't distracted,\" Faye laughed to herself as she patted her belly, relishing the movement inside her womb.</span></div></div>",

Do you know what you have done!? </span> The coins screamed in her head, It was angry, very angry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, the hungry thing beyond the beyond was more angry at itself more than it was upset at Faye. It cannot blame human stupidity, as human stupidity was a blessing and a curse. It was a blessing in order for it to spread it's chaos and feed, but every few hundred years, the magic blows up it in the horrible thing many faces, and this was that time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt should have been clearer, should have explained the rules to her. It should have told her that even though reality can change, that women can think they were pregnant for months, that men can be made to think that getting pregnant was normal, reality is still delicate, like glass. Easy to mold, easy to break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd reality was about to break, because of Faye's words to Amber. Amber was now aware of the fact that she wasn't supposed to be pregnant with Charles children, that her current condition was the cause of the coin. Faye had told her so, and in doing so, the \"glamour\" of the coin's new reality came crashing down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had two memories now, the truth and the reality she perceived the truth; a drunken mistake in the bar, a growing belly, a quest to find the man who was the father of her children. But yet, she remember dancing and getting so wasted just a week or so ago. Spending money on new skin tight dress that emphases her breasts and tight stomach. Buying shoes not cribs, buying makeup not diapers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd suddenly, what once seems to be her accepted truth became a dream, a bunch of fuzzy memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magic was gone when Faye told the truth, Amber suddenly remembered how everything use to be, should be. Soon everyone who though reality was one thing will soon remember what it should be. The truth can be like a virus, easily spread. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber felt a kick in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe screamed. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amber screamed as the realization hit her. When Faye first told her about how her pregnancy \u2013 the physical process of growing, gestating, and nurturing two of her own biological children inside her womb for 40 weeks  \u2013 was in fact the result of some kind of magic and she had only been pregnant for little more than a week, Amber ignored it as nonsense. After all, could you think of anything stupider than a coin that causes pregnancy? That wouldn't even make a good story, let alone a believable cause for her condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it made Amber start to think about her pregnancy and search for evidence to the contrary. That was when Amber realized she could not recall any details before last week. She couldn't remember seeing her doctor for an ultrasound, not counting her less-than-cordial run in with the army of HHS agents that ran the city for a while. She couldn't remember picking out baby supplies or watching her belly slowly grow over the nine months. Hell, Amber couldn't even remember having sex with Faye's husband to cause the pregnancy in question. All she had was the vague impression that these things <i>must</i> have happened but...there wasn't a shred of memory in Amber's head to confirm that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she screamed with shock at the horrifying realization, her eyes narrowed on Jack, the man Faye just told her was the reason she couldn't fit into her pants without fully unzipping them. She stormed toward Jack, her large belly pushing against his still-vigorous erection. Any other time, Amber would have taken the time to tease her employee about this but right now she was not in the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" Amber hissed, grabbing Jack around the throat with one hand. \"You did this to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, easy!\" Jessica said, her quadruplet belly awkwardly pushing against Amber's. \"What's going on? Let him go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not the only one with strong hands, hon,\" Amber sneered, eyes still locked with Jack's. She could see the fear on his face as clear as day, though there was no doubt a flicker of excitement from being attacked by a pregnant beauty like his boss. \"It all makes sense...why there are so many pregnant women around you, why you're always playing with that fucking coin...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" Jessica said, suspecting the worst. \"Amber, relax. The coin, all of it...we're trying to fix it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fix it?\" Amber grunted before stopping to think. Gradually, her grip softened and Jack stumbled back, clutching his neck and coughing. \"How many people know about this thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Better not to get into that</font>,\" Jack choked, still clearing his throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber turned to Jessica and prodded her enormous middle with one finger. \"So yours is also...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Jessica said with a sigh, reaching both hands across her belly and slowly rubbing both sides, feeling the kicks in response to Amber's touching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gorgeous red-head snickered. \"And here I thought Jack was dating a girl carrying another man's babies. I knew you weren't that much of a push-over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, even if she was, I'd still love Jessica,\" Jack said, putting one arm around her shoulders and pulling her close before touching his other hand against her stomach. \"Isn't that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica purred and kissed Jack on the cheek. \"My, getting kinda feisty, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber sighed and ran her hands through her long fiery locks, pushing her hips and belly out in the process. \"So...you two think you can fix this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to win the coin that's part of the prizes for 1st place,\" Jessica explained. \"So if you win...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, it's yours,\" Amber nodded, stroking her belly and looking around the room. \"But what if no one wins?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one? What do you mean?\" Jack said before following Amber's gaze. Things were not looking good. Bits and pieces of their conversation were being overheard and the damage Faye's prodding had done was already damaging the delicate reality bending already taking place. Women who were overjoyed and rosy with their pregnancies were realizing how, until recently, they were going about life with an utterly empty womb. And that resulted in no small amount of panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother-daughter competitors were both hyperventilating and touching each other's bellies nervously, unsure what to say to the other. Trisha, still reeling from her kiss with Faye, began to question everything that had happened at her class and ran her hands around her stomach, fully aware that there was one fetus too many inside her. The sensation of an \"alien\" baby mixed in with her previously natural twins chilled her to the bone. Tara was pacing around madly, her hands rubbing every square inch of her massive triplet belly. She was worried enough when her second and third babies showed up unannounced but now that the whole pregnancy and all of her concerns about finding the father and raising a family alone were twisted around and magnified. She doubted even Zavaleta could console her at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no one was reacting as poorly as Mia Vasquez. The triplet-carrying bombshell was having a full meltdown, hesitating to even touch her belly. Everything she'd worked on for the past week had revolved around her pregnancy and the pregnancies of the people in the city. Now that was all a lie or some kind of even stranger medical event than the \"pregnancy sickness?\" And where did these babies even come from? When she felt them start to kick, Mia screamed with fear and tried to hide her pregnant body, which was exceedingly difficult since she was in a skimpy bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is bad,\" Jessica said, looking around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the panic is only getting worse,\" Ms. Smart said, storming over to Jack. \"What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing! Honest!\" Jack said, holding up his hands in self defense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was her,\" Amber said, pointing to Faye. The massive mom-to-be was currently muttering to herself and was clearly not happy with the latest developments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect, she's somehow undone the reality change from the coin,\" Ms. Smart sighed. \"If this spreads out into the audience too, we could have a full-on riot and we're only a few hours away from the deadline.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deadline?\" Amber asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're too new to this, red,\" Ms. Apple snickered, waddling over and sticking out her chest and belly to compare against Amber. \"Don't ask too many questions or you'll just hurt your head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Faye's internal argument was only getting worse. <span class=\"clred\">There needs to be a victor!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Why can't I just live my life and have my babies?\" Faye whined, cradling the underside of her massive bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">You threaten everything by leaving us exposed! The competition must go on!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine, whatever,\" Faye grumbled. \"As long as I get to be pregnant after all this is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Mortal, I will give you a pregnancy only written about in myth. But you need to win.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will! I'll crush these bitches!\" Faye cackled. \"What do I have to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Give me to the chosen one.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The...who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">The boy.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye's heart sunk right into her womb. \"Jack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">He has control and affinity that you do not. If mistakes are to be corrected, I need more power.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye shuddered with anger before a wave of nausea and contractions overcame her. The coin was not playing around. With a growl, she waddled over to Jack, nearly bowling him over with her belly. \"Here.\" She shoved the coin into his chest, feeling the stinging stares of Amber, Jessica, and Ms. Smart. \"Fix this and then keep the coin ready because I'll take it right back from you, sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks?\" Jack said, looking at the second coin nervously. He took out his own coin and held the two together for comparison. Both were identical in every way and Jack could feel his skin start to tingle as he held them close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Tthhaatt'ss bbeetttteerr</span> a grotesque voice said in his head. Amber saw Jack's confused look and cocked her head as well, but in the meantime, she felt her heart rate start to slow down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the situation she faced \u2013 being impregnated by a coin and believing it was natural all this time \u2013 was no longer as distressing. She knew she had only been pregnant for a few days, sure, but it was not as distressing. And around the room, other women were clearly relaxing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard some commotion back here,\" Oven said, peeking his head around the curtain. \"Is everything okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're all fine,\" Jessica said back with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Lisa?\" he asked, looking around the room. \"Well whatever. She'll need to show up when her name's called. It's dance time, ladies!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"We've already got your music queued so when you get on stage, just wait a moment for it to start,\" Oven called out as the women lined up. It stretched all throughout the back room because of how many women were participating and because so many of them had such extreme belly sizes. \"And remember, you only have a few minutes to show the audience what you've got so stay focused and make it count.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the women in line were laughing at chatting with one another. Even with the prizes being offered, this was all taken as a light-hearted event. It was a pregnant bikini contest, after all. Not much gravity behind that. But for the women most closely connected to Jack, they were nervously pacing in place, hands stroking their bellies faster than ever before. Jessica, Ms. Smart, and Ms. Apple were worried about whether they could perform well enough to win and get the final coin back, Mariah was still uncomfortable with her betrayal to Faye, and several other women had just discovered that their pregnancies had not lasted as long as they'd thought and they too were victims of the \"pregnancy disease,\" with their bellies appearing only a handful of days prior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the women Jack knew personally, only his mother Amanda and Faye looked composed. He'd done his best to keep Amanda insulated from the controversy surrounding the coin and the pregnancies it had caused, especially since she had enough on her plate with the coin giving the 50 year old quadruplets. Faye had her usual sultry smile across her plump lips because...well, she was Faye. Even with the loss of her own coin, she had enough sensual confidence to win it all back once the competition was over. Even Ms. Apple and Smart had to admit that Faye was a top contender to win the whole contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stood beside Jessica in silence as she got closer to the stage. Trisha had just made her way out. She was clearly attempting some kind of dance combining her flexibility as a fitness instructor with the size and shape of her tanned twin belly but just before she was called out, Faye had given her a strong kiss to steal some of the color from her lipstick. Trisha's knees were weak and she stumbled in her steps, trying not to make eye contact with the father of her babies. And it didn't help that, until a moment ago, she was unaware that she was originally only carrying one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Trisha,\" Sandwich said, reading off of his cards as Trisha hurried off-stage. \"Next we have...our own Miss Lisa Smith!\" The crowd erupted with applause as Lisa walked out slowly, her heavy breasts on full display in her skimpy bikini and her triplet belly hanging out proudly. She stood on stage, nervously patting her belly as she tried to get Natalie out of her mind. Lisa did her best to convince her girlfriend that she hadn't made out with Faye but there wasn't much time to argue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa's music came in \u2013 a generic hair metal song \u2013 and Lisa began to strut around the stage. Her routine could only be described as a strip tease, but minus any clothing being removed. And there aren't a lot of women full term with triplets doing strip teases either. But she wiggled her hips and rear and chest in front of the crowd, bending and turning, all while jutting her belly out and stroking it. The audience, especially those familiar with 101.9's programming, hooted and hollered while several people remained quiet, assuming a pregnant bikini contest would be <i>somewhat</i> family friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Lisa was ending her routine, she got sight of Natalie off to the side. Her arms were crossed and resting on her sextuplet belly, half exposed from under her shirt. And Lisa could see her still scowling up at her, but this time, she was also crying. Lisa stopped dead in her tracks, just staring at Natalie. The audience murmured to one another as Lisa's music died out and she waddled off stage in the wrong direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandwich cleared his throat into the microphone and looked down at the next card. \"N-next up we have...oh, another local celebrity, Mia Vasquez!\" Mia waddled out quickly after prodding from Oven to undo that awkward showing, and stood tall on stage, hands on her hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I don't even know how these babies got inside me</i> Mia said, sticking her hips out to accentuate her swollen middle. <i>But you're about to get the ride of your lives</i>. Mia's music came in slowly and she began to move gracefully around the stage, letting her hips wiggle to make her pregnancy dance above the audience. As they oohed and awed, the beat dropped. Mia hopped as high as she could and began to shake her body all over. Ass, breasts, belly, everything was whipped around and fondled in rhythm with the music. She continued to dance, a big smile on her face as she got lost in the music, when she heard a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...Mia?\" Brooke, one of her station's anchors said. Mia saw her shocked expression and looked down at herself. Her bikini had come loose again. Very loose. It was off and Mia had been dancing with her chest exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia hurried off stage as Sandwich scrambled to grab the microphone and introduce the next participant. \"O-okay, up next we have Mariah-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandwich looked up to see Mariah shaking her head. Her face was as red as a cherry ferrari. \"What do you mean, 'Pass?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pass. I forfeit this round,\" Mariah said, trembling before running away as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Christ,\" Sandwich muttered, unaware his microphone picked that up. \"Okay, uh...Tara? Are you still here or is the whole show falling apart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here,\" Tara said, already front-and-center on stage. She'd managed to change a little before this part of the competition and it certainly made an impression. Her bikini top was still on but she had a long, dark skirt around her legs with some beads sewn in. But most surprisingly was the extensive paint done on her belly, flowering out like a henna painting. When the spotlight went on her, the audience could see it and gasped. Then her music started: a mid-paced Middle Eastern song with plenty of drums. Tara began to belly-dance, shaking her hips and undulating her large pregnant belly along with the drums as her skirt flapped out and her beads jingled. Jack peeked through the curtains at her movement and fell a shudder run through his core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandwich let out a sigh of relief, glad a real dance had finally come as Tara's time ended and she left the stage to great applause. Faye huffed, unaware she would put on such a good show. Next came Ms. Smart, whose familiarity with high arts let her do a graceful dance with plenty of hip movement to show off her pronounced belly. Following her was Ms. Apple, who had a little more composure than her practices but still relied heavily on showing off just how inviting her cleavage was, which seemed to get plenty of reaction from the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least her top didn't come off too,\" Sandwich muttered again, still unaware how much his voice was being picked up by the microphone. Ms. Apple shot him a withering look as she left and Sandwich introduced Amber. If Lisa had been trying to do a strip tease, Amber was a full-out champagne room entertainer. Spreading her legs, Amber dipped down and gyrated her hips, letting her belly follow suit as she glided around the stage, making eye contact with the most nervous men and women in the audience and smiling and purring at them. She'd had so much success teasing Jack so why not try it out on her audience?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came Amanda, who got plenty of applause for her notoriety as the oldest woman competing and many were still surprised at how good she looked at her age. Better than many of the women in their 20s, even! And Amanda used every bit of energy she had in her, rushing around the stage to \"Flashdance\" and letting her belly do all the talking. She didn't shy away from the size of her pregnancy and the crowd loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was an energetic one!\" Sandwich said with a chuckle. \"Up next is...Faye Jones!\" The lights went out and the crowd yelped in response. Then one spotlight came on, showing Faye in the center of the stage. She had her flirty smirk on and her body was newly oiled up. As burlesque music began to play, Faye slowly ran her hands up and down her body, cupping her chest and stroking her belly. With each stroke, Faye walked closer to the edge of the stage, eventually stepping down and mingling with the audience, inviting people to touch and touching them back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do you all think should win?\" she cooed to one pregnant woman who wasn't competing. The music died down and she flashed a grin, waddling back behind the stag.e<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really a dance,\" Sandwich muttered. \"But straight guys'll fall for anything, I suppose...okay, up next! Give it up for Jessica!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd out she came. Her music was the peppy but with a little electro edge. Jessica bolted out and took a deep breath before hitting her marks. She had reversed every step so many times for so many days and it showed. Hips, arms, legs, belly. She moved with expert precision, as if her hulking quadruplet belly didn't weigh a thing. The audience marveled at her, a mix of sexuality and technique, until Jessica came to a stop, arms outstretched and belly sticking out. The audience roared with applause as she smiled and waddled off, into Jack's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-that was amazing!\" Jack laughed, kissing her on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Jessica laughed, nuzzling against him. \"Maybe you'll get to see it up close someday. In a private show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't mind,\" Jack said, touching one hand to her belly. \"Maybe I could even coach you. A little hands-on training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth giggled and headed for the back as Sandwich picked his mic back up. \"Great showing. Up next, some character who doesn't matter to the plot...wait, who wrote this?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Backstage, Faye was fuming. Hands on her wide hips, she leered at the monitors displaying the scene out front and tapped one foot incessantly. Here she was convinced she had managed to knock out the top threats in the bikini contest and Jessica managed to come out and throw a wrench into her plan. Her dance was charismatic, sensual, and didn\u2019t shy away from showing off her pregnant belly. Even Faye\u2019s advantage of being close to the largest woman in the whole competition in terms of pregnancy size was undone thanks to Jessica also carrying quadruplets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah, still answering to Faye with eager puppy love, was staying cautiously far from her new lover. She\u2019d been used to Faye\u2019s\u2026mood swings, let\u2019s say\u2026and didn\u2019t want to anger her any further. Mariah certainly didn\u2019t want to point out that Jessica was only carrying quadruplets because of Faye\u2019s reckless use of the coin when she, Jessica, and Jack snuck around in her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-you did great,\u201d Mariah said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I did,\u201d Faye snapped, turning and shooting Mariah a piercing gaze that nearly made the pregnant bookworm faint right on the spot. \u201cBut why didn\u2019t you tell me Jack\u2019s girlfriend was such a skilled dancer? You both trained together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah just warbled and didn\u2019t get any clear answer out, leaving Faye to scoff and turn away. The truth was, when Faye asked Mariah for her assessment of the competition, Jessica and Jack were getting busy in the bathroom so she\u2019d gone under the radar. But Faye had bigger problems. Her big plan for the talent portion was going to be using the coin to make someone pregnant (or based on the audience, more pregnant) and pass it off as a magic trick. With the coin throwing a tantrum and demanding to be held in Jack\u2019s possession for now, she was left out in the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou like me, don\u2019t you?\u201d Faye said to Mariah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes!\u201d Mariah said hurriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye smiled and touched one hand to Mariah\u2019s cheek, feeling the girl shudder at her touch. \u201cThen develop a new talent routine for me. One that will cement me as the top of the competition.\u201d She touched her belly against Mariah\u2019s and leaned in for a kiss, sealing the deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kiss did not go unnoticed by Ms. Smart, who was watching after Mariah declined to participate in the dance portion of the bikini contest. \u201cLooks like we\u2019re down one team member,\u201d she reported back, joining Jack, Jessica, and Ms. Apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had a feeling about her,\u201d Ms. Apple sighed. \u201cShe had the same look in her eyes I give men when I mesmerize them for information.\u201d She crossed her arms, propping up her heaving chest in the process. \u201cShe\u2019s smitten.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack gulped, and not just because his eyes were now drawn to Ms. Apple\u2019s enticing cleavage. He was thinking about how close he was to Faye \u2013 before everything happened with the coins and during the plot to steal the book back from her. Could he have been put in the same position as Mariah?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-that\u2019s okay, we don\u2019t need Mariah,\u201d Jack said. \u201cJessica killed it out there. And even if, by some crazy oversight, the crowd didn\u2019t like her, you both danced really well too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how they couldn\u2019t love me,\u201d Ms. Apple said with a little smile, kicking her hip out some and running one hand down her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, focus up,\u201d Ms. Smart sighed, patting Ms. Apple on her red-haired head. \u201cWe\u2019re still going to need Mariah\u2019s help decoding the book if it comes to that. Plus there\u2019s still the talent portion and I don\u2019t think Mrs. Jones is done with her tricks just yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and Jessica nodded as Sandwich started up on the microphone again. \u201cOkay, now that our ladies have had time to rest, let\u2019s welcome them back out for the last section of the night before voting: the talent segment! Please, give a big hand as these moms-to-be show us what they\u2019ve got!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd began to clap as the women lined up to go back out. \u201cDo your best,\u201d Jack said with a smile, kissing Jessica on the lips and stroking her belly. She held his hand against her midsection long enough to feel a few kicks before lining up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp in the rafters, Zavaleta was still watching with care, stroking her enormous octuplet belly and feeling how tight it was getting. Clearly, something had changed with the chaotic magic as the crowd seemed unsteady with the previous \u201creality rewriting\u201d that the coin created. By her guess, one of the coin\u2019s owners \u2013 Jack or Faye \u2013 had tried to manipulate it or destroy it and it didn\u2019t go well. But now that things seemed steady, only one of them was holding onto it now. But Zavaleta didn\u2019t know who was the likelier candidate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few other women of no barring to our story, out came Mia Vasquez with a big smile on her face. A little too big, especially considering how distracted she was with her bikini constantly falling apart and the realization that she hadn\u2019t been pregnant, particularly not with triplets, for longer than a week or so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello,\u201d Mia said, speaking into a microphone. \u201cWhen I learned there was a talent portion in this contest, I wasn\u2019t sure what to do. But then I sat down and thought about it and it became clear that I have one very definite talent: reporting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights on the stage dimmed and a ceiling-mounted projector showed slides depicting large sums of money and numbers of individuals, linked with the names of various government and private-sector organizations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo for my \u2018talent,\u2019 I\u2019m going to clue you all in to what my reporting has recently revealed about our city\u2019s take-over by the Department of Health and Human Services,\u201d Mia said, her smile growing and growing as the audience stirred uncomfortably in their seats. \u201cNamely, how HHS was never in charge of the operation to begin with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone watched in shock as Mia went on and on, in great detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you can see from this form, this is not an issue limited to one country,\u201d Mia said, now deep into her report. \u201cThis organization, PEAR, has resources from nearly every country, and at least every industrialized one. And again, they only appear when issues surrounding pregnancy arise and they take total control, as they did in our city.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what a talent!\u201d Sandwich said, laughing nervously. \u201cBut we are about\u202630 minutes over your allocated time so it\u2019s time to welcome our next expectant lady!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the audience clapped politely, Sandwich walked Mia off-stage as she continued to talk. \u201cThis organization exists outside of any international charter! It is essentially an illegal military force and any inquiry by any country could reveal even more!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZavaleta chuckled, watching Mia leave. This may be the death knell in PEAR once and for all. She was a dedicated soldier and followed PEAR for years to try and get her hands on the coin but now that Mia\u2019s report was done, Zavaleta was glad to see it go. PEAR betrayed her at the first chance and she was pregnant. She didn\u2019t need them anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more competitors, out strolled Faye, a terrifying look on her face. She wasn\u2019t scowling or even clearly angry. That was what made her so scary: she looked eerily happy. She glided across the makeshift stage and struck a pose in front of the audience and scanned them slowly, letting her pouty lips and heavy eyelids work their magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy talent?\u201d Faye said into the provided microphone. She paused, thinking of something to say. Mariah was too busy running around backstage to give her any ideas. So Faye did what she had to. \u201cMy talent is that I am still keeping my family together.\u201d The audience murmured. \u201cFor years, I was told I couldn\u2019t bear children. Then when I find out I\u2019m blessed with four babies of my own, growing in my glorious, swollen womb, what other news do I get?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and pulled on the curtain to expose the rest of the women and grabbed Amber, dragging her out on stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI learned my husband also got another woman pregnant!\u201d Faye barked, pointing at Amber\u2019s belly. \u201cThis fiery slut!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bitch!\u201d Amber growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa now,\u201d Sandwich said, hurrying between them. \u201cT-this is a fun event, let\u2019s remember.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s my talent: 10 years of command sambo,\u201d Amber spat at Faye, reaching back for a punch and accidentally hitting Sandwich in the head and chin and knocking him out cold. \u201cOops.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOven rushed out, looking between the three of them as the audience gasped and hooted. \u201cUh\u2026brief intermission,\u201d he said as a new curtain dropped down and Amber and Faye left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBackstage, Mariah was trembling as she got close to Faye. \u201cY-you did a good job out there. You\u2019ll get big points for sympathy from anyone who\u2019s ever been cheated on, for sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh shut up,\u201d Faye snarled. \u201cYou obnoxious child. I could get anyone to take care of my beautiful body and I picked you because I thought you were useful. I was wrong.\u201d She ripped Mariah\u2019s bikini top off and shoved her away. \u201cNo wonder no one likes you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah whimpered and hurried for the nearest corner, curling up and shaking. As she began to lightly sob, Jessica came over and put one arm around her back. \u201cHey\u2026everything okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFaye\u2026broke up with me,\u201d Mariah sniffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she was a good fit for you,\u201d Jessica said with a chuckle. \u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s get you some new clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cE-even after I helped her beat you?\u201d Mariah said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, even after that,\u201d Jessica sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re my best friend, after all.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You're up next,\" Oven said, one hand on his budding pregnant belly as he passed by Jessica to walk over to where Sandwich was lying with a wet towel compress. Sandwich had come to but he was still a little groggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knocked out by a pregnant woman,\" Sandwich said, holding his chin and adjusting his jaw. \"That's a new one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least it wasn't Lisa. I thinks she's wanted to deck us for years and if she actually KO'd one of us, we'd never hear the end of it,\" Oven chuckled. \"But we might be fasttracking the rest of the night. We have a lot of women and it's almost midnight and I don't want those two to let their family drama turn into a riot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBackstage, Jessica was pacing around, rubbing the sides of her belly as she had a small frown on her pink lips. Jack and Mariah looked at her worried. \"Hey, everything okay?\" Jack asked. \"I know the stuff with Faye and Amber's fighting is still scary but we'll figure this all out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that,\" Jessica said, nibbling on her thumb. \"I kind of focused all my time on learning to dance and...forgot to come up with a talent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I hear that right?\" Ms. Smart said, charging over with Ms. Apple waddling up behind her. \"You don't have a talent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was focusing on just being...sexy and confident,\" Jessica said, looking down at her quadruplet middle as her face turned pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I think you excelled at that,\" Jack smiled, kissing Jessica on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ease up, casanova. We have bigger things at stake here,\" Ms. Smart said, patting her tight, dark belly. \"This competition needs to be a slam dunk. There can't be the slightest chance anyone else wins outside of our circle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think, Jessica. You must have something you can do,\" Mariah chirped. \"You're so talented and...amazing.\" Mariah started to blush and curled her hands around her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up with her?\" Ms. Apple said, gesturing at Mariah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She just went through a breakup \u2013 she's fine,\" Jessica said. \"I could try and dance again. That would work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Against the rules,\" Jack said, shaking his head. \"I read up before coming here to help out backstage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, boy,\" Trisha called out, waddling over and prodding her wide bump with one finger. \"My tummy skin is drying out. I need some moisturizer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack blushed and grabbed a bottle of skin cream. \"B-be right over,\" he said before looking back at Jessica. \"I-I'm sure you'll come up with something.\" He hurried over to the pregnant exercise instructor, kneeling down before her bare belly as he started to rub the moisturizer into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica continued to ponder before a little light went off in her head. \"I think I might have something,\" Jessica said, grinning at her collaborators. \"I'll see you all in a bit.\" Jessica waddled across the backstage area to Amanda, who was resting in a chair while holding onto her huge stomach. \"You look winded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dancing while pregnant is not easy. Especially at my age,\" Amanda chuckled, patting her enormous belly. \"You did a wonderful job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, you were good too,\" Jessica smiled, putting her hands on her hips. \"Say...what did you have planned for your talent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda shrugged. \"I was just going to lip sync to one of my favorite songs. I thought it would be funny and I'm just here to have a good time.\" Her smile grew as Jessica slowly sat down next to her. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking...we haven't done a lot together as mother and daughter-in-law,\" Jessica said. \"Maybe we could...share this one? Do a duet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda laughed out loud, a big smile on her face. \"Oh Jessica, that would be wonderful.\" She put one hand on Jessica's belly. \"And I'd get to share a memory with my grandchildren...I know they aren't exactly Jack's but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they are absolutely your grandchildren,\" Jessica smiled, placing one hand on top of Amanda's. Both women sat there in silence, feeling the kicks and hiccups inside Jessica, until Oven came over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're up,\" he said. \"Do you need the sound people to cue anything up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica turned to Amanda and smiled. \"We'll be doing ours together. Cue up Mrs. Dale's music.\" Oven nodded and hurried back, talking into a headset, as Jessica and Amanda helped each other to their feet. \"So what's our song?\" Amanda just smiled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women waddled out on stage to applause from the crowd. \"Ladies and gentlemen, this is my mother-in-law and these are her grandchildren,\" Jessica said, pointing to Amanda and her own swollen stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is my daughter-in-law and her, I suppose, brothers and sisters-in-law,\" Amanda giggled, rubbing her belly. The audience laughed softly and gasped in pleasant surprise. \"So since we're both about to bring our children into the world, we wanted to share a little something while they're all still inside us.\" Both women nodded to the sound crew. Shania Twain's \"I Feel Like A Woman\" started up and Jessica nearly burst out laughing as Amanda mouthed along to \"Let's Go Girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, Jessica knew the song by heart as well and both women paced around the stage with sultry grace, exchanging verses and rubbing their bellies together when it came time to shout out the chorus. The audience loved it, laughing and clapping as it went on. When it was done, both women stood at the front and waved, with Amanda bending down to kiss Jessica's round belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Amanda whispered to Jessica, tears forming in her eyes. \"That was...special.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay and up next, give it up for Mariah!\" Oven said, with the audience clapping again. Backstage, Mariah turned to Ms. Apple and Ms. Smart with big, shocked doe eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't have anything to do either,\" Mariah squeaked. Ms. Apple slapped her forehead and Ms. Smart stepped toward Mariah, pushing her back with her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You helped our enemy conspire against us and I am not as nice as Jessica,\" Ms. Smart said through clenched teeth. \"Just do something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I have a lot of Shakespeare memorized. I could do some of that,\" Mariah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, fine, just go!\" Ms. Smart said, turning the trembling triplet-carrying woman toward the stage and pushing her forward. Mariah stumbled onto stage, looking terrified, before turning up toward the spotlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-a reading of a famous poem,\" Mariah said before taking a deep breath. When she started to speak, it was like an entirely different woman was on stage, full of energy and power. \"He jests at scars that ever felt a wound. But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?\" Everyone was silent, suddenly transfixed by her line delivery. \"It is the east and Jessica is the sun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack hurried over to Ms. Smart and Ms. Apple. \"Did she say...Jessica?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thou, her maid, art more fair than she. Be not her maid, since she is envious; her vestial livery is but sick and green and none but fools do wear it; cast it off,\" Mariah said, her voice getting choked up. \"It is my Faye, O it is my love: O that she knew she were!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh,\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's still doing pretty well,\" Ms. Apple whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh,\" one of the other participating pregnant women hissed at them. \"This is beautiful. Don't talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When he bestrides the lazy puffing clouds and sales upon the bosom of the air,\" Mariah said in conclusion. \"E-especially the bosom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room filled with thunderous applause as Mariah quickly bowed and hurried away. Her face was bright red and she was trying to hide in the back. But the pregnant woman who hissed at Jack waddled over, putting one hand on her bare back. \"Hey...that was terrific.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-thanks. I t-think I messed up some lines though,\" Mariah squealed. This other woman was very attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got this sense of real passion for not just one woman, but all women,\" her new pregnant friend said. \"I'm Juliet, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-seriously?\" Mariah choked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not really. I'm Gina,\" she giggled. \"You know, I love Shakespeare too. And I love to read.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-me too,\" Mariah said with a little smile. \"I, um, work at a book store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so cool!\" Gina said. \"Hey, do you want to go somewhere and...talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMariah smiled and looked down at their touching bellies. \"I'd like that,\" she murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Oven said on stage. \"I-I mean, up next we have...Ms. Apple. Why can't we get her real name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Apple strutted out on stage with a big smile on her face and a banana and a condom in her hands. \"Hey everyone. My talent is that I am the fastest at putting on a condom with just my mouth. Now if someone wants to time me-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's enough of that,\" Oven said, hurrying her off-stage and welcoming up the next competitors. The rest went through quickly as the clock was counting down to midnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This had better be over soon,\" Zavaleta said, stroking her tightening belly as she watched the show from the rafters. \"I am losing my patience quickly and I have not seen any sign of the coin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBallots for voting were all handed up to the front, where Oven and a newly steady Sandwich counted them up. \"Looks like we're ready to read out our winners,\" Oven said with a big, showbiz smile. \"Your winner of the First Annual Miss Stork Pregnant Bikini Contest, sponsored by 101.9 <i>The Edge</i> is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just as Oven read out the name-</span></div></div>",

He grunted, feeling his shirt start to roll up and reveal more of his round curve. \"Ugh, that felt weird,\" he said to himself, worried what people might think if they saw. Male pregnancy was not exactly rare in the city lately but he didn't know how people would react to his gut actually expanding in front of them. But when Oven looked back up at the crowd, he saw he was the last thing on their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the audience, pregnant women were groaning and panting, the floor soaked with amniotic fluid. As soon as the midnight hit, nearly everyone's water broke and contractions were coming fast. It was deafeningly loud as men and women heaved themselves out of their slippery seats and tried to waddle to their loved ones or make it out the door, tightening bellies bumping into one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBackstage, it was even worse. Bikini-clad women with enormous middles were panicking, all stroking their swollen middles as they felt their fetuses start to really try and escape. Jessica was one of the few who were immune but her progression to be full-term with quadruplets still took the air out of her and she doubled over while clutching her stomach. It was now double her arms' length and the kicks were much stronger. Jack held her in his arms as she rode out the last tremors of growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it,\" Jack whispered in her ear, giving his increasingly pregnant girlfriend a kiss on the cheek. \"You won.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not in time,\" Jessica sighed, looking at the struggling women backstage. Mariah, Ms. Smart, and Ms. Quick were hurrying over, all red-faced and sweating as they gripped their stomachs. \"How are you holding up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're moving fast,\" Ms. Quick winced, moving her hand to her lower belly, patting her dark tan skin. \"You two might want to...oof.\" She squatted, spreading her legs as she rubbed her stomach in wide circles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've done this before. You can hold it in,\" Ms. Apple chuckled, turning to Jack and Jessica. \"What she means is now that you won, hurry up and...oh boy.\" She leaned back, pushing both hands into her lower back to stick her pregnant swell out even farther, its rosy smooth surface constantly shaking with kicks and punches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I get the idea,\" Jack said, turning to Mariah. \"Before we grab the last coin, any advice on how to undo all this? You had the book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-right, um,\" Mariah panted, her hands rubbing quickly near her navel. \"The closer they all get together, the weaker they'll become. So if...if...\" She squealed and her knees buckled. \"O-oh that feels even better than Faye~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's always the quiet ones,\" Ms. Apple sighed, grunting with another contraction. By this point, medics were starting to hurry in and help pregnant women out of the sports bar and into vans and ambulances to take to the hospital. Some of the response plans left in place by the CDC and PEAR seemed to still be in effect. \"Just...just do something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess we're up,\" Jack said, turning to Jessica. He pulled out the other two coins, both burning in his palm. \"Let's collect our prize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and Jessica made it onto the front stage, where Sandwich and Oven were looking around frantically. \"See Lisa yet?\" The biggest belly in the crowd bobbed past them as some medics tried to get Natalie to sit still in a wheelchair while she reached out to Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I didn't trust you!\" Natalie yelled as she clutched her stomach. \"I'm so excited and scared to have these babies with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too, me too!\" Lisa cried back, struggling to walk as two men held her arms and helped to support her. \"Hey, watch it!\" she shouted at one of them when she felt him getting a little too close to her chest. \"I don't turn into public property just because I'm in labor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" Jessica said, patting Oven on the back. \"Where's my prize?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're worried about that <b>now</b>?\" Oven said, gesturing at the lovely chaos in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just need it, okay?\" Jack said. \"Where's that rare coin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, jesus,\" Sandwich said, tossing the coin to them. Jack and Jessica screamed and Jack hurried to catch it before it technically flipped. A laboring woman cried out in shock as her tightening belly got a whole lot tighter and pushed away her helpful husband so he didn't quite make it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, now what?\" Jessica said as Jack hopped off-stage and placed the three coins together. Once joined, Jack felt a shiver run through him and he went weak, stumbling a bit so Jessica caught him for support. \"Jack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack!\" Faye called, staggering from back stage to see him. The angry, lusty woman Jack had sparred with for the past few days was gone and the loving, scared face of a desperate mom-to-be looked back at him. \"Please, don't take my babies away. I know I've been bad to you lately but...I want to be a mom so bad. I see how Amanda and your father raised you and I want that too. Even with Steve and his affair, I want-\" She grunted and bent over, one hand going between her legs. \"They're so close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get you somewhere more comfortable, ma'am,\" a medic said as she took Faye and walked her out of the sports bar. Faye was moaning loudly, a soft laugh coming out of her mouth as she felt her children make their way through her birth canal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to check on your mom?\" Jessica asked. \"She's got to be as far along as any of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time,\" Jack gulped, looking down at the coins. The air around the seemed to be bending as he focused his attention. \"What do I do...what do I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can put your hands up, for starters,\" a growling voice said. Jack turned and instinctively raised both arms. A very large, very naked Nicole Zavaleta had a pistol pointed at his head, her face doused in sweat. Just like the coin's revenge made her pregnancy as uncomfortable as possible, so was her labor. \"Now back away from the coins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're...enormous,\" Jessica gasped, eyeing Zavaleta's octuplet belly. It looked like a balloon, so ready to pop at any moment. Her pale skin was so tight, Jessica could even make out the silhouettes of her eight fetuses, all throwing tantrums as they lowered into position. There was a steady stream of amniotic fluid coming from between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who exactly are you?\" Jack said, stuck between his fear of her gun and his admiration of her extremely pregnant body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone who's had her eye on you for quite some time now,\" Zavaleta said through gritted teeth. \"Now give the coins or-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...that's a head,\" Jessica said, one hand over her mouth. Zavaleta's enormous belly and tree-trunk thighs made it hard to get a good look at her birth canal but Jessica had positioned herself to see all the action. She had long fantasized about pregnancy and motherhood but actually seeing a woman crowing in person was a bit of a shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mix of pain and maternal emotion overtook Zavaleta and she lowered her gun and reached one hand down to her lap. \"My baby! My first baby! It's...it's happening!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was frozen, watching this whale of a pregnant woman literally giving birth in front of him while the coins he'd been after for the past days sat right in front of him. But hearing Zavaleta talk about motherhood snapped him back to the reason he was here in the first place. He turned his attention to the coins and thought about the last nine days. How <u>he</u> was the one who set all of this into motion. How <u>he</u> was the master of the city's pregnancies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Taken your rightful place, eh?</span> that familiar, sick voice said in his head. Time felt as though it slowed down around Jack as he brought his hands closer to the coins, feeling its energy prick at his skin. <span class=\"clred\">Well, you run the show now. You can have whatever you want.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack prepared to tell the coin to undo things but a fold developed in his mind. \"Any...thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice laughed gently. <span class=\"clred\">Yes, I can help you do so many things with pregnant women. Make them all fall in love with you. Make any woman pregnant. Make them as big as you want. All up to you.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack trembled, imagining that fantasy life and feeling his erection grow. \"Or I could just destroy you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">You could but how do you know that wouldn't just create its own chaos?</span> the coin replied. <span class=\"clred\">A lot of decisions here, chosen one. You carry a heavier burden than your girlfriend there.</span> Jack looked over his shoulder at Jessica, her hands patting her belly as she stood radiant in her bikini. <span class=\"clred\">You could make any woman in the world lust after you the way she does. You can be the true master of pregnancy.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel his mind being filled with images. All different scenarios ran through. He was lying in a mountain of bellies in one. He was helping Jessica take care of their children in a nice home in another. He could see Faye and his mother screaming in the hospital together in another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Better make a choice!</span> the coin's voice cackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack shut his eyes. \"I want...\"</span></div></div>",

The wave of pregnancies in town certainly made his life a lot more exciting and there were women like Faye who were ecstatic about having a baby on the way. But at the same time, he'd seen all the people it was hurting. He thought about Jessica and their relationship. Her growing a belly made things more interesting but he didn't need to the coin to date her. They were already together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't want the coin to hurt anyone ever again.

It's really gone!\" She lept into Jack's arms, hugging him tightly and kissing him. \"You did it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did more than me. You won the whole contest,\" Jack smiled, reaching his hands down her bare back. He could feel her breasts against his chest, still as big as they were a moment ago. Some things didn't change. \"So...maybe I should have consulted you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\" Jessica asked as they broke the hug, looking at him with some confusion. Her hand was still on her waist, stroking her empty belly out of habit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a few choices about what to do and...I chose to undo all the pregnancies,\" Jack said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's good,\" Jessica said, putting her hands on her hips. \"Did you think I'd miss being a young mother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means the coin got away,\" Jack said sadly. \"I just passed the problem on to the next person. I was...selfish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica studied him for a moment before wrapping in a lighter, warmer hug. \"Hey, you cared about your friends and family. Nothing wrong with that. And we managed to overcome the coin so I'm sure the next person will too.\" She kissed him on the forehead. \"And you know...if we wanted me to be pregnant again...there <i>are</i> ways to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" Jack chuckled, leaning in to kiss Jessica before seeing Zavaleta over her shoulder. \"Wait...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enormous, naked super soldiers was still squatting with a belly the size of a cluster bomb. Through grit teeth, she was grunting and clenching all of her muscles, sweat dripping off of her pale skin like a monsoon. Against her chest, she held one newly-born infant, its umbilical cord still attached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here...come...number...two!\" Zavaleta shouted in a mighty boom, catching the head of a second baby as it pushed out of her birth canal. \"Ah, moje die\u0165a! Ahoj!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you only cancel my pregnancy?\" Jessica said in a panicked voice, turning to Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! I said everyone since I got the coin!\" he said quickly. \"Unless...oh no. Ms. Smart and Ms. Apple said we had until we gave birth. The coin didn't undo when people gave birth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if anyone actually delivered a baby before you did your thing...\" Jessica said, nibbling nervously on her fingertips. \"We...we better go to the hospital!\" Both ran out of the sports bar, leaving the coin alone on the stage as it vanished into the shadows, searching for its next home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roads were a mess with ambulances and taxi cabs. Some people got out of taxis, looking down at their flat stomachs with surprise while Jack and Jessica could hear screams of women, men, and babies coming from the backs of some others. Jessica spotted a recently vacated taxi and got in the back seat while it waited in traffic. \"Mind if we take this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you pay your fare,\" the driver shrugged, looking at Jessica in the rear view mirror. \"You're not pregnant so I don't know what your rush is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack climbed into the seat next to Jessica. \"City hospital, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy enough. That's where I was going anyway,\" the driver said. \"But it'll take a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, looks that way,\" Jack sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jack and Jessica made it to the hospital, it was chaos. Nurses were trying to help patients navigate the floor and people were asking why their bellies had gone away or, more often, why theirs hadn't gone away. Jack snuck past the distracted security to get right into the thick of the maternity ward for the men and women still delivering their babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe poked his head into a few rooms to try and find someone he knew when someone called his name. \"Jack! Jack!\" Behind a curtain, Faye was gripping onto the side of her bed for dear life, covered in sweat, with a big smile on her face. \"Jack, look at them! They're my babies!\" Two nurses held two wet infants, swaddled in blankets. \"I did it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...sure did,\" Jack said, eyes bugging out a bit when he saw the head coming out from between her wide-spread legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa,\" Jessica said, a little stunned. \"I saw a lot of videos to prepare but up close...whoa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry for everything I did! I was just scared about my family!\" Faye shouted again before doubling forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Mrs. Jones, you'll need to focus and push,\" a nurse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faye, did you see my mom when you left?\" Jack called out as another nurse tried to get him to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NNNNEXT ROOM!\" Faye screamed as she started pushing out her third quadruplet. Jack took her advice and darted into the next curtained area. Sure enough, Amanda was lying in bed, her gigantic belly still towering above her. Jack Sr. was by her side, holding onto her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom,\" Jack said, a little surprised to see her like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Jack,\" Amanda said weakly, giving him a faint smile. \"Good...you're here. And Jessica's here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hi Mrs. Dale,\" Jessica said, walking over to her side with Jack. \"You're doing...good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda laughed and looked at her bare belly. \"Well, when you get to be my age, child birth is a little trickier. Especially with four of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack gulped nervously, trying to figure out why she was still pregnant if she hadn't delivered yet. Then he remembered: he didn't flip the coin on her. She did it herself at the flea market before he found the coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops,\" he said to himself as the nurse knelt down by her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Mrs. Dale, you're fully dilated. I'm going to need a really big push.\" Amanda grabbed his husband and son's hands and let out a big sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here they come,\" she murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One month later, health officials are still unsure of what to make of the so-called 'pregnancy disease.' For some, it came and went, and for others, it has been a happy surprise. But life has largely gone back to normal as residents settle in to their new lives of motherhood and fatherhood. Filling in for Mia Vasquez on her maternity leave, I'm Brooke Roberts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack turned off the TV and looked at Jessica, laying in his arms. \"Guess they're still going with calling it a disease.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think they would have been able to understand the truth,\" Jessica sighed, cuddling up against Jack. \"I miss Mia's reporting. She was good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I miss hearing Lisa on the radio but they'll both be back after they adjust to having triplets,\" Jack said. \"Not everyone can be like Faye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, Faye burst into the Dale's house, pushing two strollers with four babies total inside. \"Hel~lo everyone! Hel~lo Jack! Hel~lo Jessica!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Faye,\" they both said in unison, looking up from the couch. Faye was glowing even more than when she was pregnant, clearly ecstatic to be a mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn walked Amanda and Jack Sr., each holding two babies. \"Hi Faye. I'm sorry, I'm running a little slow. I'm not used to changing a diaper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or four,\" Jack Sr. added as they put Jack's siblings into strollers. \"But a walk will be good. Is Chuck coming today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we've been going to...marriage councilling and things have been going well. He likes being a father,\" she said with a little smile. \"He'll probably ask you a lot of questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can ask away. With four, I have a lot of questions too,\" Jack Sr. said with a laugh as they left the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce alone, Jack and Jessica turned to one another. \"How long do you think we have?\" Jessica asked him, looking up toward Jack's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, we have Mariah's girlfriend's thing in a few hours, don't we? We should probably get ready for that,\" Jack sighed, stretching out. \"I don't know how Mariah would have handled being a mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least this soon. Same for your boss, April or whatever,\" Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amber,\" Jack said, correcting her. \"I dunno, Tara at my mom's office seemed pretty scared but she seems to be good at taking care of triplets. And my mom's boss enjoys being a new dad though...I'm still not sure how he gave birth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some mysteries we'll never answer, like what happened to the coin,\" Jessica said, stroking Jack's arm. \"Are Ms. Smart and Ms. Apple already out looking for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they're waiting in town for a bit until Ms. Apple gets a handle on her new babies,\" Jack said. \"I wonder if we'll ever learn their names?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica laughed and looked down at her flat belly. \"It was kinda fun, wasn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes,\" Jack smiled, leaning over to kiss Jessica. \"But I'd rather us become parents on our own schedule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh. Then I've got bad news,\" Jessica said, reaching over and shoving a large pillow up her shirt and cradling it like a belly. \"It came back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack shuddered and grinned nervously. \"O-oh...what should we do about that? Let's get you upstairs to rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said we didn't have time,\" Jessica purred, stroking her fake belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I changed my mind...but let's decide,\" Jack said, reaching into his pocket and pulling out a quarter. \"Heads we wait, tails we go upstairs. Flip a coin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">The End</font></div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Uh... Nothing.\" Replied, struggling to recover. \"Just a little nervous is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't be\" Jessica said as she cracked a smile. \" it's just to friends who haven't seen each other in awhile catching up and having fun. Nothing to be worried about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's a relief.\" Jack said, nervously laughing. \"She thought I was worried about our not date. \" he thought, grabbing a drink of water that he usually kept in his car. \"Well, I am nervous about that. But I am more worried about this coin, Jessica could wind up like Tara if my theory is correct. No, your being crazy, if it didn't affect her first time, she must be fine, everything is fine.\" Jack said, desperately trying to dispel his own fears and calm himself down. And he was starting to relax to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until Jessica leaned over and whispered in his ear in a voice so sultry and carnal that even a priest would fill with lust and desire. \"But let's see where the night takes us, big boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat drink that Jack took never made it down his throat. Instead, it wound up being choked on by Jack. He almost swerved into traffic, he was so shocked. He didn't see that one coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica, for her part, burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter. \"Oh my god that was priceless!\" She said, wiping tears from her eyes. \"You should have seen your face! I can't believe you fell for that! I mean, come on! Big Boy? Who says Big Boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to see you find my confusion so amusing.\" Jack said.<br>\r\n\"I do. I really do!\" Jessica said, still giggling.<br>\r\n\"Well when you are done laughing at your ride home, we are here.\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nice place. Family owned for at least fifty years, it was one of the big staples of Jack's hometown. He and Jessica spent many hours in this place, and he figured bringing her back would be a good start to there not date. It was also near many of the social activities of the town as well, one of which being the laser tag Jessica so desperately wanted. Yes, it really was a nice place, a shame jack wouldn't get to enjoy it that evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jessica saw their destination, she gasped. \"Awwwww! I can't believe this place is still open! I can't believe you took me here! You can certainly pick the right spots can't you?\" She said, giving jack a big hug, causing him to blush and his blood to rush to a place it probably shouldn't go for someone on a not date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an awkward moment of staring, until Jessica said \"well? Aren't you gonna open the door for me?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh right! Sorry!\" Jack said. And fumbled his way out of the car to open her door for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Jack was never the most sure footed person around. Heck, he wasn't even the most unsure footed person around! And it only got worse for him when he was nervous. And he had never been more nervous than on that not date. So it was no surprise that when he was scrambling to the other side of the car, he tripped  and stumbled to the ground quite unceremoniously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis brought forth another burst of laughter from Jessica. \"Good job, \"Big Boy\"!\" She said. \"I think I will let myself out, that way you don't hurt yourself even more.\"<br>\r\nOh don't worry, I'm just lay here for awhile.\" Jack said, mostly to wait for his bright red face to cool down. If only he had gotten up faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey look, there's a free coin on the ground!\" Jessica said.<br>\r\n\"That's great! I guess its yours for now then!\" Jack said, the embarrassment of his past blunders and the nervousness of being on this not date clouding his mind on the importance of that statement until it was far too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I wonder if I can still do that coin trick my uncle taught me.\" Jessica wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's uncle had taught her many things, many of which weren't exactly good things. Her uncle was a convicted con man. When she was little, her uncle would always dazzle her with stories of thrilling heists and big scores. None of it was true, but Jessica didn't need to know that.<br>\r\nHer uncle also taught her many cons and tricks to swindle people of their money.<br>\r\nJessica couldn't remember half the things her uncle taught her. And the half she did know, she wasn't skilled enough to perform. Not that she'd want to anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the one thing that always stuck in her mind, the one trick she could perform, was a trick that would always help her be the winner in a decision. That trick was how to rig a coin flip to land on whatever side she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see if still got it.\" Jessica said as she turned to the window of the car door to see herself, wanting to see her own skill with her own eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Jack realized the importance of that earlier statement. His eyes shot open and his hand flashed to his pocket. The coin was gone.<br>\r\nJack bolted upright and stared at Jessica as it all unfolded before his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flick of her thumb, Jessica launched the coin into the nighttime sky. Jack lost count of how many times it revolved in the air, but he knew it was at least double digits. The coin came down to land on Jessica's thumb, and he caught a glimpse of what he thought was heads, before Jessica shot the coin up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect was instantaneous. The roundness that Jack noticed about her earlier  definitely grew more pronounced. Her belly soon swelling outwards at an incredible pace. The red shirt that covered her torso slowly lost ground to the new front that was the growing orb of flesh.<br>\r\nAnd her stomach wasn't the only thing growing. Jack could see her breasts slowly increasing in size as well, filling with milk for her unborn child. Jack could almost see the months of pregnancy go by as her womb filled with new life. Seven months, eight months, nine months, she looked to be full term and yet continuing to expand. By the time the growth stopped, Jessica looked vastly overdue. And then the coin landed on heads yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis happened several more times. Jessica would flip the coin high into the air, it would always land on heads, and she would continue her unchecked growth as more children filled her womb. Jack was frozen on the spot, the shock of what was happening keeping him firmly rooted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Jessica, her stomach continued to expand without hindrance. The red shirt that once covered her entire top half had lost so much ground in the war against the encroaching womb, that it was now nothing more than a glorified bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of bras, Jack could hear the snap of her bra as her breasts ballooned well beyond the C cups they were designed for. Now they were easily E cups, and still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the seventh time the coin landed on heads, Jessica grabbed the coin and smiled to herself in the car window. \"I still got it. \" she said, and winked to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was stunned beyond words. Jessica was absolutely huge!  The red shirt now just barely covered enough of her G cup breasts so as not to be inappropriate, but Jack could clearly see her nipples poking and rubbing against the fabric of the only thing keeping her from being publicly indecent. Her jeans (thankfully not the skinny ones, she had wrestled with earlier today) were fully unzipped and being unzipped by her new gravid belly, again just barely scraping by on decency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was her belly, it was MASSIVE! Jack had never seen a belly so big. And yet, not a stretch mark could be seen anywhere. Her belly stretched three feet out from her easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to go in and get on with the celebration?\" Jessica asked, rubbing her new super belly.<br>\r\n\"Celebration?\" Jack inquired, not all there yet.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my one year celebration. Most women pregnant with seven children barely make it past twenty weeks, but here I am! On pregnancy week 52! I can still see the doctor's face every time would come in. But he says there are no complications, amazingly, and that the walking and exercise might start up my <br>\r\nLabor, but I highly doubt it. If they'be stayed in this long, I don't think they will come out anytime soon.\" Jessica explained. \"Did you really zone out that much? Never mind, let's just get in there soon, I wanna get as much food as I can, I'm eating for eight you know.\" And with that, Jessica started making a slow waddle towards the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack just stood there, wondering what the hell just happened. <span class=\"clred\">\"You gave her permission, so she can change while you remember.\"</span> the alien voice said inside Jack's mind. He fished in his pocket to find the coin had magically returned to his pocket. He then remembered what he said to Jessica when she found the coin,\"That's great! I guess its yours for now then!\" Jack surmised that the coin must have taken that as permission for her to use the coin while he would still remember her as she was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was at a loss for words, the only thing that came to mind at first was \"so are we still going to laser tag\"<br>\r\nJessica looked back and laughed. \" do you honestly think they would let me in there like this?\" She pointed to her belly. \"They probably don't even have a vest big enough for me. We never discussed laser tag for the celebration, only dinner and a long walk in the park to help start labor, even though it won't work.\" She said. \"Why would you suggest something crazy like laser tag? Doesn't matter let's go \"Big Boy\" I have to feed eight stomachs!\" She said as turned back to her slow waddle, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack now found the perfect words to describe the situation \"WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED!?!?\" He screamed to the heavens.</span></div></div>",

When the waiter saw Jess coming he couldn't believe the size the woman was. \"Good evening\" he said to the two, \" come right this way\" the waiter took the two over to a booth, with Jess's new size, she couldn't sit down on a chair. As they sat down Jack couldn't help but look at Jess's breasts, they were soo huge now and with a shirt now so small and straining you could see her nipples, he was starting to get a little excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we order?\" He said clearing his throat.<br>\r\n\"Sure, but I'm warning you, we will need a bigger table!\" She said laughing. Jack waved of the waiter and he came over, Jack ordered something simple, but when Jess started her order, she didnt stop. By the end of it, the waiter had to go over two pages long. \" I think we need something to wash all that down\" Jess said. \"Might I suggest a hose?\" Said the waiter jokingly. \" how about 2 jugs of water?\" Jess said rubbing her gravid belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food came, and went, by the end of it Jack was completely amazed, she had gone through 5 dinners and 3 desserts! She sat there exhausted, her belly was pushing against the table with all the new food she had eaten. Jack reggrettably paid for all of it. The bill was past  $200 for just Jess allone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey left the restaurant and drove to the park just a few blocks away, Jack got out and helped Jess out of the car when he heard the ring call him, <span class=\"cmaroon\">flip me jack!</span> it said, \"seriously? He said she's huge already!\" Thank you Jack, she said giving him a kiss on the cheek. As she waddled down the path Jack couldn't help but look at Jess's enlarged behind. It swayed with every step, Jacks arousal increased. \"What are you doing behind there?\" Said Jess \" are you checking me out?\" <br>\r\n\" um no\", Jack said  trying to hide his erection. They continued walking through the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I'm so lucky to have a friend like you\" Jess said looking up to Jack, \" if there could be anything I could do to make it up for everything\"<br>\r\n\" there is something\" jack said turning to her, he looked into her eyes as she looked into his, they kissed, long, passionately kissed. It wasn't until Jess realised Jacks member pressing up against her belly that they stopped. <span class=\"cmaroon\">flip me jack</span> said the coin again, \"look not right now\" jack thought to the coin,  \"I wish she would always be this pregnant\"<br>\r\n\" I see you are a little excited to be kissing me, big boy, want to continue this someplace private?\" Jess seductively said to him<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">I can arrange that, flip me! heads she stays like this forever, tails, she goes into labor </span><br>\r\n\" I would love to, just let me see if I can do that trick you did earlier tonight.\" Jack said happily looking into her eyes. Jack took a step back and flipped the coin. It flew into the sky then plummeted onto his hand, he looked down to see.</span></div></div>",

This caught their attention because they were completely spaced out for a minute there. Jack realized that he still had his hands on her belly and quickly pulled them off and tucked them in his pockets and went to the other side of the store acting like he was doing work. April, who for the first time since Jack's worked there, blushed a little and made herself look presentable and asked, \"Is there anything I can help you with sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering if you could get me an IPod charger? My grandson is visiting me tomorrow and I heard he forgot a charger for his IPod so I thought I would get one,\" he said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes of course. Jack, could you get him one? April asked with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah,\" Jack said still a little flustered at what happened a couple of minutes ago. He got the charger and brought to the counter and rang it up. The old man took it, thanked them, and headed out of the door. As he was just about to leave, he turned and said, \"You lovebirds have a great one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, we're not lovebirds,\" they both said at the same time. Jack got red, of course, but April for the second time also got red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and I'm a young man!\" the old man said shaking his head and laughing as he walked out the door. Jack and April looked at each other. April was the first to leave as she headed to the back and Jack just remained at the counter and thought about what the old man said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack? Could you come in the back please?\" He heard April from the break room. He went into the back and found her sitting at the table. Her hands rested on her bump. Jack was staring at the bump a lot longer than what he would have liked. He shook his head and asked, \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you get that off the top shelf?\" She asked pointing to a book. Jack got the book, but as he was reaching, he thought he heard, \"Mmhmm\" form April. He gave her the book. \"Thanks,\" she said as she was getting up. She headed out of the break room when she dropped a pen. \"Oops,\" she said and bent down to get it. It was a bit difficult but Jack saw her wonderful shaped rear. As she got up, she turned back to Jack, closed the door and gave him a sexy look. They walked towards each other, when April asked, \"Do you wanna do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The previous night - Jack had laid the groundwork for the next day. He called back to work and said he was taking tomorrow off. Now he woke up around 10 o'clock the next morning. He went for his cell phone and called Jess. They set up to meet around 1 o'clock in the afternoon, have some lunch and then go see a movie. Jack was looking forward to this. He immediately went to the shower. Afterward, he got dressed and went down for a light breakfast. On his way to the kitchen, he noticed that his mom was having coffee with Faye. He had a bagel as he listened to them talking - Faye mostly talked about her cravings. He didn't think a woman COULD eat as much as Faye wanted to. Regardless, he left the house around noon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe met with Jess at the rendezvous point. The two of them made their way to a restaurant. Jess placed quite a large order of several platters and appetizers. Jack was amazed at her appetite. All he ordered was a burger. When the meals arrived, Jess dug in and she didn't stop. Perhaps it was possible for a girl to eat that much. Was he supposed to pay for all of that? He asked her what brought this on. She told him that ever since yesterday, she just had these strange cravings. She saw most of her desires on the menu and couldn't resist helping herself. Jack was grateful that he had uninhibited access to his father's credit-line. But he knew he also had to leave a generous tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey soon went to the movies. They both shared a large soda. The movie was enjoyable, but Jack noticed that Jess started to look a little nauseous. He leaned over to ask her if she was alright, when suddenly she vomited all over his shirt! She was so shocked and embarrassed that she ran out of the theater. Jack was taken aback by the incident as well. It made him a bit sick, but he was also a bit concerned. He immediately took after her. He managed to see her disappear into the Ladies Room nearby. He followed her inside and heard her retching into a stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess - are you alright in there?\" he asked. He was answered by more retching, but soon the sound was joined with sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack...I'm so sorry,\" she said between sobs. \"I didn't mean to...it was an accident. I'm sorry for ruining your shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack gave a light smile. \"It's alright Jess. I'm not mad. I'm just hoping that you're okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the stall door opened. Jess stood there, dabbing the tears away from her face. She finally smiled back at him. \"I-I guess I ate too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps,\" Jack said, raising an eyebrow. She looked down at the disgusting stain on his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get you cleaned up,\" she said. The two of them moved over to the sink where they got Jack's shirt as clean as they could. Soon after, they left the theater. It was already late at night when Jack drove Jess back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack,\" she started to say. \"I bet you're probably thinking that this was a pretty lousy day. But I just wanted you to know that I had a really good time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" he asked in return. \"Well, that's good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah - and I'd really like to do it again sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...well...I don't see why not,\" he said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent - I'll talk to you later then. Good night,\" she said climbing out of his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait Jess!\" he called to her. \"I...just want to know one thing. Was this a Date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back at him blankly for a few minutes before smiling. \"Good question...I think we should probably figure that out.\" She suddenly winked at him before closing the door and proceeded to her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's eyes were wide and his face was red. He leaned back in his car and took a deep breath. \"That...was a Date. A pretty bad date, but still - she's into me.\"</span></div></div>",

He took off his dirty shirt like his life depended on it. He immediately took another shower. As soon as he was done, he threw his shirt into the laundry. He got himself dry and dressed...It was still early in the night, so he decided to go out and get a quick dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever...before he left the room, a strange force drove him to look toward his desk. He saw the coin there. What the flack was up with that coin? Whenever he tried to put it out of his head, it was like the coin itself kept bringing him back to it. He'd been hearing voices as if something was in his head, talking to him. The coin was weird. It was not like it scared him, he almost liked the feeling of carrying it around. But it was strange. So of course, he quickly picked it up and slid it into his pocket. He soon left the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided that he wanted some really good fried chicken. So he decided to go to Pop'eye's. It was pretty busy, but he didn't want to go anywhere else. So he stood patiently in line, until he was second to the register. However, right as he was about to place his order, someone pushed in front of him with a very impolite, \"EXCUSE ME!\" It was a woman, dressed like a complete whore. She then began to bend the ear of the cashier about how long she's been waiting in line. Jack needlessly was put off by this. He thought about giving this woman a piece of his mind, but he thought better of it. Needless to say, the Broad got her meal first - after complaining about having to wait too long for them to cook it. Jack had the satisfying belief that the cooks promptly spit in her order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack got his meal patiently like everyone. He just hoped that the cooks weren't pissed off at everyone after that incident. He took his meal and got a seat by the window. But as much as he tried to enjoy his meal peacefully, he couldn't help but be distracted by the same whore that cut in line. When she wasn't bitching about something with her other two girlfriends, she made sounds akin to a garbage disposal while eating her chicken. She was absolutely disgusting with how she ate as well as how she acted. Jack always thought better of himself for his ability to keep his temper, but he was just so put-off by how she'd cut in front of him and everyone else in line. He was half-tempted to going to let her have it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis old philosophy dictated there was one way to handle this. And he reached into his pocket for the coin. His judgement halted his movement. If he did go over there, then who knows what could happen? She and her friends could flip out on him. But still, he couldn't get over how much she angered him. He wanted to get back at her so badly. As he contemplated, he rubbed his thumb over the coin. He continued to fiddle with the coin, rubbing his thumb in a circular formation over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me, NOW!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about rubbing the coin five times, he decided. Heads - he'd go over there and tell her to shut her trap. Tails - he'd just let it go. He positioned it and flipped the coin. It spun into the air a total of five times before coming back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Don't. Look. Away.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe barely noticed the voice's orders. He never took his eyes off that horrible woman until the coin landed in his hand. He turned his palm down on his other wrist before looking to what it was...Tails.<br>\r\nHe sighed - partially relieved that he wouldn't do anything. The Broad probably would've kicked him hard in the balls if he had said anything. So he went back to his chicken strips and fries. The Coin's Decision was Final.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly - the restaurant was disturbed by a horrendous scream; a shriek of absolute terror. A table was suddenly flipped over. That caused Jack and everyone to look toward the source of the scream. Jack's jaw-dropped. It was the woman who'd cut in front of him. A huge, bulging stomach jutted out from her trashy tank-top. Somehow - her stomach just imploded, instantly. She looked like she was five-months pregnant! She was screaming and freaking out. Clearly whatever this was, wasn't supposed to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack suddenly looked down at the coin. What WAS up with this coin? Ever since he'd got it, he'd been hearing voices every time he'd flipped it. But...no way, it couldn't be. He didn't believe in the occult or supernatural. This coin couldn't have caused it. He flipped it while looking at other people and they didn't just...implode with a baby in them! But then he thought about it - the one example he'd remembered was Faye. He flipped it when he looked at her...and the next day, she was pregnant. Extraordinary coincidence. But it took her a day - she didn't just balloon. But then Jack thought. He rubbed the rim of the coin a total of five times. She looked five months pregnant...Maybe that was how it worked. The coin would drop you into a month of pregnancy based on how many times your fingers circle the rim.<br>\r\nBut all of this sounded insane. He looked down at the coin thinking all of this was a crazy dream. There was only one way to prove that this was real...he had to test it, and see if the same effect happened again.</span></div></div>",

There was little doubt in his mind that all this pregnancy based wierdness started right after he bought the thing at that store, it couldn't have been a coincidence but at the same time it seemed impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what exactly are you?\" He asked, he had also done some searches on the internet but there was nothing really prelevant, well except for stumbling on a website that had a bunch of fictional stories about guys getting pregnant, but that was hardly helpful. Jack then picked the coin up and felt it in his hand, it weighed about as much as an old eisenhower silver dollar, and despite sitting on his bedside table all night then on his desk for about an hour now it was surprisingly warm, like it had been in his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'flip me' the voice came back as it always seemed to whenever it was on his person, the voice stopped when it was on his table but in the back of his head there was this strange tingle that almost made him want to pick the thing up, while the voice was creepy having the coin in his hand seemed to have sort of a calming effect on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'flip me' he looked down on it then at the full length mirror on the back of his bedroom door, and odd thought crossed his mind. Would the coin work on men, there was a picture of a pregnant guy on both sides but it wasn't like guys had all the \"equipment\" to carry a baby or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wierd stuff seemed to happen to who ever he was looking at when he flipped the thing, so the question is what now?</span></div></div>",

She just recently celebrated her 55th Birthday alone and childless, after her twenty year marriage to her ex-husband Thomas recently imploded after discovering he was having an affair with a woman literally half his age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blamed herself, deep  down, because Thomas always wanted children, a lot of children, and getting pregnant and raising ungrateful little brats was something that she never, ever, wanted to do. She hated children, always had in fact, probably due to the fact that she spent the last 30 years teaching, and was exposed on a daily basis on the worst children had to offer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, maybe she could have had at least one child, maybe that would have made Thomas happy. And maybe it wouldn't have left her \"golden years\" so damn lonely. She came home to an empty house, filled with bad memories, and did nothing. Watched TV, read books, worked on her garden, with only her empty sighs breaking the silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's too late for any of that now</i> She thought to herself, as she continued to peruse the tables, blushing aside a slowly greying strand of her platinum blonde hair aside. <i>Too old</i> she thought. And she was beginning to feel it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe woke up with crow's feet under her eyes, more and more of her once gorgeous  long platinum blonde turning grey, her joints beginning to ache, and her once tight figure beginning to sag, especially her upper regions. <i>Old Maid Samantha</i> she thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer best friend, Nina Weeks, and her husband Chris, had insisted that she join them to this big Flea Market that was in town for the weekend only, hoping to get her out of her lonely cold house, and hopefully meet someone nice. She didn't share their optimism, but she thought it would be nice to get out, even if it was just with friends. She chose her nicest blue sundress she had, and put on a little makeup, and joined her friends for this \"hot day on the town\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer best friend Nina, could not have been more different from her. While Samantha's marriage floundered over a lack of children, Nina and Chris's thrived with an overabundance of children. Four precisely,all boys, the youngest,  just heading off to college   <br>\r\na few weeks ago, leaving Nina and Chris alone in their big house for the first time in their lives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They're lonely</i> Samantha thought. <i>That's the reason they wanted me to come along. They don't want to be alone with each other, afraid to find out if the only reason their marriage worked was because they always had children to think of</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Still, it must have been nice</i> Samantha thought, her mind racing back to her own shattered marriage and loneliness . <br>\r\nAfter a few more moments of walking around, a bright silver gleam caught her attention on a table next to her; a coin, approximately the size of a quarter sitting on the table. Full of scratches, the strange coin appears to have the image of a pregnant woman, and a...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Strange, the male figure on this coin looks pregnant like the woman. I wonder if this some type of old ceremonial coin?</i> she thought to herself, looking at the coin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat appears to be a pregnant man and a pregnant woman are on the head of the coin, a happy look on their face, while on the tail end of the coin, are the same pregnant man and pregnant woman, a look of panic and fear on their face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, my dear lady. You like the coin?\" a voice asks her. Samantha's attention is taken off the coin, to a twenty-something year old man, dressed all in black, wearing way too much makeup and mascara, with several piercings on his face. \"At Lavern's Lair Of The Occult, any item you purchase could have powers beyond your wildest comprehension! These cursed, haunted, and otherwise supernatural items come from the deepest darkest regions of Earth\" he says, with quite the sales pitch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, this quite the strange coin. Where did you get it?\" Samantha asks, turning her attention away from the goth man and to the coin. <br>\r\nHe looks at the coin for a moment, and then his face goes blank.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Oh that? I got that some fat guy who was desperate to get rid of it or something. Said it brought him nothing but trouble. Judging by his gut, looked like it gave him nothing but pizza.\" Lavern says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i>Buy Me Samantha</i></span> an alien thought raced through her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much?\" Samantha asks without hesitation. <br>\r\n\"Well, how about a dollar? The guy just gave it to me, telling me to get rid of it forever, but what does he know? He just shoved it in my hand, and then waddled back inside when two of his kids started crying from his house\" Lavern says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i>Pay for it</i></span> the alien thought races through her head again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take it!\" she says, taking a dollar from her purse and putting it on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks lady. You've been my first customer all day. I was hoping that all this fake mystical crap I got off weirdoes from craigslist would have been more profitable. Oh well\" Lavern says, putting the dollar in his money box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha didn't hear him thought, she was walking in a daze, staring at the coin, running her fingers along it's surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samantha! Over here!\" She's brought back to reality, by her friend Nina, who approaches her. Nearly Samantha's age, she's dressed in jeans and a t-shirt, with the words \"World's Greatest Mom\" written on it. Her once dirty blonde hair is slowly greying just like Samantha's, but Nina could still pass for mid 40's if she really tried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer husband on the other hand, was skinny as a rail, with a short haircut, and wear khaki's and a button up shirt. Slightly younger than Nina, he looked like a stereotypical father you would see on a sitcom, right down to the mustache. Both of them worked together in the same office, where Chris did IT work, and Nina did sales. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you find anything? Some clothes? An antique? A man?\" Nina says slyly. <br>\r\n\"Oh honey, leave her alone\" Chris says, playfully nudging his wife. <br>\r\n\"I found this strange coin\" Samantha says showing it to Nina and Chris. <br>\r\n\"Weird art on it\" Nina says.<br>\r\n\"It's probably one of a kind. Let me borrow it sometime, I collect coins, I can probably do some research on it for you\" Chris says.<br>\r\n\"Chris\" Nina says, slightly annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I didn't say now. I said later, after she's had it for a while\" Chris says correcting. <br>\r\n\"So do we want to hang around here some more? Or should we head back home?\" Nina asks Samantha. <br>\r\n\"I'm having a great time. I could stay here a little bit longer\" Chris says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha is not hearing any of this though, her attention once again drawn to the strange coin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip Me Samantha. Heads Or Tails.</span> the alien thought races through her head once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even realizing it, she places the coins on her thumb, and gives it a nice strong flick, sending it high into the air, and then catching it in her hand, closing tight around it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Look at someone Samantha. Look.</span> the thought charges through her head with the coin in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does she look at?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the tingling sensation worked up to its peak throughout her body, Samantha doubled over and began to moan softly as she clutched her belly. Looking down, she was shocked to find it was growing at a fast pace right before her very eyes. It grew bigger and bigger as she began to rub her increasingly larger abdomen, which was quickly outgrowing the blue sundress she had put on this morning. Luckily, the dress still managed to cover a lot, though instead of reaching down to her knees like it was originally intended to do, it now only came up to the upper part of her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of her thighs, those had begun to grow a little bit larger, though nowhere near the extent of her belly, which had long since passed the size of a woman at full term with one, and was nearing the size of a woman almost 9 months pregnant with twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her belly's growth neared completion, Samantha was surprised to feel her butt also gain a little bit of heft, but what drew her attention immediately after was the tightness of her bra, and as she looked down she saw that her breasts were also growing considerably. She had always been a modest B-cup herself, but at this point she looked to be pushing out at around a D-cup, and her poor bra was being put under a good bit of strain as it struggled to contain Samantha's larger assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the growth came to a stop, Samantha gave a sigh of relief, but suddenly she froze as she felt something rock her belly a bit, surprised once again, she looked down to find visible bumps pushing through her sundress, and at the sight of it, only one thought went through her mind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...Pregnant?\" She whispered tentatively as she watched the passengers inside her womb kick outwards. Surprisingly, as the question left her lips, the words clicked, as if it was just the right way she wanted to be described. \"I'm pregnant!\" She repeated, but this time it was more of a conformation as she smiled at the notion of her being with child, and the more she told herself that phrase, the more it just felt right to her, as if she couldn't imagine ever not being pregnant. Strangely enough, no one in the market or the stalls had noticed one bit of this, and kept about their business as if nothing was even happening, not that Samantha really cared, as she was taking joy in the children that, to her, had been there since 9 months ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sam!\" A yell broke her out of her happy state of maternal bliss, and she looked up to see it was Nina calling out to her again with a worried look on her face. \"You alright?\" Her friend asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine Nina!\" Samantha called out to her friend, \"just the twins kicking a bit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, it's like they knew you'd be going out today for some fun time huh?\" Nina said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! These little rascals just can't keep still when they know Momma is getting her exercise!\" Samantha said with a chuckle as she give her huge belly a couple of pats, which did little to sooth its active occupant's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when are they due Sammy?\" Nina's husband, Chris asked her, \"I mean, you look about ready to pop any time now!\" He added jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well gee thanks Chris!\" Samantha said as she rolled her eyes at the just, \"the doctors said my due date was in about a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if we're done here, let's get a move on!\" Nina exclaimed, \"I'm starving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak for yourself!\" Samantha laughed while clutching the bottom of her inflated stomach, \"I'm eating for three here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group shared a laugh as they began to head out of the market, thoughts of having a nice lunch (or huge lunch in Samantha's case) fresh in their minds as Nina and Chris walked, while Samantha simply waddled after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a man rushed towards Nina and Chris, obviously in a hurry for something, the couple managed to get out of the way, but Samantha, whose movement and center of gravity was hindered by the twins in her womb, couldn't get out of the way in time. And the man accidentally ended up knocking her to the ground, Samantha landing on her side with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, watch where you're going jerk!\" Nina yelled as the man disappeared into the crowd, while Chris went to help Samantha back up as the two asked if she was ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm good, he just brushed up against my back and knocked me off balance.\" She explained to her friends, who sighed in relief. \"Now we were heading for lunch correct?\" She asked, the hunger in her voice quite obvious. Nina and Chris nodded as they all headed out of the market and finally headed off to lunch. However, during the time when Samantha had been knocked down by the man, she...</span></div></div>",

Count me to hang around. I mean I found this coin, you never know what else I might fi- - - -HMMPH!\" Samantha is interrupted by a sudden, strong desire by her lunch to make a dramatic reappearance. She quickly covers her mouth and takes off running away from her friends, towards the bathrooms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samantha! You gonna be okay?!\" Nina and Chris yell out after their soon-to-be-vomiting friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran. Faster than she ever thought possible, her hand over her mouth, desperatly trying to keep her lunch down. She reached the ladies rest room in record time, probably running into people, and knocking them aside. She bolted through the door, her stomach churning, her mouth full of sick, and knelt before the porcelain god in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHURK! was the only sound she made, as the contents of her stomach emptied into the toilet bowl in front of her. HURK! She seemed to throw up for a seemed like minutes, desperately trying to keep her fading blonde hair from becoming thick with sick. Eventually, her stomach settled, and she stood panting by the toilet, filled with her (former) stomach contents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh\" is all she say, trying to catch her breath, and calm down after her puke-a-thon. She grabbed some toilet paper, and dabbed the corners of her mouth, before tossing it into the bowl and flushing it. She picked herself off the floor, and washed her hands and face, feeling calm and relaxed as the cold water splashed on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What was that?</i> Samantha asked herself, as the sudden wave of nausea seemed to vanish as quickly as it came. <br>\r\nA new feeling came over her: Tiredness. Extreme tiredness. She felt exhausted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I must be getting sick</i> she said, studying her reflection in the mirror. She took a few more moments to collect herself, before leaving the bathroom and rejoining her friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There she is! Samantha! What happened to you!\" Nina asks with worry on her face.<br>\r\n\"I just had to throw up all the sudden. It was weird\" Samantha says, the new feeling of tiredness washing over her.<br>\r\n\"You gonna be okay?\" Chris asks. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm just really tired now. I think I'm coming down with something. I'm going to head home, I'll take to you guys later.\" She says before hugging her friends goodbye, and heading back out to her car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think she'll be fine?\" Nina asks. <br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, she can take care of herself\" Chris says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha's drive back was nothing if not uneventful. No more bouts of strange sudden nausea, just an overwhelming desire to sleep. Eventually she pulled into the driveway of her two story house, with a large front-and-back yard, in a nice quiet little neighborhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe often wondered why she didn't sell the house. It was a house for people with children, in a neighborhood for people with children, not a house for a single childless divorcee. Getting out of her car, and into her house, she didn't even make it to her bedroom, plopping down on the couch, kicking off her shoes, and falling almost instantly asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dreams were troubling. In her dream, she was massive, big as a house, very, very pregnant. She was cooking a large dinner for her other three children sitting at the table, loudly waiting for their dinner, while tormenting each other. \"Mommy, is it dinner time yet! We're hungggrryyy!\" Her oldest daughter whined, banging her silverware up and down on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a moment sweetie! Mommy can only do some much with your little brother or sister inside of her!\" She says, stirring the big pot of pasta with one hand, rubbing her belly with the other. Her middle child, her son, sat at the table banging his utensils against his dishes, making an unholy racket, while her youngest child, her second son, sat the table, completely dirty from head to foot, playing with his army men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still the same age as she always was, but now dealing with three very young children, aged 6 -2 with another one on the way. Her house was a mess, dirty clothes and toys everywhere, dishes stacked up in the sink, the TV blaring some children's cartoon show in the other room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she awoke with a start, alone, back in her house, as it always was. No children screaming for food and banging plates. No dirty clothes and toys strewn about the house. No pregnant belly. Just her, alone, as always. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What a nightmare</i> she thought to herself, her dream reminding her of why she never wanted children. <i>Still</i> she said, placing a hand on her stomach and looking down, a faint smile crossing her face. Suddenly, she shakes her head and is brought back to reality. <i>Come on Sam, snap out it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGROAN! A mighty hunger gurgle comes from her stomach. She was hungry. Very hungry. It felt as if she hadn't eaten for days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess I better get something to eat. Hopefully, I can keep it down this time\" she says aloud to herself. She headed into the kitchen, and opened the fridge. Soy Milk, a few pieces of fruit, a couple of old slices of pizza. <i>I really need to go shopping</i> she thinks to herself, seeing that there is very little to actually eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, as if almost by instinct, she grabs the pizza, and takes a bite out it. <i>Not bad but could use something else</i> she thinks, and begins digging through the cabinets in here kitchen.  She didn't have much, just an half-eaten jar of peanut butter (she hated the stuff) and an unopened jar of pickles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs the peanut butter and the pickles, and begins to apply generous portions of both to her slices of pizza. She grabs the pickle-peanut butter pizza and takes a bite, her mouth filling with a flavor that while many would consider disgusting, she thought was heavenly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Weird, I hate pickles and I HATE peanut butter, but this tastes so good on this pizza</i> she thinks to herself, adding more pickles and peanut butter to her remaining slices of pizza, and heading off into the living room. She plopped down on the couch, and turned on the tv, searching for something to eat while enjoying her bizarre food mixture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNews, movies, gardening shows, none of these interested her right now as she looked for something to watch. Eventually the channel lands on the image of a very pregnant woman, getting her belly casted, her husband by her side. <i>Oh god, another one of these pregnancy shows. Why is this always on every channel?</i> she thinks taking another bite of her pickle-peanut butter pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going to reach for the changer to switch to another channel, but stopped. For whatever reason, she suddenly became engrossed in this tale of this woman's pregnancy. Minutes flew by and the show ended with the woman giving birth, and then another episode of the series came on, following another woman's pregnancy. Samantha continued to eat her pizza, watching the mini-pregnancy show marathon, sharing in the laughs and tears along wit the expectant women in the show. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree hours passed, as the marathon finally ended, Samantha curled up on the couch, tears running down her face, wearing the widest smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was in her happy place, her phone rang, snapping Samantha out of her daze. <br>\r\nShe picked up the phone. <br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Samantha asked, turning off the tv, now that her program was over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was.... </span></div></div>",

What's happening?\" she says in a disinterested tone. \"How's the witch doing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If by witch, you mean my lovely wife Lucy, then she is fine\" Thomas says with a stern voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still cheated on me with her, I think calling her a witch is very nice of me\" Samantha says a smile coming across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't want to have any children Sam, what was I supposed to do? We were\" Thomas is interrupted by Samantha. <br>\r\n\"Look, we've had this conversation a thousand times. What do you want Tom? Why are you calling me?\"<br>\r\n\"I want you to meet me for lunch tomorrow at The Velveteen Grill. Don't worry, I'll pay for everything.\" Thomas says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to what do I owe the pleasure of your company?\" Samantha asks. <br>\r\n\"I want to discuss the house. I know you got it, but I have a great offer in the works for it, and I think it would be benefit both of us to talk about it.\" Thomas says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The house. It's always the bloody house.</i> Samantha thinks to herself, although she couldn't really blame Thomas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no-one else in her life, it was simply just too much house. Half of the rooms were empty or being used as storage; no-one young or old to occupy them. Aside from her bedroom, she spent most of her time downstairs, never bothering to at least set-up an office for her. She did all her work on the couch with her laptop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam, are you still there?\" Thomas asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes Thomas. Okay, I'll meet you for lunch. I'm just coming to listen, as far as I'm concerned this house is mine, and I'll hang onto it until the day you pry the deed from my cold dead hands.\" Samantha says, ferocity coming from behind her words.<br>\r\nThomas sighs on the other end of the line. <br>\r\n\"Look, this is a really good offer. Don't be so quick to say no. Just listen to what I have to say tomorrow. You won't regret it I promise.\" Thomas says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight Thomas. I'll see you tomorrow. Noon.\" She says dryly and then quickly hangs up the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That felt great</i> She thinks to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gets up off the couch, stretching her arms high over her head, cleaning up the crusts of her pickle-peanut butter pizza, and throwing it in the trash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stifles a small yawn, feeling once again, that feeling of extreme tiredness washing over her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>God, why am I so tired? It must be my body fighting off whatever I'm coming down with</i> she rationalizes in her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it was barely 8:30, she saw looking at the clock on the wall. She still had some things she wanted to do around the house.<br>\r\n<i>Maybe I could do some research into that coin I found. I bet it's worth some money</i> she thinks. <br>\r\nFinding a rare coin that was worth thousands, if not hundreds of thousands at a Flea Market would be amazing. She could be like one of those people on the news. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she stifled another yawn, feeling sleep try to wash over her body again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she made up her mind, she would:</span></div></div>",

I'm truly getting old</i> she thinks. <i>Still, early to bed, early to rise, they say</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the walk up the carpeted wooden steps that lead to the second floor of her house. It was up here, were the extra bedroom and bathrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour bedrooms, two-and-half bathrooms to be exact. Thomas bought it years ago when they first got married, hoping to start adding \"occupants\" as quickly as possible. When she dropped the news that she refused to have children, she could see her marriage shatter before her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas stopped being the man she married. He started coming home later and later, went on long \"business trips\", and started spending the nights elsewhere. She tried to make it work, she really did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while she thought about getting pregnant to save her marriage, but she just could't do it. She never wanted kids, and that was something her husband was just going to have to accept. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't of course. He stuck around a few more years, before eventually dropping the divorce papers on her one morning, and then announcing he wants to marry a younger woman he's been seeing on the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love her, she loves me, and we want a family\" he told her that morning. Never mind, that Thomas at this point was old enough to be her father, but if a 50 year old man wanted to chase the skirts of some gold-digging 21 year old, that was not her problem. She's been in this marriage for over twenty years, but if he wanted out, then she would give it to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she cleared those thoughts from her mind as she walked into her bedroom, still the same as the day he left, minus the pictures and personal effects. She changed over into her pajamas, and crawled into bed, falling asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">The Dream</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up Mommy! It's Christmas! It's Christmas!\" She was jostled out of her sound sleep by three little jumping figures on her bed. <br>\r\n\"Come on! Wake up!\" Her six year old daughter, propped open her eye, trying to rouse her sleeping mother. <br>\r\n\"Okay, okay. I'm getting up. Give me a few minutes guys, but don't open anything till I get there!\" She said, her eyes falling upon her three children, her six year old daughter, her four year old son, and his two year old toddler brother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christmas!\" Her four year old son yelled, leaping off the bed, his little brother not far behind, and his older sister still jumping up and down on the bed. <br>\r\n\"Is Jessica awake yet?\" Her six year old daughter said, pulling aside the cover, and placing her ear on her older mother's very pregnant belly.<br>\r\n\"Hello Jessica! Wake up! It's Christmas!\" She said, giving her mother's belly a rub. <br>\r\n\"Now now sweetie. You don't know if it's a little sister. It could be another little brother\" Samantha says. <br>\r\n\"No! It's a little sister! I already have two little brothers and they stink! I asked Santa to make your belly give me a little sister!\" Her daughter said proudly. <br>\r\n\"My, my, aren't we resourceful? Well, go downstairs, and we'll start Christmas.\" Samantha says, shifting up into a sitting postion, her massive life filled orb resting in her lap. <br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Her daughter ran off in a storm of the pitter-patter of little feat. <br>\r\nSamantha laughed, and rubbed her pregnant belly. \"Good morning little one. Merry Christmas!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly lumbered out of bed, and admired herself in the mirror. She was massive, her pregnant belly making the top of her Christmas-themed shirt rest on the very top of her mound. Her breasts where large and firm, tightly hugging the fabric of the shirt, making their every curve that much more pronounced, her nipples visible through the red fabric. The words \"Dear Santa, I think you left me another gift last year\" were written on her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her bright red sweat pants, decorated with little reindeers, hung low under the vast expanse of her gravid form. <br>\r\nHer skin was shinny and covered with stretch marks, although after three kids going on four, that was to be expected. <br>\r\n<i>Merry Christmas to Me</i> she thinks, staring at  her pregnant frame. <br>\r\n<i>Even at my age, and after three kids, seeing myself this pregnant still makes me beyond happy.</i> She thinks to herself, rubbing her mammoth mound.<br>\r\n\"Come on Mommy! We're waiting!\" Her eldest daughters yells from down-stairs. <br>\r\n\"Okay honey, just keep on waiting! Let me grab the video camera in my office!\" she says. <br>\r\nShe gives her pregnant belly a pat.<br>\r\n\"Come on little one, let's go join your older brothers and sister.\" She says, waddling out of the room, slamming the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe woke up with a start, panting heavily, sweat drenching her face. <br>\r\n<i>What was that?! It felt so real! </i> she thinks, looking around. Nothing's changed. Still the same loneliness as last night. <br>\r\nNo children, no Christmas, no belly. <br>\r\n\"It was those damn pregnancy shows I watched yesterday. Messed with my brain\" she says out loud to herself. <br>\r\nShe looked at the clock. Nearly 9:00 AM. <br>\r\n<i>Damn I overslept </i> she thought to herself.<br>\r\n\"Well I better get ready to meet that jacka - - -HMMRPH!\" Samantha's train of thought is interrupted by another wave of nausea, causing her to once again run for a bathroom with a hand over her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nURK! For the second time in two days, she once again emptied the contents of her stomach in a toilet. URK! Make that three times. <br>\r\nAfter a few moments of resting on the floor, she flushed the toilet, dispensing her sick down the drain. <br>\r\n\"This better not become a regular thing. Listen body, fight off whatever it is okay?\" She said to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up off the floor, and walked to her shower, disrobing, and turn on the shower. As she was about to enter the shower, she caught sight of her nakedness in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer once, older, slightly sagging breasts, were bigger.<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" Samantha says looking at her new improvements. <br>\r\nHer breasts were defiantly bigger, it was not the light playing tricks on her. She was almost pushing a C-Cup, and they had a firmness to them. Her nipples were larger too, and darker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to touch one, and what felt like a wave of electricity went through her body. <br>\r\n\"Damn, these things are sensitive!\" She says to herself out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't all she noticed, her hair seemed shinier and she had some kind of glow going on about her. Her skin felt amazing. <br>\r\nShe profiled herself in the mirror, inspecting her changes. <br>\r\n\"Bigger boobs, healthier look skin, shiny hair\" she says to herself out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea what's going on, but I look amazing.\" she says before hoping in the shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe washed herself, taking special care to avoid touching her new \"enhancements\", and got dressed, which was slightly harder given her new ample chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I must be having some kind of reaction to - something. The throwing up, the swelling, I don't know. If it gets worse I'll talk to someone about it.\" She says as she dressed, putting on a blouse that seemed to struggle to contain her new top-heaviness. She put on a pair on pants and went downstairs to have some breakfast. Despite vomiting, she was starving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed some fruit, some peanut butter, some soy milk, some toast and ate all she possibly could in a hazy moment of extreme eating. When she was done, she let out a little belch, feeling satisfied with her meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea why I've been so hungry lately. I keep eating like this I'm going to gain some serious weight\" she says aloud to herself, enjoying the one-sided conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went back into the living room, and turned on the TV, not really finding anything worth watching. She flicked channels for over an hour, before just turning it off and looking at the clock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nearly 11</i> she thinks. <i>Traffic is going to be a nightmare. I should leave now to get there on time.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs her coat and her purse and keys and heads out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she gets into her car, she sees the silver gleam of the coin she bough yesterday staring back at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip Me.</span> An alien thought crosses through her head as she stares at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shakes her head, starts the car and heads off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe been driving for a while...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

See what he has to say, and then just go back home.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach let out another groan of hunger. <br>\r\n<i>I can't be hungry again.</i> She thought to herself. <i>I must have caught some kind of stomach virus or parasite or something</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe entered in the restaurant, where she was greeted by a red-head hostess in her late 20's.<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the Velveteen Grill. How can I help you?\" She says with a smile, showing the fact that she has braces. <br>\r\n<i>Better late than never</i> Samantha thinks to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm meeting a Thomas Peters here\" Samantha says. <br>\r\n\"Ah yes, right this way. He's already here. Follow me\". The red-head says leading Samantha to the table were he ex-husband Thomas was sitting. <br>\r\nHe was dressed in a suit and tie, clearly coming from the office during his lunch-break. His dark hair was slowly turning grey, while his beard still had the dark brown color she was used to, and fell in love with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, any other signs of aging appear non-exsistant as his skin appears tight, his skin a deep color tan, and a diamond earring stud shines from one of his ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dressing like a 50-year old with money who has a 21-year old waiting for him at home</i> Samantha thinks to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red-headed hostess shows Samantha to her seat. \"My name is Christina, I'll be your hostess today. I'll leave you two alone for a while\" the red head now known as Christina says, placing menus in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" Thomas says, subtitly checking out Christina when she leaves. <br>\r\n<i>Wondering Eye. Something must be wrong with the witch</i> Samantha thinks to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, Samantha looks at you! You've, changed, since I last saw you. You look.. incredible to say the least\" Thomas says, his eyes not leaving her new chest. <br>\r\n\"My eyes are up here Thomas\" Samantha says slightly annoyed. <br>\r\n\"I know that. It's just, wow! Your skin and hair look incredible, and your chest - - - Well let's just say if you had those when we were married, I might have forgotten the whole \"kids\" thing\" he says. <br>\r\n\"Your a pig Thomas - Also married. What would your new wife say if she say you drooling over your ex?\" Samantha says. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, yeah.\" Thomas says, his eyes finally meeting up with Samantha's face. <br>\r\n\"How is she by the way?\" Samantha says, looking over the menu.<br>\r\nIt all looked so good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to lie Sam\" Thomas said.<br>\r\n\"That's a first\" Samantha retorted. <br>\r\n\"Funny. It's not great. We're having trouble conceiving, and she wants us to go to some doctor.\" Thomas says.<br>\r\n\"Ironic. You left your wife who dosen't want kids to be with a woman who can't have them\" Samantha says coldly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know what I did was a horrible thing. But I made my decision, and I'm happy with it. I want kids Samantha, you don't. I don't regret it. As soon she gets pregnant, everything is going to get better between me and her. You'll see\". Thomas says. <br>\r\n\"Ready to order?\" Samantha says. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm not really that hungry. I'll just get a salad or something.\" Thomas says. <br>\r\n\"I'm going to have the fish and chips, with a salad, and a side of mash potatoes, an extra side of fries, and maybe a dessert\" Samantha says absentmindedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam, when I invited you here, it was talk, not to have you gorge yourself on my dime\" Thomas said. <br>\r\n\"Tough. You said you were paying, I'm eating. Now let's order, and we'll talk.\" Samantha says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina came back over and took their order, Samantha's order taking longer than Thomas'. \"Anything to drink?\" Christina says. <br>\r\n\"How about some wine?\" Thomas asks. <br>\r\n<i>I'd love some wine</i> Samantha thought. <br>\r\n\"No thank you. I can't have wine. I'll just take some tea\" Samantha says without thinking.<br>\r\nChristina complets the order and walks off, leaving Thomas and Samantha alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since when can't you have wine?\" Thomas inquires.<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Samantha asks. <br>\r\n\"You just said you can't have any wine. Why not?\" Thomas asks. <br>\r\n\"I didn't say that. I just said I didn't want any right now\" Samantha says.<br>\r\n\"No, you said you can't have any wine, not that you didn't. Huge difference\" Thomas replies.<br>\r\n\"I know what I said.\" Samantha says defensively.<br>\r\n<i>Do I?</i> she thinks. <i>I'm sure I said I didn't want any wine, not that couldn't have any</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to talk about Thomas?' Samantha says slightly annoyed. <br>\r\n\"I want you to sell the house\" Thomas lays it all out. \"While her and I have money, it might take a while and some treatments before she get's pregnant, and this doctor doesn't come cheap. I got a great deal going with a guy I work with, whose willing to pay 750,000 CASH to buy your house. Say's that house is prefect, reminds him of his old childhood home. This guy is loaded Sam. He makes the big bucks, and he wants to buy your house.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's in it for you?\" Samantha asks. <br>\r\n\"Look, I'm going to cut to the chase. I want money out of the deal. Just enough to pay for the doctor visits. You can keep most of it. Move to a smaller ranch house in a quieter neighborhood. You get the money, he gets the house, I can get my wife the baby she wants\" Thomas says bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me, to sell MY house, to some guy YOU know, so you can get a portion of the money of the sale of MY HOUSE, so you can go to a doctor to help get the woman you cheated on me with pregnant\". Samantha says, emphasizing every word in her sentence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know it's a little - - \" <br>\r\n\"It's not 'A Little' Thomas. It's ALOT. Do you hear yourself?\" Samantha asks. <br>\r\nShe was feeling nauseous again, although she wasn't sure if it was from getting sick or her weasel of an ex-husband. <br>\r\n\"Would you just hear me out? It's alot of money!\" Thomas says. <br>\r\n\"I don't care about the money! I care about that house!\" Samantha says. <br>\r\n\"Forget that house! What are you using it for anyways? It's just you in there. Not me and you, just you. Just you and no kids, because you made damn sure of that!\" Thomas lashes back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to me you son-of-a\" Samantha train of thought is interrupted by an alien thought running through her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i>Flip Me Samantha. </i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer attention is drawn to her purse, and the coin inside. Without thinking, her hand reaches into the purse and pulls out the strange coin. <br>\r\nShe slowly caresses the coin, her mind in a daze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I think that's why you should sell. It only makes sense. I know your upset but - - - \" Thomas continues.<br>\r\n\"Samantha? Hey are you listening to me?\"<br>\r\nSamantha is snapped back to reality. <br>\r\n\"What? Sorry.\" <br>\r\n'Is that a coin you got there?\" Thomas asks looking at the coin. <br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, Nina and Chris took me to a traveling Flee Market yesterday. Bought it for a dollar\" She says. <br>\r\n\"Well it's your money. I was just saying that\" Thomas is interrupted by Christina coming back with several trays of food and a bottle of wine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pops the cork, and pours the red wine into Thomas glass, and begins to put down the food, much of which was Samantha's.<br>\r\n\"Here you go!\" Christina announces, distributing the food. <br>\r\n\"Anything else for yo- OH!\" Christina goes to put down the last tray, but it bumped from behind by another server, causing her to jolt forward and knocking the coin from Samantha's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the coin spins to the ground, Samantha manages to grab it just before it collides with the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about that ma'am! Someone bumped me! Is everything okay?!\" Christina says, clearly worried about this situation going the wrong way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. I just dropped my coin, I caught it though\" Samantha says the coin firm in her hand, her eyes still locked on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i>Look Samantha</i></span> the thought ran through her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her fist closed around the coin, not allowing her to see what it inadvertently landed on, her eyes drift upon....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This thing gets in the way some times!\" she said, her hands gesturing to her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe belly, which was flat moments ago, had now jumped to the size of a woman five months pregnant.  She leaned over to clean up the mess, as her belly pressed into the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up straight, Samantha could see that the hostess's green shirt was struggling to contain her pregnant-looking belly, and her pants button had popped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right back with another salad,\" she said, a hand slowly rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha was bewildered.  <i>What the hell did I just watch?</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, Christina returned, and her belly had grown to the seven months mark.

It takes a while to get from place to place with this little guy hanging around!\" she said, giving her belly a pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I almost for got to ask.  How's the baby mama and my baby doing?\" Thomas said, happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're doing great, thank you for asking!  But the baby is upset that he still has two months until he can see you!\" she said, giving her exposed belly another rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're seven months, then?\" said Samantha, finally snapping out of her silence, her eyes on the young girl's middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" she said, patting her belly. \"Gosh I just love being pregnant! It's a shame you never got to be pregnant yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. A shame.\" she said, as her own stomach groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get the message.  I'll let you guys eat!\" Christina said laughing.  She left the two alone to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that?!\" Samantha asked Thomas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" replied Thomas, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since when was she pregnant, and when were you the father?\" she said, beginning to eat her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since seven months ago.  Are you feeling alright, Samantha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine.  I want to know what the witch thinks about this.\" Samantha said, continuing to dig in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy doesn't know, and I intend to keep it that way.\" Thomas said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn minutes, Samantha was finished with the meal, causing Thomas to give her a slightly disgusted look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What is wrong with me?

You're going to be a soccer player when you're older!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha returned to her house.  When she got inside, she removed her coat.  Surprisingly, she was able to make out a slight food baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Serves me right for eating like that,</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha plopped onto the couch and turned on the TV.

KNOCK! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha, sitting comfortably on her couch, watching nothing in particular, is disturbed by the loud pounding coming from her front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the hell is this now</i> Samantha thinks to herself, getting of the couch, well trying to at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, she was having a small amount of difficulty removing herself off her couch, the small bulge in her belly getting in the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed her hand on it, exploring it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I've eaten like a pig for the past two days! No wonder I'm bloating</i> Samantha thinks to herself giving the almost microscopic bulge a rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a second!\" Samantha asks to the person on the other side of the door. As she moves to open the door, she catches sight of herself in her living room mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I've changed</i> she thinks examining herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer once sagging breasts are now firmer, larger, rounder, heavier. They strain against the contours of her blouse. Her stomach bulges out slightly, barely visible against the lower portion of her blouse, while her hips have appeared to have gotten slightly wider, her hair shinier, the non-white portions of her gorgeous blonde hair looked healthier. She even looked like was glowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What's happening to me?</i> Samantha asks herself, turning around in a circle, taking in every inch of her changing appearance. <i>I almost look... maternal</i> she thinks, a smile forming across her face when the word \"maternal\" pops into head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yes... Maternal</i> she thinks slowly to herself, placing her hands on the small bulge on her midsection. She sways back and forth, humming something to herself, staring at her reflection, hands on her bulge, lost in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pounding on the door brings Samantha back to her senses. <i>What in the hell was THAT just now?</i> She thinks, looking at her reflection in the mirror. <i>I swear, it was those stupid pregnancy shows I watched yesterday. They fired my brain with that crap. I should have never watched that garbage. Who could ever want children? Or be that big and disgusting fat?</i> She thinks loud to herself as she opens the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her friend Nina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Samantha, took you long enough! How are you feeling?\" Nina asks.<br>\r\n\"Well Nina, not fantastic actually\" Samantha says, inviting her friend in. <br>\r\n\"What's the matter? And - - - What Happened To Your Chest?!\" Nina exclaims, her eyes looking on Samantha's new assets. <br>\r\n\"It's nothing.\" Samantha says, putting her arms across her chest, trying to hide her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those were certainly not nothing! Samantha! Your 55 year's old, and have a chest that would make most average woman literally half-your-age jealous! I mean, where did those come from?\" Nina says, moving her head around trying to get a good look at her friend's chest. <br>\r\n\"It's a reaction to something\" Samantha says, getting slightly annoyed. <br>\r\n\"Reaction to what? Silicone?\" Nina says, a smirk forming on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha! Very funny. Look, I got sick yesterday, and then this morning I woke up and they were like these. Clearly, between that and the throwing up I've been doing, it's some kind of reaction to something\" Samantha states very matter-of-factly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense\" Nina says, quickly losing interest in her friends new chest.<br>\r\n\"It does?\" Samantha says surprised. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, my cousin ate a piece of shrimp once, every part of her body swelled up from an allergic reaction. She didn't even know she was allergic to shellfish until she was in her 30's!\" Nina informs. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, that makes sense. I guess that would explain this\" Samantha says, lifting up her blouse showing her friend Nina her small bulge. <br>\r\n\"I think it's part of the swelling. Although, I've been eating like a pig since yesterday, so it might be rapid weight gain\" Samantha theorizes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, 55 years old. Your body is slowing down, hormones changing. The weight starts piling on seemingly overnight\" Nina says prodding the small belly. <br>\r\n\"Still, it's kind of firm. Kind of like when I was - - - \" Nina is cut off.<br>\r\n\"Are you done prodding me?\" Samantha asks, putting her blouse down over her bulge. Her bulge that was swelling and food, and nothing else. <i>Nothing else</i> Samantha thinks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry. So, still you feeling better than yesterday?\" Nina asks.  <br>\r\n\"Not really. I feel worse in fact. I had to meet Tom today\". Samantha says, sitting down on the couch, her friend joining her moments later.<br>\r\n\"Ugh. Bet that wasn't fun. Let me guess, he want you to\" Nina's thought is finished by her friend.<br>\r\n\"Sell the house. And get this. He want's me to sell the house to this guy he works with, so he can get a portion of the money with a finder's fee so he can use that to take \"The Witch\" to the doctor's because she's having trouble getting knocked up\" Samantha explains.<br>\r\n\"That pig! Unbelievable! I never liked him! I told Chris, day after day, that Thomas guy is nothing but trouble. And I was right! I was right!\" Nina jesters, loving every moment of the gossip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did you tell him?\" Nina inquires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me Samantha</span> the alien thought was back and running through her head again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well something happened...\" Samantha says hesitantly. How could she possibly explain it? She still couldn't believe what she say. The shimmer, the young waitress becoming pregnant, and then suddenly Thomas is the father? He didn't even know that girl before today! <i>She's going to think you're crazy!</i> Samantha thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! Come on tell me!\" Nina complained.<br>\r\n\"Well, okay. But I'm not crazy okay? I get there, and there's this pretty little red-head right? Mid-to-late 20's, chipper personality, braces. She shows me to  Thomas table, and he's his usual slimy self. But after a while, I pull out that coin right? The one I bought? And the red-head comes back right? Well, after I drop the coin, I come back up - - and\" Samantha couldn't finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AND WHAT!? COME ON WOMAN, TELL ME!\" Nina was captivated.<br>\r\n\"Okay, but I'm not crazy remember! I come back up, and all of sudden she's pregnant right? Like 4 or 5 months or whatever the hell it is right? Like flat belly to fatso in no-seconds flat. But the weird thing is, she's acting as if it's completely normal. She leaves, and waddles back moments later, even more pregnant then when she left - - She was seven months, she told me herself. Her belly was so big that her uniform was straining against it, and resting on top of her stomach. I could see the kid kicking against her skin! And she just acted like it was nothing! Like it had always been that way! And then out of nowhere, Tom is talking to the girl, calling her his baby's momma! They both acted like this was normal!\" Samantha says, sounding completely insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence falls between her and her friend. Finally, Nina bursts out laughing. <br>\r\n\"Oh man Samantha, you sure can spin a good yarn!\" NIna says between laughs. <br>\r\n\"I'm serious Nina! That's what really happened! I watched a woman grow pregnant and act like it was nothing unusual!\" Samantha says, taken a little back by her friends reaction.<br>\r\n\"As a woman who's been pregnant many times, let me tell you something Sam, women don't just \"Grow\" pregnant. Babies are still made the old fashion way.\" Nina says.<br>\r\n\"Then what did I see today?\" Samantha says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was your mind playing tricks on you. Okay listen: You get there, and Tom is already bothering you to sell your house for his gain. Then, you realize that young pregnant twenty something who showed you to your seat is Tom's mistress, and coming from a woman who has been cheated on by this same man, your brain identifies with what \"The Witch\" is about  to go through as Tom's infidelity is about to be found out, unearthing deep feelings that you still haven't gotten over when you were in this situation. So your brain created this elaborate scenario to protect you. Makes sense doesn't it?\" Nina lectures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it kind of does. It would explain why I was so calm about seeing a woman \"Grow\" pregnant\" Samantha thinks. <br>\r\n\"Exactly. The reason you didn't panic was because you knew it wasn't real, and this was just a mental escape you built for yourself\" Nina explains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me Samantha. Heads or Tails</span> the alien voice runs in her brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Tom is cheating on his second wife, and is having a baby with another woman? Man, I can't wait to see that explode in his face. It's going to be sweet sweet justice. I hope \"The Witch\" takes him for everything he has left, which isn't much\" Nina says with a sinister look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot listening, Samantha gets up off the couch, digs through her purse, grabs the coin, and sits back down. <br>\r\nShe begins to lightly caress the coin while her friend looks at her like a crazy person. <br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry, was my insulting your scumbucket ex-husband boring you that you had to start playing with your little flea market purchase?\" Nina says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip Me</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe does. Flick! The coin goes flying in the air, and she Samantha catches it, closing her hand tight around it, not breaking eye contact with her 52 year old friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam, you okay? You're acting weird. And not good weird\" Nina asks, not aware of what's going to happen next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine. Why?\" Samantha asks, her hand slowly opening to reveal the coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Reveal it!</span> The voice cries in her head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coin is revealed..

A woman doesn't just grow pregnant instantly!</i> She ponders to herself, her hand absentmindedly finding itself resting ontop of her small mysterious bulge in her midsection, giving a small rub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And yet, I saw it happened TWICE today.

I just need to rest</i> she thinks, shifting her body to a more comfortable position, resting her head agains the soft fabric on the wooden chair, and let the sweet siren call of sleep cover her like a blanket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Another Dream</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood red leaves fell to the pavement during a violent breeze against the dark red setting sun on that pleasant Autumn evening. These blood red leaves lived an average leafy existence, after all they were leaves, before being trampled into a crunchy red pile by the clomps of the ghosts, ghouls, goblins, witches, and other otherworldly shapes that marched through the neighborhood, tightly clutching their smiling orange buckets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach house looked like a scene from a horror movie. Zombie arms reached through the green grass, threatening to grab the first person foolish enough to come close, while the skeletons of dead man hung from trees, front porches covered in massive spiderwebs, monsters, and glowing orange vegetables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalloween. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her house, Samantha was putting the final touches on the princess costume her 6 six year daughter was wearing, making sure it fit properly (and safely, most importantly) for the long night of candy-begging that awaited her, and her two younger brothers. <br>\r\n\"Don't squirm sweetie, this will only take longer.\" Samantha says, (awkwardly) trying to bend down to pin the last safety pin into place. It was a difficult move for Samantha, because of how pregnant she was, her massive orb of life making it difficult to completely bend down to her daughter's level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis halloween, Samantha decided to go with a \"sexy\" costume, feeling her inhibitions run wild as she walked the aisles of the local Halloween store with her children two weeks ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer six year old daughter wanted to be a princess, which was humorous to Samantha, because she really was a princess, at least to her. Her four year old son wanted to be his favorite superhero from those Saturday morning cartoon shows he loved. Her youngest child, her two year old son, didn't really have a say in what he wanted to be, as Samantha instantly fell in love with a little pumpkin costume that was just his size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spending longer at the costume shop than she should have, she finally decided on one of those \"Sexy\" costumes, which made women look like something, well, something Samantha really wouldn't say. The costume she choose was \"Sexy Witch\", which was basically knee high stockings, a halloween theme skirt with magic looking symbols on it, then a top which was just basically a frilly bra, and a large pointed witches hat. It was really only the hat that made this costume look like a witch's outfit and not lingerie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe costume was meant for someone literally 30 years younger than Samantha. It was meant for young wild 25 year old in perfect shape for the exposed midsection piece, not a 55 year old heavily pregnant woman towing around three kids under the age of 10. When Samantha tried it on after getting home from work, she was surprised by how sexy she felt in this vastly inappropriate costume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skirt (which only fit after some alterations) hung low and snug around the underside of her mound, while her breasts nearly spilled out over the top. She spent the time between getting home, her children fed, and getting them ready, to paint various Halloween shapes and words on her pregnant belly with some new glow-in-the-dark halloween paint she found in the costume store that said it was safe. Ghosts, cats, pumpkins, witches, stars, and the words \"Trick or Treat\" \"Boo!\" \"Happy Halloween!\" and \"Little Monster Inside\" were painted along the vast expanse of her gravid belly, which after she was done, had to give herself credit for doing a pretty good job at doing by herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking several pictures of herself in her halloween costume (a tradition she's done with every halloween costume she wore while pregnant) she grabbed some fabric glow-in-the-dark bags with Halloween pictures on them, and prepare to go Trick-Or-Treating with her children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha finished up the work on her daughter's costume, and gathered up the rest of her little flock. After a few last minute checks to costumes, and making sure they had their little glow sticks on them, they were ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys ready for Halloween!\" Samantha says, resting her hands into the small of her back, slightly pushing her belly farther ahead of her. <br>\r\nA cheer went up from her children, forcing Samantha to smile. <br>\r\n\"Okay, here are you bags! Now remember, don't run ahead of Mommy! Your little brother or sister makes her move slowly these days! And NO EATING Candy without Mommy checking it first! If I see anyone eating candy before I check it is going to be in BIG trouble! And stay on the sidewalks!\" Samantha commands her flock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's go!\" Samantha says, opening the door and showing her children out the door, with a smile, watching them file out with a cheer. She gives her mound a rub, before turning off the lights to her house and closing the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was awoken by a tapping on her should. As she her eyes opened, all she saw in front of her was belly, very pregnant belly, that now belonged to her friend Nina, looking at her, positively glowing, a smile a mile wide across her face, the wrinkles and crow's feet lightly showing around her happy expression. Nina was holding a sonogram in front of her barely covered belly, showing off her new child which she just seemingly aquired some time ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a girl!\" She says, tears in her eyes. \"I finally have my little girl!\" Nina was on the verge of tears, as Samantha just started at the picture in front of her. Nina had three boys, the youngest of whom she just sent to college a few weeks ago. While Nina loved her sons, it was no secret to anyone that she always wanted a little girl, and now, she finally has her, growing inside of her, despite not being pregnant hours earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations?\" Samantha asks, unsure if this is a good thing or a bad thing. Nina rubs her hands across her 8 month pregnant belly, checking to see if  <br>\r\nit was in fact real, and it was very real. Samantha could see the kicks and jabs against Nina's skin from her new daughter inside of her. \"I'm going to name her Miracle\" Nina says with a smile, rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina had changed, her once sagging breasts had seemed to be perkier, heavier, and bigger, and she has seemed to gain some weight, although Samantha couldn't guess where it came from. <br>\r\n\"That's a lovely name Nina\" Samantha says. \"But what about Chris?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina just looked at her new pregnant belly and just smiled, not caring about the world around her. <br>\r\n\"Chris knows. I mean he knows now. The doctor called him after the examination, telling him the baby was fine. Everything checked out, she's great. Chris, on the other hand, is a little confused. I tried to explain on the phone, but he seems to think this is all an elaborate prank. I think he's going to come face-to-face with the truth very soon.\" Nina says, putting her hands on her back. <br>\r\n\"Did he seem upset?\" Samantha asked.<br>\r\n\"A little; also confused. I have the sonogram and the paperwork to show him\" Nina says.<br>\r\n\"Among other things\" Samantha says look down at Nina's belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think this little girl and I should go home and get some sleep. It's been... It's been a day.\" Nina says, looking down at her gravid middle. <br>\r\n\"I think I'll drive\" Samantha says, eyeing Nina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunger washed over her like a wave, her stomach groaning. <br>\r\n<i>Oh come on. I can't be hungry after that big lunch I had earlier</i> Samantha thinks to herself, placing her hand on the bulge in her midsection.<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\" Nina asks rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n\"Just a little hungry\" Samantha says.<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm a little hungry too, although for probably different reasons than you\" Nina replies, emphasizing her new pregnant frame. <br>\r\n\"Nina, you should really get some sleep though. I mean, what's you been through...\" Samantha says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food, sleep. I could go for either right now\" Nina says, resting her hands ontop of her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha looked at the clock: 12:31 AM. <br>\r\nNot a lot will be open this late...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>She needs to rest. Not just for her sake, but for that brat now inside her</i> Samantha thinks to herself, staring at the pregnant midsection of her friend. <br>\r\n\"Come on Nina, let's waddle your butt home. I think food can wait for you. I think you have a confused husband who might want some answers\" Samantha says, poking Nina's taut, firm belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're probably right. Besides, I have some pickles and ice cream at home\" Nina says with a devilish grin, and pats her pregnant stomach. <br>\r\n<i>Pickles and Ice Cream sounds pretty good right now</i> Samantha finds herself thinking, before shaking her head, removing the idea from her head. <br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Nina asks, rubbing her gravid mound. <br>\r\n\"Nothing, just had a foolish thought\". Samantha says, heading towards the door, Nina now waddling behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an awkward ride home for Nina. The chaos of her sudden pregnancy, as Samantha could best describe it, had died down, replaced now with a near silence as Samantha tried to keep her eyes on the road, and off her friends pregnant middle. Nina had fallen asleep with her hands resting on top of her life-filled orb, a small flurry of kicks and jabs visible under the portion of her skin that was not covered by her shirt. Catching glimpses of it out of the corner of her eye, Samantha was both enthralled and disgusted at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she made the turn into Nina's driveway, and politely woke her expectant friend up. \"Hey Mommy, you're home.\" Samantha says, teasing her friend. Nina, opened her eyes and drummed her fingers along her belly with a smile on her face. \"Thanks Sam, I owe you\" she said. <br>\r\n\"No, you don't. Besides I think you got bigger problems to deal with tonight\" Samantha said. <br>\r\n\"Emphasis on bigger huh?\" Nina laughed, patting her belly. <br>\r\n\"Just keep me informed Nina. This is unusual, and I want to make sure you'll be okay.\" Samantha said, putting her hand on her friends shoulder. <br>\r\n\"I'll be fine. WE'LL be fine.\" Nina says, looking at her pregnant orb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe unbuckled her seat belt, grabbed her medical documentation, and then waddled to the front door. As Nina unlocked the door, the lights came on from the master bedroom. Nina entered the house and flicked on the light. Moments later, a very audible \"OH MY GOD NINA\" was heard, the unmistakable sound of Chris's voice, followed by the sound of breaking glass, Chris dropping whatever it was he was drinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha smirked, sorry to miss the show that was about to unfold, but shifted her car back into drive and headed home.<br>\r\nAfter some time, she found herself in the warm embrace of her bed, and drifted off into a dreamless slumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBZZT! BZZT! BZZT! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes opened what to her were mere moments later, to the buzzing of her alarm clock. which read 5:00 AM. <br>\r\n<i>Oh damn that right. Work's back</i> Samantha thought, remembering that she has to be a teacher again today, after one glorious week off thanks to another made up break due to budget cuts. When the school board told them it was more weeks off from school or less pay, the teacher's union went with more time off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha sat straight up, and slowly walked her way to the bathroom. For the first time in two days, she didn't feel like puking her guts out. <br>\r\n<i>Small miracles</i> she thought as she prepared for her day. After disrobing, her jaw dropped as she saw that her breasts appeared bigger than yesterday,  encroaching the upper C range to low D range, while the small bulge in her stomach was bigger than yesterday. Her breasts were firm, heavy feeling, and started to have visible veins around her nipples, which were larger as well, and taking a deep dark shade of brown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bulge was the size of small tennis ball if not larger. When she turned sideways in the mirror, she could see that it started to slope downwards, and the her back appeared to start arching, giving it a distinct curve, and roundness to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What in the bloody hell?</i> she thought. <i>Why am I still swelling? I thought with the nausea gone, this flu I'd be fighting would start causing my other systems to go away.</i> she thought. She was alarmed, but some part of her, deep downside inside of her, ignored what was best for her, turned away from the mirror, and took a shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter drying herself off, she got dressed for the day, putting on white undershirt, blue sweater, and a pair of black pants. They were very snug against her, so much so, that the waistline of the pants seemed to dig into her potbelly, making her uncomfortable. <br>\r\n\"Oh come on\" she says out loud, unbuttoning the pants, and trying again. She sucks it in (something she's never had to do before this day) and tries to refasten the button on her pants. She does, buttoning it lower, making the firmness of her pot-belly seem to spill over her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sweater and undershirt went on fine, but the problem was that her clothing  was more snug around her breasts and stomach, the sweater now only covering 95 percent of her, leaving a small section of belly peeking out from under. The sweater and pants seem to make her new \"curves\" that much more pronounced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at herself in her dressing mirror, turning to the side to see her profile. <i>God, I'm so fat. </i> she thought, as rush of sadness and emotion sweeping her away, tears forming in her eyes. <br>\r\n\"Oh, why am I crying?\" she says out loud to herself. She wipes away the tears, and heads downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the clock, inspecting her new body has taken her longer than she thought, and was now in danger of running late. She was always early. Letting out an audible swear, she picked up her car keys and prepared to head out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Take Me Samantha</span> an alien thought was back in her head. <br>\r\nShe looked over to where she was sitting last night, when Nina's new pregnancy \"just happened\" as Samantha could best describe it, and saw the coin sitting on the table where she left it. <br>\r\n<i>Strange, didn't I put this in my pocket last night? </i> she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at it for what seemed like an eternity, before picking it up and placing it in her pocket.<br>\r\n<i>Maybe someone at the school could identify this</i> she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got her things together, and got in her car, heading off to work. Halfway there, she became hungry again, and deciding not to argue with herself, got some drive-thru breakfast sandwiches from the local burger joint. She normally hated fast food, but this morning, it was impossible to resist. She scarfed down every crumb of the two triple-bacon egg cheese sandwiches, a large orange juice, and two sides of good morning fries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No wonder my clothes don't fit. I'm a fatty </i> she thinks, sadness coming over her like dark rainclouds. As she pulled into the teacher parking lot of Twin Hills Elementary School, her mood was about to go from bad to worse as she saw the cherry red convertible parked in her designated space at the front of the parking lot. The cherry red convertible that she knew belong to Ms. Brooke Edwards, the 26 year old strawberry blonde bombshell that everyone calls Bombshell Brooke, or in some cruder circles of men, Ms. \"DD\" Edwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn her. She took my spot again! That's the third time this month!\" Samantha says slamming her first into the steering wheel. She sighed, pulled around the parking lot, and pulled into Ms. Edward's spot located at the very back of the lot. Parking spots were assigned by the years worked at the school, and Ms. Edwards just started this year, while Samantha was fast approaching 30 years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thirty years. Thirty years of teaching 4th grade. Thirty years of dealing with children. </i> she thought, the irony not lost on her. She just kind of feel into teaching, not really sure what to with herself. She enjoyed it at first, watching young minds grow and learn, filled with a sense of pride. But the years went on, and the children's behavior steadily grew worse and worse, her workload becoming more and more intense, her class size becoming larger than she should have had to handle. Eventually it got to a breaking point, and she found disdain for both her job and children. She considered quitting, possibly working at a higher grade level, but in reality, she was close to retirement age, put some decent money away, and was quickly counting down the years until retirement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Tread water until your pulled from the sinking boat</i> she thought as she walked, with some great difficulty into the school, not quite sure what that phrase meant. She walked into the teacher's lounge and sat down to enjoy a few minutes to herself before the rest of her coworkers arrived. She was always one of the first to arrive everyday more so for peace an quiet than job pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Samantha\" a male voice said. She looked up, and her mood brighten considerably, since the voice belonged to Dylan Best, the very handsome 30 year old 5th grade teacher that taught down the hallway from her. Smart, young, funny, kind, good looking, with sharp brown hair, and in amazing shape, Dylan was the type of man she could have literally killed for, if she was twenty-five years younger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Twenty five years younger</i> Samantha thought to herself. <i>Am I really that old? Am I that foolish to pine for a younger man?</i><br>\r\nTwin Hills Elementary school was for the young, and she was not talking about the student. Most of the teaching staff were in their late 20's, early 30's, many landing these jobs straight out of school, apart of the school districts desire to revamp education with hip, new young teacher to make kids more excited about learning with someone they saw as a friend. The results were promising. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was your break Samantha?\" Dylan asked making coffee. <br>\r\n\"It was interesting to say the least. I had something odd happen - - - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha was interrupted when - <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Good morning losers!\" was the workday-morning greeting belong to one Ms. Brooke Edwards, the 26 year old strawberry blonde bombshell, that sauntered into the teacher's lounge like a lingerie model strutting down the catwalk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Brooke Edwards, was by the far, the least teachery looking teacher in the history of teachers. 6'2, long legged, narrow at the hip, with a 45 DD chest, which had given her the nickname \"DD Edwards\" by some of her male co-workers, long pink fingernails, and a firm supple rear-end, that was always perfectly outlined in whatever she was wearing, (which, was as little as the school board dress code would allow), she looked more like a high priced supermodel that just walked off the list of \"The World's Top 10 Sexiest Women Ever\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was the school new's gym teacher, making sure all the students at Twin Hills Elementary got their physical activity, with different activities including kickball, an obstacle course, and her personal favorite dodgeball. She was good at her job, even if it looked like she belonged on the cover of some girly mag, and not in the gym of an elementary school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her work was great, her attitude was terrible. She was mean, at least Samantha thought so. Not just mean, cruel. Constantly starting bickering matches with other members of the female staff, she would often insult co-workers about their lack of fashion or physical fitness, among other things, while constantly flirting with many of the male staff members at the school, Brooke was more like a Hollywood Party Girl in personality than an educator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe acted like she owned the place, and truth be told, she probably did. Her father was loaded, and had a habit of making generous donations to the school whenever Brooke became a \"problem\" for the school board. A few hundred thousand dollars or more, a few new computers or laptops, and any complaints with Brooke (of which were several), seemed to vanish in thin-air. Brooke may have been stunningly beautiful on the outside, but she was rotten on the inside, not that most of the male staff members (Dylan included, Samantha noticed the way he looked at her) seemed to mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Ms. Edwards\" Dylan says, checking out Brooke. Today, her hair was in a long ponytail, wearing a pair of grey sweat-pants that hugged every curve on her lower half, with a skin-tight white t-shirt with the words \"Twin Hills Elementary\" written on it. Her black lacy bra was visible under the curve hugging white t-shirt. Samantha could see that Dylan liked what he saw. She couldn't blame him, he was a man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dylan, making me coffee? It's like you knew I was going to be nursing a hangover this morning\" She says, taking Dylan's coffeecup and taking a huge swig from it. \"You're almost marrying material\" she says with a devilish grin on her face. \"Yeah, too bad your not the kind of woman I wanna marry. You know, the kind that's a decent human being\" he says with a smug smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ouch</i> Samantha thought with a grin. \"Oh, Dylan, Dylan, Dylan. Who needs a personality when I look like this? Come on, it's the 21st century. Why don't we just give into our basic primal instincts?\" she says, in an alluring breathy voice, moving in closer to him, her amazing body brushing against his. <br>\r\n\"Your body is amazing Dylan. I know you work out all the time. I've seen you playing basketball in the gym after school.  How about you and I get together after work for a little extra credit physical education?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tempting. But I'm worried about what I may catch\" Dylan says. <br>\r\n<i>Zing. Smart, funny, sexy. Oh if only I was twenty years younger</i> Samantha thought herself.<br>\r\n\"The only your going to catch is my -  - - \" Ms. Edwards was about to say something particularly vulgar when Samantha stood up from the table. <br>\r\n\"Okay, children. I think we should stop this hear before it ends with Ms. Edwards father having to buy another computer lab and band equipment for the school\" Samantha says, putting a stop to this conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Samantha stood up, Dylan and Brooke's eyes fell upon her round belly, slightly visible against the tight contours of her sweater. <br>\r\n\"Samantha - - \" Dylan says, entranced by Samantha's covered midsection. \"What happened to you?\" <br>\r\n\"It's obvious. She pigged out over break. Oink-Oink!\" Ms. Edwards said, thumbing up her nose to make a nose. <br>\r\nTears suddenly started to form in Samantha's eyes, Brooke's harsh words making her emotional about her weight gain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brooke! That was not okay!\" Dylan says looking at her.<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, it was a joke Samantha. Don't freak out about it\" Brooke says in a tone that makes it seem like she's the victim. <br>\r\n\"It's swelling. I've been fighting a sickness for the past few days\" Samantha says, fighting back tears and a lump in her throat. <br>\r\n<i>Damn, so emotional right now</i> Samantha thinks to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't cry Samantha. It's barely noticeable.\" Dylan lies, poorly. \"Besides, I think it's kind of sexy. Shows that a woman can enjoy a good meal every now and then huh?\" Dylan says, chamingly. <br>\r\n<i>He's just saying that to me feel better. It's working</i> Samantha says looking down at her small round middle-section. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip Me</span> the unknown voice races through her head again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm feeling better. I'm sure the swelling will go down soon.\" Samantha says, placing her hands on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small moment was interrupted when the principal of the school, Ms. Lisa Jacobs, came in. In her mid-40's, she was dressed in a grey suit with a white button up blouse. Her hair, still golden blonde, was up in a bun. Lisa Jacobs was a dedicate career woman, never stopping to get married or have a family. Her job was her husband, and her student were her children, she heard her say on numerous occasions. <br>\r\n\"Good morning Samantha, Dylan\" She nodded to them, before slowly turning her attention to Ms. Edwards... attire for the day.<br>\r\n\"Ms. Edwards, I see you're still pushing the limits of the dress code and good taste around her\" Ms. Jacobs said with a stern tone. <br>\r\n\"Don't worry boss. I'll make sure Daddy buys us some new playground equipment.\" Brooke said with a smile. <br>\r\n\"Yes\". Ms. Jacobs says, rolling her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip Me Samantha</span> the thought ran through her head again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Jacobs eyes Samantha's midsection, and her the curves of her bust, and raises an eyebrow. \"Uh, Samantha? Something different about you?\" Ms. Jacobs asks.<br>\r\nShe covers her chest with one hand, and her belly with the other, suddenly ashamed of how she looks. <br>\r\n\"Uh - - - \" Samantha tries to speak, no words forming. <br>\r\n\"Samantha is just having a rough week. She's fighting off something that's causing her to retain water and swell. The doctor says the swelling should go down soon.\" Dylan lies for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing serious is it?\" Ms. Jacobs asks, genuine concern in her voice. <br>\r\n\"Uh - no. Just some swelling and uh - - water weight.\" Samantha acknowledges Dylan's lie. <br>\r\n\"Well, okay. It if gets worse, come see me, so we can get you some medical leave.\" Ms. Jacobs says. <br>\r\n\"More like Maternity leave judging by the size of her!\" Brooke says with a cackle. <br>\r\nEmotions begin to well up inside of Samantha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Edwards! What did I tell you about how you talk to fellow female staff members?! My office in 1 hour!\" Ms. Jacobs says, her voice raising at Brooke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me.</span> The voice echoes through her head. <br>\r\nSamantha couldn't fight it. She was on the verge of tears, emotions running through her she couldn't explain. She grabs her purse off the table and begins to dig through it looking for tissues, instead, her hand grabbing the strange coin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me!</span><br>\r\nShe did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one quick motion, she flicked the coin in the air, and grabbed it, with a snatch of her hand. <br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Look!</span> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough her watery eyes, her gaze fell upon..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The lunch bell's shrill ring was a welcomed sound to Samantha. <br>\r\n<i>Finally, I can get off my feet. Although sitting's also become a problem. </i> Samantha thinks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her teaching day was uneventful, it was becoming increasingly more difficult. If she stood for any length of time, her back began to ache, forcing her to sit down. And yet, if she sat for too long, her ankles and feet began to swell, causing her legs to hurt after a short amount of time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp, ache, down, ache. This was her routine for the first few hours of teaching. While she received no more questions from her students  about her swelling mid-section, she could all see them staring at it, as she stood teaching, the tiny silver of taut belly peeking out from under her sweater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students all filled out of her classroom, room 4B, (Fourth Grade classroom B), taking their lunch money or their brightly colored, licensed lunch boxes with them, leaving Samantha alone in her room, in peace and quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lunch hour was always broken up into two sections: 45 minutes to eat, and 15 minutes of in-door \"Free Activity\", allowing the students to go the library, or play small quick board games that were in the \"cafeteria\", although, the cafeteria was officially labeled as a \"Activity Area\" because of the lunch room having board games, books, and other things for the children to do after finishing eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha looked around her classroom with a sigh. It was a disaster, just like it was every day of the school year. Falling into the same routine, she went around the room, cleaning it up. Walking by the desk of one of her best students, Amy, she noticed a scrap of paper left on her desk, with the words \"<b>Names For Miss Peter's Baby! By Amy Larson</b>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the corner, in a semi-decent drawing, was a representation of Samantha, wearing what she was wearing today, with a pregnant looking belly, with a little stick figure inside. A note above the drawing reads: <b>Miss Peters! I'm so happy you're having a baby, even if you're very old. But old people are nice like my grandma! You will make a great mommy! - Amy</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove two columns listing names for boys and girls is a note: <br>\r\n<b>Miss Peters is having a baby! Her belly is getting big just like when Mommy had my little brother last year. She might need help picking out a name for her new baby! </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome names were listed in each of the columns: Brandon, Cameron, Zayn, Liam for boys, Trisha, Julia, Rebecca, Veronica listed for girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the note, a wash of different emotions came over her, in what felt like a hormonal cocktail. <br>\r\nFirst was anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow dare this little girl make such an assumption that she was pregnant! She wasn't pregnant, shouldn't wouldn't EVER be pregnant. <br>\r\nThis was borderline offensive. She told the girl that the reason her belly was getting big was because she was sick. This is was not okay, and she felt as though she should really talk to the young girl about how something like this might hurt someone's feelings. She should also talk to the girl about respecting people's privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, her emotions slingshotted to another emotion: Happiness. <br>\r\nHere was this young girl, who was so happy that her teacher (at least to her) was having a baby, and all she wanted to do was help, unselfishly. <br>\r\nShe worked very hard to come up with some very pretty names for her teacher's (pretend) baby, and even signed it herself, letting Samantha know that it was her, Amy, who helped her out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout missing a beat, a third emotion hit her: Sadness. <br>\r\nNo, she wasn't sad because she wasn't pregnant, no matter how hard this little girl wanted her to be. She was sad at how fat she was getting. <br>\r\n<i>I worked so hard to stay in decent shape my whole life, and I catch some kind of disease and now little kids think I'm pregnant</i> she thinks looking down at her swollen middle. <br>\r\nShe was also sad for the little girl. She was so happy that her teacher was going to have a baby (in her eyes), that she didn't even realize that it was impossible for a woman her age to have a baby She was going to be crushed when she told her that she wasn't having a baby, or wasn't ever going to have a baby. That would lead to the next question: Why not? Which always lead to the same answer: Because well, some people don't want to have babies. Some people are content with just being by themselves, and I'm one of those people. This wasn't the first time she had to answer that question. <br>\r\nShe was asked that question when she was teaching one of the Nina's three boys when they went here. They asked her why didn't she and Thomas have a baby, because they were married for a long time, and married people have babies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking back on Nina, she worried about her friend. <i>I should call her during lunch. Find out how she and her... baby are doing</i> Samantha thought, tripping over the words. <i>If nothing else, I should find out what Chris thinks. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA groan of hunger rumbled from her stomach, and she sighed.<br>\r\n\"Always hungry! It must be some kind of stomach parasite or something. Probably from when I ate that organic imported fruit.\" She said outloud to herself. <br>\r\n\"Well, I'm already fat enough. I'm just going to go out, eat a like snack, and then call Nina\" <br>\r\nShe took Amy's little list of baby names, and put it in her pocket. She would have a talk with her later about this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moment later, she was in the \"Activity Area\" watching the students eat their lunches, talk to each other, play games, and cause havoc. <br>\r\n<i>Whose on lunch duty with me today?</i> She thinks to herself. A few teachers from the classrooms sat at the teacher's table, supervising the chaos that was a daily lunchtime, the rest would enjoy a nice quite meal in the teacher's lounge, trading horror stories for the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she scanned the \"Activity Area\" she actually was surprised to see Dylan Best, the 5th grade teacher, sitting by himself at the Teacher's table, eating a large meal and nursing a ginger ale. He looked like hell, slightly pale, and his hair disheveled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dylan? Are you okay?\" Samantha asks Dylan, as he stuffed several tater tots into his mouth. <br>\r\n\"Well, I'm feeling better but not great\" he says, drinking down his ginger ale. \"I have no idea what happened to me this morning. I came in feeling great, excited to be back teaching, and then I was just talking to you guys, and then I just had this overwhelming feeling of being nauseous. Like boom, out of nowhere, I just going to puke. I managed to make it to the men's bathroom in time, where I heaved my guts out for like 30 minutes. Actually had to get someone else to cover the early part of my class because I was so sick.\"<br>\r\nDylan takes a huge bite out of a very grey looking cheeseburger that the school was serving today, mayonnaise, ketchup along with pickles, tomatoes, lettuce, and onions spilling out of the bun. He barely chews his food before shoving more tater tots into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you must be certainly feeling better.\" Samantha says sitting down across from him. <br>\r\n\"It's the weirdest thing. A little while after I puked, I was starving. Like I haven't eaten in days kind of thing. I usually don't eat the junk this school serves you know loaded with fat and calories, I usually bring my lunch, but today, I don't know. This is my second helping of these burgers and fries. It's just so good\" He says shoveling more food into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha might have been disgusted of how much a pig Dylan Best was making out of himself, but she just gorged herself like this earlier this morning, so she couldn't hold it against him. Besides, he would burn off all those calories in a heartbeat. He was young, thin, and athletic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha looked at Dylan stuffing his mouth, and her hopes of having a small lunch soon went flying out the window, as she grabbed two of the grey looking school cheeseburgers, some fries, and three little paper cartoons of milk, returning to her seat across from Dylan, and begins to eat her food like no tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan raises an eyebrow in her general direction. \"Swelling huh?\" He asks, referring to her expanded midsection. \"I don't know Dylan. I think I might have some kind of parasite or something. I ate some organic imported fruit and probably had a bug in it. Would explain the hunger and throwing up I've been doing\" She said, her mouth full of burger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if that's true, you should get to a doctor.\" Dylan says, finishing up his meal, and wiping the corners of his mouth. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, if it keeps up. But I wasn't puking this morning, so that's probably a sign that things are getting better. What's your excuse?\" Samantha asks. <br>\r\n\"My niece was staying over at my house over the break, I probably caught something from her. She was sick a little bit.\" Dylan says. <br>\r\n\"You gonna okay?\" Samantha asks. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think so. I'm still feeling a little bit queazy, but if it goes worse, I'll head home and lay down\" he answers. <br>\r\n\"Okay, if you need to, drop your class of me. I'll figure out something to do with them\". Samantha says.<br>\r\n\"Thanks Sam. See you around\" he says, picking up after his meal and leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunch ended all to soon, as Samantha picked up her tray, cleaned up after her mess, and walked back to her classroom. <br>\r\nShe saw Amy looking for the baby name note she meant to give her, but Samantha said nothing, instead focusing on continuing teaching, while constantly dealing with the increasing pain in her back, her swollen front, and her aching feet. <br>\r\nShe was constantly getting up and down from her desk to teach, her students continually watching her as she struggled to get up from her chair each time, her belly getting in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn, maybe Dylan's right. I should get a doctor soon.</i> She thought, her hand absentmindedly brushing her bulge lightly. <br>\r\nAfter a few moments of up and down teaching, there was a knock on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha turned to see...</span></div></div>",

Samantha stood there, shooting daggers at the busty 20-something gym teacher leading a joint-class session between Samantha's class and Dylan's class (who had gone home a few minutes earlier due to sickness that would several days later be revealed to male morning sickness), the mysterious coin still lying on her open palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt exactly 33 seconds, Samantha closed her first around her coin, and began the motion to put back in her pocket, while Brooke, the strawberry blonde busty gym teacher, couched the class in a particularly intense game of Capture The Flag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 34 and a half seconds, Brooke became nauseous. Her hand went to her bare, perfectly toned stomach, which was glistening with sweat. When this impromptu \"field day\" started, Brooke changed from her usual \"barely there, barely appropriate\" school attire, to her \"physical actives\" attire, which was just a pair of tight bicycle shorts, (which showed off her firm and shapely rear-end), and a white curve hugging belly shirt, with the words \"Let's Get Physical\" written on it in bright gold glitter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oohhhh\" Brooke moaned, suddenly awash in feelings of nausea. She bent over, hands on her stomach, panting deeply. <br>\r\n\"Ms. Edwards? Are you okay?\" One of the children from Samantha's 4th Grade class asked his Gym Teacher. <br>\r\n\"Yeah\" Brooke said, taking in deep breathes of air. \"Yeah, I think so, I just suddenly feel so nauseous. But, I think I'm going to be fine. Go back to playing, and watch your team's left side, they're going to - - - -\"  Brooke's hand suddenly went to her mouth at the speed of light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMMMMM!\" was all Brooke could say, before lightly pushing the young student aside and running down the field, hand over her mouth, tears in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran as she fast as she could possibly could. If she was running a marathon, her display of athleticism would have for sure placed her within the top four runners, but alas, this was a race against what would later turn out to be pregnancy-related nausea, and this was a race she was never going to win. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nURK! This sound never sounded so sweet to Samantha, who was on the sidelines, watching this scene play out. As she did, one of her hands, absentmindedly found it's way to rest of her swollen midsection, which, to Samantha's surprise, will turn out to be MUCH MORE than it appeared to be, but that story is for later. URK! That was the current story, happening at this exact moment! <br>\r\nURK! The sweet sound continued as Brooke stood in the middle of the field, bent over, head between her knees, puking out her lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EWWWWWWWWW! Ms. Edward's barfing!\" was the collective call of the combined 4th and 5th grade classes, as they all watched Brooke Edwards, the cruel gym teacher, empty the contents of her stomach onto the field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nURK! This was the finale refrain as Brooke finally finished her bought of sickness, catching her breath, wiping away the mess around the corners of her mouth, with the back of her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH NO! It got all over my brand new designer sneakers! This were $700!\" Brooke screamed at the top of her lungs, a wicked smile forming on the edges of Samantha's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This day has suddenly become ALOT better</i> Samantha thinks, stopping one of the children near her, trying to run away from the quote unquote \"girl germs\" on the field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go get the principal. I don't think Ms. Edwards is feeling very well. I think she needs to go lay down for a while\" Samantha tells the young student, who nods, and runs off to find the principal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Samantha slowly walked over to Brooke, (her swelling ankles, aching back, and swollen midsection making it harder for her to work than usual) she tried to hide her smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hopefully Brooke caught whatever the hell has been going on around here. She deserves it. </i> Samantha thinks to herself, putting a hand on Brooke's back, who was still bent over, catching her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay Brooke?\" Samantha asks, putting on her \"concerned\" face. <br>\r\n\"I think it's stopped. I don't know what the was all of a sudden. It was like I needed to puke my guts out from out of nowhere.\" Brooke says, standing back up.<br>\r\n\"Maybe it was something you ate?\" Samantha asked. <br>\r\n\"No. I don't eat any of that garbage they make here. I always bring a specially made meal everyday, designed to help me keep my amazing figure. I don't shovel two grey cheeseburgers in my mouth like you and Dylan did today.\" Brooke says with a bite in her words. <br>\r\nSamantha was taken back. Brooke saw that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh yeah, I saw you two pigging out on that disgusting cafeteria food. No wonder he got sick, and you - - - Well, let's just say, with you it explains some 'new' things\" she says with a catty smile, poking her finger at the slight sliver of exposed firm belly flesh that hugged Samantha's tighter sweater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha was about to slap the ever loving hell out Brooke, but was unable too as the school principal, Lisa Jacobs, in her mid-40s came onto the field, lead by the student that Samantha sent off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Edwards! I heard what happened! Are you okay?!\" Ms. Jacobs asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine..  BUT MY SHOES ARE NOT! THESE WERE DESIGNER! FROM NEW YORK! AND NOW THEY'RE COVERED IN PUKE!\" Brooke yelled, clearly more shaken by the loss of her designer shoes than her bizarre sudden bout of sickness. <br>\r\n\"Well, shoes or no shoes, do you need to go see the school nurse? Do you feel like you'll be able to continue with the rest of the class session?\" Lisa Jacobs asked, assessing the situation and her options. <br>\r\n\"I don't know. First I felt like puking my guts out, now I'm tired as all hell\" Brooke says, rubbing her eyes, trying to banish the tiredness away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's it. This class is over today. I'm sending these students to the library for the rest of the day, Brooke I'm sending you home. Don't argue with me! Not today! Dylan tried to power his way through the day, but was puking his guts out in the men's room. I'm sending you home. Hopefully whatever has affected both Dylan and yourself will clear up with some good bed rest. If you're feeling up to it, I want both of back here tomorrow. If not, stay home. <br>\r\nSamantha, I can trust you to take care of these kids at the library? We have some educational DVDS in there with some board games. Just kill time, and hopefully they learn something\" Lisa Jacobs says, asserting her authority. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Finally. That's all I wanted to do with these kids</i> Samantha thinks. <br>\r\n\"Sounds great to me Ms. Jacobs. I know some great videos they can watch. They'll learn and have fun\" Samantha says with a smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip Me</span> the thought comes racing back to her head at a million miles an hour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay kids, Ms. Peters is going to take you back inside to the library. You're going to watch some fun videos!\" The principal said with a smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Samantha dug through her pocket, and slowly pulled out her coin, she lead her class back towards the school, much to the disappointed groans of the classes, while Lisa Jacobs lead Brooke inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing through the doors back inside the school, the urge to flip the mysterious coin she bought days earlier, ate at her. <br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip Me Samantha!</span> the voice ordered her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ms Jacobs lead the class towards the library, with Samantha and her gaggle of 4th and 5th graders walking behind her, with poor Ms. Edwards dragging herself at the tail end, a small scuffle between a 4th and 5th grade boy broke out. The shoving match caused a chain reaction, with each student accidentally bumping into the one in front of them, like dominoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis lead to little Amy, Samantha's best student to bump into the back of her teacher, which in turn, sent Samantha's coin flying out of her hand. <br>\r\nWith a grace that she didn't know she had, (nor that her new swollen figure would typically allow) she burst forward with an outstretched hand and grabbed the coin in mid-air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it!\" Samantha said out loud to no one in particular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, little did Samantha know, the coin counted this as a flip, and echoed it's next command into her thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Look Samantha</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did. Her eyes fell upon </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the smell of burnt plastic disputed, Samantha turned to see that Ms. Lisa Jacobs, the single mid-40 something school principal, face had gone pale. <br>\r\nIn a motion that she had already seen twice today, Lisa's hand went over her stomach, and she let out a groan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhhhh\" was all the principal could say as she bent her head slightly down.<br>\r\n\"Oh no. Not again\" Samantha said aloud to herself, pretty confident  about what was going to happen next. <br>\r\nExactly six seconds later, Ms. Lisa Jacob's mouth went from her stomach to her mouth, and she took off running towards the large garbage cans they kept in the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nURK! The sound of the principal throwing up filled the hallway, followed immediately by the call of \"EWWWWWWWWW!\" from the collection of 4th and 5th grade students in the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the adults are getting sick!\" one student cried. <br>\r\n\"Are we going to get sick too? That would be cool! We could miss school!\" another student said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody's getting sick! Everyone into the library now! I'll be in shortly!\" Samantha said, putting her hand on her forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of the students followed her instructions, instead watching their school principal throw up into a trashcan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! She can barf!\" her heard someone say from the back of the line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething welled up deep inside of Samantha, a strange emotion she never felt before. It was a deep commanding emotion, stern yet caring. She channeled this to her voice, which itself would take on a tone she never used before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormal people would call this the \"Mom\" voice, but this was all new to Samantha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone listen to me right now. Get in that library right now, sit down, and wait quietly until I come back! If one person, ONE PERSON, misbehaves, so help me, I will personally drive your parents down here to punish you! Now MOVE IT!\" Samantha says, in the voice that only a mother would use when a child is in serious trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe use of this voice brought all of the students to stand straight up, and march, in complete silence into the library. These students had heard the tone of voice before, and they knew it meant business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha, this strange feeling suddenly disappearing deep inside her, walks over to the principal, who stood hunched over the trash can, trying to catch her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Samantha asks.<br>\r\n\"I think it's over. I mean, I still feel nauseous, but I don't think I'm in immediate danger of throwing up all over the place.\" Lisa said, between deep breathes. <br>\r\n\"Come on, I'll take you and Ms. Edwards to the school nurse.\" Samantha said, helping Lisa up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while, but she eventually got Ms. Brooke Edwards, the busty gym teacher, and Ms. Lisa Jacobs, the middle-aged principal, to the school nurse. <br>\r\n\"Oh no, not more!\" The school nurse said, looking over her new patents. <br>\r\n\"More?\" Samantha asked. How many sudden cases of violent nausea did she have today? <br>\r\n\"Yeah, this flu that's going around is really nasty. I was hoping it would die out, but apparently those signs that I hung up around the school, that said \"Wash You Hands to Fight The Flu!\" was just a waste of my time.\" She said with a sigh, putting the two women on the beds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you've seen this before?\" Samantha asked.<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. Nausea, tiredness. Tale tell signs of the flu.\" The school nurse says, sticking a thermometer into the mouths of the two \"flu\" suffers. <br>\r\n\"What about hunger?\" Samantha asks, hoping to finally get a confirmation of her self-diagnosis of her current \"illness\" she had been suffering from the past few days. <br>\r\n\"In some cases, patients can suffer from a loss of appetite, or in some cases, over appetite.\" The nurse says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That settles that</i> she thinks, absentmindedly poking a finger on the bulge in her midsection. <br>\r\n\"I can take it from here.\" The nurse tells Samantha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods, and heads back to the school library, feeling better than she ever had in the past few days. <br>\r\n<i>I knew it. It was just the flu. Nothing else. Nothing else.</i> she thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe entered the library to find both the 4th and 5th grade classes sitting quietly at tables, doodling on paper, drawing pictures, of just staring blankly.<br>\r\nSamantha let out a smirk. She had no idea what that commanding tone was, but she could get use to using it. It had results. <br>\r\n\"Alright classes, with Ms. Edwards getting sick, and Mr. Best going home for the day, we're going to watch some DVD's. Won't that be fun? Now I want everyone to take notes about what they learned from the video. Write your name, and which class your from in the upper right hand corner of the paper. Turn them in when the videos are done. The best papers will receive a special prize from myself and Mr. Best when he gets back. This is going to count towards your grade, so don't goof around!\" She says, her voice strong and commanding, as the tone from earlier makes a small resurgence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe inserted the DVD and pressed play, the music of a popular children's education show starting to blare through the library. The class was immediately<br>\r\ncaptivated by what was on the screen, only periodically breaking eye contact from the video to jot down some notes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small minor pain in her lower back caught Samantha off guard, and she let out a small groan. She placed a hand in the small of her back, giving it a rub. <br>\r\n\"Oh man, my back's killing me again.\" She complained. This was a common occurrence for her today, and frankly she was getting annoyed with it. <br>\r\nShe lowered herself into a chair, looking over the two classes she was put in charge of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemed to be moving slowly, each second that passed felt like an eternity, and yet Samantha sat there, doing her best to manage the two class rooms she had be burdened with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clock ticked by, second by second, minute by minute, until...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The shrill ringing of the bell signaling the end of the school day was music to Samantha's ears. <br>\r\nShe had no idea how long she was in the library, watching those kids, but it felt like an eternity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they all finished the video and their assignment that went with it, but there still time in the school day, so they moved into playing quiet board games or reading to kill the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime was eventually slain, the shrill ring of said school bell signaling the victory of the young students over the monster that was school, as they excitedly packed up their belongings and prepared to head home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh man, I'm glad that's finally over. When I offered to help Dylan with his class, I didn't actually think he'd take me up on the offer</i> Samantha says with a sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cleaned up the small mess the students had made in the library, grabbed the papers, and put back the DVDs onto the shelves. <br>\r\nBy the time she was done, her back with aching again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mighty groan, she put her hands into the small of her back to work on out the kink. Catching herself in the mirror, she was shocked by what she saw. <br>\r\nWith her bigger breasts and swollen stomach hanging out of her clothes, she looked radiant, positively glowing, almost.. motherly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>STOP IT SAMANTHA</i> she screamed in her head, trying to stop this train of thinking that had been running through her head recently. It was those damn pregnancy shows she watched. She was going to go home and kill her TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going on a diet first thing tomorrow!\" she said sighing and poking a finger at her firm stomach. <br>\r\nShe left the library, heading back to her classroom, where she continued the class room clean up, grabbed her things and prepared to leave for the day. <br>\r\n<i>We've got that half-day coming up in a few days </i> she thought. <i>I should treat myself to day out</i><br>\r\nThe half day was one of those state mandated tests, the one's that marked how well or how poorly the school was doing. It was just a huge waste of time,   time that could have been spent teaching them something useful, but Samantha didn't have to do much that day except for collect tests to be mailed off, and then get paid for the whole day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a win-win in her book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she grabbed her personal belongings and headed out to the teacher parking lot, she passed by the front office, where the nurses station was located. <br>\r\nShe paused for a moment, before deciding to check in on Ms. Edwards and Ms. Jacobs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she knocked on the door to check up on her co-workers, she was surprised to see the two beds empty. <br>\r\n\"Where did Brooke and Lisa go?\" Samantha inquired to the school nurse. <br>\r\n\"Home. About 45 minutes after you left they each threw up again. I was almost concerned until I brought them some small sandwiches from the cafeteria, and they devoured them nearly whole, even Brooke, who was complaining about calories and saturated fats, but she ate it all the same, well, ate two of them all the same\" the nurse explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet still they went home?\" Samantha asked, confused as they clearly sounded like they were feeling better. <br>\r\n\"Policy. Any teacher that pukes twice or more during school hours to sent home to rest, even if they're feeling better. The school avoids liability that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shrug, Samantha left the nurses office, and headed out to her car. Getting in, plopping her purse in the backseat, she started the car and drove back towards home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping at a red light, just like many of the red lights she stopped on her way to-and-from work, she grabbed her cellphone from her purse. <br>\r\n<i>I should really check on Nina</i> Samantha thought. She couldn't even begin to imagine what her friend was going through.<br>\r\nGoing from not-pregnant to 8-months pregnant instantly for no apparent reason was beyond strange to say the least. While Nina seemed to be alarmed at first, she seemed to accept her new expectant state well, despite she was now in her early 50's and very pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she never cared for children, she was concerned about the health of Nina and her new unborn child. Nina was one of her closest friends, and if something happened to her she would be devastated.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she contemplated looking dialing her friend, she looked out her driver side window to see a very sexy, very pregnant 22 year old brunette standing at a bus-stop in skin tight jeans and white shirt, that seemed to make every single curve on her body that much more pronounced. Her belly was massive and hanging out, the bright tan belly flesh visible under the way to small t-shirt that read \"I make this look good\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe certainly did, even if it was extremely inappropriate to be wearing something like that in her condition. She was rubbing her vast, taut pregnant belly with a smile on her face, striking a pose only a model could, her dark black sunglasses hiding her eyes, her hair blowing in the wind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she watched the drop-dead sexy pregnant woman rub her pregnant belly, Samantha absentmindedly removed a hand from the steering wheel and placed it on her own firm bulge. As she began to rub it, her eyes closed, becoming lost in a tide of emotions. Joy, excitement, a feeling of being whole, and dare she say, maternal feelings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was snapped back to reality by the blaring of the car horn behind her, demanding her to go as the light had changed to green. <br>\r\n\"Move it grandma! Some of us have places to be today!\" The jerk behind the wheel yelled at her. <br>\r\nShe looked over at the pregnant woman, who noticed her and smiled, and Samantha waved back before driving on her way. <br>\r\n\"Tomorrow I'm not only going on diet, I'm going to see a shrink\" she said to herself outloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got farther away from the school and closer to home, she thought about dropping by to check on Nina.<br>\r\nYet, all of the events of the past twenty-four hours began to weight heavily on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided...</span></div></div>",

It's not like she could undo the mysterious pregnancy that seemed to befall her 50-something friend. Beside, Nina seemed to be enjoying her pregnancy, and the doctor said it was a healthy pregnancy, so there was nothing to worry about right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled her car into her driveway, got out of her car, opened her door, and threw herself onto the couch. <br>\r\nIt felt great to lie down. Her ankles were swollen and hurting, her back ached like she couldn't believe. <br>\r\nShe grabbed one of the extra pillows on put it on her back. It was like floating on a cloud. All the pain and pressure on the small of her back was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's better.\" She aloud to herself. She looked down at the small bulge that had taken up residency on her midsection. It was round, very round, and very, very firm. Slowly she lifted up her sweater to take a look at it. It was like a little dome, round and smooth. Looking at her middle while laying down it's small roundness caused a little bit of her block to be viewed. She ran her hands over it, exploring it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This has to be swelling and weight gain, but it feel different, it feels like - - - It almost feels like Nina's belly - - \" Samantha said to herself, realizing what she was saying. <br>\r\n<i>Could I be pregnant? </i> she thought. <i>No. That's impossible. I haven't been with anyone in years, and my doctor said my childbearing days were behind me. But this, this can't just be - - - It's just like Nina. I mean Nina wasn't pregnant until last night. I mean could I - - - </i> she tried to push the thought to be the back of her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samantha, stop scaring yourself. You can't be pregnant. Your doctor said you couldn't get pregnant even if you tried. You're too old. You're too old and nobody wants you.\" Samantha said getting up off the couch and heading up the stairs into her bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe disrobed, dressing down into her bra and underwear. ignoring her reflection in the mirror, and crawled into bed, turning out the light.<br>\r\nShe was still going to bed in the early evening, the clock barely reading six o'clock. She didn't care. She wanted to sleep everything away. Her mysterious swelling, her friend Nina, the illnesses of her co-workers. All of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laid out her back for a few moments before her back began to bother her again, so she switched to her side, burying her face deep into her pillow, waiting for sleep to overtake her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dreamt a dreamless sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was awakened not by an alarm clock, but a light fluttering in her belly. It was like a butterfly was trapped inside her. She awoke with a gasp, flinging the covers of her bed aside, turning on the light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nearly screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly was bigger. MUCH bigger than yesterday. It was like someone shoved some kind of overinflated ball into stomach. She put a hand on it, and it was very firm, just as it was yesterday, but so much bigger. It was causing her plain panties to dig uncomfortably into her new large mound, the elastic<br>\r\nand fabric stretching across her new expansive middle, giving it a very round shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts were bigger, like oversized cantaloupes, spilling out of her bra uncomfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she felt it again, a light fluttering from inside her. She sat motionless, her hands cupping her belly, waiting to feel whatever it was she was feeling again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited for a few moments but no more \"fluttering\" could be felt. Eventually she lifted herself off the bed. She felt like she weighed a ton. Standing up, she placed her hands on her new enlarged middle and explored it, mapping every curve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked, (more like waddled) over to the mirror, and inspected herself for every angle she could she. She belly jutted forth like she smuggling some kind of ball under her skin, firm and round. Her skin was shiny, and she thought she could see little red lines forming on the sides of her skin and belly.<br>\r\nShe placed her hands into the small of her back, and pushed her stomach forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It looks pregnant. I look pregnant. But it's impossible! I haven't been with anyone in years! I'm too old! I hate children! I can't become a mother!</i> she screams inside her head, looking for explanations and reasons to deny what was quickly becoming obvious to anyone who saw her. <br>\r\n\"I'm not pregnant! I'm not pregnant!\" she keeps telling herself, even as she ran a hand over her new round middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was on the verge of tears as she walked into her bathroom, got cleaned up, and came back to get dressed. <br>\r\n<i>I'm not pregnant. I can't be. It's not possible. </i> she thought, as she tried to cram her into regular clothes. <br>\r\nShe was going with a button up blue blouse, that was, if it would fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could button the middle just fine, but she it very difficult to button the top and bottom of the blouse. The bottom buttons would not come together over her new larger belly, while the top would not button due to her new \"assets\". After struggling for several moments, she decided to leave her top buttons undone, showing off some very firm and very ample cleavage, that would put most 20-something supermodels to shame.<br>\r\n<i>Even Brooke would be impressed with theses \"things\"</i> Samantha thought to herself, cupping her sensitive ample bosom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe struggled with the bottom buttons for a longer while, and finally managed to get them to hold together, but just barely. The buttons were under some serious strain, small patches of her tight belly poking through the gaps between the buttons. <br>\r\nAnd then there was the tiny problem that the blouse decided to not fully cover her new round orb, only stopping halfway down her belly, the rest exposed for the world to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pants barely fit, and hugged the underside of her belly snugly, her belly spilling out over top. It was not comfortable.<br>\r\n\"Forget the diet, I'm going to the doctor first thing tomorrow\" she said, disgusted by what she in the mirror. She turned away from her expectant looking reflection, heading downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stairs took her longer than usual, her sudden new weight gain, as she called it, left her breathless as she reached the bottom steps. She put her hands into the small her back, causing her belly to be pushed forward again, and increasing the strain on the buttons of her blouse. <br>\r\n\"I'm so hungry, but I'm so big. I really shouldn't eat\" she said to herself in a debate she ended up losing. <br>\r\nDigging through her pantry, she poured herself two large bowls of cereal with an apple she found in her vegetable crisper. She woofed down the two bowls with a ferocity she didn't know she had, letting out a small belch after she was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes for a moment, and her hands came to rest on top of her belly. She was alone and scared. She had no idea what was happening to her body, and no one there to calm her down. She felt like screaming, like running out into the middle of the street, ripping off all her clothes and asking the world about what was happening to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't of course. She instead cleaned up mess, and got ready to get to work. She had a job to do, and she was going to do it. <br>\r\nMaybe with a little luck, she could get some help from someone she worked with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe longed to see Dylan. Dylan knew everything, he could tell her what was wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled out to her car, and tried to get in, finding her seat far to close for her to fit inside. She moved the seat back from where she kept it for years, and got in the car. Her breasts and belly seemed to rest onto of each other, her clothes straining as she drove the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, she finally pulled into the teacher parking lot of Twin Hills Elementary. <br>\r\nShe pulled into her parking spot, parked, and heaved herself out of her car. <br>\r\n\"Either Brooke parked in her own parking space today, or she's still sick\" Samantha said to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fluttering from inside her started again, her hands instantly going to her belly with an OMPH! She held her belly, waiting to feel it again, to try and get a grasp on what it was, but nothing happened. It was gone as quickly as it started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just gas\" she said to herself, refusing to accept the obvious truth. <br>\r\nShe opened the door to the school, and entered the teacher's lounge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was there that...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The lights were on but nobody was home; so to speak. <br>\r\nAs Samantha entered the teacher's lounge, it quickly became apparent that Dylan Best, 5th Grade Teacher, Brooke Edwards, Gym Teacher, and Lisa Jacobs the principal were not in today. Instead, she saw the regular staff hanging out in the teacher's lounge, drinking coffee, exchanging small talk, and just going about there day-to-day business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFully entering the teacher's lounge, she felt everyone's eyes fall upon her. The women looked upon her with a smile on their face, while some of the men couldn't take their eyes of her ample bosom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samantha... Is there something you would like to share with us?\" One of her younger female co-workers asked her, her eyes looking at her round middle peeking out behind the strained buttons of her blouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. It's just swelling. I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow\" Samantha said, feeling very sensitive about her expansive middle. <br>\r\n\"Sammy, I don't think that's swelling. If your embarrassed about being pregnant at your age, don't be. I think it's great! I've seen the way you are with your students, I think you're going to be a great mom!\" Her female co-worker came over, and rested her hands on the side of Samantha's belly, with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n\"So are you having a boy or a girl? What do you want? I know most women just want a healthy baby, but come on you have to have a preference. What's it like being pregnant at your age? How did you keep this secret from us for so long? How do you feel? Are you going to tell your student today? Do you have any names picked out yet? When my sister was pregnant she - - - \" <br>\r\n\"GET YOUR HAND OFF ME! I'M NOT PREGNANT! NOW LEAVE ME ALONE!\" Samantha shouted at the top of her lungs, pushing the hands  of her female co-worker off her belly. <br>\r\n\"Samantha, I'm sorry. I just assumed\" The female co-worker began. <br>\r\n\"Well don't. Now where is everyone else?\" Samantha asked, her mood for the rest of the day soured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dylan's out sick.\" A male co-worker said, his eyes casually drifting over to the amazing cleavage of Samantha.  <br>\r\n\"Still?\" Samantha asks, sitting down awkwardly, her belly making it difficult. <br>\r\nShe had that fluttering feeling inside her again, but she ignored it the best she could. <br>\r\n<i>I'm not pregnant</i> Samantha chanted inside her head, trying to ignore the obvious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, guy called in this morning. Said he was puking his guts out this morning, and that his chest was sore. Probably has some kind of infection\" One of her male co-workers said, taking another bite of his donut and drinking his coffee. <br>\r\n\"Lisa's out sick as well, said she was puking her guts out this morning as well, and she didn't get a lot of sleep last night. She said she had odd dreams\" Another co-worker informed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Ms. Edwards?\" Samantha asked, worried if the trifecta from yesterday would be complete. <br>\r\n\"She's not here yet. She probably won't be. You know Ms. Princess, she only works when she feels like it. She probably doesn't feel like it today.\" Another co-worker said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That was true</i> Samantha said, her hands cupping her heavy middle under the table, out of eyesight. <i>Brooke doesn't work when she doesn't feel like it</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rung signaling the beginning of the school day, and Samantha, with great effort, got up from the chair, and walked to her classroom. <br>\r\nBy the time she got there, her ankles were already swelling and her arching back was sore. <br>\r\nShe placed her hands on her back giving it a rub, and then opened the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of her students stared at her as she walked, more like waddled, into the classroom, with her hands pressed into her back, which caused her belly to stick out even further. <br>\r\n\"Good morning class\" she said as she walked to the front of the class.<br>\r\n\"Good morning Ms. Peters\" the class said in unison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone take out your homework from last night and put it on your desk please. I'll be shortly to pick it up\" She said standing at the front of the class, both hands pressed into her arching back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of her students raised a hand. \"Ms. Peters?\" The student asked. <br>\r\n\"Yes?\" She said.<br>\r\n\"How come you're having a baby? I thought old people couldn't have babies.\" The student said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of emotions once again washed over Samantha. Anger, sadness, happiness, she felt the entire emotional spectrum at once. After a few moments, she collected herself and answered the young students questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said yesterday, I'm not having a baby. I'm just sick\" she said firmly. <br>\r\n\"But my mom is pregnant, and your belly looks just like hers!\" the young student said. <br>\r\nSamantha  looks down at her round middle, feeling something stirring inside her. <br>\r\nShe placed her hand on the side of her tight belly, as her class stared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was becoming harder and harder for Samantha to deny what some many other people had been pointing out to her: She was pregnant. <br>\r\nSamantha tried to push back against the obvious, going through elaborate mental gymnastics to find some reason, any reason, that she wasn't a single 55-year old divorcee who was now mysteriously pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm happy that your mom is having a baby, but I'm not. Now enough talking about this. Turn in your homework and take out your books please\" she said.<br>\r\nAmy, the student she caught yesterday coming up with a list of baby names for Samantha's \"Baby\" raised her hand.<br>\r\n\"Yes Amy?\" Samantha asked.<br>\r\n\"Can we pretend you're having a baby?\" Amy said with a smile.<br>\r\nSamantha let out a sigh, her hands absentmindedly rubbing her belly. <br>\r\n\"Fine. But that's only in the classroom okay? And when I've said pretend time is over, it's over okay?\" Samantha says. <br>\r\n\"Now, let's stop talking about this and learn something\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class continued on as normal could be, except for the increasing pain in Samantha's feet and and back, her increasing need to go to the bathroom, and the mysterious stirring inside her. Lunchtime came and went, Samantha once again finding it impossible not to stuff her face with two helping of turkey, mash potatoes, gravy, and macaroni and cheese. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day progressed, the stirring inside her intensified, Samantha finding herself rubbing her middle to get it to stop.<br>\r\nAs the final bell of the day rung, Samantha let out a relived sigh, finally happy to get this day over with. <br>\r\nHer students were none stop through the day asking to feel her belly, playing their \"Miss Peter's Pretend Baby\" game as she called it. <br>\r\nThey would talk to her belly, put their ear against it, poke it with their fingers, all while saying things like \"Hello Ms. Peter's Baby! How are you in there? Treat her good, Ms. Peter's is really old!\" It annoyed her to no end, but she let them have their little moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rest of the students left, she walked around the room, picking up the mess, her back still killing her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she bent down awkwardly to pick something up, she felt it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUMP. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a fluttering this time, and it certainly wasn't gas. It was a firm solid THUMP from inside her, feeling like her stomach was dropping out in a roller coaster. Her hands instantly went to her belly, and she felt it again, stronger than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUMP. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a kick. A baby's kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHER baby's kick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind went blank as she stood there, feeling her unborn child kick firmly inside of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... is.. impossible\" she said to herself, moving her hands along her belly, feeling the kicks. <br>\r\n\"I can't be pregnant. I haven't been with anyone in two years. My doctor said my child bearing days were over. This can't possibly be what I think it is\" she said as explored what she was now sure was her pregnant belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUMP. Another firm kick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stood in her empty class room, trying to rationalize what was happening, she made a decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could either accept the facts and make a doctor's appointment, or she could try to continue to deny the truth. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

RING. RING. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe listened, a phone in one of her hands, her other hand resting on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pregnant belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! Come on! Pick up! Pick up!\" She shouted nearly at the top of her lungs, the truth of her \"condition\" quickly becoming more and more apparent to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRING. RING. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Twin Hills Medical Center. Is this an emergency? If so, please hang up and dial 911 immediately. \" The nurse on the other end said plainly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is this an emergency? It sure as hell feels like one. 55, single, and mysteriously pregnant. </i> Samantha thought to herself, looking down at her midsection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" The person on the other end said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yes. Hi\". Samantha said hesitantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I should hang up. This is ridiculous. There's no possible way I could be pregnant. But still</i> she thought, moving her hand across her midsection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I help you?\" The nurse stated in an annoyed tone. Clearly this call wasn't proceeding as quickly as they had hoped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to make an appointment with Dr. Kristen Harper please, as quickly as possible, like now if possible\" Samantha said as she felt another sharp THUMP from inside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Harper has gone home for the day. I can check to see if she has anything for tomorrow\" The nurse said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FIRST THING TOMORROW.\" Samantha said, her voice somewhat demanding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn annoyed grunt from the other end of the phone, as Samantha sat down at her desk with great difficulty.<br>\r\nShe rested a hand on top of her mound, drumming her fingers lightly as she waited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>i should have done this two days ago. </i> She thought to herself. <i>What am I going to do IF I am pregnant? I hate kids. I never wanted kids. I'm 55 and single. This is a nightmare.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" The nurse on the other end of the phone said.<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Samantha replied. <br>\r\n\"I have an appointment tomorrow when she first comes in at 9.\" <br>\r\n\"That would be perfect\" Samantha thought. <br>\r\n\"Who is the appointment for?\" The nurse asked.<br>\r\n\"Samantha Peters. I'm a regular patient of hers.\" Samantha replies. <br>\r\n\"And what is the appointment about? I need to put it on your chart and her morning notes\" The nurse asked. <br>\r\n\"Uh\" Samantha said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Do I lie? She's my doctor. I should tell the truth, but who would ever believe me? But at this rate I don't think it's going to matter. I think it's going to be obvious to anyone who sees me</i>  Samantha thought to herself looking at how her belly was sitting in her lap, the strain on her blouse visible as firm belly flesh poked through between the buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samantha, what is the appointment about?\" The nurse asked. <br>\r\n\"I think...\" She said slowly.<br>\r\n<i>This is it Samantha. Say the words. Stop ignoring the obvious</i> She thought to herself<br>\r\n\"I think I'm pregnant\" She said, the words, once spoking feeling like a great weight lifted off her shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tale-tell click and clack of keys on a keyboard could be heard from the other end of the phone, followed by a pause. <br>\r\n\"Ma'am is this a prank call?\" The nurse said suddenly very annoyed. <br>\r\n\"No.\" Samantha said, knowing what was coming next.<br>\r\n\"Ma'am according to our files, your 55, I find it highly doubtful that you're pregnant\" The nurse said. <br>\r\n\"Please, I'm very very sure I'm pregnant. Could you just please schedule the appointment?\" Samantha said. <br>\r\n\"Fine. She'll see your first thing tomorrow morning.\" The nurse said before hanging up the phone with a click. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha put the phone down and placed her hands on the side of her belly. <br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that's that. Kid, I don't know if you're actually in there or I'm just going crazy, but we'll find out tomorrow.\" Samantha said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she didn't receive a reply she sighed. <br>\r\n\"Samantha, you're talking to your fatness. You've gone crazy.\" She said to herself, heaving herself out of her chair and gathering up her belongings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled out towards her car, moved the seat back, got in and drove off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she traveled the familiar path towards home, her mind once again thought back to her friend Nina. <br>\r\n<i>I should really check up on her. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she sat at the red light, Samantha decided that </span></div></div>",

Just a quick visit. </i> Samantha thought, turning on her blinker and making the turn towards Nina's and Chris' house. <br>\r\nIt took her a few moments, but she finally pulled into the driveway, and as she did she noticed that Chris's bright red new sports car he just bought was missing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, in it's place was a bright blue mini-van, brand new, a pink ribbon still tied to the grill. It did not take long for Samantha to guess what happened. <br>\r\n\"Chris loved that sports car. He considered it a gift to himself as an end of parenthood\" Samantha said looking at the mini-van. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw herself in the reflection of the car's still \"show room floor\" clean windows. She turned to see her profile, and it was obvious she was pregnant. <br>\r\n\"If I walk to the house like this, I think Nina will have a bigger heart-attack than Chris\" she said, putting her hand on her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked back to her car and opened the trunk. She always kept an oversized winter coat in her trunk for cold weather emergencies or snow, this seemed like a perfect time to use it.  She put it on, buttoned it up, and put her purse in front of her. Checking her reflection in side-view mirror, the coat did an admirable job of hiding what was obviously her pregnant belly. Sure her midsection looked a little bigger under the coat, but she could probably pass it off without raising too many questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked back to the house, and knocked on the door. <br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, heavy, almost angry sounding foot steps approached the door. <br>\r\n\"I'm getting the door Nina! Just like I'm getting to do everything around here!\" It was Chris's voice. He was not a happy camper. <br>\r\n\"Don't give me that excuse! I saw you get up for ice cream, peanut butter, and apples, I'm sure you could get up to answer the door!\" He was shouting back at Nina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened with a mighty force, revealing a haggard looking Chris standing at the doorway. <br>\r\n\"What?!\" Chris yelled, oblivious to Samantha's existence. <br>\r\n\"Hi Chris\" Samantha said sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This was a mistake coming here</i> Samantha thought instantly looking at Chris.<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Sam. How you doing?\" Chris asked. <br>\r\n<i>Oh just peachy.I'm probably pregnant at 55 and on my own. Oh and did I mention I hate kids?</i> She thought to herself. <br>\r\n\"Just fine\" she lied. <br>\r\n\"Well that's good. We were worried about you after a few days ago\" Chris said. <br>\r\n\"I was more worried about Nina. How's she doing?\" Samantha asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Bad Question</i> Samantha asked. <br>\r\n\"She on the couch. Why don't you see for yourself.\" Chris was clearly not happy about this situation.<br>\r\nSamantha entered the house, and made her way to the living room, where she hear the TV blaring loudly. <br>\r\nAs she turned the corner, she saw her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked like a beached whale in sweatpants and a bikini top. Nina was laying on the couch with a pillow on her back, slurping down a huge bowl of ice cream, staring blankly at the TV. She was wearing grey sweat pants that hung low around her massively pregnant belly, which looked even bigger than Samantha remembered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Probably a mixture of laying down and pigging out for the past few days</i> Samantha thought to herself, surveying the carnage. Junk food containers littered the room, along with a stack of what appeared to be brand new pregnancy books, (mostly dealing with pregnancy at an older age), her laptop, which had a recent photo of Nina on it, doing the classic pregnancy pose on it as her background. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stack of movies were next to her, along with the remotes, and some half-written letters stuffed with more photos of Nina's current pregnancy. <br>\r\nShe was wearing a blue bikini top that did nothing to conceal the massive pregnant belly of her over 50 year old friend, her belly shining in the light. She had a dark line going from the top of her belly to the bottom through her popped out belly button vertically, and the sides of her belly were covered in bright red stretch marks.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer skin was tight like a drum, the movements of Nina's unborn daughter visible under the skin. <br>\r\n\"Samantha! You came to visit us!\" Nina said, putting down the bowl of ice cream, and resting her hands on her massive 8 month pregnant belly for emphasis on the word \"us\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Nina, how are you doing?\" Samantha asked, her eyes not leaving Nina's massively round pregnant belly. <br>\r\n\"Oh we're doing fine!\" Nina said with a smile, giving her belly a pat. <br>\r\n\"Well, one of us is\" Chris said loudly, sitting down in his chair across from his very pregnant wife, who has taken up all the room on the sofa. <br>\r\n\"Oh Chris, would you stop?\" Nina said, rolling her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha was at a loss for words. Her friend Nina was taken to her new sudden pregnancy quite well despite being close to the same age as Samantha. She looked happy, as she watched TV her hands resting on her massive pregnant orb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how are you doing Samantha?\" Nina asked with a smile. <br>\r\nNina seemed more youthful, radiant, even if the bikini she was wearing showed too much skin that told a different story. Her greying hair was up in a pony tail, and it looked healthier too. Her breasts that were once sagging, were now much more firm and bigger. She was glowing, as they say.<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. Saw the new car out there. Nice mini-van\" Samantha said. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, can't drive out new baby around in a sports car. Not safe, so I had Chris trade it in for a mini-van.\" Nina said.<br>\r\n\"Which was great, because we traded in the old mini-van for a sports-car for us because we done with children, but whoops! Now we had to trade the sports car back in for a more expensive mini-van. But hey, at least they put a pink ribbon on the grill right?\" Chris says with a mean tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samantha just ignore him. Have a seat\" Nina says gesturing to an empty chair in the living room.<br>\r\nSamantha sat, hoping her secret wouldn't be exposed when she sat.<br>\r\n\"You look great Nina\" Samantha lied to her friend. She looked like a whale.<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I feel great. I missed being pregnant. I forget how great it made me feel\" Nina says, rubbing her pregnant middle. <br>\r\n\"Glad you feel great Nina. Because that's how every pregnant 50-something should feel. Not panic or anything\" Chris says sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is your problem Chris?\" Nina said, resting her hands on top of her bare stomach. <br>\r\n\"That's my problem Nina!\" Chris said angrily pointing at Nina's pregnant belly. <br>\r\n\"I get a call in the middle of the night telling me that my pregnant wife is fine, and next thing I know you're showing up waddling with a massive pregnant belly. You give me this long complicated story about how \"you just grew pregnant\" that I'm just supposed to believe? Women don't \"grow\" pregnant Nina!\"<br>\r\n\"What do you want me to say Chris?\" Nina says yelling at her husband. <br>\r\n\"I want to admit that this is some kind of hoax! Some kind of sick elaborate prank you've played on me ever since I made you get your tubes tied.\" Chris shouts at his wife.<br>\r\n\"Oh don't you dare bring up this again. You know for a fact that this!\" Nina says, pointing at her massively pregnant belly \"Isn't a hoax! You've felt our daughter in there! This morning I put your hand of my belly, and you felt OUR daughter kicking around!\" <br>\r\n\"That's not my kid!\" Chris shouts at her<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare say that again!\" Nina gets up from her laying position, standing up by jutting her belly forward, and bracing herself against the furniture.  <br>\r\n\"Why shouldn't I? It's been a while since you and I have been together!\" Chris is practically hurling his words at Nina like daggers. <br>\r\n\"Does that matter?! I named her Miracle for a reason Chris. She's a miracle! A baby given to us to change our lives!\" Nina says, rubbing her pregnant belly with her hands. <br>\r\n\"Change your life! Not mine! I was done having kids! Our kids were out of the house, getting ready to start there own lives, and now look at you! \"The baby's kicking, my back hurts, my feet are killing me, I'm hungry again\" Chris says in a mocking tone. <br>\r\n\"Nina, I love you more than anything, but we're supposed to be living our lives right now. We're getting close to retiring. We talked about working less hours and getting out more, seeing the world! Doing everything we always wanted to do before we had kids!\" Chris continues.<br>\r\n\"Nina, I don't want this new baby your having. I think you should give it up for adoption. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not giving up this baby Chris! She's our miracle!\" Nina says, wrapping her hands around her midsection.<br>\r\n\"She's your miracle! Nina, I'm done with kids! No more ballet practices, parent-teacher conferences, dirty diapers, midnight feedings, no more temper tantrums in crowded stores\" Chris continues, listening off the reasons. <br>\r\n\"Chris, you said you always wanted a little girl!\" Nina responds back. <br>\r\n\"Yeah, years ago. But we're older now, the boys are gone. Did you even think about what to tell the boys? They'll be here visiting in a few days. They're going to be here a whole month! How are we going to explain this to them?\" Chris asks. <br>\r\n\"I -uh. I don' know.\" Nina says looking down at her pregnant belly. <br>\r\n\"And did you think about the costs? We gave away all your old pregnancy and baby stuff! We're going to have to rebuy all new things! There's childcare, doctor's visits, all the toys she's going to want, school fees, college! Nina, we can't afford this baby! We're going to work until we're 90 at this rate!\" Chris is practically shouting at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I KNOW CHRIS! I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT ALL OF THIS! ALL I KNOW IS I'M HAVING THIS BABY! I'M HAVING OUR BABY! I just want some support right now! I'm going through a lot right now! I mean, I wasn't pregnant last week and now look at me! I'm old and pregnant Chris! I just wish you could understand what I'm going through!\" Nina shouts tears in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha shifted uncomfortable in her seat. She should really leave, but she wanted to be here for her friend. </span></div></div>",

We'll probably argue some more.\" Chris said. \"But I just need you to see things from my point of view\" he finished. <br>\r\n\"And I just wish you could just know what I'm going through and realize we need this baby!\" Nina says softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a moment that I'm sure the universe deemed hilarious, due to Samantha's coin flip, Nina was going to get her wish, and then some, because at that exact moment after Nina said the exact words \"And I just wish you could just know what I'm going through and realize we need this baby!\", Chris's hand went over his mouth as he experience a sudden and violent bout of nausea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran out of the room to the downstairs bathroom, where he loudly began to puke violently.<br>\r\n\"Just like him to fake getting sick to get out of argument. He's done it before.\" Nina says, gently plopping her massively pregnant form back onto the couch. <br>\r\nWhile it was true that on precisely one occasion Chris faked an illness to end an argument with his wife, (an argument that was never actually resolved and remains unresolved to this very day), this bout of illness was not fake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite the opposite in fact, as Chris's nausea was actually caused by the fact that he was now pregnant with triplets. Chris's pregnancy would be a huge shock for his wife, and even more so for Chris himself, but that story is a short ways down the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor right now, Samantha just sat in shock as she just watched what was a very uncomfortable argument between her best friend and her husband. <br>\r\n\"Is he going to be okay?\" Samantha asked, oblivious to the truth of the situation. <br>\r\n\"Oh he'll be fine.\" Nina said, assuming her relaxing position on the couch, her pregnant belly sticking high into the air. <br>\r\n\"You don't think he's going to leave do you?\" Samantha asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't be ridiculous\" Nina said with a scoff, her hands resting on her pregnant belly. <br>\r\n\"I know he said a lot of things I didn't want to hear, but in the end he'll stay.\"<br>\r\n\"Are you so sure of that?\" Samantha said. <br>\r\n\"Of course. He's just having a man tantrum that all his plans for the future have been changed because of our little Miracle\" Nina said, rubbing her pregnant belly. <br>\r\n\"So, you're still sticking with calling her Miracle?\" Samantha asked trying to change the subject.<br>\r\n\"Of course. She's our miracle! Our baby from nowhere.. but\" Nina said, her voice trailing off. <br>\r\n\"But what?\" Samantha asked. <br>\r\n\"I feel bad.\" Nina asked. <br>\r\n\"For naming your only daughter what sounds like should belong to woman who takes her clothes off for money while men hoot at her on the stage?\" Samantha said with a catty tone. She was loving this.<br>\r\n\"Oh ha-ha. Pick on the old pregnant woman. Very funny. No. I feel bad for Miracle well, she won't have anybody to play with her own age.\" Nina said, looking at her belly. <br>\r\n\"What do you mean, when she gets to school age, she'll make lots of friends\" Samantha says. <br>\r\n\"Not if she's anything like my boys she won't. I just don't want her to be lonely. I kind of wish she could have some more siblings to play with\" Nina said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Nina know, Miracle would have several siblings to play with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, if having a kid at your age is crazy, I don't want to know what having another one is when you're older\" Samantha said, <br>\r\n\"I'm mean not now. I meant I just hoped she could have come sooner when some of the boys were younger that's all. I just want to her have a brother or sister her own age that should could always have by her side, you know?\" Nina said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Miracle would in fact have two sisters and a brother to play with as she got older, thanks to her father who was currently working on them, unbeknownst to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Nina. You know I don't really like children. All this is foreign to me.\" Samantha says, trying to ignore what she was almost 100% sure was her unborn son or daughter inside of her. <br>\r\n\"If you had children you wouldn't hate children. Trust me on that\" Nina says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud flushing sound from the bathroom signaled the return of Chris who stood at the door rubbing his (for now) flat stomach. <br>\r\n\"You alright honey?\" Nina asked, looking at her husband over her massive pregnant belly.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just felt really sick all of sudden. Don't know why\". Chris said. <br>\r\n\"That's been going around the school where I work. Probably a bug or something\". Samantha said looking at Chris. <br>\r\n\"Yeah probably.\" Chris said sitting down back at his chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm hungry again\" Nina said, patting her belly again. <br>\r\n\"You know, oddly enough I'm starving.\" Chris said, unaware of what was happening to him. <br>\r\n\"You hungry Samantha?\" Nina says looking over at her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>{I am pretty hungry</i> Samantha thought to herself.<i>But you could cut the tension in here with a spork. I should probably leave</i><br>\r\n\"I am hungry, but I should really go.\" Samantha says, making a move to get up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't be like that! Stay for dinner! We're having..\" Nina looks over at her husband. <br>\r\n\"Well, I was going to make something with Chicken, but you know, I have the most bizarre craving for pizza\" Chris said. <br>\r\n\"Oh Pizza sounds so good right now! I haven't had it in forever!\" Nina says, lightly tapping her hands on belly like a drum excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Pizza does sound fantastic right now</i> Samantha thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" Samantha said hestantly. <br>\r\n\"Oh come on Sam. Stay have some Pizza with us. We'll get it delivered, we'll watch some of these movies I had Chris pick up for me. It'll be great, we'll all hang out just the three of us. I mean, we won't be able to do it once little Miracle arrives\" Nina says with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha weighed her options. </span></div></div>",

Dinner and movie sounds great.\" Samantha said, Nina beaming with happiness. <br>\r\n\"Fantastic! Chris, would you be so kind to order the pizzas?\" Nina said, looking over at her husband, who sat in his chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. What does everyone want on the pizza?\" Chris asked. <br>\r\n\"Pizzas. Plural. This little one and I could finish off an entire large pizza by ourselves.\" Nina said rubbing her pregnant belly with her hand, with a smile on her face. <br>\r\n\"Okay, how many pizzas should I order?\" Chris asked, picking up the phone. <br>\r\n\"3?\" Nina asked looking over at her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha thought for a moment before a well placed THUMP inside her gave her an answer. <br>\r\n\"Four.\" Samantha said, trying desperately not to place her hands on her own enlarged middle as her friend Nina was doing. <br>\r\n<i>If I really am pregnant, this little brat inside me is trying to make me fat. If I'm not, then I have to have some kind of parasite or something</i> Samantha thought to herself. There was some part inside her that was fighting off the very obvious truth that she was pregnant, because facing that truth would put her in a position she didn't want to be in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I better make it five. Just in case. I'm starving.\" Chris said. Samantha noticed that he had placed a hand on his flat stomach, which was unusual. <br>\r\nChris finished placing the order, and then sat back down after placing the DVD inside the player. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was one of the generic romantic-comedies that the movie industry seemed to make every year. This one was called \"40 Years 40 Weeks\"  which Samantha had never heard of before. It was about a single 40 year old business woman who becomes pregnant after a one-night stand with a much younger co-worker. It was cookie-cutter plot; busy business woman meets attractive new co-worker at an office party, has a one night stand, and gets pregnant, and the two decide to remain friends, but slowly fall in love, and eventually end up together after overcoming great odds and make a happy little family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway through the movie, (when the business woman, now half-way through her pregnancy and started realizing she was falling in love with her younger co-worker) the pizzas arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris got up from his spot, payed for the food, and placed the food down on the coffee table. Everyone grabbed slices of pizza and dug into the food with such ferocity, it looked like something from a nature special where the pack of predators ripped apart their prey as fast as they could. <br>\r\nChris, who had not been feeling well earlier, ate with extra ferocity, nearly finishing off a whole pizza by himself. Nina on the other hand, did finish off a whole pizza by herself, while Samantha ate more than her fair share of the hot greasy meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the movie came to an end, with the very pregnant business woman going into labor after getting the big account for her company, and getting proposed to by her younger co-worker, all that remained of the food was a pizza and a third. Just before the credits rolled, the business woman was celebrating the first birthday of her child with her husband, when the camera pulled back to reveal that she was pregnant again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what a cute movie!\" Nina said, resting her hands on top of massive belly. \"It was okay. I mean, it had some funny moments, but I've seen this same story a million times\" Chris said, giving his review of the film. <br>\r\n\"What did you think Sam?\" Nina asked her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I really liked it.  Maybe there's hope for me and Dylan</i> Samantha thought. She was found of Dylan, but she was always afraid about the age difference between them would \"make it weird\" as the younger generation put it. <br>\r\n<i>But come on Sam, look at you. Your 55 and getting older, parts of you and wrinkled and sagging, and you might be pregnant. You're hopeless</i> her negative thoughts came back to her again. <br>\r\n\"It was okay. I wasn't crazy about the pregnancy angle to the film, but I laughed a few times\" Samantha lied. <br>\r\nMaybe it was the fact that she might be pregnant, the idea of a woman that old having a baby spoke to her. Awakened something deep inside her that she thought she buried deep down a long time ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Samantha, your always so negative about everything that has to do with pregnancy, babies and kids. Lighten up. They're not so bad. Beside, you ate like a pregnant woman tonight.\" Nina teased.<br>\r\nSamantha tried to fight the urge to place her hands on her belly which was hidden under her large coat. <br>\r\n<i>No one can know. If I am pregnant, I don't want anyone to find out. Not until after the brat is born and I can give them up for adoption</i> she thought to herself exploring her options. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, what other options were there? Have the kid and raise it? She hated kid. She couldn't be a mom.<br>\r\nCould she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, should I put on the next movie?\" Chris asked. <br>\r\nNina looked over at Samantha, who just shrugged. <br>\r\n\"Put it on!\" Nina says, rubbing her pregnant belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris put on the movie and sat back down. It was another generic drama about a clean cop in a dirty city and the corrupt police chief out to get him. <br>\r\nSamantha thought it was better than the last movie, but that wasn't saying much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movie continued on, and the hours grew late. Samantha looked over to find Nina as sleep on the couch, a smile on her face her hands on her pregnant belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She better enjoy that sleep while she can get it</i> Samantha thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movie was just about to end as she looked over to Chris, who hand fallen asleep in his chair. <br>\r\nStrangely, he had a smile on his face, both of his hands resting on his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hmm, I wonder what he's dreaming about</i> Samantha thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movie came to an end, and Samantha was the last person standing, as her friend had drifted off to sleep. <br>\r\nShe looked at the clock, and it was pushing 11PM. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly turning off the TV to not awaken her friends, she stood up and unbutton her coat to reveal her round belly. <br>\r\nWith a sigh, she snuck out the door, locking it behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got into her car, and drove off towards her home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pulled into the driveway, she let out a little yawn. <br>\r\nShe stayed up later than she usually did, but it was worth it to be with friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into her house, she thought about what she should do. <br>\r\nShe could stay a little while later, or she could go to bed. <br>\r\nShe did have a doctor's appointment early the next day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Come down stairs, your relatives are here!\" a very pregnant Samantha called out to her children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Thanksgiving.  A time to get together with family, watch football, and ,more importantly for Samantha and her unborn child, to pig out.  Samantha was dressed in maternity jeans and a tight t-shirt which read \"Fully Cooked!\" on it.  Samantha was nearly at her due date, as her massive belly and popped-out belly button had indicated.  Quite often, it was clearly visible that her child was moving around freely against her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer young children made their way down the stairs wearing nice clothes.  \"Do we have to dress like this?\" her oldest son asked. \"Yeah! We feel stupid!\" her daughter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you look nice!  Just be glad you aren't like you're little brother or sister, who isn't wearing a thing!\" she said, giving a hearty belly laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeewww! It's naked?!\" her daughter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Samantha could respond, there was a knock at the door.  Samantha slowly waddled to the door and opened it to a wave of family members.  Her parents were first, and were thrilled to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sammy! You look great!  How's the baby?\" her mother asked, rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're doing fine!\" she responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When are you due, again?\" her father asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"VERY SOON...\" Samantha said, arching her back for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all of her relatives piled inside, Samantha announced, \"Who's ready to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=====<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever was inside Samantha's belly wanted her to get up.  She slowly removed the covers and was shocked at what she saw.  Her belly, like yesterday, was much bigger than before.  It was if she had swallowed a basketball.  Although her breasts had slightly grown, it wasn't much.Samantha looked at the clock, and saw that she only had thirty minutes until her appointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap!\" Samantha said, slowly getting up.  She waddled over to her closet to quickly decide on what to wear.  The only pants that would fit  were some old sweatpants, and she was forced to wear a t-shirt that rode up to show most of her belly.  Although she was getting a bit hungry, she had no time because the doctor's office was thirty minutes away.  Running late, she left the house as fast as she could waddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car ride seemed to take an eternity.  The thumping in her belly had increased and was more frequent, and she could swear that she could feel it in multiple places at once.  A hand on her belly and a hand on the wheel, she was able to make it to the doctor's office with moments to spare.  She entered the office, her big belly leading the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha approached the desk, signing in.  The secretary looked at Samantha from over the computer, and was in awe at her pregnant-looking form.  \"Oh my...Doctor Harper will see you in just a moment.  Please take a seat. Please\" the secretary said, her mouth agape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't need to be told twice.  Taking a seat close to the door, she sat down heavily.  Everyone in the waiting room was staring at Samantha.  <i>Yep.  They all think I'm pregnant.  Join the club</i> she thought.  Minutes later, a nurse entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samantha Peters? Wow...\" the young nurse said.  Samantha sighed and got up, following the nurse into the back rooms.  The nurse led her into the room and told her to take a seat on the examining table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...being pregnant at your age must be...interesting...\" the nurse said.  The nurse was in her mid-20s, with long blonde hair and green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I'm not pregnant-well I might be-I don't know-I'm finding out today.\" Samantha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  You don't know by know?  You must be like six months!\" the nurse said, her hands on Samantha's belly, which responded with a strong THUMP.  Her hands shot off of Samantha's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry...Doctor Harper will be with you in a minute.\" the nurse said, embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, Doctor Harper entered the room. She was a woman in her 40's with good skin for her age, and she had brown spiky hair and brown eyes. Like everyone else, her eyes shot to Samantha's belly.  \"Well, congratulations, Samantha!  Now, ideally, it isn't recommended to get pregnant at your age, but there have been stranger cases.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I don't know if I'm pregnant or not.  I was hoping to find out today.\" Samantha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no problem!  I'll just examine you and give you and ultrasound and that should answer all questions. Does that sound alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's just take your weight real quick...\" Doctor Harper said.  Samantha waddled to the scale.  Stepping on it, she could hear it creak.  Doctor Harper adjusted the number on the scale.  \"Alright.  It looks like you've gained thirty pounds since your last visit.  Samantha just sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor ushered Samantha back onto the table to lie down.  She rolled up Samantha's shirt to reveal her entire belly.  Doctor Harper began to feel all over Samantha's belly, pushing in and out in certain places.  \"It's quite firm.\" she said.  \"Could you tell me what it feels like?\" she said, gesturing to the round dome that was her stomach.  \"Well it's heavy, like there's a bowling ball in there or something.\" Samantha said.  \"What about inside?  Can you feel anything?  Like kicking maybe?\"the doctor said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha sighed and placed a hand on her rounding belly.  \"Yes.  And it's been more frequent lately.  And sometimes...I can feel it in multiple places...\"she said, surprised when a strong flurry of thumping erupted from her belly, clearly visible beneath her skin.  Doctor Harper placed both hands on Samantha's belly, feeling where the movement occurred.  \"Those are definitely kicks!\"she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Harper wheeled in an ultrasound machine and turned it on.  She grabbed a tube of gel and began to smear it on Samantha's belly with the wand.  <i>Please let this be a dream!</i> she thought, closing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! There's it is!  Congratu-wait...I think I see another one, yes I do!  You're having twins!  A boy and a girl!\" the doctor said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha willed herself to open her eyes.  It was true.  On the screen, she was able to make out to two small images, almost alien-like to her.  She was going to be a mother.  Tears began to fill in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me get a few papers for you to fill out and then you'll be on your way.  I'm sure momma must be getting a little hungry!\" the doctor said, patting Samantha's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left Samantha to herself for a few minutes.  <i>This is impossible! I can't be pregnant-and with twins?!  How will the people at school react?  How will Nina and Chris react? How-</i>  Her train of thought was interrupted by her baby boy and girl kicking gently, making her cry.  \"Damn it...\"she said softly, rubbing her belly, \"I guess I'll just have to adjust...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip Me</span> the alien thought entered her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching into her pocket, she grabbed the coin.  Samantha gave it a flip, her eyes falling on...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The THUMPS of her unborn son and daughter inside of her brought Samantha back to reality, as her hand snapped to her belly.<br>\r\nShe looked around in a confused daze as she put the coin back into her purse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the hallway, Doctor Harper left as the shimmer around her disappeared and she walked off to finish her doctorly duties. <br>\r\nAnother firm volley of kicks from her children caused Samantha to look down at her basketball sized midsection. <br>\r\n\"This can't be happening. I'm pregnant. Really pregnant.\" She said as she ran her hands over her mound, her unborn children stirring inside her. <br>\r\n<i>What am I going to do? I was always so sure I was never going to be a mother, and yet here I am. 55, Single. Pregnant - with twins!</i> she thought.<br>\r\nShe got off the table and stood in front of the large full-body mirror mounted onto the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to her side, pushing her hands into the small of her back, making her pregnant profile that much more pronounced. <br>\r\nSlowly, with one hand, she pulled at the hemline of her shirt, revealing her pregnant mound in it's full unrestrained glory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I going to do with you two?\" She asked, moving her hand along the smooth firm skin of her twin-filled belly. <br>\r\n\"I never wanted to be a mother you know.\" She talked to her belly, her hand moving up and down, back and forth around the firm round dome. <br>\r\n\"I never wanted to have kids. Can't stand them. And yet, here you two are, inside a woman who should be past her prime in doing this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer two unborn children thumped along inside her in response. <br>\r\n\"I'm 55. 55! Divorced. Yeah, you two heard me. Divorced. There's no Dad in the equation. Although, I'm not even sure you two even have a Dad. \" She continued to run her hand along her pregnant belly. She could feel the bumps in her skin caused by the movements of her unborn children. She could feel how tight and firm and smooth her skin was. Rubbing her pregnant belly filled her with so many emotions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you two would be better off with someone else. Someone younger, hipper. Someone who could have the means to take care of you\" she said, looking at herself in the mirror. She was huge, there was no denying that. <br>\r\n\"And yet, I don't think I could do it. I may have never wanted children, but now you're MY children. You two are a part of me\" She said, a smile coming across her face. \"I don't know if these damn emotions and hormones running through me. I swore that I never wanted any children, but now that you two are here inside of me, I never want to let you go. Can you hate children and still love your own children more than anything else in the world?\" She asked her two passengers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey responded with two firm and strong kicks. <br>\r\n\"Heh, I guess that settles that. Look, I need to say this to you two before I change my mind. I don't know how you got there, but you're mine. I'll do my best but I can't make any promises. I know really a \"child\" kind of person, but you're my children so that will have to count for something. So - - - \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha let in a deep breath. As soon as she said these words, there was no turning back. <br>\r\nHer life would change forever. It would be a life filled with dirty diapers, school plays, Christmas mornings, birthday parties, tough love, yelling, checking the closet for monsters, and strained bank accounts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Can I even do this?</i> she thought to herself.<br>\r\nShe received a swift THUMP from one of her children in response. <br>\r\n<i>Guess I don't have a choice in the matter.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wrapped her hands around her bare pregnant belly, staring at it.<br>\r\n\"Hello, I'm Samantha Peters - - - But you can call me Mommy\" She said to her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So that's it then. I guess my name is Mommy now</i> she thought rubbing her belly, a smile slowly crossing her face.<br>\r\n<i>Mommy. Guess that's not so bad. I've been called worse</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the examination room slowly swung open, and Doctor Harper entered in a waddle. <br>\r\n\"Okay Ms. Peters, or should I say Mommy.. I've got everything you need.\" The doctor said, a stack of pamphlets in one hand, her other hand placed firmly in the small of her back. It took Samantha a few moments to realize what she was seeing. What had been Doctor Kristen Harper, the 40-something fit athletic doctor with short spikey brown hair and deep brown hair had been replaced with a similar looking yet very different Doctor Kristen Harper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this Doctor Harper was still a 40 something fit athletic doctor with brown eyes, there were a few minor yet major difference. Her brown hair was no longer short and spiky, instead it was long and flowing, like liquid strands of chocolate. Her breasts were bigger too, much bigger than before, firmer and much more rounder. They were visible through the green-scrubs she was now wearing under her unbuttoned green scrubs, her new cleavage spilling out the top of her scrubs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her newest addition by far was the 9 month pregnant belly that was attached to the doctor's midsection. It was perfectly round and huge, the green scrubs she was wearing were straining to hold back her life filled orb, it's tightness giving her maternal curves that much more emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about the wait, I forget how much longer it takes me to do simple tasks because of her\" Doctor Harper says with a smile, patting her pregnant scrub covered belly. <br>\r\n\"So here are some pamphlets about pregnancy in older women, read the yellow one it's been especially helpful to me, ever since I found out I was pregnant at my age. I know you're worried Samantha but trust me, if I can do it, you can do it. I'm going to give you some prescriptions for some vitamins, and I want you to exercise.  Alot of pregnant woman just want to lay around and get fat, but you can't do that, especially at our age. I want to walk for at least a few miles, it will help keep blood pressure down, and will help with swelling in your legs, and the pain in your back. I walk a few miles in the morning before work.\" Doctor Harper says cupping her pregnancy in her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything else checks out fine. Despite your age, your babies are looking extremely healthy. I would say that I was surprised, but that would be a lie. My own doctor told me this morning that he's never seen a healthier baby in an older mother before.\" Doctor Harper explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, one last thing Samantha. I want you to enjoy your pregnancy. It's a special wonderful time in a woman's life. Don't stress about your age, or the birth, or work or anything. Just enjoy being pregnant. Write a journal, take photos of yourself, do something. Just enjoy it. It's goes by faster than you think\" Doctor Harper finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha understood the words that her pregnant doctor was saying, but she was having trouble listening as her mind raced as she stared at her pregnant doctor. <br>\r\n<i>She's pregnant! She's definitely pregnant! She was not pregnant moments ago! It's just like Nina and that waitress, yet she's acting like she's always been like that!</i> Samantha thought, staring at her doctor's belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samantha, what's wrong?\" Doctor Harper asked rubbing her belly. <br>\r\n\"You weren't pregnant\" Samantha said, the words falling out her mouth.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Doctor Harper asked confused. <br>\r\n\"You weren't pregnant last time you \" Samantha says flabbergasted. <br>\r\n\"Last time you saw me? This is why I tell you to schedule more frequent appointments. 9 months ago there was this mixer at this hospital fundraiser, and a few drinks with another handsome doctor my own age and well \" Doctor Harper patted her belly with a smile. <br>\r\n\"He's not in our life right now. Says he's too old to play daddy, but he'll support us. I guess it's for the best. Most kids probably don't want to know they were the product of a drunken grope fest\" Doctor Harper says looking down at her very pregnant belly.<br>\r\n\"Still, why that may not have been the smartest decision of my life, I'm certainly glad it happened, as this little girl is going to be my joy. I'm sure she's going to be a doctor just like her mommy\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha's mind raced. <br>\r\n<i>My doctor's pregnant and she's acting like it's normal. Something weird is going on</i> she thought when it hit hurt like a two-ton truck that was on fire and full of clowns firing machine guns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhenever something like happened she had used the coin. Her memory of it was fuzzy, but she vaguely remembered the coin.<br>\r\nBut that's insane? A coin couldn't cause someone to get pregnant! Could it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Samantha. I've got a lot of other people to see today. My nurse will see you out\" Doctor Harper said, handing over the stack of papers to Samantha. Doctor Harper waved with one hand, the other resting on her belly, as Samantha slowly walked out the building, everyone's eyes on her and her pregnant form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pregnant\" she finally said to herself as she sat in her car, the seat all the way pushed back to make way for her belly. <br>\r\n\"I'm pregnant. And so is Nina. And that waitress, and my doctor. And each time I can vaguely remember the coin. Could that strange coin I bought really be behind\" a thump in her belly cut her off in mid-sentance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know little one. I'm just thinking. Maybe we should go home and check it out\" Samantha said resting a hand on her pregnant belly.<br>\r\nShe was pregnant. She was going to be a mom. She was going to have not one, but two little lives to take care of and fill her life with love and joy. <br>\r\nA smile crossed her face as she accepted that fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Maybe I should come up with names for you two. I can't call you boy and girl, or little ones.\" She said looking down at her belly.<br>\r\n\"So what do you think? This coin might seem to be the reason you're here. On the other hand, I should really talk to someone about this, and your aunt Nina is the only pregnant woman i know right now. Well, the only pregnant woman I know right now that doesn't seem to remember being pregnant. What do you think mommy should do?\" She asked her children, rubbing her belly. </span></div></div>",

We should tell Aunt Nina and Uncle Chris the big news about you two\" Samantha said with a smile, rubbing her pregnant belly in her car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just sat and stared at it, her hand smoothly moving back and forth along the massive surface of her skin. She was enthralled by her changing body. She never would have thought her belly would get this big, and yet here it is, and it was only going to get bigger as her two children, she was going to have children!, continued to grow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no idea what she was going to  do. She meant that literally of course. She knew what she was going to do, she was going to get bigger, bigger than a house (figuratively), as her pregnancy progressed, she was going to go into labor, she was going to have these children, and raise them to the best of her ability to be kind upstanding human beings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe meant she had no idea what to do before and after her son and daughter were born. She had nothing. No baby clothes, no maternity clothes (although that was obvious to anyone who looked at her), no cribs, no baby food, no diapers, no bottles, no books on parenting, no toys, no anything! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no idea where to start. But she knew of someone who could probably help her with that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, they're not really your aunt and uncle, but for all intents and purposes, we'll just call them Aunt Nina and Uncle Chris. She's having a baby too. So you'll have a playmate little girl\" Samantha said, resting her hand on a particularly active spot on her round pregnant belly, hoping that this particular occupant was her unborn daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, Mommy needs some advice on how to get started taking care of you two. I'm probably going to need some books, and cribs, and toys or something\" Samantha said talking to her two children, and received several more KICKS at the mention of toys. <br>\r\n\"Oh you like it when Mommy said toys huh? We'll don't get too crazy, I have some money saved up, but don't expect to be drowning in toys. I'm only a school teacher, and I have to make sure you two end up in a good college.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh god. College. </i> Samantha thought, holding her pregnancy in her hands. <i>And Christmases. And birthdays. Temper tantrums, homework, school plays, baseball practice, dance recitals. Oh god Samantha, are you really going to do this?</i> She thought to herself, staring at her pregnant belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too late now huh?\" She patted her belly with a smile, and then drove off to Nina's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, she pulled her car into the driveway of Chris and Nina's house. Oddly enough, she saw that Chris's car, which was now the mini-van was in the driveway.<br>\r\n<i>Odd for him to take a day off from work</i> Samantha thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she waddled toward the door, she stopped and looked down at her midsection. When someone answered that door, they would know she was without a doubt, pregnant. While she did come over to tell her friend about her new \"passengers\", she did want to have a little fun with it. After all, this was going to be her first time dropping the baby bomb on someone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled back to her car, and took out the thick winter coat she wore last night. Before putting it on, she lifted up the shirt she wore, laying her pregnant belly out bare. She then fastened the coat over her very bare pregnant belly, the coat buttons straining to contain the life orb hidden underneath. <br>\r\nLooking at her reflection one of the exterior mirrors the best she could, the coat managed to hide her pregnancy somewhat, as long as the person wasn't paying attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha hoped that Nina wouldn't be paying attention so she could really surprise her friend. She waddled back to the front door, adjusted her coat, put on a serious face, and knocked on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome shuffling was heard on the other side of the door, before it opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and it was...</span></div></div>",

She saw an eye peering out at her through the peephole of the door.  \"It's Sammy!\" said Chris, opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was different, to say the least.  His normally thin body was replaced with a small potbelly and some man-boobs, to Samantha's surprise. His buttoned shirt straining over his belly.  \"Well, Chris, looks like you've put on a bit of weight since yesterday!\" Samantha said, patting his rounder belly, which was oddly firm.  \"Yeah, it appears so.  I've been throwing up all day, so I probably have that virus that you have...how has that been, anyway?\" he said, a hand on his belly.  \"That's actually what I came here to talk about, can I come in?\" she asked.  Chris lead her into the living room where Nina was laying on the couch, eating.  She hadn't bothered to change since yesterday, her pregnant belly sticking high in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sammy!  What brings you here?\" Nina said, giving her belly a rub, as her daughter was kicking violently inside.  Samantha stood in the middle of the room, while Chris stood by the couch that Nina was weighing down.  \"I'm not really sure how to say this, so I won't...so here we go...\" Samantha said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned away from the expecting couple and unbuttoned her jacket, dropping it on the floor.  She slowly turned around, revealing her twin-filled belly to Chris and Nina.  \"Oh my God...\" they said simultaneously.  They sat in silence for a few minutes, in awe at Samantha.  \"Are you-\" Chris began.  \"Pregnant.\" said Nina.  Samantha began to rub her belly.  \"Yes, I am pregnant, and with twins, I might add.\" she said, as she felt kicks from both occupants.  \"Congratulations!\" said Nina, slowly rising from the couch.  She waddled over to Samantha and started to rub her pregnant belly.  Chris was silent.  \"I can't believe we're pregnant at the same time!  How long have you been hiding this from us?  How far along are you?\" Nina said happily.  \"I'm not really sure...I'm probably going to go back to the doctor's in a few days to see what's what...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris was staring into space.  \"That must mean I'm....\" he said lightly, before trailing off, looking down at his belly.  Nina and Samantha couldn't hear that statement, as they were still talking about Samantha's pregnancy.  \"Excuse me, I'm going to get something to eat.\" Chris said, walking into the kitchen.  \"Has he seemed different to you?\"  Samantha asked.  \"What?  Besides the belly?  Yeah.  He's been getting sick these past two days, and it seems like he eats <b>ALL</b> the time.  It's like he's...pregnant or something.  But that's not possible!\"  \"Yeah, I thought the same thing about my self!\" Samantha said, putting a hand on her belly.  \"Don't worry about it, he's probably just sick or something.\"  Nina desperately wanted to believe this to be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Sammy!  I just thought of an idea-let me take some maternity photos of you!\" Nina said.  \"I don't know...do we really need to?\" Samantha said, slowly rubbing her belly to her occupants' delight, who repaid her with strong kicks.  \"Come on, it'll be fun!\"  Samantha agreed, and Nina slowly waddled away, getting a camera.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina returned minutes later.  \"All right, now just strip down to your bra and panties and let me take a few pictures!\" she said.  \"What!?  Come on, Nina!\"  Samantha said.  \"Please?\" Nina asked kindly.  \"For the children?\"  Samantha sighed.  She took off her belly-baring t-shirt and plopped on the couch to remove her sweatpants, leaving her in only her panties and a bra that was too small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at her bare body, she finally came to terms-she was pregnant, very much so.  Nina had Samantha do various poses, cradling her belly, and others, even the classic Demi Moore pose.  Twenty minutes later, it was finally over, although Samantha thought that she might succumb to delirium from the camera flashes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha put back her clothes on, as Nina approached her with a large scrapbook.  \"Sammy, this is for you to scrapbook each moment of your pregnancy.  It goes by so fast, just enjoy it while you can!\" Nina said.  Samantha took the scrapbook, which already had pictures from the recent photo shoot.  \"Thanks,\" Samantha said,\"I'll do that...\"  \"Great!  Just call me once in an while so I can fill you in on what's happening to your body.  You know what's odd?  A few days ago you were really skinny, and now you look really pregnant!\" Nina said.  \"Yeah, I guess I sorta popped overnight...\" Samantha said, rubbing her belly.  \"I should be going now, I need some rest.\"  Nina understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha grabbed her coat and walked to the front door.  \"Bye, Samantha!\" Chris said, peering out of the kitchen, with food in his mouth.  Samantha could have sworn that Chris's belly was slightly bigger than before, but she put if off for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her car, a wave of fatigue hit her.  She needed rest but she also wanted to see if she could find anything about the coin.  She decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The need for sleep washed over her as she sat in the car. She leaned over and took her new scrap book, looking through it. Staring at the pictures of her very pregnant self, she was amazed at how big she was, at how big she could possibly get. She looked at the photos that Nina made her do, the poses she was placed in; a side profile with her hands in her back, a comical shocked expression as she looked down at her belly, the classic Demi Moore pose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her mind drifted off looking at the photos of her pregnant self, she wondered how this happened. She hadn't been with a man in years, and more importantly, her doctor, her very own doctor, who herself was now pregnant at 40, despite now being pregnant hours ago, told her that her child bearing days were over. Yet, her she was now, having twins. Twins! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought of Nina, her pregnant friend, who like herself, wasn't pregnant a few days ago. She thought of the young waitress that was supposedly now her ex-husband's other woman on the side, the one who would finally give him the child he longed for. She, like Nina and Samantha was not pregnant a few days ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer unborn son and daughter kicked away inside of her as she pondered the situation. Placing a hand on her firm orb she let out a sigh. <br>\r\n\"I think I've put it off long enough. I think it's time to figure out where you two came from\" Samantha reached into her purse and pulled out the strange silver coin she purchased exactly five days ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I think you have something to do with it!\" She said to the coin, examining it yet again. She turned it this way and that, hoping to try and decode the mysteries held within just by reflecting light of the surface of the coin. Her eyes feel upon the image on the coin, of the pregnant woman and what appeared to be a pregnant...man?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat train of thought led her back to Chris. His belly was bigger and he was developing what could only be described as man-boobs. Surely, if the coin was the source of her pregnancy, it couldn't affect Chris could it? There was no possible way, and yet, all the symptoms matched. The weight gain, the vomiting, could it really be? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's impossible Samantha. Something else is wrong with Chris. He's not pregnant</i> Samantha thought looking at the coin. <i>Still that's what you though about yourself, and look at you now... Mommy</i> She thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's time we find out more about you\" Samantha said, putting the coin back in her purse. She started the car, buckled her seatbelt, and drove home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a stop for lunch at a burger joint (the stop was short, the meal itself was quite large including an extra large burger, an extra large milkshake, fries, a salad, and some ice cream), Samantha pulled into the driveway of her home, wiping away the particles of food at the corner of her mouth. <i>I know my doctor said not to pig out, but I'm eating for three here. Besides, I'll go for a walk in the park later</i> Samantha thought to herself as she hefted herself out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe in the driveway, hands in her back as she looked at her house. This house, which once seemed too large and lonely, will soon seem way to small and way to full. She smiled as she placed a hand from her back onto her belly, giving it a rub. <br>\r\n\"Welcome home little ones. I know it's not the best, but it's ours.\" Samantha talked to her occupants as she looked at her house, no not just her house. Her family's house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nice front yard to play in, and she could probably put some swings and a playset in the back. She could watch her children laugh and play as she sat on the porch, rushing to their aid as they fell and skinned knees. That's what Mom's do right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued rubbing her belly, looking at her house, soon to be alive with sounds of children. The thought both captivated her and terrified her, but they're was nothing she could do about it now. She heard a gasp to her right, and looked over to see her neighbor staring at her. He was watering his lawn with a hose, staring at Samantha's new maternal figure, his mouth agape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi Mark! NIce day isn't it?\" Samantha asked, returning to her hands to the small of her back, pushing out her belly that much more than it already was. <br>\r\nMark said nothing, and just continued to stare at her. <br>\r\n\"Give my best to your wife. Come on little ones, we have things to do\" She said looking down at her belly before walking into her house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put down her purse, took off her shoes, and sat down on the couch, her belly filling her lap. She sat and sighed contently as she rubber her belly.<br>\r\n\"Okay you two. Time now for Mommy to rest. Why don't you two go to sleep or something? You've been awfully active\" Samantha said, holding her belly by the sides. <br>\r\nShe picked up her laptop and turn it on, resting it firmly on her belly.<br>\r\n\"Well, at least it's useful for something\" Samantha said commenting on her own expanding midsection as she began to work on the laptop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe surfed the web for a few moments, finding out information on pregnancy later in life. Lots of information on being pregnant in your 40's, but very little information about pregnancy past 50. It's almost like people weren't expecting women in their 50's to BE expecting. <br>\r\n\"Well, fat lot of good that does us huh?\" Samantha says to her unborn children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, she stopped surfing the internet and started researching the strange coin, that to the best of Samantha's beliefs, was the cause of her new \"condition\". She spent what seemed like hours searching coin databases, chat rooms, and search data to try and find out anything about the coin. Eventually she found a small thread that eventually led her to a website about strange magical and other paranormal items. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paranormal huh?\" she thought, staring at the screen. <br>\r\n<i>I don't know why I'm even bothering with this. The coin can't be responsible for my two little ones</i> she thought, preparing to exit the internet browser. But a nagging thought at the back of her head was pulling at her, pulling her away from exiting, and continuing onwards in her quest for the truth. <br>\r\n\"Oh what the hell\" she said, but realizing that she just swore. \"You two didn't hear that. Sometimes Mommy needs to use grownups words, and if I ever hear you two talk like that, you're in so much trouble\" she said to her pregnant belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe typed in a few more keystrokes, eventually landing on the page about the various so-called \"magical, mysterious, supernatural, or paranormal items\" that exist in the world. Scrolling down through the page she found entries about creepy dolls, monkey paws, wish granting fish, unknown islands in the middle of the ocean, haunted cars, and more. She continued to roll her eyes as she went by objects after objects before finding a link that read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't See What You're Searching For? Contact us!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, gave her pregnant belly a scratch, and clicked on the link. An email box opened up, and she started to type, explaining the story of how she bought the coin, the situations she's been involved with the coin, and of course, her current expectant state. After including photos of the coin, and sending in photos of herself, she sighed and closed the laptop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well kids. Either we're going to get answers or some weirdoes on the internet will think your pregnant 55 year old mother is crazy.\" Samantha said with a sigh. She walked into the kitchen to find something to eat, as her hunger was seemingly endless. She searched for a good ten minutes before realizing that she had nothing to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you two, I guess it's time we go to the supermarket.\" She said looking down at her midsection. Was she really going to go out in public like this? While she wasn't ashamed in being pregnant, she knew people there who certainly ask some questions, the answers for she did not have. Yet, it would be even more awkward to show up with children at the grocery store and not have an explanation that people would by. If they saw her pregnant now, they wouldn't ask questions when her children were born. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well come on you two. Let's go get some food. Anything you want for dinner tonight? Mommy was thinking chicken and macaroni-and-cheese. I have such a craving\" she said, placing a hand on her belly. Her two passengers were silent. <br>\r\n\"Great, not listening to me when I need them to. Already off to a fantastic start.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed her purse and slipped back on her shoes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>She opened the door and stepped out into her driveway. <br>\r\nHumming to herself a little song that she didn't quite now, she approached her car.<br>\r\nOut of the corner of her eye she noticed that her neighbor Mark was staring at her from the behind the curtains of his living room window. <br>\r\nShe placed a hand of her belly, and waved at her peeping neighbor with the other. <br>\r\n\"Hello again Mark. Just heading out to the grocery store!\" Samantha said with a smile, rubbing her pregnant belly with her one hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked back at the window, she could see that Mark's wife, Beth had joined him at the window, staring at her as she made her way to her car. As Samantha buckled herself in her car, she could see Beth's mouth agape, staring at her newly pregnant neighbor. <br>\r\n\"It's like you'd think they've never seen a pregnant woman before, hmm little ones?\" Samantha talked to her belly, as she pulled her car out of the driveway and left to go the grocery store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took her a little while to get there, as Samantha seemed to get nothing but red lights. On any other day this would have aggrivated her to no extent, yet today was not just any other day. Today was the day she found out she was pregnant, that she was having not one, but TWO, children. Two children that would forever change her life, for the better. Now, Samantha took every opportunity she could to just be by herself, and enjoy her time with her unborn children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she pulled into the parking lot of the grocery store, got out of her car, gave her belly a little pat, grabbed a cart, and headed inside. <br>\r\nThe store was crowded today, more so than usual, which made navigating some of the more narrow aisles a little hard for Samantha and her largeness. She grabbed everything she could ever hope to eat in her pregnant state, and then some. Frozen pizzas, potato chips, sandwich meats, cereals, pastas; everything, including pickles and ice cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she slowly filled her cart to the brim, she could see every pair of eyes falling upon her. Well, to be more precise, falling upon her belly. Every time she could feel a pair of eyes on her, she would look. Most of the time the pair of eyes belonged to an woman, ages differing from woman to woman, but every time one of the woman looked at her and of course her belly, a small smile formed on the woman's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made Samantha happy, as she felt like she was apart of some sort of sisterhood. Women would just come up to her, asking questions about her pregnancy, what she was having, when she was do, those kind of things. She always felt welcomed into this group, and that she could always connect to now, not just a woman, but as a mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she noticed that a few of the stares were not as warm or as welcoming, even from the women. Quite a few people seemed to look at her with disgust on their face. Their looks said it all - \"Having children at your age? How revolting. Think of them instead of thinking of yourself. You're too old.\"<br>\r\nEvery time Samantha saw those looks on their faces, it gave her more pain than she could possibly know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't her fault. She didn't ask for this. Yet, we all have to play with the cards that have dealt to us, and Samantha choose her hand wisely. <br>\r\nShe was going to do the only thing she could think of doing - become a mother. If they didn't like it, well, she could tell them where they could place their head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bought all her groceries, and for once in her life, actually did take the help of having someone assist her with the bags. She would have done it herself, but her back was starting to kill her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe loaded herself into her car, and drove back to her house. As she pulled into the driveway, she once again noticed Mark and Beth staring at her from the windows of their house. It took her nearly forever to bring all the groceries into the house by herself, but she eventually got everything put into their proper place, and she put the macaroni and cheese and chicken into the stove. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n35 minutes later, she was scarfing down the delicious combination with a force she never knew she had, cleaning her plate not once, not twice, but three times. Stifling a little burp, and rubbing her stomach contently as her two unborn children moved around inside of her, Samantha was truly happy for the first time in years. Somewhere deep down inside of her she began to think, did she really hate children, or did she just hate the prospect of having Tom's children. As she rubbed her belly, she began to think about what she ever saw in him in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hoisted herself out of her chair, and put away the rest of her dinner, packing it away to be used as lunch tomorrow. <br>\r\nEventually, evening turned into night as Samantha sat on the couch, her twin filled orb sticking into the air, watching TV. <br>\r\nThe clock chimed 9 and the desire for sleep came over her. <br>\r\n\"Well little ones. I think it's time for bed. Mommy has work in the morning... and she has to figure out how to explain you two\" she said, as she watched her belly squirm around as her children became active again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDA-BEEP! Her laptop chimed as she received an email message. She checked the time. 9:02. She had to be up early tomorrow to get ready for that half-day of testing, but this might be that email about the coin she was waiting for. </span></div></div>",

You have no idea how much Aunt Nina wanted Mommy to have you two.\" Samantha said, moving the laptop of her pregnant belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up and walked (although she noted that was getting closer to waddling than walking now) and collected the two items, folded them and put them in her purse. <br>\r\n\"Luckily for us tomorrow is a half day at work hmm little ones? We need to get everything ready for you two.\" Samantha said looking down at her belly. <br>\r\nShe felt a tiny little kick from inside, and placed one hand on her belly, slowly gliding it over the left side of her dome, her hand following the curve slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Samantha's eyes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. I'm going to need someone to move out all those junk from those upstairs bedrooms. I mean, I don't think you two should share the same room. Lord knows I don't need a fussy baby walking up the one that's actually sleeping\" She said to herself. \"But how am I going to do it? I can't lift any of that stuff. I mean I could do it before I got pregnant\" her voice still stumbled over the word pregnant, although it was quickly becoming a word in her \"most often used words in the last 24 hours\" pile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, and placed her hands in her back. She was in quite a jam. She had babies she had to get ready for, a one-day sale where it was a safe bet she was going to buy out the store, and no place to put either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She's huge!\" Mark said, his eyes not leaving Samantha's belly. <br>\r\n\"Oh my god! I thought it was a trick, but oh my god!\" Beth said, bending down, coming face-to-belly. <br>\r\nBeth reached out a hand, and gave Samantha's belly a firm poke with her finger. <br>\r\n\"It's so firm! She's not fat! She's pregnant just like you said!\" Beth said her mouth agape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Mark, Beth. Can I help you? Or did you just come over at past 9 o'clock at night to prod your 55 year old pregnant neighbor\" Samantha said sounding irritated. How could she not be? Her two next door neighbors invited themselves over and just started poking and prodding her without a \"Hello\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samantha, is there something you'd like to share with us?\" Beth said, moving her face away from Samantha's belly and back to eye level. <br>\r\n\"Like with the fact that you broke that pact!\" Mark said nodding his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark and Beth were high school sweethearts that became college sweethearts that became the happily married Mark and Beth Dentons. They moved into the house next door about two years after Tom and Samantha first moved in. Samantha wouldn't really consider them friends, just people she talked to on occasion. She really didn't have a lot of the same interests as them, she enjoyed reading a good book, they would go out on exotic adventures. She would cook a small meal for herself, they would dine out at the best restaurants in town. She drove a sensible car, they owned sports cars and boats. <br>\r\nThey did have one thing common though: They didn't have children, and didn't plan on ever having them. However, as Samantha stood before her two neighbors it was quite obvious that specific common interest was no longer there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't really a pact Mark\" Samantha said, rubbing her belly, emphasizing her point. <br>\r\nMark and Beth were close to pushing 40. They both looked people who fell out of a magazine that sold boats and sweaters to rich people. The button up shirt for him with sweater wrapped around his neck, polo pants, with Beth wearing the latest fashions with a sensible haircut at large flashy jewelry. <br>\r\nMark had some serious money after selling off his computer company to some big name several years ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome people would have moved away to a better neighborhood, the kind with gates, and butlers, and tennis courts, but not the Dentons. The Denton were the type who spent all their vast amounts of money for their own enjoyment, not their own vanity. \"A house is a house, besides we're almost never in it, so why not just buy sensible?\" Mark always said. He was proud of the fact that he bought a sensible house, fixed it up, and was going to sell it back for 5x what it was worth when the market turned around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we said we weren't ever going to have children, you agreed. That's a pact\" Mark said. <br>\r\n\"Mark, I said while going through a bad marriage where children were the focal point. It was never written in stone\" Samantha said lying. It was always the plan, but plans change. <br>\r\n\"But Samantha, at your age? Have you even thought this through? Your 55! 55! When those kids are 5, you'll be 60! When they're 15, you'll be 70! When they're getting out of college, you'll be almost 80!\" Beth said. <br>\r\n\"Thank you for the basic math Beth.\" Samantha said, her friendly face getting tested to the limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was aware of how she was going to be as her children grew up, but that was hurdle she was going to have to face. She didn't care. She had two little children to think about. She would eat right, exercise, and go for as long as she could. That's all anyone could ever ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samantha, how did you even get pregnant at your age. I would've though the plumbing would be all rusted up at this point\" Mark said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was angry. Mark didn't just cross the line. He dropped a nuke on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what business is it of yours what I do with my life!?! Who cares how I got pregnant! It doesn't have anything to do with you! Now, what the hell do you want? Say it quickly before I slam this door.\" Samantha said, fighting back tears and uncontrollable rage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth elbowed her husband in the shoulder as hard as she could. <br>\r\n\"Ow!\" Mark said looking at his wife, <br>\r\n\"Nice going!\" Beth said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye!\" Samantha said, about to slam the door. <br>\r\n\"Wait! Wait! Wait!\" Mark said, and Samantha did in fact wait. <br>\r\n\"Look, what I said was inexcusable, Look, if you decided to have children, that's fantastic. It's not our business to tell you what to do, even if I think it's not in your or our best interest\" Mark said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha was one sentence away from punching Mark in the nose. Beth picked up on this and elbowed her husband in the ribs again. <br>\r\n\"Ow! What did I say?!\" Mark said looking at his wife. <br>\r\n\"What he meant to say is: \"Congratulations Samantha. We hope your child - - \" Beth said before being interrupted.<br>\r\n\"ChildREN. I'm having twins\" Samantha said, cupping her belly for emphasis. <br>\r\n\"Seriously? Wow.\" Beth said, taken back. \"I mean, we hope your children fill your life with joy and happiness, and if there's anything you ever need for us, don't hesitate to ask!\" Beth said.<br>\r\n\"Wait what?\" Mark said looking at his wife. <br>\r\n\"Look you dolt, you just came over here and insulted the woman twice. Your plan was to come over here and have her talk to an adoption agency is a bust.\" Beth said to her husband. <br>\r\n\"You came over to. Something about \"not hearing screaming brats in the backyard\" Mark corrected her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>These two are horrible human begins. They came over here to convince me to give up my children for adoption so they won't be the only childless couple of the street. How money can make people to monsters. </i> Samantha thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up Mark!\" Beth said, before turning her attention back to Samantha. <br>\r\n\"If there's anything you need from us, just ask. Also, we would really like it if you didn't tell any of the other neighbors we had this conversation, it would make us look really, really bad, and Mark's running for president of the homeowners association in the neighborhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you came over here, at 9 o'clock at night, to convince me to give up my children for adoption as there is a chance that as they got older their playing might disrupt YOUR lives, despite the fact that you live in a house in a neighborhood full of children, a house I may remind you, you are only in about less than 60 days a year. You didn't think this through did you?\" Samantha asks with a smug sense of self satisfaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth and Mark's face went blank as the jig was up. They looked like deer caught in the headlights of a on-fire semi-truck that was barreling towards them at over 100 miles per hour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh---\" Mark stammered. <br>\r\n\"If you uh - - ever need anything\" Beth said.  </span></div></div>",

Right now in fact\" Samantha said, a devilish smile coming across her face. <br>\r\n\"Uh - - \" Mark continued to stammer while Beth just stared blankly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need some rooms upstairs cleaned out. There's not alot of stuff in there, just some boxes and other junk. I need it to be brought into the garage so I can get those two rooms set up for the babies\" Samantha said, cupping her pregnancy for emphasis. \"Now usually I would have someone do it, but since I'm getting everything I need tomorrow at the big Baby Barn sale, I kind of need to be done now so I can get everything ready as I go along. So, what do you say neighbor? Want to help out an old preggo and take that stuff out of there for me... tonight?\" Samantha said, rubbing her belly for emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want it done..\" Mark said.<br>\r\n\"Now?\" Beth asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? It's only 9. If you two work together you could have done by 11:05 tops\" Samantha said, feeling quite devilish. <br>\r\n\"But we uh\" Beth started to say. <br>\r\n\"We only came over here at 9PM to tell you to give your children up for adoption so they won't disturb us, and, oh don't tell anyone we said that as we're running for president of the homeowners association?\" Samantha said with a smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth looked at Mark, who looked back at Beth, knowing that they were both backed into a corner they could not get out off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh does it really have done tonight?\" Mark asked.<br>\r\n\"Can it wait till tomorrow afternoon?\" Beth asked. <br>\r\n\"Maybe. Before or after I make a few calls to the other people running for the home owners association president?\" Samantha asked. <br>\r\n\"But - - \" Mark said, his own words coming back to haunt him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I could always meet them in person. I'm a pretty convincing person, and I'm sure some of them would love to take out my children I'm having\" Samantha said, rubbing her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth pressed two fingers to the ridge of her nose and sighed. <br>\r\n\"This isn't my fault\" Mark said looking over to his wife.<br>\r\n\"This is entirely your fault\" Beth said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, if you get started now, you can probably get it down by 11. It's not much\" Samantha said, moving aside inviting her two new \"helpers\" in. <br>\r\nMark and Beth stepped inside, and Samantha showed them the two rooms that were now going to be used as the rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, true to Samantha's words, they were full of boxes and tubes, mostly junk that belonged to Tom, that he said he was going to collect, but never did. Samantha was now pretty sure that he was just using her house as free storage knowing that Samantha would never throw out his things unlike his new wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Soon to be ex-wife once the witch finds out about Tom's little secret</i> Samantha thought to herself. <br>\r\nBeth and Mark got to work, carrying out boxes and tubs from the two rooms, carrying them down the stairs and into the garage, which she never used. <br>\r\nTom used to use it as work area, making sure that Samantha always parked her car out in the driveway. Sure, Tom got to keep his car in the garage with his tools, but not Samantha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn retrospect, Samantha did always find that a little odd, but she no longer cared. Tom was long gone from her life, and his things were going to be replaced with things that belonged to her children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer children, still Samantha could not believe it. She stood in the door frame, watching as her two \"helpful\" neighbors moved all of Tom's garbage into the garage. As the piles of boxes, tubes and other junk began to get hauled down, she could start seeing the bits of room that her children would call \"their room\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her son's room, she could see where his crib would go, and then where his bed would go as he got older. She could imagine him playing with army men and race cars on the carpet of his room, while posters of sport stars and comic book heroes hung on the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her daughter's room, she imagined tea parties, stuffed animals being flung everywhere, a doll house in the corner. Samantha rubbed her belly with a smile on her face as she imagined the life that she would soon have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed, and eventually Samantha's back and feet started to hurt her, forcing her to return to her laying position on the couch. She lifted her shirt up, examining the great fleshy orb that was attached to her midsection, drawing invisible circles on it with her finger. A little after 11 PM, her two neighbors, dirty, sweaty, and looking very tired, came down the stairs to find their pregnant neighbor on the couch, belly exposed watching late-night talk shows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're finished\" Mark said, looking exhausted.<br>\r\n\"Both rooms?\" Samantha asked, moving into a sitting up position, her belly filling her lap.<br>\r\n\"Both rooms. They're bigger than they look. We must have moved about a hundred boxes!\" Beth said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thanks a lot, I appreciate it.\" Samantha said getting up, her shirt still lifted up showing her belly.<br>\r\nBeth and Mark's eyes looked at it, her tight skin reflecting the light in the room. <br>\r\n\"I know huh? I'm getting so big!\" Samantha said with a smile, rubbing her belly before lowering the hemline of her shirt in an attempt to cover whatever amount of pregnant flesh she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn awkward moment passed between them as... </span></div></div>",

The sounds of Beths' pregnancy related puking could be heard from behind the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha came back to her senses as Mark just stared at her. <br>\r\n\"Samantha, what's with that coin?\" Mark asked, still pale from his bout of pregnancy related puking.<br>\r\n\"It's uh - - -\" Samantha searched for a lie. <br>\r\n\"It's my coin that I use to make moral decisions on. I've been flipping it lately because - - - well I've decided that - - - I will not tell anyone what happened here tonight. Maybe your concerns were valid, maybe not. But you should totally get to run for home owner's association president\" Samantha lied, the words becoming clearer and easier for her to form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Mark pale face seemed to light up. <br>\r\n\"Y-yeah\" Samantha continued her lie \"Look, I needed to flip the coin twice to make sure I was making the right decision. Leave it up to fate and all that. So, I won't tell anyone. In fact, I'll endorse you. I have some minor pull in the neighborhood, and coming from a middle aged pregnant woman\" Samantha said, holding her belly for emphasis \"They'll by any story I tell them\" Samantha finished her lie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>My god. Did I really just absentmindledly do to these two what I think I did?</i> Samantha thought to herself. <i>If it's true, well then, they're in for some big changes and bigger surprises soon</i> Samantha thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two will have playmates\" Samantha said outloud to her belly giving it a rub. <br>\r\n\"I'm sorry?\" Mark asked confused. <br>\r\n\"Oh, just saying something out loud to myself.\" Samantha said, spewing out another lie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth returned from the bathroom minutes later, her eyes also red and watery. <br>\r\n\"Beth honey, you okay?\" Mark asked. <br>\r\n\"Yeah. I feel fine. Great in fact. I'm - - -\" Beth was interrupted as Samantha finished her thought, \"Starving?\" <br>\r\n\"How did you know Samantha?\" Beth asked. <br>\r\n\"This puking hunger thing is going around school. A couple of the staff have it. You probably caught it somehow\" Samantha said, in yet another lie. <br>\r\n\"I guess\" Mark said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, see you guys later and thanks again for all your help\" Samantha said, politely pushing her two guests towards the front door. <br>\r\n\"See you Samantha\" Beth said in a daze. <br>\r\nAs Samantha closed and locked the door behind them, she could still hear Beth and Mark talking. <br>\r\n\"I'm starving. Let's eat.\" Beth said.<br>\r\n\"What do you want to get?\" Mark asked. <br>\r\n\"I could go for a extra large pizza with everything on it\" Beth said.<br>\r\n\"Honey, we don't eat meat. \" Mark said. <br>\r\n\"I know, but I have this sudden craving from meats and lots of it\" Beth said her voice drifting off as they walked towards their home.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I' craving meat as well. 1 little pizza with meat won't hurt us right?\" Mark asked. <br>\r\n\"Make it two, I could eat a whole one by myself\" Beth corrected.<br>\r\n\"I'll make it three. I know a place around here that delivers late. Saw an ad for it\"Mark's voice fading off into nothing as Mark and Beth went into their house, unware of the new beings that were growing inside of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha yawned, scratched her belly and looked at the clock.

Tomorrow would be a big day, as she had a half-day of teaching, and she had to go to the mall.  Hopefully, someone would send her an e-mail about the the coin, as she had many questions to be answered.  With these thoughts drifting through her head, she fell asleep, her babies kicking gently inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, she did not have a dream last night.  Unraveling the covers from her pregnant state, she was again surprised at what sat before her.  It was as if someone had shoved a watermelon in her womb.  She was huge, maybe the size of a woman seven or eight months pregnant with just one baby.  Even more surprising was the fact that her belly button was now poking out.  \"I may have to schedule another appointment soon, I'm growing really fast...\" she said, as her babies greeted her with strong kicks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had about half an hour before she needed to be at school.  First, she decided to take a shower.  Her slight waddle/slight walk had turned into full-on pregnant lady waddle.  After removing her clothes in the bathroom, she carefully stepped into the shower.  Five minutes later, she dried off, which was difficult due to her larger size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha waddled back into her bedroom and went to her closet.  Unfortunately for her, she could only fit in a pair of sweatpants and shirt that was similar to the one she was already wearing, exposing her belly slightly.  <i>There's no way that I'll be able to get away with this at school.  I need to come clean...tell everyone I'm pregnant...</i>she thought, her babies kicking in agreement.  Her belly gave a rumble, signaling that she needed food now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer appetite was definitely increasing.  She had four pancakes, bacon, eggs, and a side of fruit, which could have fed three people.  \"Ugh,\"she groaned,\"I'm going to be having a feast every meal if this keeps up...\"  Checking her watch, she noticed that she had five minutes until she had to leave.

Besides, there's a chance they might be pregnant... </i>she thought to herself.  Samantha then waddled over to their house next door.  Approaching the front door, she rang the doorbell.  She was able to hear heavy footsteps coming to the door.  Opening the door was Mark, different from yesterday.  He appeared to have grown some man-boobs and a slight paunch, to Samantha's surprise. <i> Reminds me of Chris, but a bit smaller.  I better not say anything about it as to not piss him off</i>, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Samantha.  What do you want?\" he asked.  \"I just knew that you were both pretty sick last night, are you feeling any better?\"  \"Not really, we're both really hungry, though.\" <i> All the signs so far...</i>Samantha thought, rubbing her own belly.  \"Where's Beth?\" she asked.  \"She's getting ready for work at the moment.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, they both heard footsteps coming down the stairs.  It was Beth, dressed only in work pants and a bra, which struggled to contain her growing breasts.  Her belly was exactly the same size as Mark's, as if she were severely bloated.  She also had an almost maternal glow about her.  \"Hello Samantha, what brings you here this morning?  Have you decided to accept out offer?\"  Samantha immediately shot that down.  \"No!  I was just checking to see how you all are doing.\"  Beth let out a soft sigh.  \"We're still pretty sick.  We were throwing up a lot this morning.  But we're also really hungry, as I'm sure Mark mentioned.  And I guess you can tell we're pretty bloated, but for some reason I'm a little worried...\" Beth said, rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, Samantha's hands shot to Beth's stomach, feeling the firmness of it. <i> I knew it.  She's pregnant.  And so is Mark.  But I can't tell them that here, they'd have a heart attack!</i> she thought. Beth gasped.  \"What are you doing?!\" she asked.  Samantha removed her hands from Beth's paunch, while Mark gave her an angry look.  \"I-sorry, I wasn't really thinking.  I think you're alright, but if you get any bigger, you may want to see a doctor.  Same goes for you, Mark.\" Samantha said.  \"Goodbye Samantha!\" said Mark angrily, slamming the door in her face.  Checking the time, Samantha realized it was time to go to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled to her car and headed out.  Pulling into the parking lot, she became nervous.  <i>What would they all think of me?  How are they going to react to my pregnancy?</i>  Her babies began to kick, as if to give solace to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Samantha heaved herself out of her car and waddled towards the front doors of the school, she noticed something that was a little different today than two days ago. <i>Two days..</i> she thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt just occured to her that she ditched work yesterday. Now granted, she would have TWO <i>very</i> good excuses to give to Lisa, but still it occurred to her that she should have at least told someone that was taking yesterday for a personal day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut yesterday was yesterday, and Samantha was focused on today. Today was going to be a very busy day for her; she had a pregnancy to announce (although at this point, people could just look at her and make a safe guess), a class to test, and a shopping date with her pregnant best friend in a crowded mall to purchase items for her two children that she was pregnant with, despite (to her own knowledge) she was not pregnant with days ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Today's going to be a day</i> Samantha thought to herself, and she was right. Her first clue was that as she waddled towards the front door of the school, she noticed a brand new bright blue sedan parked in Lisa's parking spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's not Lisa's car. She's driven that old mid 90's sedan for several years, almost to the point of death. Someone must have parked their car in her spot. </i> Samantha thought examining the car from where she was standing. It looked brand new, pristine, not a speck of dust on it, like it just rolled off the factory floor. It looked roomy, sleek, yet safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha was just about to shrug off this new car as someone not parking where they are supposed to, goodness knows that Samantha has had her fair share of that, until she noticed the bright pink steering wheel cover, a pacifier hanging from the rear view mirror, and a back window decal showing a smiling woman with the name \"Lisa\" written above it, with a tiny story next to her with the name \"Ian\" written above it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through the front windshield, she saw a brand new carseat in the back seat, with a plastic doll strapped in, dressed in blue. <br>\r\n\"What in the world?\" Samantha asked, taking in everything she saw. This was Lisa's parking spot, the sticker on the window said Lisa, so why was this family car parked here? Why was there a plastic baby doll in the back in  car seat? Surely none of this belonged to Lisa. She had no need for a family car or a carseat didn't she? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coin. Samantha's thoughts came back to the coin. <br>\r\nIs it possible that the effect it had on Chris and Nina and her neighbors was at work here with her coworkers? <br>\r\nShe ran a hand across her belly, lost in thought as a chill ran down her spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't be.\" Samantha told herself before looking down at her pregnant belly, which was hanging out of the shirt she was currently wearing. <br>\r\n\"But then again, I said that about you two now didn't I?\" Samantha said to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to investigate but she couldn't. She had things to do today, she a class to teach, a test to supervise, a mall to shop at. Whatever mystery that lay behind this mysterious blue car would either have to wait or would unveil itself to her in due time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed turned around from the bright blue mystery and entered into the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made her way into the teachers lounge, and upon her immediate entry, she could feel every pair of eyes looking at her and her pregnant belly. A silence fell over her co-workers as Samantha wrapped her hands around her pregnancy. <br>\r\n\"Good morning everyone.\" Samantha said to her co-workers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Here goes everything!</i> Samantha thought to herself. \"I have something I would like to announce to everyone, although I think it might be obvisious to anyone with a pair of eyes. I'm -  - \" Samantha was just about to say those words when she was interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pregnant, you too! Samantha, that's fantastic!\" The interrupting voice was from Lisa who came into the room from the bathroom, rubbing a very small but very visible tiny pregnant belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-wha-Lisa?\" was all Samantha could stammer about before it felt like she was going to faint. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Although it was not big, she had a noticeable bulge in her midsection, along with a larger pair of breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is such good news, Samantha!  I can't believe it!\" Lisa said, beaming, arms around her belly.  Samantha just smiled as she tried to control her wits.  Lisa tried to continue the conversation.  \"So, what is it?  Boy or girl?\" she implored.  \"It's both...\" Samantha replied.  \"Twins?!  That's incredible! Of course, I only have little Ian in here, but that's all I really need...\" Lisa said, rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how far along are you, Samantha?\" Lisa asked.  \"Actually, I'm not really sure.  I'll probably have a doctor's appointment soon to know for sure...What about you?\"  \"Oh me, I'm four months along...but I really have now idea how I got pregnant!\" she said.  <i>I can venture a guess...</i>Samantha thought.  Now it was Samantha's turn to continue the conversation.  \"So...you feel any kicks yet?  These little jerks do it all the time!\" On cue, the \"little jerks\" gave two swift kicks to Samantha's bladder.  \"Actually no, they haven't yet, but Dr. Harper said I should soon.  It's different for every woman, I've heard-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, they were interrupted by Dylan entering the room.  Dylan's belly was also big, nearly identical to Lisa's.  Like Chris and Mark, he also had a sizable pair of man boobs. He seemed distraught, confused, even. He was dressed in khaki's and a button down shirt which struggled to contain his belly.  As Dylan approached, Lisa left the room.  \"I'll see you later, Samantha!\" she said, cradling her own pregnant belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good Morning, Samantha.  I see that your swelling swelling hasn't gone down, then again, neither has mine...\" he said, looking down at his belly.  \"I'm actually pregnant.  With twins.\" Samantha said.  \"Wow...you?  Pregnant?  I never thought I'd see the day! Well, my congratulations to you.\" Dylan said.  \"So what's your excuse, Dylan?\" she said, referring to Dylan's turgid midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just an illness, I guess.  Maybe a tapeworm or something.  I'm just hungry <b>ALL</b> the time.  Unfortunately, I really can't afford another sick day to go to the doctor's so I'll just have to fight it off, I guess.\"  he said, somewhat timidly.  Samantha was at a crossroads.  On one hand, she knew he was pregnant. But on the other hand, how could she break the news to him in the break room?  <i>I've got to tell him, </i>she thought.  \"Dylan, I think that-\"  At that moment, Samantha was interrupted by someone loudly entering the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course, any time Brooke walked into a room, it was an eyebrow raiser, with her impossible good looks and her sexy stroll, but today it was like never before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke was wearing a full body leotard, clinging to her body like her own pair of skin. Her already heaving cleavage was even more noticeable now, the neck of the outfit leaving an open cut for her breasts to show and the tight material showing their full size. Her nipples were also clearly visible against the fabric. And, like Lisa, Nina, and every other woman who'd become mysteriously pregnant, Brooke's double-Ds were now even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe outfit probably didn't cover up her legs, but Samantha couldn't tell because around her round ass, Brooke had on a tight pair of black, velvety pants; the kinds that probably say JUICY on the butt. Samantha wouldn't put it past Brooke to wear that sort of thing so she craned her head a little to see if there was any writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See something you like?\" Brooke grinned. Samantha snapped out of it and looked back at Brooke annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brooke, do you really think that outfit's appropriate for a work environment?\" Samantha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke pouted playfully. \"Well, I can't help it. I need to wear more form-flattering outfits. I'm pregnant!\" Sure enough, there was a big bulge in Brooke's midsection, easily visible through her satiny leotard material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me too,\" Samantha said quietly, resting her hand on her heaving twin-filled belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could have guessed,\" Brooke chuckled, looking over at Dylan. \"Dylan, what's up with you? Did you get knocked up too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan blushed and held his hands together, trying to cover up his midsection. \"I-I've got an illness. I'm going to the doctor to check it out.\" And with that, he was out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" Brooke said, walking up to Samantha. Brooke was already much taller, so she was literally looked down on the 50-something pregnant woman. From Samantha's perspective, Brooke's face was partially obscured by her big breasts. \"So how far along are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not quite sure,\" Samantha said, rubbing one hand against her belly gently. \"My babies seem to be getting big pretty fast so it's hard to tell. They're already kicking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't be surprised, with a belly this big,\" Brooke said, aggressively rubbing Samantha's belly, even rolling up her shirt some. \"Huh. No stretch marks. I'd figure you'd be covered in them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm sure you don't have any,\" Samantha smiled back sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" Brooke said. \"I have a feeling I'm going to carry this pregnancy <u>very</u> nicely.\" Samantha's fake smile slowly turned back to a look of annoyance. She certainly hadn't planned for all her coworkers to become pregnant, but when the possibility crossed her mind, she looked forward to the perky, sexy Brooke DD getting fat and saggy with child. But just the opposite happened. Brooke had never looked better and she now had a glowing, motherly aura about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, I'm carrying twins,\" Samantha said, trying to jut her belly out a little. \"And did you hear that Lisa's pregnant too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Brooke said, now rubbing her own small bump with her wide open palm. \"Well it's going to be a very interesting next couple of months, isn't it?\" With that, Brooke strolled out of the room, off to traumatize some young boys and girls with developing hormones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Months? The way things have been going, it'll be an interesting couple of days</i>, Samantha thought as Brooke walked out the door.</span></div></div>",

Mommy's got some work to do and then we'll go to the mall with Aunty Nina. If your very good, Mommy will give you some ice cream\" she said to herself with a smile, her hands exploring that vast expanse of her midsection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And even if you aren't Mommy's still going to have ice cream\" Samantha said with a chuckle. It was all still surreal to her; being pregnant. She never in a hundred years thought she would be, and her she was 55, single, and pregnant with twins. But then again, she never thought she would come across a magical coin that caused pregnancy and seemed to be working it's magic on her co-workers, men included. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed to herself, knowing there was nothing she could do about it now, and walked (although now turning more into a full-on waddle) to class. Today was a test day, one that she had been preparing her students for. The state wanted test results, and the only way to get test results was to well... test. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha was crazy about the state testing kids of useless stuff for the purpose of whether or not the kids were learning, it was a waste of time to her. She would much rather spend the day teaching them instead of sitting at her desk with a book. But luckily for her today, the fates seemed to be aligning for the single pregnant over fifty teacher. She could actually sit down for a while (standing this long seemed to be taking a toll on her) and after words, she could head out to the mall to get what she needed for two little bundles of... Samantha wouldn't call it joy right now, but she was getting there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding outside the door to her classroom, she took a deep breath, caressed her belly, and said to herself \"Here we go\". She didn't know how she was going to tell her students that their single teacher was having a baby, but it wasn't like she could hide it anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door and stepping through, it took mere seconds for the children's attention to turn from say, general chaos, to their teacher's ample midsection. Their mouths hung agape as Samantha slowly entered in, placing her hands in the small of her back for emphasis. \"Good morning class.\" <br>\r\nSamantha said, slightly sweaty from both her nerves and her current condition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I wasn't in yesterday, but well..\" Samantha slowly smiled, trying to get her point across without having to say the words. <br>\r\nOne hand slowly moved from the small of her back to the small sliver of belly-flesh that hung out from the shirt she was wearing. Slowly, still smiling, she slowly lifted up the hemline of her shirt to reveal her massive twin-filled belly to her class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm having a baby.. Well two babies to be exact..\" Almost on cue, her unborn son and daughter went into a kicking overdrive, their tiny pokes and jabs very visible under her very ample amounts of pregnant skin. Her class just stared on in silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, class any questions?\" Samantha said, slowly pulling her shirt down over her belly, well as far as it would go. <br>\r\nEVERY hand in her class went up at once. <br>\r\n\"I thought you said you weren't having a baby!\" One student said.<br>\r\n\"Aren't you too old to have a baby?\" Another student asked. <br>\r\n\"When are we going to meet the babies?\" A third student asked. <br>\r\n\"Don't you have to have a daddy to have a baby? You don't have a daddy in your life Ms. Peters\" A fourth student asked.<br>\r\n\"Why are all the ladies here having babies? The principal and the gym teacher are having babies as well!\" Another student said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile crossed the edges of her face. This went alot better than she thought it would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While those are all great questions, I think maybe your parents would be better answering some of those than me. Just know that I'm having twins and I'm very excited and nervous. Yes, I'm older than most mommies, but I'm going to do my best. I didn't want anyone to know right away because, when a older lady has a baby there are.. risks, but I found out that my babies are perfectly healthy, and growing very fast\" Samantha said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A little too fast </i> Samantha thought. \"Now, are you guys ready for your test? Once you're done, put your answer cards on my desk and wait until 12:30 to be excused to go home. Now, don't forget to do your homework this afternoon. Now that I'm going to be a mom, I'll have a special sense that will tell me when you're homework is done or not\" Samantha said, half-joking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha waddled back to her desk and sat down with a sigh of relief. The students took our their pencils and test books and began working while Samantha sat there, rubbing her belly, watching her students. Soon, her children would be born, and in a couple of years,they would be students just like them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wonder if I can have my own children as students. Hmm. They'd totally hate that</i> Samantha thought with a smile on her face. Mothers knows best ran threw her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime went by, the scribbles and scratches of pencils filling in answers and doing work the only sound in the classroom as Samantha sat awkwardly at her desk, browsing up pregnancy information. She still wasn't use to her ever-growing belly, but she was compensating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was reading articles on child-rearing and what to expect as her pregnancy continued...</span></div></div>",

With a shill ring, the time for test taking had come to a swift end, the students finishing up scribbling down their answers and placing the pencils down. <br>\r\nAwakening from a daze of pregnancy information, and rubbing the soft bare skin of her pregnant belly (deciding to loosen the strain on her poor shirt, lifting it up somewhat during the test), Samantha heaved (and their were no other words around it. She was now heaving herself out in and out of seats) out of her chair, placing one hand in the small of her arching back, the other bracing her standing action against the desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter coming to a complete stand, she took one hand and stretched out her shirt all the way down it could go, as her students handed in their tests, Samantha smiled, For this once brief moment in her life, she was truly happy. She was doing her job, she was pregnant, and she not a care in the world. She didn't worry about the bizarre changes her body was going through on a daily basis, she didn't have to worry about trying to care for two-children at her advanced age. She didn't need to worry about doctor's visits, bills, temper tantrums, college savings or anything of that. For this brief little moment in time, it was just her, her job, and her pregnant belly, with her son and daughter locked away inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye Ms. Peters! Goodbye Ms. Peter's babies!\" Amy said with a smile, placing a hand of the ample middle of her teacher with a smile. \"Ohh. Thank you Amy. But in the future, you ask a pregnant lady if you can feel her belly okay?\" Samantha said with a smile. \"Okay\" Amy said, taking her hand away and leaving the classroom to be dropped off by her bus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing to herself, hoping that her own children would be as smart and polite and kind as Amy, she gathered the tests up in her arm. \"Well then, I guess it's time for Mommy to shop for you two hmm?\" Samantha said looking down at her midsection with a smile. Gathering up her belongings, she filled the tests away, leaving them in a stack for Lisa to collect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha thought about the current situation with Lisa. She seemed happy enough to be pregnant, even at her age (Samantha laughed in her head at the phrase \"at her age\" since she was younger than Samantha) but she was worried that she, like Samantha, might be underestimating how hard it would be to be a single mother at their age. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind drifted to Brooke, who seemed to not only mind being pregnant, but would undoubtedly be able to take care of herself and her child, probably with the help of her parents, who would probably spoil their grandchild as badly as they spoiled Brooke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking towards her car, she caught sight of Dylan, his button up t-shirt tight against his small belly, his hand absentmindedly placed against the side of it, his face showing great concern as to what was happening to him. This \"mysterious pregnancy\" as Samantha had dubbed it, was the one that gave her the most regret. Dylan was a man, he couldn't possibly be pregnant, yet as she watched struggle to bend over to pick up something, and watched his movements, it was clear to her, he WAS pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDylan was going to be a dad.. or a mom. Samantha hadn't quite figured out the exact way to define this situation, but it was a situation none the less. Did Dylan know what was happening to him? Was he taking proper care of himself and his unborn child? What happened when he had to give birth? If he went to a hospital, they would take his child and lock him in a lab somewhere.. Then Samantha's eyes went wide as her train of thought went back to Chris and her next door neighbor. She used the coin on them, could it be happening to them as well? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had she done? She wanted to tell them, wanted to call them up, apologize profusely, but would they believe her? They just had to take a look at themselves, and seeing is believing right? Even if it's the impossible? A firm kick from one of her children drew her thoughts to her immediate needs, Dylan could wait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back to her car, she eased herself inside, adjusting her seat. Funny, it almost seemed like she was growing by the hour. \"I'm probably going to need a new car first. Maybe a mini-van\" She said to herself, adjusting the seatbelt over her pregnant belly. \"Oh god, I'm truly going full-on Mom in this case huh?\" She said, looking down to her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning the key to the ignition, the engine roared to life and she set course for the mall. After having a long conversation with herself over what she needed (although Samantha would argue that she was asking her children for their input on things), she pulled into a parking space. Unbuckling her seatbelt, she heaved her self out of the car, checking, double checking and then triple checking that she would have everything she would need for this prenatal shopping spree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking (though more waddling) into the mall, she found her way to Baby Universe, and waited outside patently for Nina and Chris to show up. She waited, and waited, and waited some more, frequently swapping her hands from her belly to the small of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after sometime waiting, she was finally met at Baby Universe by..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Samantha looked around, hand on her belly, as she saw Thomas and Christina, his pregnant mistress, heading her way.  Samantha froze, realizing that he had no idea that she was pregnant, and with twins no less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom noticed Samantha, and led Christina towards her.  \"Samantha, how are yo--OH MY GOD!\" he screamed, observing her pregnant state.  \"Are you--\"  \"Pregnant?  Yes, I am.\" she said, rubbing her rounding stomach as her babies kicked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you weren't this big a few days ago.  In fact, you weren't even showing.\" Thomas said, still in disbelief.  \"Well, I am having twins, after all.\" she said with a smirk.  \"TWINS?!  But what, whatever happened to you saying you didn't want any children?  Any now you're having twins right off the bat?\" he asked, becoming more and more dumbfounded as the conversation progressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what to tell you, Thomas.  I really don't.  Sometimes things happen for a reason without any explanation.\" she said.  Christina stepped in.  \"Congrats, Samantha.  You actually look a bit bigger than me!  How far along are you?\" Christina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, how far along are you, Samantha?  And who's the father?\" Thomas asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me</span> said the alien voice yet again.  On cue, Samantha grabbed the coin out of her pocket and gave it a flip, staring at Thomas.  She looked at the coin as it hit her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Tails!  No reality change!</span> the voice boomed.  Suddenly, Thomas's stomach began to rapidly expand, as the buttons of his shirt were popping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly kept growing, up until the point where he looked nearly eight months pregnant.  \"OHMYGOD OHMYGOD OHMYGOD!\" both Thomas and Christina shouted.  \"We need to take you to a hospital!\" Christina yelled, putting a hand over Thomas's pregnant belly.  \"I know that, Christina!\" he shouted back.  The two waddled away, leaving the mall as fast as they could.  Samantha wasn't surprised at all by this occurrence.  In fact, she had gotten used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that situation, Nina and Chris appeared.  Nina was still wearing sweatpants and a belly-baring shirt, but Chris was wearing a large jacket, which was weird, considering how warm it was outside.  They finally reached Samantha after a few minutes of Nina's waddling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Sammy!  Wow, look at you! You're bigger than you were yesterday! Those twins must be growing fast!\" Nina said, placing a hand on Samantha's belly.  \"H-hey Samantha.\" Chris said sheepishly, keeping his distance.  \"Oof!  She's right on my bladder!  We'll go shopping right after I hit the restroom, ok?\" Nina asked, before waddling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Samantha.  Could we talk for a second?  In private?\" Chris asked.  \"Sure, what's up?\" she asked, following Chris to a secluded area.  \"I think...I think I'm pregnant...\" he trailed off.  \"What?  Pregnant?  Come on, Chris, men don't get pregnant!\"  she said, trying to calm him down, even though she knew that that statement wasn't true.  \"I mean, what do you mean you're pregnant?  You don't look pregnant.\" she said.  \"Oh really?\" he said, looking around.  After making sure the coast was clear, he unbuttoned his coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was right.  His stomach was large, giving him the appearance of someone who was seven, going on eight months pregnant.  His belly button was shallow, and would no doubt stick out soon.  \"Oh my God, Chris...\" Samantha said, not really knowing what to say.  She knew that he was already on edge with Nina having a baby, but she had no idea how he felt now that he looked to be adding at least one more to the bunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did this happen...three days ago?\" she asked, ignoring her babies' kicking as she felt Chris's taut stomach.  To her surprise, she could feel some slight kicks and jabs in numerous places.  \"That sounds about right.  Samantha...what should I do?\" he asked.  \"You should definitely go to a doctor.  I mean, I'm your size and I'm only having twins, so...\" Samantha replied.  \"But what about Nina?  What should I say?\" he asked.  \"Well, you're going to have to tell her at some point, so better now than later.\" she said.  Chris gave out an audible gulp, placing a hand on his very pregnant-looking belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm back!  Ready, Samantha?\" asked Nina, finally back from her bathroom break.  Chris quickly buttoned his coat, but Nina wasn't paying attention.  Nina led the way into Baby Universe, as Samantha and Chris followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina helped Samantha make purchases, from maternity clothes to baby supplies.  After making their purchases, they headed to checkout.  The cashier was a goth girl, which they both thought was odd, considering they both assumed that goths ate babies for breakfast.  \"Thanks for shopping at Baby Universe.  I hope that everything was okay for you.\" the goth said in a monotone voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me!</span> the voice boomed yet again.  Samantha once again grabbed the coin and flipped, keeping her eyes on the goth girl.  She looked at the coin after it landed in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Heads!  Reality change!</span> the voice rang out.  The goth's belly sprouted outwards, stretching the limits of her tight corset.  Her belly grew until she was about Thomas's size, and the corset had given way to her belly, baring it for Nina and Samantha to see.  \"Have a good day.\" she said, as if nothing had happened, and in reality, nothing did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha, Nina, and Chris all exited the store, and their bellies groaned in unison, Chris's the loudest of the three.  The babies began to kick and move around in Samantha's belly, which she didn't really expect.  \"Oof!  Boy, I'm STARVING!\" she said.  \"Me too!\" Nina replied, rubbing her belly.  The three then made their way to the food court, and prepared themselves for the feast that they soon would have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And by anything, everything was probably a better term.  From Chinese to Italian, the two pregnant women got as much as they could fill their plates with.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of paying for food at each individual restaurant, there was just one checkout station in the middle of the food court.  Since Chris was still getting food, Samantha and Nina waddled to pay for their food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey approached the cashier, who was a blue-eyed brunette who looked to be around 18 or 19.  She saw them waddling towards her, and noticed that they both were quite obviously pregnant.  \"Oh-Em-Gee you guys are both pregnant at the same time?  That's, like, totally amazing!\" she said in a high-pitched voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess you could say that...\" Samantha said.  Her thoughts were interrupted once again.  <span class=\"clred\">Flip me!</span> the voice rang out.  She grabbed the coin and gave it a flip.  It was almost becoming a routine for her.  Samantha noted that the cashier's name was Kellie, as her badge indicated.  Looking into her hand as the coin landed, she saw the outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Tails!  No reality change!</span> the voice boomed.  Nina payed for their food, as Kellie's face turned pale.  \"Excuse me, I have to, like, use the restroom.  Enjoy your--MRMPH\" she trailed, one hand covering her mouth, her other on her stomach, as she ran to the nearest restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that was weird.\" Nina chuckled.  \"Yeah, let's find somewhere to seat.\" Samantha said, trying to change the subject.  They found a table that would be able to accommodate their growing bellies and took a seat.  They ate their food at a speedy rate, as Chris joined them a minute later with a tray with more food than Nina and Samantha combined.  He began to devour his food as soon as he took a seat. \"Jeez, Chris, I'm beginning to think that you're the one who's pregnant...\" Nina said, watching Chris chow down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris let out a nervous laugh.  \"Yeah...yeah right...\" he said, before continuing his binge.  Samantha remained silent.  Chris was pregnant, and it was pretty obvious.  But she had to let him approach Nina about it.  She thought that that was what's right.  She gave a fake laugh as well.  A few minutes later, the pregnant trio finished their meals.  As they reached the mall's exit, they gave their farewells.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Sammy.  I'll call you soon, alright?\" Nina asked, one hand on her belly.  \"Sounds good.  See you guys.\" Samantha said, as they went to their cars.  Samantha put the multiple bags into her trunk and drove home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she parked in the driveway, Mark and Beth were just arriving home from work.  Samantha exited the car and waddled to the trunk, all the while trying to get her neighbors' attention.  \"Boy, being pregnant with twins and having to carry all of these heavy bags sure is hard!\" she shouted, just loud enough for them to hear.  \"Need some help, Samantha?\" Mark asked dryly.  \"I'd greatly appreciate it.\" Samantha responded with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark and Beth approached her, and Samantha noticed their own slightly rounded middles, about the same size as it was earlier in the day. They both grabbed a few bags each, leaving Samantha with only two to carry.  They took the bags up to the babies' rooms, or what would become their rooms.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha milked her condition for all it was worth, constantly rubbing her belly in front of them.  \"They're kicking up a storm right now.  Wanna feel?\" she asked as Mark and Beth were about to leave.  \"No.\" Mark said bluntly.  \"Uh...sure!\" Beth said in a somewhat excited tone.  Mark scoffed as his wife approached Samantha's belly.  She took a few minutes to feel the kicks and punches from Samantha's occupants.  \"Wow...that was...\" trailed.  \"Too much?\" Mark asked, obviously annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...just...I don't know.\" she smiled, one hand resting on her \"bloated\" stomach.  Mark grabbed Beth's shoulder and led her out of the house, not even giving Samantha a goodbye.  The silence afterward was broken by a loud grumble coming directly from Samantha's large stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cravings were getting the best of her, and she was craving...</span></div></div>",

If these cravings get any worse I'm gonna have to move there...\" Samantha said, giving her belly a pat as she grabbed the phone.  Calling the local Chinese restaurant, she ordered basically one of everything, and waited for them to deliver.  While she waited, she wanted to slip into something a little more comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled upstairs, making her way into her bedroom.  Samantha searched for something loose-fitting, and was able to find a pair of sweatpants that had belonged to Tom.  \"Well, at least he was good for something.\" she said out loud.  She then remembered what had happened earlier in the day.  \"Tom is pregnant, so is his mistress, but his wife that's been trying for months to get pregnant isn't?  Karma's a bitch sometimes.\" she scoffed.  Her occupants kicked sharply at that remark.  \"Ow!  Sorry, Mommy shouldn't swear around you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping into the sweatpants, she was able to find a t-shirt that she won at a school raffle a few years ago.  It covered a decent amount of her belly, but left about half of it exposed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha realized that she had to teach tomorrow, but luckily she wouldn't have to go half-naked, thanks to her maternity clothes.  And not to mention, Lisa, Dylan, and Brooke were going to be bigger as well.  Lisa was having one baby, a boy, Samantha already knew that.  Dylan was the same size as her, so hopefully he'd be in the same boat.  But Brooke was bigger than them.  What was she having?  Twins?  Triplets?  More than that?  Before Samantha could continue to think, the doorbell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha waddled back downstairs, and paid for her food.  She brought it over to her couch, and turned on the TV.  She spent the next few minutes channel surfing, of course eating while she did so, and finally settled on a TV movie called \"Drink of Life\".  In it, two roomates, one a fitness freak and the other a model, who became pregnant via an energy drink.  \"Pfft, yeah, like a magical pregnancy could ever happen...oh, right...\"she said, feeling a few kicks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her laptop beeped.  Samantha grabbed it, and placed it in her lap, resting the carton of noodles on her belly.  She checked her email, and was a little disappointed when she saw that it was just an email from Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\"><i>Hey, everyone.  Don't forget that tomorrow is the date of our annual parent-teacher conference, so be sure to be extra nice to your students tomorrow!  That means you too, Brooke. - Lisa (and Ian) Jacobs, Principal, Twin Hills Elementary School</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Great, there's nothing better than sitting for an hour while parents berate you</i> she thought, while placing the laptop next to her on the couch.  A strong flurry of kicks sent the almost empty carton of noodles flying off her make-shift shelf, as the carton's remnants splayed over her exposed belly.  \"Thanks for that.\" she said, giving her belly a playful flick, as she scooped the noodles back into the carton, and waddled to the bathroom to clean the sauce off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha scrubbed her belly with a wash cloth, and was able to make it squeaky clean within a minute or two.  She rolled the rest of her t-shirt up, and observed her pregnant form in the mirror.  Faint stretch marks were beginning to form, scattered around her belly, but other than that, she was round, big, and was only going to get bigger.  Samantha stifled a yawn, and realized that it was time to go to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that her bed would be most comfortable to her, but she couldn't bring herself to walk up those stairs again tonight.  Instead, she decided to sleep on the couch.  After grabbing a few spare pillows to make her feel more comfortable, she was able to get into a position to fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few faint kicks rolled across her round dome of a stomach, which comforted Samantha.  \"Good night, little ones.  You'll probably be bigger in the morning...\"she noted, her eyes slowly closing.  \"And so will I...\"she said, drifting off into sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She took a look back at the mirror across from the teachers lounge and began to walk towards it. As she drew closer to it she saw that her belly was visibly moving in spots quite frequently, no doubt due to her twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly though the tingling sensation she had been feeling began to fade, and suddenly her eyes widened and she gasped audibly as she saw in the mirror that her already distended belly began to grow even more before her very eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No please! Not another one!</i> She begged in her mind as the growing belly had already thrown her center of gravity and she staggered back, fortunately finding a chair and falling in a heap into it as the chair creaked loudly in protest at the sudden weight that had filled it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha moaned softly as her belly went past full term and began to look overdue with one as she felt her twins, and now however many more children kick vigorously, which she felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, her belly was not the only thing growing as she felt her breasts, thighs, and butt all begin to fill out and expand as well while her hips began to widen in response to the added children that had filled her now enormous orb of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the expansions had come to a close, and Samantha was left heaving and huffing as sweat was pouring down her face from the strain of the expansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, her heart stopped as she heard a knock at the door of the teachers lounge, and heard Lisa's voice call out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samatha? Hello?\" Her voice called out from the other side of the door worriedly. \"Samantha was that you I heard in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha decided not to respond, as she didn't know how her friend would respond to her new, even more gravid state. After what felt like hours, she finally heard footsteps growing softer and softer, signaling that Lisa had left the area, and Samantha let out a relieved sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shakily got up, wobbling a couple of times as she had to adjust to her new weight, and made her way over to the mirror, her pregnant waddle now much more pronounced. She looked over herself in the mirror and sighed sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe t-shirt, which previously had managed to just cover all of her belly, now exposed all of her enormous belly, which looked to be full term with twins now, the kicks of her children now clearly showing up against her skin without any obstruction. Her breasts, which had grown size-ably, were putting a clear strain on the top part of her t-shirt and made sure that any adult who saw her would probably shake their had at how much it showed, her cleavage having increased and even her nipples a bit visible against her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer previously loose sweatpants had not fared much better, and were clearly stretched to their limit as they were pulled tightly around her widened hips and fuller thighs and rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh God! I look like I'm wearing the same kind of clothes Brooke wears!</i> Samantha thought in disgust as she shook her head. Indeed, aside from her obviously much bigger belly, she looked almost exactly like her fellow teacher that she disliked so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Aside from the obvious reason, there's no way I can go into class like this!</i> She told herself as she looked at her practically form hugging clothes that looked horribly tight against her. She sighed sadly, knowing that the only thing she could possibly do was to go home and wait until the pregnancy ended, even though she knew the consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deep breath she began to waddle carefully outside the teacher's lounge and towards her car in the parking lot, her pace now much slower and the walk much more tiring due to her new passenger(s). Luckily she had picked a time just when classes were beginning, and so no children or teachers managed to see her in her heavily pregnant state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha gasped for breath as she sat in the front seat of her car, her belly heaving in and out as she finally finished the trek to her car. She growled, frustrated as she noticed that she was leaning all the way back in her seat and she still had to angle her belly away from the steering wheel, and so she moved her seat back as far as it would go and managed to still reach the wheel and pedals, though to her shock her belly was still barely nudging the wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>God I've gotten so big!</i> She thought. <i>I've got to get home!</i> So she started up the vehicle and shifted it in drive and began to drive off. Unfortunately as she pulled out of the parking lot and began to head towards her home her belly gave an absolutely huge growl as a sudden hunger much bigger than ever before hit Samantha like a brick. She bit her lip as she knew she might not have enough to sate her pregnant hunger in her pantry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No!</i> She shouted at herself, <i>I've got to get home, no time for food!</i> Though even as she told herself this she was already placing a hand on her belly and rubbing it quite a bit as she thought of all the different food places in the area. So after much deliberation she...</span></div></div>",

Of course, the driver honked loudly and had a few choice gestures for Samantha, but at this point the hunger she felt was becoming painful, and she was too engrossed in finding a place to sate her appetite to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring that a buffet was the only place that could truly fill her up, Samantha decided to go to a nearby restaurant called Daring Dave's Delicacies. It was an establishment that was more family oriented, but had a large selection in its buffet line. The heavily pregnant teacher knew she didn't look very fit for the public eye in her clothes that hugged her body tightly, but the urge to eat was becoming unbearable, and so as quickly as she could she got out of her car and waddled inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside the cashier reacted quite shocked at the fact that she was dealing with a woman that was so...huge. Again though, Samantha was already eyeing the selection of food lustfully to care too much, and so paid no attention to the woman's wary and also somewhat disgusted attitude towards her attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Samantha paid she was off like a shot, getting not one, but two trays at once, and piling up as much food as she could onto each plate. She then sat down at a table in a corner that was relatively far away from the other families that were dining into the restaurant. She didn't even waste time sitting down, and tore into her food ravenously. She didn't care if anyone saw her, she just knew that she needed to eat as much as she could fit into her stomach. Her babies seemed to spur her on, kicking frequently as she kept her pace, tearing through chicken wings, pizza slices, and salads. Any and all food met its end at her mouth and traveled into her already immensely gravid belly, which seemed to slowly be bloating out even more due to all the food she was eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Samantha groaned and gave out a loud belch as she sat back in her chair. <i>Oh man I can't believe I ate so much...</i> she thought to herself as she placed her hands on her even more bloated belly, rubbing it slowly in order to aid in the digestion of the feast she had just consumed. She figured she had put away enough to fill at least 3 or 4 adult men, and indeed, the stacks of empty plates she had accumulated on her plate testified that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving another loud belch that would have made a grown man blush, she tried to heave herself out of her chair, and found herself much heavier and tired than when she had sat down to eat initially. After a few more tries however, she had managed to hoist herself out of the seat and slowly made her way out of the restaurant, her pregnant gait much slower and more pronounced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive home was uneventful, though she was anxious to pass the school in case someone noticed her car passing by, but luckily she went by without anyone stopping her, and arrived home after a few minutes. Feeling the urge to relieve herself, she got out of the car (a task made much more difficult due to the fact that her belly had expanded even more from the feast she had consumed.) and waddled as fast as she could towards her restroom. Unfortunately, she found it a bit difficult to undress herself since her pants were pulled quite taught around her expanded rear and thighs, but finally managed to get them off. With a sigh of relief, she relieved herself and her bladder and got back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning towards her mirror, her eyes widened at her state. <i>My God I really <b>did</b> overdo it at the restaurant didn't I?</i> She thought as she placed both hands on her enormous belly. Her poor shirt had already ridden up from the expansion she had gone through in the morning, and had given up altogether trying to contain her swollen middle by this point, the spread she had eaten making her belly bloat up to look like she was pregnant with yet another child. Samantha's eyes widened even more as she thought she noticed that her pants, and the part of her shirt holding up her breasts were already beginning to weather from all the strain they had been under, and were starting to tear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get some new clothes...and fast!\" She whispered, still not quite comprehending that she didn't used to be this big. Of course, she knew she couldn't stand around all day and so decided to waddle over and sit down on the couch so she could think on what she wanted to do. With a huff she plunked herself down on her couch and lay on her side, her immense orb of life jutting off the couch like a hump on a camel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was thinking over what to do on the couch, she then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she took a look in the mirror, she sighed in relief at first since her belly's swelling seemed to have gone down, but was still quite big. Then, she frowned as she realized that yesterday's meal was already starting to show on her body. \"I knew eating that much was a bad idea!\" She scolded herself as she noticed that at some point, the digested food had accumulated every where in her body. Her breasts now straining the shirt so much, it looked like she was wearing a new sports bikini top of some kind, her nipples easily visible through the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pants had given out at some point, and Samantha growled in frustration as she found herself clad in naught but her panties, which looked like a thong bought from a lingerie shop at this point, which meant that obviously the fat from her meal had gathered up in her thighs and buttocks some, and Samantha feared that the garment might snap at any second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a roll of her eyes and another frustrated sigh, she sarcastically complimented herself. \"Nice going Samantha...now you look even more risque than Brooke ever did!\" She said, giving herself a few mocking slow claps. However, the more she thought about it, the more she realized that she <i>did</i> look even better than before her pregnancy, a motherly glow all about her, her skin shinier, her hair thicker and more colorful. \"You know...I daresay I look downright amazing!\" She told herself, though this time meaning it genuinely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought back yesterday, and remembered all the looks of disgust the other mothers had given her as she had entered and exited, and all the men that had eyed her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer features hardened into a glare the more she thought about this. \"They're just jealous!\" She told herself while caressing her belly lovingly, \"they probably didn't carry their pregnancies nearly as well as <i>I</i> am!\" She continued, her thoughts turning more self-righteous and narcissistic with each passing moment. \"Why, those losers were probably angry cause their husbands found <i>me</i> more appealing than <i>them!</i>\" She reasoned, giggled in a fashion that she had never done before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout all this the spirit in the coin was observing her with glee. It knew before now Samantha would most likely have tried to destroy the coin in an attempt to undo all that it had created, and so took appropriate measures. Without her knowing it, the coin was slowly and carefully manipulating Samantha's emotions, memories, and thoughts into an altogether different personality. A personality that would be too wrapped up in itself and it's physical beauty to even care about what the coin was doing to its holder and the people it affected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short, the coin was turning Samantha's personality into something akin to Brooke's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Samantha though, she figured now that she was done admiring her figure, which obviously put everyone else's to shame, she had better find some nourishment to nurture her growing children. After eating a rather large breakfast, which while big was nowhere near the size of the feast she had tackled the previous day, she sat back and decided that she needed to get out today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then decided to get dressed in what she deemed \"appropriate attire,\" which at this point seemed to be a red sweatshirt that showed of a good amount of cleavage that would put even Brooke to shame, and some sweatpants that hugged her bottom almost to the degree that spandex would, her panty lines easily visible through the sweatpants. Of course, since no bra would fit her she had to skip it, not that her current personality minded anyway since it would most likely let people \"admire her\" more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...\" She hummed to herself while placing a hand on her lips in thought, \"what should Mama do today?\" she said, letting out a girlish giggle at the self served nickname, \"I should probably go out and buy some new clothes, I mean, this <i>amazing</i> figure isn't going to show off itself.\" She said, giggling again as she ran both hands over the curves of her body. \"Or...I could go and visit that loser I call friend Nina and see how she's doing, though she doesn't look half as good as me!\" she added with a snicker. After getting up from the table and heading out to her car, Samantha...</span></div></div>",

That was at least half the reason she put it on in the first place, after all.  But she hadn't expected the rush, the thrill, the ecstasy that came from knowing that all eyes were on you.  The stares from women, especially the glares, she dismissed as jealousy.  She didn't blame them though: Few, if any, could even dream of measuring up to her.  The stares from men, she reveled in.  She gave flirty looks back, letting them know she appreciated the admiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved slowly but surely, making her way to the maternity wear store.  The clerk was flabbergasted (clearly wishing she looked as good as her, Samantha was certain), but eventually recovered enough to help the massive mother-to-be find some clothing that would not only fit her, but also show off her simply gorgeous figure.  Having bought what she came for, Samantha thought about leaving, but remembered that she also needed stuff for the babies.  She would have gotten it yesterday, but with the way her day had gone, she had forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How thoughtful of that loser Nina to get me a gift card.  Guess she is good for something,\" she thought.  \"Too bad I missed the sale, though,\" she pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she made her way to the Baby Barn, she caught a glimpse of some t-shirts in a regular clothing store.  She stopped so she could get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them showed a large chili pepper with two smaller peppers on each side, for a total of five peppers in all.  Above them, on the chest, it said, \"HOT MAMA\".  The other one looked very similar, except it had foxes instead of peppers, and it said \"FOXY MAMA\".  Samantha smiled.  She simply had to have those shirts.  She grabbed one of each and made her way to the register.  The girl at the register, a petite red-head who couldn't be older than twenty-five, gave her a look, the kind that said, \"Are you a moron?\" without any words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, I don't think those are going to fit you,\" she said in a very condescending tone.  Samantha's good mood swiftly evaporated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am aware of that,\" she said, her voice sounding as icy as Antarctica, \"I'm getting them to wear after my pregnancy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" the girl replied, \"Well, good luck with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha found her temper rising rapidly.  \"And what is that supposed to mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weellllll,\" the girl drew out the word, \"I'm just saying that considering how huge you are, you might not fit them even after your kids are born.  But if you insist, I won't stop you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha saw red.  How dare this girl talk to her that way!  \"How rude of you, girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, my name's not 'girl', it's Heather,\" the girl said, pointing at her name tag.  \"Second, I was just giving you some advice.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All of a sudden the uncaring and indifferent look on Heather's face was replaced by one of confusion, and then one of pure nausea as her face suddenly paled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing alright there?\" Samatha asked as innocently as she could, though she had to hold a hand over her mouth in order to keep herself from snickering at the cashier's misfortune. Heather glared back at her, but the look came out a lot less strong than the girl had probably intended to due to the current wave of sickness that had washed over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm fine!\" She replied with a bit of hostility in her tone, \"I-I...excuse me\" She suddenly ran fervently to the back of the store where the restrooms were located, the audible sound of a person retching being very easy to hear throughout the tiny store. Samantha grinned as she heard this since that would indicate that the coin had worked it's magic on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Good riddance!</i> The now more snobbish mother-to-be thought to herself. <i>The nerve of her questioning my fabulous sense of fashion! Hmph, I almost feel sorry for her. She's probably half my age and not even full term and doesn't even look <b>half</b> as good as <b>I</b> do!</i> Samantha grinned as she admired her pregnant form in the mirror and gave her belly a loving rub with her hands. She turned back around as she heard Heather emerge from the bathroom, the petite red-head looking a lot worse than she had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything alright in there?\" Samantha asked with a cheerful tone that seemed to annoy the clerk even more, but at this point the poor girl just wanted the older woman to leave so she could recover from her sudden unexplained bout of vomiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah here just let me ring the shirts up.\" Heather said as she hurriedly rang the bar code of each shirt and added the total up. \"That'll be $22.43.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha paid the amount requested and happily grabbed the new shirts she had bought. As she exited the store she sat down on a bench and collapsed in a fit of giggles at what she had done. The look on the girl's face as she felt the morning sickness hit her was absolutely <i>priceless</i>! Though, the little part of Samantha that was still her old self began to wonder if she had gone too far by using the coin. However, her new self quickly dismissed the idea. <i>She deserved it!</i> She thought with an air of arrogance, <i>If she hadn't been so jealous of how well I was carrying this pregnancy and insulted my looks I wouldn't have had to do that!</i> Nodding in what she thought had justified what she had done, she slowly brought her self to her knees and placed her hands on her back as she arched her belly forward to get the cricks out of her back that had been bothering her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what to do...\" She whispered to herself while looking around for where to go next. Her hand that didn't have bags began to absentmindedly span the globe of her orb of flesh. She noticed that the babies's kicks had started to act up again and began to rub more frequently in an attempt to calm them down. Her belly suddenly gave a loud rumble that signaled to her what she needed. Samantha blushed and giggled as she heard this and looked down at her enormous belly, though it was covered up somewhat by the good amount of cleavage that her shirt was displaying. \"Oops, looks like momma needs to go and get herself some lunch!\" She cooed in a motherly tone as she looked up and began to decide where she wanted to go to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...I suppose that I could go to the food court to eat...or I could go visit my 'good friend' Nina and see if I can't bum a meal off of her...it's all she's really good for anyway!\" She said to herself with a snort. Finally turning, she decided to...</span></div></div>",

The door was violently swung open by none other than Brooke, who looked different to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer already ample breasts had grown slightly, and it was obvious that her behind had done some growing as well, evident in the yoga pants she donned.  But the most surprising thing was her belly.  It was enormous, looking nearly eight months with a single baby, and was even bigger than Samantha.  Her athletic shirt did nothing to cover her belly, riding up to her protruding navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you losers looking at?  Never seen a girl gain weight before?  It's this crappy school food that's doing it...\"she said, grabbing some muffins from the table, eating them ravenously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha approached Brooke.  \"Hey, Brooke.  I just wanted you to know that I'm pregnant.  With twins.\" she said, rubbing her belly for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke looked at Samantha's belly, then to her face.  \"Humph,\" she said between bites.  \"Aren't you a little old to be having kids?\" she sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn't shock Samantha, but she tried to be calm.  \"Well, Brooke...are you sure that that's just weight gain?\"she gestured to Brooke's large belly.  \"You kinda look pregnant...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?  Pregnant?  Yeah, right!\" she scoffed.  \"I mean, look.  Does THIS look like I'm pregnant to you?\" she chuckled nervously, pulling up her shirt, revealing her bared belly.  It was perfectly spherical, not a stretch mark to be seen.  Brooke tried to push her hand into her rounding belly, but it had no give.  Samantha didn't even let Samantha answer, as the bell rang.  Brooke pulled her shirt down as far as she could.  \"See you later, loser.\" she said, bumping into her with her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha waddled to her classroom as the children flooded into the room.  Samantha stood in the front of the room, as the children stared at her size in awe.  \"Gather round, kids.  I have an announcement to make.  I am indeed pregnant.\" she said, as some of the children's jaws dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you were as big as my mommy two days ago.  How come you're bigger than her now Ms Peters?\" said one child.  ''Well, I'm having more than one baby.  It's twins.  A boy and a girl.\"  \"Really?\"said Amy excitedly.  \"Yes really.  They're actually kicking right now.  Would you all like to feel?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha rolled up her shirt as the children approached.  The children took their time feeling and rubbing her belly, feeling her children kick.  This made Samantha feel incredibly happy and more maternal than she had ever felt.  The lunch bell rang, and Samantha waddled her way there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the cafeteria, Samantha picked up the tray of a chicken sandwich, tater tots, and sliced fruit, and looked for a table.  Surprisingly, Dylan was not there, nor was Lisa.  But Brooke was, stuffing her face with the food on the tray, which appeared to be her second one of that lunch.  Samantha decided to take a seat next to the large gym teacher.  \"Hey, Brooke.  Where's Dylan and Lisa?\" she asked.  \"They're having a meeting.\" she said, scarfing down the food.  Samantha began to eat her food with determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooke leaned back in her chair, pulling up her shirt to rub her belly.  \"Well, it's gonna be tough to lose this weight when the food is so damn addictive here.  It's so unhealthy, though.\"she moaned, rubbing her belly.  Suddenly, she jolted upright in a shock.  \"Wh-what?\" she asked, moving her hands around her swollen belly. \"Brooke what's wrong?\" Samantha asked, concerned.  \"N-n-nothing...just...this food's trying to digest and it's moving around a bit...I think...\"Brooke said, eyes widening.  Samantha placed her hands on Brooke's belly to see what the fuss was about.  Indeed, something was moving in there, and it could even be seen under the surface of Brooke's tight belly, but Samantha was sure that there was more than food in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Brooke is pregnant!  But why is she so big?  How many kids is she having?</i> she thought.  Samantha knew she couldn't have Brooke freak out in the middle of lunch.  \"Yeah, it's just some bad digestion, I think.  It should stop soon.\" she said, reassuring Brooke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the half-day Samantha spent teaching her class.  As the bell rang, Samantha waddled to the parking lot.  There, Brooke was hitting her car.  \"Damn it!  I hate this car!\" she said.  \"Car troubles?\" Samantha asked.  Brooke turned to her.  \"Yes, loser!  I...I'm sorry, it's just...I need a favor.  Could you please take me to my doctor?\"she asked desperately.  \"Me?  The loser?  Why can't you get someone else to take you?\"Samantha asked, in total control of the situation.  \"Are you kidding me?  Most people here are jealous of me, Lisa has a lamaze class, and Dylan has been acting weird lately.  Please.  I need you.\"  Samantha sighed, rubbing her belly as her children kicked inside.  \"Why do you even need to go to the doctor's anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm pregnant.\"</span></div></div>",

She and Brooke had never gotten along, even before all the awful things the blonde bombshell had said to and about her recently.  Her attitude was appalling, her dress was indecent, and her flirtatiousness was infuriating.  She also didn't like the way that the gym teacher had been going after Dylan (conveniently ignoring the fact that she wouldn't mind going after him herself).  Yes, Samantha had very little reason to say yes to Brooke's request.  But any refusal she would have made died in her throat when she saw the look on her face.  It was a look full of confusion, shock, fear, anxiety, and more.  It was a look of a person who was desperately trying to deny what was happening to them, but was increasingly unable to.  It was the look of someone who was afraid not only that their suspicions about their situation were true, but of what the truth would mean for their future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, before she had finally come to terms with it, that look had been on Samantha's face too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, Samantha felt a great sympathy for Brooke.  Not too long ago, she had been in the exact same situation that the woman in front of her was in now.  How could she ignore the predicament she was in?  And there was the risk of her or the babies (there had to be more than one, given her size, she thought) getting hurt or worse.  Even without the feeling of empathy she now had, she didn't hate the woman enough to wish physical harm upon her.  No, she couldn't refuse, her conscience (and possible maternal urges) wouldn't let her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, okay.  Come with me,\" she said, waddling off to her car.  Brooke stood there for a moment, then followed after her.</span></div></div>",

I'm getting bigger every day, but I think it's because I'm having twins.\" Samantha replied, as kindly as possible.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange to see a different, kinder side to Brooke, but maybe that was her maternal instincts kicking in.  Samantha didn't know how long Brooke would be this calm, so she decided to milk it for all it was worth.  \"How many babies do you think I'm having?\"  Brooke asked, giving her belly a rub.  Samantha tried to reassure her.  \"Well, we need to make sure you're actually first.\"  Brooke just sighed.  \"Come on, Samantha!  Do you see <b>THIS</b>?\" she asked, giving her rounding middle a light slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point.  I really don't know.  I mean, you're nearly bigger than me, so I'd guess twins, at least.\"  Samantha replied, with a weak smile, her children kicking as she mentioned them.  \"Shit.  I can't be pregnant!  I haven't had sex in months!  And how am I supposed to support a child?  Or more?\" she huffed.  \"Who's your doctor?\" Samantha asked, trying to change the subject as best as she could.  \"Kristen Harper.\"  Brooke replied, looking down at her belly.  <i>Good, we have the same doctor.  Maybe I can talk to her to see why I'm growing so much. Samantha thought.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha and Brooke sat in an examination room, waiting for Dr. Harper to arrive.  Minutes later, the door opened.  \"Sorry, for being late.  It's hard to get from place to place with this big belly here!\" Dr. Harper said, rubbing her belly for emphasis.  Samantha, long time no see!\" she joked, then turning to Brooke.  \"Wow...big...uhhh.  So, Brooke, would you mind telling me how you got this way?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two days ago, I got sick at work, so I went home.  I was throwing up, but I was so hungry.  When I fell asleep, I had a weird dream.  I was pregnant, as big as a house.  I woke up in the morning, and I was extremely bloated, and my boobs were bigger.  I was still super hungry, and I had weird cravings.  Basically all yesterday I stayed home and ate, and I finally decided to go back to work today.\" she said, taking heavy breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That actually sounds somewhat in line to what Samantha was saying.  Lay down for a moment?\" Dr. Harper said, as she pulled over the ultrasound machine that was sitting in the corner of the room.  Brooke pulled her shirt up, and Dr. Harper began to apply gel to Brooke's rotund middle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa.  No wonder you're so big!  You're having quintuplets!  They look to be around three months!\" Dr. Harper said, excitedly.  Brooke let out a small yell.  She obviously did not want to be in this situation.  Dr. Harper gave Brooke a few pamphlets, and sent her on her way.  Samantha almost forgot about talking to Dr. Harper.  \"Hey Brooke, would you mind waiting in the car?  I need to talk to Dr. Harper about something.\" Samantha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha opened the door of the examination room, where the doctor was taking a look at Brooke's ultrasound.  \"Can I talk to you for a second, doctor?\" Samantha asked.  \"Sure, Samantha!  What about?\"  \"Do I look...bigger to you than yesterday?\" she asks.  \"Yeah, you do, actually.  Let me give you another ultrasound.\"  Dr. Harper rubbed the wand over Samantha's belly.  \"Huh.  The babies appear to be a little over six months along, but they were five months yesterday.  Odd.  Tell, you what, come back in two days, and bring Brooke along with you.  Okay?\"  Samantha agreed, and said goodbye to the very pregnant doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car ride to Brooke's house was silent, as she was still in shock.  Samantha dropped her off and headed to the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As the tingling sensation worked up to its peak throughout her body, Nina doubled over and moaned in pain clinching her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped out weakly, \u201cwh what\u2019s happening  to me..\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one around her reacted at first to her bending over in pain not even her husband Chris. Who was standing directly across from her, her belly started to distend expanding as she filled with a babe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing liquid flowed into her womb, gradually filling her with amniotic fluid her flesh began to round up quickly into a small baby bump. Her chest started to follow swelling up a cup size, nipples hardening and starting to become erect. B tits becoming cupped tighter into her bra, her belly bugles under her t shirt creaking farther into a visibility pregnant swell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina whined weakly in disbelief, her eyes clinched shut a rush of sensation shooting through her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs milk bloated her breast into a c cup, bra strap getting tighter more amniotic fluid rising her womb. Her t shirt was starting to push up the cloth, climbing forward into five months. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarmth pooling in her core, a snapping noise echoed around her. A groan of relief escaped Nina, her bra broke apart the fabric ripping in the back, her breast flopping onto her raising belly. They jiggled at a greater size of double DDS, her shirt was peaking up revealing a bit of skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha snapped back to reality. She looked at her friend, and noticed that, she was bent over her belly was growing \u2026.growing?! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly was pushing out, breast doing the same at a frightening pace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH my God!\u201d, she exclaimed in shock, Samatha could only watch in horror as Nina continued to expand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swollen flesh groaned, more amniotic fluid stretching her outwards into six months. Her womb crawling downwards with the weight from the coming babe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistending belly greatly stuck out a clear foot in front of of her, as her t shirt traveled up the length of her swell. Getting caught atop around her navel which poked out halfway into the open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina cried out in horror, \u201c it\u2019s not stopping! Why isn\u2019t it stopping what is happening?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grew increasingly more swelling into the second trimester, bigger rounder fuller Nina\u2019 s sided popped out again her will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer navel thumped out, the baby distending her belly greatly it stuck out proudly atop her taut tight gut. The pink haired teens knees quivered from the oncoming weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grew increasingly more pregnant, swelling into the second trimester, bigger, rounded, fuller Sakura\u2019s sides popped out against her will. Her belly forced her t shirt up higher, it slid all the way the engorged flesh leaving her belly out in the open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shirt came to rest heavily under her milk filled breast. Her jeans hugged her wider frame, which were wider thighs plumper to support the oncoming weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moaned shaking hand coming to cradle her engorging mound she was at least seven month pregnant now. <br>\r\nJust from how far her belly was from her body, sweat dropped down her face and her hair clung down on her forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting from the strain she was feeling due to her growth, Nina\u2019s eyes slipped open her huge breast taking up her vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen had she closed her eyes? Finally her growth was slowing down skin creaking one last time. Her navel thumped out, signaling her descent into eight months pregnant. Her eyes widen in disbelief and horror as the 44 year old woman took in her new form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a huge set of bigger boobs, a wide fat belly rounder sides and a thumb sized navel atop it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whimpered when something inside of her kicked against the skin. \u201cI\u2026.I\u2019m pr-pregnant?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the button on her pants popped off and zipped down as her belly sagged in it conquest for more space. She gasped taking all the changes on her body, breast extremely swollen with what she could only guess was milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat atop her expansive womb, glass hanging out so wide it could have been a couch cushion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOmg Nina?!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly hell!\u201d , two voices exclaimed at the same time as Chris finally saw what had happened to his wife. While Samantha tried to grasp what had just occurred to her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced down at the coin in her hand, then back up at Nina\u2019s eight month pregnant belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way\u2026\u201d she mumbled softly, while Nina\u2019s husband Chris stood next to his wife checking her over. <br>\r\nShe tried to pull her shirt back down over the swell, but it only slid back up her belly stopping just above her poked out navel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his hand on her lower back to help support her balance as she wobbled a bit on her feet not used to the sudden weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright? \u201c, Samantha asked putting the coin back in her pocket, she stopped on her other side eyes falling atop her huge belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich she was rubbing back and forth with her left hand glancing up at her she replied, \u201c I \u2026 I think so, I\u2019m not sure what happened but I think I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut honey you weren\u2019t just\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina waved Chris off and said, \u201c I know, I know people don\u2019t  become magically pregnant but how else do we explain this.\u201d <br>\r\nThe blonde took her husbands hand placing it on her swollen belly where he felt something kick against his palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026.so\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYea\u2026Samatha we\u2019re gonna go to the hospital do you want to come or?\u201d, Nina asked trying in vain to cover herself with her arms. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Inez was the star player. Samantha hadn't seen her since their class reunion ten years earlier.  Amazing that Inez still looked young; her red hair was bright so it must have come from a bottle, but she was as slender as when she played center on the basketball team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha quickly pushed through the crowd to catch up with Inez who appeared to be headed toward the gate to leave the flea market.  \"Inez.  Inez,\" called Samantha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInez turned around.  She saw the older blonde rushing toward her.  When she drew closer, Inez recognized Samantha.  \"Hey, Samantha!  I never dreamed I'd see you here, or anyplace other than a class reunion.\"  The two women shared a hug.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha laughed.  \"I couldn't believe it was you, Inez.  You've been on my mind a lot lately.\"  She seemed flustered for a moment.  \"Oh, gosh, I completely forgot the coin.\"  She looked around.  \"I just had an old coin and flipped it, but before it hit the ground I saw you.  I wonder if it landed heads or if it was tails.  Oh, well, it doesn't matter.  It was just an old coin I paid a buck for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInez smiled.  \"It must have been magical because I've been thinking of you lately.  Let's go have a drink and catch up on things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\"  Samantha said.  \"Let me tell my friends who I came with so they won't worry about me.  Oh, there they are.  I'll be right back.\"  She hurried to where her friends were.  \"Hey, you guys, I'm going for a drink with an old school pal.  Glad you brought me here today.\"  She started to walk away.  \"Oh, you can keep the coin.  I'm no longer interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friends waved and shouted. \"The happy face was up so that was good.\"  Not knowing anything about the coin, Samantha didn't know it meant Inez would soon be dealing with being pregnant.  She hurried back to Inez.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam, I'm glad you found me today.  It's some kind of miracle.\"  Inez drove toward downtown.  \"Where would you like to go?  I like the Rainbow, but if another place fits you better, say the word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, the Rainbow bar's fine.  I've been there with gay friends at times.\"  Samantha smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInez was curious.  Learning that Samantha had been to the Rainbow might mean something special.  \"I haven't seen you when I've been there.  Sam, have you come out as a lesbian?  I have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha was stunned for a moment.  She looked out the side window at some children playing in the park.  \"Well, I've thought about it.  When I think about my life, who I married, my decision to end the marriage, and things like that, I wonder about my heart.  Actually, Inez, my happiest years was in high school and being on the team, not just basketball, but softball, field hockey and tennis.\"  She twirled a strand of hair as she looked at Inez.  \"I had a crush on Jeannie in ninth grade and you in twelfth; but maybe I just enjoyed good friendships.  And, I never really felt love's excitement in my heart all the years with my husband.  He said it was because I didn't want his kids, but I think it was that I really wanted to be with a woman.  I might be a lesbian.  What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl, I know I am.  I came out after my thirtieth birthday and have lived happily ever since.  Of course, my parents disowned me but I did fine and had a wonderful wife for eight years.  She died of breast cancer and I still miss her.  This might surprise you.\"  Inez stopped at a red light and looked into Samantha's eyes, \"I had a crush on you all my senior year and, my Mary even looked like you.  That may have been the reason I fell in love with her when I did.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inez, really?  You did?  Too bad we couldn't act on our girl crush back then.  Maybe we'd have gotten together.  One thing I'll do right now is to say 'I am a lesbian; always was; always will be.'\"  She smiled.  \"Wow, a big weight just lifted off of me.  I'm finally free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInez and Samantha went inside the bar and ordered drinks.  After she took a drink from her glass, Inez put her hand on her stomach. \"Excuse me.  I've gotta run; I think I'm going to throw up.\"  She hurried to the rest room where she 'lost' her lunch and felt queasy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha followed Inez.  \"You look peeked, so white.  Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine.  Who knows, maybe I'm pregnant.\" She laughed. \"As if that were possible; no man's been inside me; not ever!\"  Inez stared laughing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure,\" said Samantha as she laughed with her friend.  \"Sure, you're a virgin and pregnant.  That'd be some kind of miracle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course  I'm not.\"  Inez led Samantha back to their table.  \"What kind of coin did you say you bought?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was gold and had a smiley face on one side and a frowning face on the other.  Didn't meant anything to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam, that's the coin.  We're pregnant if you looked straight at me when you flipped it.  Everyone's been talking about such a coin and we joked about someone here at the bar finding and flipping it.  I can't believe this.\"  Inez paused for a minute. \"Okay, Sam, we're in this together. You gotta go with me to the doctor tomorrow to find out.  There must be a wonderful reason both of us were at the flea market today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inez, you mean we suddenly see each other after all this time, know we're lesbians who had a girl crush on each other and now are bound by the coin. That makes me happy.  Wow!  Makes me happy.\"  Samantha grabbed Inez, pulled her close and kissed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInez relaxed in Samantha's arms.  \"Even if the coin thing and being pregnant mean nothing, Sam, I want to marry you and be with you for the rest of my life.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha laughed. \"I've heard about the coin but figured it was a myth.  How could such a thing be real?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInez laughed with her. \"Honey! I hope it's not a myth.  I'd love to have a baby and to have you as my wife.  If wonders can happen, let it be.  Let's go home and make heavenly love tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha smiled.  \"Sounds wonderful!  Let's go.\"  She put a tip by their glasses and left the bar hand in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInez drove to her home.  \"Welcome to your new home, Sam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Inez started dinner.  \"Sam, even if this pregnancy thing is a myth and I'm not pregnant, I want to spend the rest of my life with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha looked into her eyes.  \"That's what I want.  I've never forgotten you and how much I wished we could have been more than friends.  I have peace in my heart about acknowledging I'm a lesbian.  And, I want to always be with you.  What will we name her if she's a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInez laughed.  \"Any name you choose as long as its our middle names; that would be Lou Ann.  What if its a stinkin' sweet little boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha laughed.  \"We can flip a coin, maybe a penny and if it's head, we'll name him Lincoln.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds perfect.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInez took Samantha by the hand and led her to the bedroom.  \"Let's shower together then I want to make love to you.  Your first time as a lesbian with a lesbian who loves you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, both women were under the warm spray of the shower sharing kisses, hugs and enjoying soft touching as their bodies drew together.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo days later, Inez went to the doctor and learned that, indeed, she was pregnant.  She stopped at the gift shop and bought two little dolls to present to Samantha that evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of dinner, Inez presented a wrapped gift to Samantha.  \"Something special just for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Samantha opened the box, she shouted gleefully.  \"Wonderful!  Wonderful!  we're going to be mama's.  I love the idea of sharing a baby with you, Honey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey kissed and went to bed that evening with loving to share and dreams of joy in their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInez awoke every morning to rush to the bathroom, throw up, then laugh because she was pregnant and was happy to share the baby with her wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Inez's clothes no longer fit her; strangely she got bigger faster than any pregnancy she had ever heard of.  She worried. \"Sam, this is too weird.  It's happening so fast.  What do people say about that myth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inez, I've heard the pregnancy takes nine days instead of nine months.  Maybe we need to buy things for the nursery right away.  Let's go tonight.\"  Samantha picked up her car keys.  \"Let's go to Target tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's do.\"  She followed Inez out the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two mothers-to-be had fun selecting a crib, bathinette, baby clothes and other supplies at Target.  The store clerk asked them, \"Usually, the mom-to-be brings her husband with her to buy things for the nursery.  Why isn't he with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mothers-to-be laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stayed up late that evening putting things together in the nursery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying in lovers' arms, Inez and Samantha slept peacefully that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ninth day, Inez began to have labor pains.  \"Honey, it's time.  I'm in labor.  Let's go to the hospital.  You've got to be with me every minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the hospital, the Admitting Nurse wheeled Inez's to the birthing room.  Just before they got there, Samantha told her, \"Honey, I need to run back to the car for something.  I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked as fast as she could to the parking lot, opened the trunk of the car to get a gift she had purchased for Inez.  It was something special for the birthmother.  Just before she closed the trunk, she spotted something gold and shiny.  It was the coin.  \"Oh my God!\"  She picked it up and saw it was in fact the same coin  so she held it tightly as she walked back into the hospital. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got upstairs just in time to watch Lou Ann drop from her mother's body.  She smiled and whispered in Inez's ear,  \"Lou Ann is here not.\"  The mothers shared a kiss then reached to touch the tiny little girl placed on her mommy's tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After months of appearing in ads for creams to fix embarrassing problems, most of which she did not have, she finally landed herself a lead in a film that was due to start filming in a few weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had returned to her home town to visit her mother and celebrate the exciting news, Erica was in such a good mood she even agreed to take on the role of Juliet in the town\u2019s production of the Shakespeare classic, after the last actress twisted her ankle during rehearsal. She had done this play half a dozen times before, so learning the lines on such short notice wouldn\u2019t be a problem for her. <br>\r\nShe had just finished her first rehearsal with the group which also happened to be the first dress rehearsal.

With the opening night just over a week away there were rehearsals most evenings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had finished changing out of her costume and into her regular jeans and shirt, when there was a knock at the door. <br>\r\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d she trilled coyly, some of the guys had been eyeing her all rehearsal, she had no intention of anything more than suggestive flirtation, after all in a few months\u2019 time she would in the company of more attractive men.  <br>\r\nThere was no answer, \u201canyone there?\u201d she asked after a while, still no answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up and swept (something as an actress she spent years learning to do) over to the door and opened it. There was no one outside; she was just about to close the door when something caught her eye. It was a coin, \u2018a gift from a fan\u2019 she thought to herself and picked it up. She examined it whilst closing the door, on either side of the coin was a couple of pregnant\u2026\u2019women\u2019 she thought to herself as the alternative seemed impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished packing up and was just about to go when a alien thought shot through her head.<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me\t</span><br>\r\nErica took the coin out of her pocket, looked at it for a second, then she gave a shrug and flipped it. Time seemed to slow down as the coin sailed through the air before she caught it deftly.<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Look Erica</span> said the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica looked and saw\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Samantha was normally quite bitter and snarky before and now she was even more so since she lost out on the role of Juliet not once but twice and was playing the role of Lady Capulet.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is\u2026\u201d Erica\u2019s mother began.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about them, there are just nobodies who will remain nobodies,\u201d interjected Erica, and they sat in the rest of the journey in complete silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica had trouble at dinner, as her stomach was demanding, quite noisily, that is wanted sustenance then what she was giving it.<br>\r\n\u201cErica you\u2019re starving yourself,\u201d said her mother.<br>\r\n\u201cI am not,\u201d retorted Erica, her stomach groaned loudly.<br>\r\n\u201cYour body says otherwise.\u201d<br>\r\nJust then\u2026. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was calm, soft, seductive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're excited about getting the lead in that new movie that's filming soon, but you have to Erica. I've seen those photos of other actresses your age online. skinny as a rail, ribcage visible. It's not healthy. You should eat something else other than a salad. You're going to need the energy. The play is in nine days, and then after that you're leaving back to California to shoot that movie.\" Katelyn lectured, her age and wisdom echoing through her words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica looked at her mother. Time had been semi-kind to her, because despite being in her mid-fifties, the great beauty on her face was still visible, even if hidden behind wrinkles, grey hairs, and sagging body parts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I know. But, I'm okay really. I'm not going to starve myself, my stomach is probably just a little upset from whatever that was this afternoon\" Erica says, thinking back to her recent losing bout to vomiting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What as that?</i> Erica thought, but her train of thought was derailed by another thought that came charging through her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip Me Erica.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, she reached into the pocket of her jeans, grabbed the coin, and placed it into her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want you to be careful Erica. You're my only child, and I'm concerned, especially since you moved away to Hollywood. It's a whole different world out there. I mean, I see you on TV all the time for the skin commercials, so I know you're doing fine, but it's when your commercials are not on that I worry. I watch those reality shows during my lunch break at the bank all the time. I see what's it really like out there. I just want you to be careful!\" Katelyn said, her voice ripe with motherly concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, Hollywood is nothing like those tv shows. Besides, what are you doing watching TV in the break room? I thought as manager you're supposed to make sure those slackers are doing their jobs\" Erica says with a smart, smug tone in her voice. <br>\r\n\"Oh Erica, I'm the HEAD manager for the branch. I'm the queen of that castle, and I decided that a happy worker is a productive worker. So I managed to convince the higher ups that a TV in the break-room would help. They can have their lunch hour and watch a little TV.\" Katelyn says. <br>\r\n\"Yet, it's always on trashy California reality shows?\" Erica asks.<br>\r\n\"Tracy always gets the remote before everyone else. It's the only rule on the TV, who gets the remote first, picks what's on.

Erica mind was a blank, she felt sick in fact. She got up and ran to restroom, with her hand over her mouth, as fast as she could. <br>\r\nHer mother sighed again letting her sweater drop back over her swollen midriff and got up with some difficulty, \u201cat least one of my children is eating their money\u2019s worth tonight,\u201d she said to her stomach before waddling off to get her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter emptying her stomach for the second time that day, Erica stumbled over to the basin her mind spinning out of control with the image of her mother\u2019s pregnant belly.<br>\r\n\u201cHow?!\u201d she asked her reflection.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rays of light interrupted Erica's deep sleep.  She was lying on her bed, on top of her covers.  On instinct, she tried to get up quickly, but she was slightly weighed down.  Her previously flat stomach had been replaced by a bloated belly, between three to four months pregnant, if she actually were.  Running a hand over her new-found belly, she was surprised that it was very firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica was shocked that her shirt and unbuttoned jeans could not contain her belly.  \"Ugh...thank God I don't have rehearsal toda-URMPFF!\" she said, clutching her mouth and stomach as a wave of nausea hit her like a truck.  She ran to the bathroom in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, she had finished throwing up.  <i>I must still be sick...</i>she thought to herself, as her belly rumbled.  Making her way downstairs, she saw her pregnant mother at the table, eating a large breakfast.  Wearing pajamas, her shirt revealed most of her large belly, as she gave it a rub.  \"Oof!  That was a big one!\" her mother said.  <i>Mom's really pregnant, I guess.</i> she thought, entering the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother looked up from her plate.  \"Oh, hello Erica.  I didn't know you were awake,\" she said, as her eyes were drawn to Erica's own belly.  \"Look at you!  Still bloated from last night, I see.  You should have eaten you dinner!\" Katelyn said.  Erica glared at her pregnant mother.  \"I've told you five times I wasn't hungry.  But I kinda am now...\" she said, as her belly grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't want to eat much.  She COULD NOT gain weight before the play.  It couldn't happen.  But she was SO hungry.  She cooked up a meal of sausage and eggs and joined her mother at the kitchen table.  Erica began to scarf down the meal, almost against her own will.  Her mother eyed her suspiciously.  \"I thought you were trying to watch your weight?\" she said, rubbing her belly.  \"I know.  I'm going to go to the gym after this to try to work this off.\" Erica said, patting her belly, which was nearing the four months mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?  It's weird, but...yesterday you weren't pregnant and now...well, you are.  I feel like I'm going crazy.\"  Katelyn eyed her daughter suspiciously.  \"As I've told you before, eight months ago, I went on a date.  This guy gets me drunk, and the next thing you know, I'm knocked up, and I've never heard from the sleaze bag since.\" she said, rubbing her belly.  Erica thought for a moment.  \"Eight months ago?  I thought that helping me move to Los Angeles eight months ago.  You stayed there with me for a month.  Besides, you haven't had a date in years.\" Erica said.  \"No, silly.  You moved all by yourself!\" her mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Erica went to her bedroom to get ready for the gym.</span></div></div>",

Whilst she still had a body that many would kill for it was this self-conscious feeling at her belly which caused her to dress in sweats rather than her usual spandex short and singlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter covering herself Erica made her way to the gym, the trip wasn\u2019t pleasant one. First even through the thick sweats Erica could feel the seat belt pressing into her belly reminding her how much it stuck out, secondly the seat belt also was pressing into breasts which felt unusually tender, and finally her belly next to the steering wheel was making her feel cramped and bigger then she really was. Even though she felt it as soon as she entered the car Erica wasn\u2019t going to readjust the seat though, that would be admitting to something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got to the gym and made her way in Erica was greeted by a familiar face, \u201cHi and welcome to\u2026Erica is that you?\u201d<br>\r\nJules was somewhere between five and ten years older than Erica, with blonde hair done up in a bun and the kind of svelte body that someone gets for living a balanced lifestyle.<br>\r\n\u201cHi Jules,\u201d said Erica flashing her old membership card and tried to move along before\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cHaven\u2019t seen you here in a while, I tried that cream and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes, yes,\u201d said Erica as politely she could (which wasn\u2019t as much as she thought), that was the other embarrassment she had, right now she would only be known for ointments and creams for\u2026stuff, but that had payed off and would soon be forgotten in a few months after her movie.<br>\r\nThis embarrassment on the other hand would be dealt with right now, thought Erica whilst mentally touching her belly, she would never really touch it for the same reason she tried not to look at it, plus what if someone notice.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you and help or do you know what you doing?\u201d asked Jules.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d said Erica.<br>\r\n\u201cJust give me a call if you need anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking out was even worse for Erica, she felt so sluggish, somehow no matter what she did her belly always slowed her down or got in the way, being in sweats didn\u2019t help. Erica looked around the gym, most of those who were not in peak health and were probably coming here to get there. Out of the people Erica felt jealous of was Jules in her short shorts and polo shirt which was the outfit for the staff, or at least the female ones, the males were allowed longer shorts, suggesting the person who came up with the uniform was a man. It didn\u2019t help that Jules was athletically showing one of the guests how to use one of the exercise machine, a metal contraption crossed between a dentist\u2019s chair and something a blacksmith might use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several hours of lethargically using the machines Erica had to throw up again, whilst she was in the bathroom and checked she was alone, Erica took a look at her belly, to her shock it somehow seemed bigger. She left restrooms and to her shock that Samantha had arrived at the gym. Samantha was not pretty but elegant which is an artificial form of pretty, and Erica did not want Samantha to see her like this, especially in sweats. With a great amount of effort Erica crept her way to the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2026</span></div></div>",

Cursing herself and blaming yesterday exercise session and big dinner for her sleeping as long as she did, Erica tried to get up but found this harder the she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut them in the extra\u2019s dressing room, WHERE\u2019S HAS THE HAT BOX GONE?\u201d Simon was at his wits end, he was constantly at his wits end, he was that kind of guy who was worried and impatient with the world before he started at school and now he was the director of a play. He decided to go with Romeo and Juliet a classic that should be easy, though most of his crew and actors were simpletons who wouldn\u2019t know great drama if it hit them on the head, killed them, and blamed it on the brother. Erica was good a professional and whilst Samantha was cold and icy about not getting the part of Juliet it only served to improve her performance of lady Capulet, the only other competent actress had her ankle twisted after a scenery mishap with the balcony set, which caused them to waste another day reinforcing  every part of every set. Every other actor and actress was hopeless, the nurse kept smoking on set, the prince kept adlibbing lines all of which were foul and out of place and the actor who played Romeo was so bad at remembering his lines Simon was forced to get the man\u2019s twin brother to share the role with him so that both had to learn half the lines. And now the costumes had come in and every had lied about their real size and those who didn\u2019t had really unusual body shapes, it seemed like everything that could go wrong had, and things were about to get worse. \u201cWHERE\u2019S ERICA? IT\u2019S TIME FOR HER SCENE\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cShe locked herself in her dressing room and won\u2019t come out.\u201d Simon turned and saw Peter behind the piano talking to a man who had somehow managed to put the back half of a pantomime horse on upside down. <br>\r\n\u201cWhy won\u2019t she come out?\u201d asked Simon.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d said the man giving a shrug before lighting up a cigarette.<br>\r\n\u201cI told you lot not to smoke in here,\u201d said Simon before turning to Peter and saying, \u201cPeter, you and Sunny get everyone else ready I will sort this out.<br>\r\nThere was a small crowd outside the door to Erica\u2019s dressing room by the time Simon got there, \u201cErica what going on, it\u2019s your scene,\u201d he said whilst knocking on the door.<br>\r\n\u201cGO AWAY,\u201d came Erica\u2019s voice from the other side of the door.<br>\r\n\u201cShe screamed a few minutes ago,\u201d said a stage hand by the name of Jimmy, \u201cnot the lookout he\u2019s got a knife scream but the I stepped in something squishy and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, thank you Jimmy,\u201d Simon had worked with actress before and knew several things about them and how to deal with them. \u201cIs it the outfit?\u201d<br>\r\nThere was no response, \u2018that\u2019s a yes\u2019 thought Simon to himself, \u201cTo small?\u201d<br>\r\nStill no response, \u2018another yes\u2019, \u201cit was made for Sunny and she is a bit shorter than you and..\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cGO AWAY.\u201d<br>\r\n\u2018Nope,\u2019 Simon gave up he didn\u2019t have time to deal with this, he decided to use his next trick of the trade, \u201cIf you can\u2019t do the part I\u2019m just going to have to let Samantha t\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNO.\u201d<br>\r\n\u2018Bingo,\u2019 \u201cYou are going to have to come out then,\u201d said Simon.<br>\r\nThere was a very long pause before Erica slowly opened the door and stuck her head out.<br>\r\n \u201cCome on,\u201d said Simon calmly, or what he thought it was.<br>\r\nThe was an awkward moment where Erica stepped out into the hall, the outfit for the balcony scene was a pale blue nightie, which was made for Sunny who was shorter than Erica and not as full in some areas, but that would of only caused the nightie to be rather skimpy and someone Erica\u2019s body and vanity would have no problem with that. Except that Erica was now much fuller that she was before especially in the belly. There were several gasps and sniggers as Erica came into view, whose bulging belly cause the nightie barley reach her hips.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d said Samantha mockingly.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d said Erica blushing and trying to tug the nightie further down in fruitless attempt to cover her panties with were purple.<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of nothing,\u201d said Jimmy.<br>\r\nErica started to blush even more, \u201cEveryone back to you place, you all have jobs to do,\u201d said Simon, \u201cWill sort this out later just do the scene.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rehearsal wasn\u2019t good for Erica, first the balcony set creaked ominously as she walked on to it, and she was told to just practice on the stage whilst it was made sure that the set was safe. Secondly was the breeze, her backside was open to the wind and there seemed to a lot more of it, both the wind and her backside, and no matter which way Erica turn someone was going to get a good look at it. Finally was the stares, mostly at her belly, in particular it was the stare from Samantha, because whilst everyone else was staring in disbelief, Samantha was had a grin on her face at the sight of what Erica was going through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter rehearsal Erica was back in her dressing room getting changed into a large sweater the kind would appear on the model in winter clothing catalogue and some black pants, that she couldn\u2019t button up and only half zip up but at least had more give then her jeans.  Just as she was about to go she heard the voice in her head again.<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip Me</span><br>\r\nDespite it being in her head she thought it was coming from her handbag, which she reached into and pulled out the coin. Strange, she didn\u2019t remember putting it in there.<br>\r\nDoing as the coin commanded flipped and caught it<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Look</span> said the voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica saw\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Admittedly it had done a lot to help figure, flaring out her hips and increasing her breast size as before she seemed to have the body of a snake, though careful dressing had disguised that fact, and whilst pregnancy had moved her body slightly away from serpentine appearance, her distended belly still gave her the impression of a boa constrictor digesting some sort of mammal.<br>\r\n\u201cBloating, you nearly as big as me and\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s the father?\u201d interrupted Erica in an effort to steer the questions away from her.<br>\r\nSamantha, sighed,\u201d Don\u2019t you know I thought everyone did by now.

Not long after Erica left the room there came a loud groan from Samantha\u2019s belly, she felt immensely hungry. She felt hungrier than she normally did after getting pregnant but just now she felt like she could eat a horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Erica arrived home she found her mother waiting for her, by that it meant her mother was sitting at the kitchen table next to several emptied plate slowly rubbing her belly, when stood up with a bit of effort, when Erica passed the down the hall, \u201cErica you\u2019re back <i>urp</i>,\u201d she said catching her daughter up.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d said Erica turning around so abruptly that her bloated belly came up against her mother\u2019s.<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!

She was big, and not just in her stomach area.  Her recent, drastic weight gain (what she wanted to believe)  had spread to her breasts and butt along with slightly widened hips.  Judging from her mother's pregnancy, she figured that she looked maybe five or even six months.  Her breasts were larger, rounder and more sensitive.  She could also see that her nipples had darkened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on here?\" she said out loud, a hand on her belly.  After minutes of observing her expanded body, she put on pajamas (which were getting too small around the middle) and tried to go to sleep.  This proved to be a more laborious task than Erica had expected.  Laying on her stomach was out of the question, for obvious reasons.  Although she thought it would be possible to lie on her back, she quickly discovered that the weight of her larger stomach was somewhat difficult to bear.  After trying multiple sleeping positions, she had finally passed out from exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Dream</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heat of the stage lights caught Erica by surprise.  She stood on a balcony, dressed in a blue robe that was much too tight.  Looking down at her self, she noticed that her belly was gargantuan, possible due with triplets, or more.  Suddenly, she felt movement inside her stomach, making her realize that she was pregnant.  The crowd was in awe at her large size.  Off the side of the stage, Simon shouted, \"Line!  Line!\"  Without thinking, Erica let out, \"Romeo, Romeo.  Wherefore art thou, Rom--AUGH!\"  A sharp pain hit her massive stomach, followed by a large splash of water.  Suddenly, Erica's mother stood up in the crowd, a hand on her own belly.  \"Oh, Erica!  It's time!\"  Erica looked up at the lights, then faded to black.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------<br>\r\nErica woke with a gasp.  She looked at the ceiling, and realized that what just happened wasn't real.  \"Well that was just about the worst dream I've ever had.\" she said, taking a deep breath.  While still in bed, she thought about what she'd do today.  She didn't have play practice today, so the day was open.  Sitting up after numerous attempts, she was in awe at what sat before her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly had grown over the night, making her look well over six months pregnant, and nearing seven.  \"Just stay calm.  You're not pregnant.  You're not pregnant.\"  Her \"non-pregnant\" belly had other things in mind.  Erica began to feel movement from inside her belly, similar to her dream, albeit not as strong.  Erica let out a scream loud enough to wake her mother.  While the movement continued, Katelyn bumbled into the room.  Katelyn's buttoned-down pajamas could not contain her belly, as half of her shirt was unbuttoned.  Erica's mother was shocked.  Not only the fact that her daughter appeared to be pregnant, but the fact that she was close to her size, belly-wise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...\" her mother said, eyes widened.  It couldn't be real.  It had to be a joke.  She had to make sure of it.  Katelyn drew her hands to her daughter's beyond-bloated stomach and felt the movement inside.  ''Okay, I'm going to call Dr. Sommers and see if I can get an appointment for you, okay dear?\"  Katelyn said, trying to remain as calm as possible, not wanting to frighten her probably-pregnant daughter any more than she already was.  Rubbing her belly, she called the doctor's office.  After three rings, the receptionist finally picked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Triple Rainbow Pediatrics how may I help you?\"  \"Yes, I'd like to schedule an appointment for my daughter, Erica Shaffer.  As soon as possible, please.\"  After a few seconds of the sound of paper shuffling, the receptionist returned.  \"We have an appointment available twenty minutes from now.  Would that suit you?\"  \"Yes, thank you.\"  \"Before you leave, may I ask what the appointment is for?\"  Katelyn paused for a moment and looked at her big-bellied daughter.  \"I believe that she's pregnant...\"  \"You <b>BELIEVE</b> that she's pregnant?  Have you been able to identify any symptoms?  Like cravings or morning sickness?\"  \"Yes both of those.  She was sick two days ago.\"  \"Has she gained any weight?\"  She glanced at Erica.  \"Little is a bit of an understatement.\"  That was all that the receptionist needed, and she hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatelyn looked at her daughter.  \"Erica, we're going to see the doctor right now to find out what's wrong with you.\"</span></div></div>",

Her pregnant mother approached her, calmly grabbing her arms.  \"I don't know, honey.  But we're going to find out.\"  Erica put her hands on her swollen belly, noticing that the movement had ceased, for the moment.  \"Am--am I pregnant, Mom?\"  Katelyn didn't know what to say.  Obviously, she looked to fit the part.  But on the other hand, it seemed impossible, considering how much she had grown.  \"Maybe.\"  Erica's face went pale, as if that was the final word on that matter.  Katelyn helped her larger daughter up from the bed, escorting her to the car, both not bothering to change from their too-small pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive was silent, as both of the big-bellied women were thinking about what was about to happen.  Arriving at the office, Katelyn approached the desk where the receptionist was sitting.  She checked Erica in, and sat down next to her daughter.  A woman across from the two noticed the ladies and their big bellies.  \"Wow, so you're both pregnant?  Mother and daughter?  There's a show about that on TV!\"  This made Erica even more embarrassed, as she remained silent.  Just then, Erica was called into the doctor's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the cold examination room, Erica heaved herself onto the table, waiting for her doctor to enter.  Minutes later, her doctor, Dr. Rey, a married mother of three, entered.  Her long, brown hair flowed, and it was clear that she had benefited from motherhood.  When she first entered the room, she saw  Katelyn.  \"Hello, Ms. Shaffer.  How is the baby doing?\" she said with a smile.  \"Fine.  But I'm more worried about her.\" Katelyn said, pointing to Erica.  Dr Rey turned towards Erica, as her eyes widened.  \"Oh my, well now I see why you believe that she's pregnant!\" she said, worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor grabbed a chair and sat in front of Erica.  \"So, Erica, when was the last time you had sex?\"  \"Well over a year ago.  This started a few days ago.\" she responded, holding her belly.  \"A few days?  Please, give me a rundown of the past few days.\" she said, grabbing her clipboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three days ago, me and my mother were at a buffet.  While I was there, I threw up, and I got really hungry afterwards.  The next day, I was sick again, but it only lasted a few hours.  I noticed I was really bloated, and I was still hungry.  I tried to go to the gym, but I felt really tired.  The next morning, I was bigger, and I had a wardrobe malfunction at practice for a play of mine because I had gotten so big.  Now this morning, I was a lot bigger.  And earlier, I could of sworn I felt something moving inside. It's stopped since, but it really frightened me and my mom, which is what made her call.  Now here we are.\" she finished giving her belly a slap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Rey finished writing on her clipboard, and looked up at Erica.  \"Could you lay back for a moment?\" she said.  Erica obeyed as the doctor approached her.  She pulled back Erica's shirt, leaving her belly on full display.  It was incredibly round, and her belly button was still an innie, but was becoming increasingly shallow.  The doctor felt the tightness all over her rounded midsection.  \"Well, Erica, it would appear that you're around seven months pregnant, from the looks of it.  I don't see how this just started three days ago.  Let's just do a quick ultrasound to see what's really going on in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor rolled the ultrasound machine to the side of the table and began to squirt the ultrasound gel onto Erica's swollen belly.  Grabbing the wand, she pressed it into Erica's belly, moving it all around.  \"Ah!  I see one!  Wait, a minute, it looks like someone's having twins! No triplets! Wow!\"  \"Triplets?!\" Erica and Katelyn said simultaneously.  \"Yep!  Two boys and one girl!  My congratulations to you, Erica!\"  Erica didn't know what to feel.  On one hand, she had always wanted to be a mother--just not this young.  She also didn't want to be having triplets her first go around.  Dr Rey went to get a few papers for the newly expectant mother, leaving Erica and her mother alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you mad at me?\" Erica said, feeling her belly as her babies had began to kick again.  \"No.  I don't think so.  I just really want to know why this is happening to you!\"  \"Me, too\" she responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Rey then entered the room and...</span></div></div>",

Erica hypnotically reached for the coin and felt over it with her thumb and finger.  She was gazing absentmindedly around the room, her attention in a haze.  In the room was a mirror where she could vaguely see her own reflection.  She was almost afraid to look at herself in this state, ready to pop.  And it would for sure get worse.  She couldn't see her mother, but Katelyn was patiently sitting in the corner of the room, observing her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica's mother was an observant person.  She was very critical and capable of observing a lot about people.  This sudden change in her daughter had thrown her for a loop.  There was so much to consider; certainly Erica was in no place to care for three children.  Katelyn had enough to think about with raising a new child of her own.  It would likely mean that Erica would have to give up her children for adoption.  She was a little perplexed by how her daughter was behaving just now.  It wasn't normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Rey had returned with a folder of information and was telling them both about it.  She was a good doctor, and was going over a plethora of important  information concerning Erica's health and well being.  The poor girl didn't seem to be listening, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a glint of light as a coin flew into the air.  Katelyn couldn't tell if Erica was looking at Dr. Rey, or her own reflection in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coin fell perfectly back into Erica's hand, and the world began to change once more.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ll just catch a bus back if that is the case.\u201d<br>\r\nErica was in too much of a daze to go or to even point out that her mother was still wearing pajamas, she hopped into the car and started to drive home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she drove home Erica past several take away food outlets, her belly gurgled, it always seemed to be asking for food until she stuffed herself to bursting point and a few hours after that she would be hungry again. She had been resisting her hunger for the last few days, and now she knew why\u2026but she didn\u2019t, she couldn\u2019t be, after all Dr Sommers had pegged her at four months with triplets, but Erica hadn\u2019t had sex in over a year, somehow she knew it was tied up with the sudden pregnancies of her mother and Samantha but theirs were instantaneous and no one seemed to notice a difference, whilst everyone seem to notice Erica steadily growing belly. She held off going to one of the food outlets she didn\u2019t want anyone to see her pigging out, which she knew she would do if she decided to have even just a snack.<br>\r\nShe got home, went to her room and fell back onto her bed, there she lay for a while slowly rubbing her belly. She felt a kick Erica jolted it didn\u2019t seem to be followed by anymore, she tried not to think about it after all she couldn\u2019t really be pregnant, this must all be some sort of mistake. She heard some noises from the kitchen told her that her mother was back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Erica entered the kitchen, sure enough, her mother was already settling down to cooking up something that she bought earlier that day. Erica made her into the kitchen and stood there. Her mother turned to see her \u201cTriplets, well that explains the sudden appe\u2026.\u201d She began to say with a grin but stopped when she saw that her daughter was barley holding herself together. \u201cAwwww there there,\u201d she said went to hug Erica, this proved more difficult them normal, as the women could stand with faces about a metre apart and their bellies would still be touching. After a few seconds of awkward leaning forward Katelyn managed to embrace her daughter in a friendly comforting hug. \u201cThere, there,\u201d she said softly, \u201ca nice meal will make you feel better.\u201d Erica would of normally of said no, turning to food for comfort was not what she would do, especially if what she needed comfort from was the fact that she gaining weight. But she hadn\u2019t eaten all day and she was starving. At that point the oven pinged telling the world that it was finish, at the same time her belly gurgled. At least she could stuff herself at home without people watching.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Clothes were big problem for Erica as none of them fitted her anymore. When she was\u2026 she left that thought stop there, even though she saw it with her own eyes Erica didn\u2019t like to think that was something alive inside her, three somethings. She needed to buy some more clothes unfortunately she had rather late again, not as late as last rehearsal day but late enough to prevent her going to the shops to buy some new clothes and get to rehearsal on time. She could use some of her mother\u2019s maternity clothes, but knowing her mother they would have no style and would have been bought when she was having Erica so they would be even further out of fashion, beside her mother needed them for herself.<br>\r\nShe was proven wrong on this last point when she went down to the kitchen, dressed in her sweats, and saw her mother in her pajamas again eating a large lunch or breakfast or dinner, her life seemed to have become one large meal, Erica wondered why the woman hadn\u2019t exploded, though her belly seemed to bigger or at least more strained and making loud groaning noises as more food was forced into. Her mother greeted Erica, though she could be too sure as mother said this with her mouth full and came out incredibly indistinct. Clearly aware that her own belly was about the same size as her mother\u2019s Erica decided not to get anything to eat despite her on belly\u2019s protest, these days once she started eating she didn\u2019t seem able to stop.<br>\r\nErica spent the time in her room trying not think about food, the large mirror in her room didn\u2019t help, whilst sweat fitted in they covered all the important parts that allowed her to go out in public, her belly still peaked out between the parts, plus the bulky shapelessness of the clothing combine with her increased weight just made her feel fat. She vowed that tomorrow she would get some new clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the time came to go to rehearsal Erica made her way to the door, telling her mother where she was going as she past the door way to the kitchen, her mother made an indistinct noise which was drowned out by a groan from her belly telling her to back to eating. Erica sighed and half walked half waddled to the car.<br>\r\nThe rehearsal wasn\u2019t as bad as the last one, whilst she was bigger she didn\u2019t have to do the balcony scene and hence her outfits were long flowing dress, despite this there was still an unmistakable bulge to show the world that she was with child, and whilst this was better than the truth that she was with children, Erica would of rather been without. Everyone seemed to be whispering or sniggering at she hear it at the edge of hearing as lumbered around the stage, somehow everyone knew she was pregnant, then again when she arrived with a belly as big as hers there is only one logical conclusion. Samantha was still unhappy, despite that Erica was by now the definite larger of the two girls they had made them switch roles. Erica had overheard that there was not enough time to people switch roles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica had a break whilst a few scenes that she wasn\u2019t in were rehearsed, she made her way over to the chairs set up for the audience several days in advance. On stage Simon was shouting at the twins who were playing Romeo, instead of learning opposite halves of the play each or alternate scenes the brothers for some reason had learnt alternate lines and now Simon was wondering whether there was enough time for them to learn the correct lines or to come up with some elaborate system to have them both on stage and say their lines. Erica sat down next to Sunny who was too good natured to giggle or make snide comments about her. A few seconds after Erica had heavily sat down next to her Sunny leaned over and gave Erica\u2019s bulge a pat asking, \u201cWhen are you due?\u201d  There was that, Sunny was that good natured she would be friendly and make conversation and Erica\u2019s belly was an elephant in the room, it felt like one. Erica was just about to respond when\u2026 <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The chair started to creak and groan under her increasing weight, the front of her skirt burst open from the stain of her swelling belly and widening hips, underneath her stretched shirt came the unmistakable snapping sound as a bra gave way.  Erica looked at Sunny in the torn remains of her clothes before they were replaced, her shirt fanned out as it became larger, it changed color to a pastel pink and the logo changed to a \u2018humorous\u2019 image of an oven front with bun on both levels inside it and a slogan that Erica didn\u2019t need to read to know what it was going to say.

Why don\u2019t you allow me to take care of your sons and daughter?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMom!\u201d  Erica started.  She bolted from the couch in shock.  Tears were pouring from her eyes, and she sobbed horribly.  \u201cI can\u2019t do that to you,\u201d she said.  Erica felt terrible for her mother.  She thought that she must be the worst daughter in the world.<br>\r\n\u201cErica, I was meant to be a mother.  Let me do this for you.\u201d<br>\r\nErica relented.<br>\r\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t meant to be a mother again!  You weren\u2019t even like this a week ago!  We were at a buffet, and you weren\u2019t even a little pregnant.  Then all of a sudden you were like this!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cErica, calm down.  You\u2019re not making sense.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI know I\u2019m not!  All I did was flip a coin and then suddenly you were expecting.  And it keeps happening: everyone keeps changing right before my eyes.  I can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d  Erica paused.  She hadn\u2019t quite put it together until that moment.  She took the coin out of her purse and thrust it into her mother\u2019s hands.  Then she hurried to her room to cry.  Katelyn was utterly bewildered as she looked at the object in her hands.  What in the world was going on with her daughter?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As she sobbed, Erica recalled a difficult time that she had had in acting school.  Back then she had been depressed about her weight, as she had been underweight and bony.  Now she had the opposite problem, but she recalled that the best way to deal with this issue was the same.  She had to focus on her work.  Expecting triplets?  Don\u2019t think about it, she resolved.  She would get through this play if it killed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Day Six.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re off the show,\u201d Simon told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The daily cycle had repeated itself as usual, and Erica had woken up larger than before. Her belly was surely on par with Sunny\u2019s and had maybe surpassed it.  Erica felt like she would cry, but was determined to power through.  Today was tech rehearsal, and ultimately more work was going among the tech crew than herself and her fellow actors.  Erica had to wait several times during the stop-and-start, uncomfortable in her new form as everyone gawked at her.  The tech crew, bless them, were apparently working overtime to disguise the issues among the actors.  Simon and Samantha had been talking throughout the process, when suddenly Simon called Erica aside to speak with her.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean I\u2019m off the show,\u201d  Erica cried, \u201cwhen you know I can still do it?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t\u201d said Simon.  \u201cI don\u2019t know what health problems you\u2019re having right now, but that\u2019s too extreme for the crew to handle.  The costumer is giving me hell.  I told her, \u2018what if we give everyone and empathy belly,\u2019 and she pitched a fit.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou did what?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.  Look, it\u2019s Tech and I have to do emergency re-casting.  I need you to accept this and get whatever medical help that you need.\u201d  Simon but his foot down and walked off.  Erica was devastated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0On her way out, Erica passed by each of her old acquaintances.  Samantha didn\u2019t speak to her, but gave a little smirk and a fake polite wave.  Sunny gave Erica her condolences, as she was genuinely shocked at the casting change.  It seemed that they had recruited Sunny to be Lady Capulet, and Samantha would be Juliet instead.  There wasn\u2019t much time to talk, as Sunny needed to hurry back into rehearsal.  As Erica left the doors, she ran into Jimmy.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s bullshit,\u201d he said.  He was not a great speaker.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, Jimmy?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWe were looking forward to seeing you perform.  What happened?\u201d<br>\r\nErica laughed.  \u201cI don\u2019t know.  I found a magic coin and suddenly nothing makes sense.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMagic what?  Anyway, you think maybe someone\u2019s been poisoning you with some kind of super weird drug?\u201d  Jimmy was not great at theories.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you let me know if you find anything in my dressing room,\u201d Erica said wearily.  Jimmy nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Erica went home and collapsed into bed.  Her dreams were bizarre and uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Day Seven.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She grew yet again. Today would have been dress rehearsal.  She didn\u2019t want to get out of bed that day, which was a difficult task anyway.  She looked overdue, if such a thing could be described.  As she sank into a depression, the day passed by uneventfully.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not that it would have been easy; she was wallowing in her misery and much heavier than she was used to.  Katelyn was shocked at the massive ball spilling into Erica\u2019s lap.  Her daughter was wearing a mostly unbuttoned nightshirt, and she could see her future grandchildren were far more active than her mother at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI know this isn\u2019t what you wanted.  You were going to become an amazing star.  I believed in you; you had such talent and vigor for acting.  Then, as life does, it drops children quite literally into your lap.  I know how you feel, what with this little one and all.  You end up having to make a choice between what you always wanted, and what you need to do.  Not everyone gets to live a dream life, but many people aren\u2019t as fortunate as we are.  Frankly, I\u2019m just as surprised as you.  I had always wanted grandchildren, but I never thought\u2026.anyway, I\u2019m proud of what you have accomplished.  I\u2019m sorry that you lost the role, but there will be others.  I promised you before that I would take care of your children, and I mean to do so.  It won\u2019t be easy, but I\u2019m used to making sacrifices.  I want to see you smile again.  You won\u2019t feel better right away, but I know that talking to me has always made you feel better in the past.  Why don\u2019t you tell me what\u2019s on your mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Erica was trying to speak as best as she could, but the words were sticking in her throat.  Worse, her unborn children were distracting her more than ever.  Her mother had a way with timing.  The thing was, Erica had always respected the idea of becoming a mother.  Her own mother had made her proud, raising her on her own.  Erica never felt like she was good enough for the scrutinizing Katelyn, however, and there was no ideal way to get her to leave the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMom.  Everything is over.  How can I expect to continue on even if I wasn\u2019t taking care of three children?  My body\u2019s a wreck.  I\u2019ll have to work so hard just to get it normal again, and then it still won\u2019t be the same as it was.  People will know what I\u2019ve been through.  They will know that I somehow had three kids and no father is around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not so bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes it is!  I\u2019m grateful that you raised me on your own, but I can\u2019t do that for three kids at once.  I hadn\u2019t even really made it big yet.  Ha!  \u201cMade it big!\u201d  Well, now I\u2019m stuck and I have nowhere to go.  I might as well take care of my baby sister and my own kids, instead of you taking care of mine.  I feel like the world\u2019s out to get me.  All this over a stupid coin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe coin again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it did this whole thing to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Katelyn sighed.  \u201cErica, there\u2019s no such thing as magic.  I mean really, you\u2019re telling me that I had a one night stand nine months ago because you flipped a coin just this past week?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know it sounds crazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is crazy, Erica.  I know you\u2019re stressed, but you need to calm down.  Look, let me show you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d Erica screamed.  But it was too late.  Looking in Erica\u2019s bedroom mirror, Katelyn flipped the coin and gazed at herself.  In a moment, Katelyn\u2019s body morphed as it had in the restaurant.  Her clothing changed and extended outward just a little bit.  Then the world resumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, Erica, I\u2019m just a pregnant with twins as I was a second ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica sobbed.  \u201cPlease leave me alone,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I\u2019ll show you again,\u201d Katelyn said, looking at her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d Erica cried.  As she did, the enchanted coin was already in the air.  She vaulted herself as well as she could forward, but she could only get onto her knees by the time the coin descended into her mother\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down, Erica,\u201d her mother said.  \u201cThere, tails.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Katelyn was about to ask \u201cand you\u2019re no different, are you,\u201d but she found herself swallowing her tongue.  Erica, astoundingly, was growing before her eyes.  The already massive, gargantuan belly full of triplets billowed forth against Erica\u2019s hands.  Her daughter began to sob as her active children kicked against her insides.  What had been confirmed as triplets now seemed twice that number, but there was no way to be sure.  The taut stomach had shot through the mostly unbuttoned nightshirt, and the additional growth had caused one of the remaining buttons to snap off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The world itself seemed to halt.  Erica was a blubbering mess, and Katelyn couldn\u2019t process what she had just seen, in fact what she had just done.  It was, in essence, a cruel moment within their lives.  What had begun as a heartfelt attempt for mother and daughter to connect had horribly crashed to the ground.  For the sake of tact, we will give these two privacy in this troubling moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What can be learned from this all?  A young woman, ambitious and vain, is unfortunately beset by a misfortune.  Her will has not, nor her relationship with others has not created this problem for her.  Yet as Time tries all, we all must experience certain universal truths.  We are all driven by relationships built with parental figures, just as Erica had learned her ideas of herself ultimately from her own mother.  The connections with our acquaintances will determine who helps us when we are in trouble, and poor friendships make for poorer counsel.  Erica no doubt suffers more greatly for her lack of bond with her childhood friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shall we say that there is more to occur within this story?  It is the eighth day, but there is still time to make meaningful discoveries.  Where did the coin come from, and is there a way to undo the curse?  Or will Erica have to learn to give up her dreams and become a mother?  Perhaps that is a worthwhile substitute to some, and not to others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Or perhaps I, as the being Time, shall allow you one chance to subvert the victory of this wicked trickster, this \u201ccursed coin.\u201d  I can, for the sake of a different universe, turn back the clock, and we may begin this story anew from the moment Erica received the coin.  There is no guarantee that she won\u2019t still encounter its curse, but she may have more of an opportunity to undo its effects.  If that is her wish.  An if that is your wish, when choose this option, and allow us to travel to this new universe, at the crucial moment.</span></div></div>",

Quickly eating everything she had put in the bowl she was left staring at an empty bowl.    The salad was just not going to cut it, she needed some real food and fast!  Erica again headed back to the buffet line and this time grabbed a tray and two dishes.  She filled these dishes with a variety of foods, whatever was closest going on her plates.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatelyn watched her daughter eat with gusto.  Shocked at not only the food she was eating but how much of it she was eating made her jaw drop.    \"Are you okay?  I thought you said that you needed to watch your figure.

Her lids fell on the sight of a young black woman entering the room.  In the brief instant, Erica noticed a red emblem on the woman's t-shirt, but couldn't define its shape.  Nor could she when her eyes opened, as it had disappeared.   What was once a casual t-shirt was now a dress, highlighting the woman's maternal nature.  Erica blinked a few more times as the woman hurriedly passed towards the nearest stall.  What had just happened?  She was sure that she had seen the outfit of the girl, or at least its color.  Another moment passed as she remembered what she held in her hand.  She gazed down at the coin, and it gazed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA foreboding feeling hung in the air as she finished her evening with her mother.  The two went home, where Erica tried to study her lines.  She was already comfortable with them, but she hoped to distract herself from the unusual feeling in her mind.  It appeared like a curious light, tempting her to approach a bizarre sensation.  The coin, which she had placed atop her dresser, was almost calling to her, as if to repeat the event at the restaurant.  How ridiculous, yet the idea was almost playful.  Why not pretend for a moment that she had the power to change reality?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it,\" she groaned.  She wasn't going to get any work done at this rate.  Surely some sleep would get rid of this pesky sensation.  Why did it bother her?  It wasn't right; something wasn't right.  The world was dramatically changed only a couple of hours ago, but it must have been her imagination.  It had to be.  She recalled the first time that she had flipped the coin while looking in the mirror.  It had been an similarly hypnotic moment, but nothing dramatic had happened--she had just felt a mild tingle.  The second time she had flipped it, a person had completely changed in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just my imagination.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Erica prepared for bed, other sensations started to pester her.  Her skin felt more sensitive, and her mind kept drifting at random.  She thought briefly of snacking more, but it was easier to quell this notion.  She had disciplined herself to pursue a healthy figure for the stage, and she resolved that she wasn't going to break any more beyond her weakness at dinner.  She went to lock the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust inside the door, she saw a card addressed to her.  What was this?  A strange end to the strange day; the card itself had no words.  Instead, a cartoon of a sun was imprinted on the inside, smiling up at her.  Sunny.  Was she the one that had dropped off the coin this morning?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt any rate, it was time for bed.  Erica put out the lines and tightly gripped her covers as she rested.  Her stomach bothered her, and the distracting temptation to flip the coin still pecked at her attention.  She thought that she could hear a clock toll on the midnight hour, when she suddenly plunged into sleep.  What would happen over the next several days, no one could prepare her for. </span></div></div>",

It was a silver disk held atop a pedestal by a frame.  On the disk there was an image of a happy and sad face, but in her dream she saw the image of the coin.  The disk began to glow and spin.  Erica heard whispers all around her, and she felt a great heat and pressure within herself.  She had to sit herself on the ground, she was so overwhelmed.  As she sad on the stage, her stomach grew and pushed forward until it reached her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had not slept well.  Her dreams were wild and eccentric.  She'd imagined herself pregnant, which was altogether an unpleasant thought.  When she woke up, she had felt groggy and miserable.  Looking at herself in the mirror didn't help.  Everything was swollen.  Erica looked aghast at the distinct change in her profile.  <br>\r\nHer breasts were bigger, and they ached.  Then she saw her belly gently sloping outward.  She had lost control of herself the previous night, eaten too much.  But that wasn't a good excuse.  She couldn't just get rid of fat when it appeared.  That's what her mother always told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chastised herself as she dressed for the day, thankful that everything still fit.  Erica glanced at the coin and considered whether she could learn anymore about it.  She was superstitious, so the coin went with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling sick and ashamed of herself, Erica walked over to Ashley's place.  It was a bright and sunny day, and full of bustling life.  The area had a wild rabbit problem, and Erica saw several on her way.  She had always found animals to be cute.  Suddenly there was a wild hare stopped in front of her.  Rather than pet it, Erica pulled out the coin and flipped it.  The hare appeared to sense danger and bolted away.  When the coin landed, it was heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica turned her head to see a woman pushing a stroller directly towards her.  The world seemed to shimmer, and the woman  halted.  Before Erica's eyes, she swore that she saw the woman swell.  Her belly expanded outward in almost and instant, but the stranger only rubbed the fecund orb pleasantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Erica asked.<br>\r\n\"What?  Oh, yes, I'm feeling lovely,\" said the woman.  \"I just need to take a break from walking sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer question answered, Erica hurried away.  What on earth had happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was an adorable woman, and a friend to everyone.  Erica liked her too, as a person.  Ashley's sunny disposition was a good aid for conversation, and she was always willing to listen.  Erica wasn't sure that she would listen to her unusual tale, however, or whether it should be brought up at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knocked on the door, coin in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The air only slightly moved with the passage of her breath.  Her sleep was deep and heavy in dreams.  Beside her bed, on the nightstand, lay the enchanted coin.  Imbued in its metal was a mischievous spirit, ever calling to interact with humans.  It's call could not be heard with the human ear, but open minds could perceive its message.  The spirit wanted its power to be used, and it had one primarily effective method of persuasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spirit's call reached Erica's resting mind and tapped into her dreams.  She dreamed of herself in ways she never had before.  She was living her role as Juliet, gazing out from a balcony.  She could feel a thrum pervading the air, causing her body to tremble.  The moon above was changing phases from new to full, and it seemed to be getting closer to her.  As if in response, she felt a change in herself.  Her slim belly was expanding in kind, becoming full and great before her.  Inside she felt a warm and comfortable presence.  Her belly grew to absurd proportions, first as if she expected twins, then triplets, and then even further, until she couldn't imagine how many she carried.  Above her, the moon had changed into a flipping coin, each side cascading an eerie light upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Erica awoke, she was sweating.  She felt somewhat heavy in her bed, but she was too uncomfortable to stay where she was.  Her hand caressed her slim stomach as she pondered the bizarre dream.  Did it feel different?  No, of course not.  The time was 3AM as she sluggishly walked to the restroom.  Erica washed her face and drank some water from the faucet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flip me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was that?  Erica walked back to her bedside table and pondered what she had sensed.  The gifted coin that she had been flipping since last night was sitting there.  She picked it up.  \"What are you?\" she wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flip me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I?\"  She wondered.   There was a small tug in the back of her mind.  It was a primal feeling, something she couldn't explain.  She shouldn't flip the coin, but why not?  She flipped the coin once, but in the dark she couldn't see how it landed in her hand.  She felt a strange affection for the motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flip me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, the compulsion was different.  She found herself moving, as if sleepwalking, back toward the bathroom mirror.  She saw herself, still drained from her lack of sleep.  She was moving without thinking, marveling selfishly at herself.  She wanted to flip the coin, to cause something to happen that she couldn't describe, and yet she was rebelling against the notion.  \"What am I doing?\" she asked her other self.  \"This is stupid.\"  And yet, she felt a bizarre yearning.  It was just a coin, of course.  She was just tired and drained.  What was it that she wanted?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of nausea struck her, and she raced to the toilet to gag.  Damn it all.  She was thankful not to vomit again.  Shaken from her daze, she stood back up and looked once more into the mirror.  She hoped that this wouldn't be a continuing issue.  She hadn't made it far before the compulsion to flip the coin returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck,\" she said, and she flipped it once more, trying to look as cool as she could in the mirror...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Her attempt to look cool didn't work.  As the coin landed in her hand, Erica felt an abrupt disturbance.  The world, which had been so serene and peaceful, began to stretch.  Her vision of herself in the mirror blurred as the entire room seemed to smear and swirl.  The dizzying effect was overwhelming.  She held her head in her hands and reeled, wishing for things to grow still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, it did.  Erica opened her eyes to find herself in the bathroom again, so overcome with nausea that she vomited in the toilet.  She sat against the wall of the bathroom, steadying her breath.  Whatever had occurred had shaken and frightened her.  Her stomach felt uneasy and tight, and she rubbed it gently to ease it.  The motion was in vain, though, as she couldn't help but fear that it was slightly bigger than it had been before.  Erica returned to bed after washing out her mouth; her rest was disrupted by more odd dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica woke up and met her mother for breakfast  Katelyn had prepared a large breakfast of eggs, hash browns, and melon for them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Erica, you look so exhausted,\" her mother whispered.  She pulled a chair back for her daughter.  When Erica sat down, Katelyn affectionately combed her daughter's hair.<br>\r\n\"I didn't sleep well,\" Erica mumbled.<br>\r\n\"It's only natural.  I remember when I was in your position.  I was so nervous.\"<br>\r\n\"My position...\" Erica mumbled, but she stopped herself.  Katelyn had never pursued acting to her knowledge, but the argument wasn't worth getting into.  She turned her attention to her breakfast.  Erica was normally particular with how much she ate, and she paced herself well.  Today she found that difficult, as a great hunger was possessing her.  By the time that she finished her usual amount for breakfast, she was hankering for seconds.<br>\r\n\"You look so cute today, honey.  I can see your little bump already,\" Katelyn giggled.<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" Erica gasped.<br>\r\n\"Oh, dear, it's perfectly normal.\"<br>\r\n\"You can't just call me fat.\" Erica retorted.  She put down the remainder of her food and hurried back to her room.<br>\r\n\"Come back and finish your breakfast, Erica,\" her mother called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica started getting dressed, bewildered by her mother's behavior.  Katelyn had always been very critical if Erica showed any excess weight, and she was determined to stay in shape.  Now that she thought about it, though, Erica looked down at her belly.  There was a tiny, perceptible curve poking out in her center.  It was oddly firm to the touch, disturbing her.  Erica was afraid that she was starting to look pregnant: something that she had never wanted in her life.  She resolved that she would go to the gym.<br>\r\n\"Honey,\" Katelyn called through the door.  \"Overreact if you want, but I'm just trying to make you feel better.  Now, I have to go to work.  I'm proud of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica went to the gym, confused at her mother's behavior.  She had grown up always conscious about her weight, in no small part due to Katelyn's criticisms.  She entered the gym with purpose, but soon found the routine difficult.  For reasons that she did not yet know, she was becoming exhausted more quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was cooling off with light walk on the treadmill, her coworker Samantha appeared on the treadmill beside her.  There was a tense silence for a moment.  Erica wasn't in the mood for talking, but she supposed it couldn't be helped.<br>\r\n\"Hey.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey.  How're you feeling?\"<br>\r\n\"Good.\"<br>\r\nThe silence returned.  Samantha let out a sigh as her treadmill picked up the pace.  \"I talked with Rachel yesterday.\"  Rachel was the costume designer.<br>\r\n\"What about?\"<br>\r\n\"She's really excited for the show.  I don't know how she does so much by herself.\"<br>\r\n\"It's such a tough job.  She's really great,\" Erica agreed.<br>\r\n\"She was very clear that she didn't want any accidents during dress rehearsal tonight.  She's not going to have enough time for modifications.\"<br>\r\n\"We're professionals.  Nothing bad's going to happen.\"<br>\r\n\"Knock on wood,\" Samantha quipped.<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"  There was another brief awkwardness, as Samantha struggled to say something.<br>\r\n\"Hey, what you're doing... it's impressive.\"  She said.<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"Don't make me repeat it.  It's impressive.  I don't think I could do the same thing in your shoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two had a strangely amicable time together.  They didn't talk too much about themselves, but rather the show and the crew.  The longer that they talked, though, Erica felt a nagging sensation in the back of her mind.  The coin was still in her pocket, calling to be flipped.  As she cleaned up, Erica glanced at herself in the mirror, determined that the tiny curve in her abdomen would eventually be vanquished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather tired, there wasn't much to gain from spending more time at the gym.  She shared tea with Samantha, and went over lines before the dress rehearsal that evening.  All the while, the scratching voice in her became stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Erica didn't know is how the coin flip that morning had affected the world around her.  Everyone knew that she was pregnant, and with twins at that.  Only Erica was unaware of this.  To others, Erica was relentlessly pursuing her career in spite of her physical limitations, but none of them could possibly have known that each passing day was causing history itself to rewrite.</span></div></div>",

The performances were not to the quality that Erica wanted, and on occasion she requested that they redo scenes.  The director, Simon, was thankfully okay with this.  Even though Erica was doing this play to help out, she wanted the others to do a good job.  Not everyone was appreciative of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt could be said that their Romeo, a man named Duncan, was a bit eccentric.  He was prone to carrying charms around with him, and would whisper tiny affirmations and prayers to them between scenes.  The thing that concerned everyone, primarily, was that he always appeared to be exhausted, which had not been the case when he was first cast.  Perhaps the stress had simply gotten to him.  Regardless, his irritability mounted, and eventually he refused to redo scenes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rehearsal ended, and Erica went straight home.  She was feeling exhausted herself.  When she got home, she laid in bed at around midnight.  She was gazing at the alarm clock when when the digit changed to 12:00 AM, when the world dissolved. She was whirling into sleep, lucidly conjuring strange images in her mind.  She kept seeing herself in various different states, replaying the same scene on stage.   Sometimes her hair would change, other times her dress.  Other features would change as well.  No matter how many times the scene replayed, she was never the same.  Her dream was akin to a flip book, and the many disconnected images flashed before her.  One thing that stuck out to her was that one part of her only seemed to grow bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she dreamed, she felt an uncomfortable pressure in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica awoke groggily.  She laid still for a few minutes, perplexed at something that she was feeling.  Her hand was cupping under a new swell on her belly.  Bewildered, she threw off the covers and got a better look at herself.  On her belly was a distinct swelling, a tiny bump, and inside something was stirring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was impossible.  Anxiety and terror welled up within her as the reality of the thing became all too apparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?!\" She cried.  Erica hurried out of her room and found her mother in the kitchen.  \"Mom...\"<br>\r\n\"Good morning darling!  Oh, look at you.  Aren't you precious?  You look so beautiful.\"  Her mother came over and hugged her.<br>\r\n\"Mom, I think something's wrong with me.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?  Is everything alright?\"<br>\r\n\"I mean... this, just look at it,\" Erica moaned.  But her mother didn't seem to be listening.<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're adorable.  I remember when I was five months pregnant with you, I looked just like that.  I guess we know what that might mean!  Isn't it exciting?\"<br>\r\n\"Pregnant...\" murmured Erica.  It didn't make sense.  Nothing made sense.  Her mother went back to preparing breakfast.<br>\r\nKaitlyn looked back at her daughter.  \"Now, Erica, your doctor's appointment is today, isn't it?  You need to freshen up.  Go make yourself ready.  I'll have your breakfast ready for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica did as she was told, a hand never leaving the new bulge of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer clothing was different.  Erica had never in her life bought maternity clothes, but in her dresser, unmistakably, were clothes meant for her new physical condition.  It was all too much, but she had to pull herself together.  She found herself following instructions, driving to a doctor that she had never known before, to get a sonogram for a condition that she never thought would have.  As she approached the hospital, she felt a foreign object in her pocket as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the coin.  Erica looked at the bizarre object with a new suspicion, although it seemed impossible.  She could barely speak; everything around her seemed impossible.  What she didn't understand--indeed what she couldn't fathom--was that her pregnancy was progressively increasing in number each day.  This was the unnatural result of using it twice on herself: once Tails, and then the second time, Heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResolving her shaken self as best as she could, Erica turned to the hospital and prepared to enter. </span></div></div>",

It couldn't possibly be real.  Using the toilet proved awkward, but if nothing else she was able to sit and breath for a moment.  No matter how tightly she shut her eyes, not matter how hard she wished otherwise, she was pregnant.  Worse, she was impossibly big; there would be no easy way to hide this from anyone.  She quickly put her shirt back on as well as she could.  It didn't cover any part of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The only thought Erica had was to get to safety: to get home.  She struggled to put away all of her fearful thoughts.  What would happen to her?  Was she going to give birth right then and there?  She felt incredibly uncomfortable.  The new weight of her abdomen was serious, and the skin of her belly was tight.  Furthermore, the unborn children in her womb were moving.  Tears welled up in her eyes as she waddled out of the dressing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She raced out of the building.  Rehearsal had gone into late night, so there weren't many people still in the building.  It didn't matter to her, though.  There was no time or probability for being stealthy.  She rushed to her car, not thinking of whether people saw her.  As she got to the door, she fumbled her keys out of her purse, only to drop them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit,\" she cried.  The keys lay before her on the ground of the lot, taunting her.  What followed was a humiliating series of attempts to lower herself to the pavement.  Her knees ached.  The keys were just out of reach,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need help, Miss?\" called a familiar voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the director, Simon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Erica groaned, almost praying.  \"Leave me alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But Simon didn't listen.  He hadn't recognized Erica from where he stood, but knew clearly that this large pregnant woman needed some help.  Hyper focused on the keys, he hurried over and picked them up.  As he held the keys out, he finally saw Erica's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they stood there, staring at each other in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Simon,\" called out a woman's voice.  It was Sunny, the stage manager.  She was a nice, short woman with black hair.  She was dressed for a social outing at the local bar, the usual hangout for the cast and crew after work.  As she came to Simon's side, she also looked at the mortified Erica.  Here eyes filled with shock as she, too, became a frozen statue.  \"Oh my God,\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A voice called out to Erica from the palm of her hand.  She had unconsciously been holding the coin the entire time, and she was overwhelmed with the need to flip it.  Then she did.</span></div></div>",

When the coin fell down into her hand, it's magic took hold again.  She felt an electric sensation pass through her body.  Her belly, which had already astonished her, began to press out further.  A heat built up inside of her.  Erica did not feel real during this moment; everything was impossible and bewildering.  Her emotions raced, and she felt sensations that she had never expected.  Naturally, she was afraid.  Her stomach was becoming tighter and heavier as it grew.  The truth was plain to see that she was pregnant.  This would have terrified her enough on its own, but the enormity of the image was beyond her.  For a moment, a guilty kind of pleasure invaded her senses, which she recoiled at.  What in the world was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Her children moved.  There was no way to tell how many children she was surely having, but one would simply be too few for her ever-growing figure.  The flurries of kicks inside of her seemed everywhere, and she felt the pressure against her hands.  Erica was awash in heat and pressure and tingling.  She suddenly felt dizzy, and uncomfortably fell to her knees.  Tears were in her eyes, but she couldn't afford to cry.  Unfortunately, the growth of her stomach  wasn't stopping. Her blouse had lost its buttons and her pants had become uncomfortably tight. Against the onslaught of sensations, she tried to think of what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She took a breath, feeling her swelling lungs against her rib cage.  All of her insides felt cramped.  The first thing she had to do was call an ambulance.  She rattled her brain for where her phone had been, and remembered with horror that it was on the other side of the room.  With a desperate push, she raised herself from the floor and raced to her phone.  Her stomach was so heavy, and the constant movement inside was distracting.  Erica found her phone, turned it on, and froze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0First, she noticed the time.  Everything had occurred in such a short period that she almost forgot that she had plans with her mother that night.  The momentary thought of her mother's shame wet her eyes.  Second, she realized that the pressure inside of her belly had ceased.  The belly that she beheld was phenomenal.  It was bigger than she had ever personally seen in a woman before, and she had known women with twins.  Third, she noticed was that she was still holding the coin.  She turned again towards the mirror that she had run from, and felt a great shock at how she had changed.  Worse yet was an unusually familiar feeling, that of a calling.  Flip the coin, it said again.  In shock and horror Erica threw the coin at the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This was a mistake.  As the coin flew through the air, it's magic activated again.  It bounced off of the mirror and began to roll atop the floor. Almost mockingly, it got nearer to Erica, and fell...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Heads.  Erica's reality changes and stabilizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Tails.  Erica encounters a final change, (she becomes pregnant with sextuplets), and undergoes labor.</span></div></div>",

Her jaw dropped.  \"Miss Keim, is it really you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Erica, I heard you were here.  I came to see you and to know if you even remembered me.  I'm glad you do.  Please, Erica, call me Madelyn or some part of it; I don't want to be that teacher called 'Miss Keim' with you; I want to be seen as your equal, both of us women and neither of us a teacher to the other.  You're more beautiful today than you were then.\"  She brushed her fingers through her short brown curls and looked into Erica's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica held her eyes to Madelyn's and held her breath in surprise and delight. \"Madelyn, I always wanted to be more than a student, more than a friend, to you; still do.  As an actress I have men falling all over themselves pursuing my heart and body; but my heart has always wanted you, the apple highest in the tree that I could never have.\"  She moved toward the emerald eyes and smiled at the soft smile on Madelyn's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadelyn's arms reached out as her eyes spoke volumes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica's lips found the softness of Madelyn's against her own as the two women wrapped their bodies together.  The long, slow kiss sent chills of joy, sensual sensations through both of them.  The love that began during Erica's senior year was now free to blossom into lifelong love and passion with her high school teacher who was filled with the same depth and wonder of romantic love for the young woman who had once been untouchable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the privacy of her room, Erica ended a kiss with an extended look into Madelyn's eyes.  Then took her by the hand, led her to the bed and pulled Madelyn onto herself.  \"I'm so in love with you yet I've tried to hide my love of the loveliest woman in the world, for the sake of my reputation; but right now, I put all that behind me and let loose all my love for you forever.  \"You're making my daydreams and my best night dreams come true.  I hope you felt all my love for you in that kiss just as I felt so much love from you to me in that kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadelyn, \"These are the best moments of all my life. I wish we could marry, even so, we'll never be apart again.  I've found you again and will love you in every way all my life.\" She kissed the full, luscious lips open to her and kissed Erica's slender neck, her ear lobes and her hands found their way to sweep across the full, soft breasts of the woman who had at one time been her student.  \"I love you so much, Erica.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, after hours together on the bed and in the shower, Erica and Madelyn sat on the patio with wine coolers remembering the time they were together and the years they had been apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica had dropped the gold coin and it rolled under the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Honey, I just thought of something.  Just before you came in, I had found a strange coin with symbols of pregnant couples on each side of it.  I had flipped it then looked up and saw you.\"  She laughed.  \"There must have been some magic in that old coin I found.  It brought me you.\"  Erica smiled and patted Madelyn's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadelyn laughed.  \"You don't know the myth about the coin with pregnancy associated with it.  I can't believe this!\"  She laughed even harder and louder.  \"Erica, my sweetheart, that means if you looked at me when you flipped it, I'm supposed to be pregnant and have a baby in nine days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica laughed.  \"Really?  You'll look really cute being pregnant.  You're so small, you'll blow up like a balloon.  If that happens, we'll be parents.  Boy or girl?  Which do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, either would be fine. My brother's a good guy, and handsome too.  You're beautiful and wonderful.  So either will suit me.\"  Madelyn laughed.  \"But that's all just a myth, 'hocus pocus'.  No magic.  But we have each other now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl, if it's no myth, we need to have a home and be ready in nine days.  We can't be living here in my dressing room.  Hell, I don't even have an apartment; I hope you do.\"  Erica laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a very nice home in the suburbs of Las Vegas.  Why don't you go home with me today?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.  We two are one now and we just may, by some mythical magic, be three in nine days.  I'm ready as soon as I call my publicist.\"  Erica picked up the phone and dialed a number.  \"Mark, as my publicist, you need to know, I'm retiring to a little home in the burbs of Las Vegas.  Yes, starting today.  Cancel everything and close up my cubbyhole here.  Yes, I mean my dressing room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Erica and Madelyn left the dressing room that day to live as lovers and wives for the rest of their lives, the gold coin lay under the bed where it had rolled.  It was found by the young maid who tossed it to her boss that afternoon.  He missed it and it landed on the floor.  As he picked it up, he looked toward the maid who was looking straight at him.  Remembering the myth he had heard, he panicked.  He knew what would happened because, essentially, she had flipped the coin and looked at <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her stomach rounded out, expanding into a full, solid bulge that hung out inches from the rest of her body. Her hips swelled and shifted to accommodate her belly, flattening out her stance. Her breasts filled out past their natural small C cup, growing into a solid D, resting on her ballooned womb. Her shirt warped into a tank-top that read \"insert baby here\" with an arrow pointing down that left her belly bare, revealing how her legion of tattoos were stretched across her taut skin--skin that now seemed to glow even in the dim hall light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Jade said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whataya mean, what?\" said Hayden, her head cocked to the side, hands on her rounded hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to be kidding me, right Hayd? What happened to you, you're...you're-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hormonal and waiting for you to rip my clothes off? Uh-huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you not freaked out that you're pregnant out of nowhere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was, months ago, remember? And so were you. We've been over this. I know I told you to hit the bottle twice as hard for the both of us but I didn't think you'd take it literally. How could you forget? I mean, yeah, I was scared as hell. Who wouldn't be? We go to a concert, get plastered and wind up in a threesome with some random guy...Well, I called it a threesome but it was more like me eating you out while he pounded me but who's counting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...uh...right, how could I forget? H-how far along are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayden laughed, \"Forget how to count too? Need mama to tie your shoes?\" she laughed again. \"Seven, I think. Feels like eight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"looks like nine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayden cradled her bulge in her arms. \"Miracle of life, ain't it? Why'd you have to go and get so big, huh?\" she said, talking into her stomach. \"What are you gonna be, like ten pounds? No getting bigger\" She wagged her finger at it, then beamed at Jade, \"Don't think he's gonna listen. Worth a shot though, right? Now, enough gabbing, I've sprung a leak,\" a dark patch spread across her top, obviously coming from the fat nipple that poked though the thin cloth. \"And somebody's gotta drink this up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a lot for Jade to take in. Hayden had always been way more responsible than she had, but seeing her like this, so matter of fact about something this huge that, as far as Jade could tell, came out of nowhere, like it was perfectly normal. It was almost too much.  </span></div></div>",

This was still Hayden, cute, perfect, big as a house and dribbling milk, Hayden and she was gonna stick with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where where we?\" Jade said. \"Somewhere between me and you in that closet over there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's my girl.\" Jade followed behind as Hayden waddled down the hall. As big as she'd seemed out there, in here, where more than half the closet was hers, it was like she'd gotten twice as huge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, sure you're up for this, in here, I mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see,\" Hayden said, as she pulled off her soaked top and groped her swollen teat. She moaned and bit her lip as it leaked over her stomach. \"Yeah, that says fuck me right here, right now, pretty good doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade had to admit, as shocking as this all was, that was a turn on. She latched onto the boob and suckled while Hayden cried in ecstasy. Jade had never had a lactation fetish, but now was a good time to develop one. It was weird, not that sweet, and warm but good, really good. And even better were the sounds it got out of Hayden. She could tell that this was really driving her wild. She decided to go in for the kill, bent down and helped Hayd slip out of her elastic pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown there, Jade was met with a surprise. \"New tattoo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one? Oh, that one. Yeah, if you call a bunch of months ago new. Newest anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a detail of Jade, exact down to her own tattoos, upside down so that he head was facing towards Hayden's nethers--where her normally trimmed patch had spread into a wild mess of her natural brown hair--and on her back spread eagle. It was placed just so that Hayd's belly spread the legs of the tattoo, getting wider and wider as the canvas stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seemed to when I got it. I wouldn't know, haven't seen it yet. Can't exactly get the full effect from my point of view.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSex with a pregnant Hayden was odd, especially the difficulty with kissing her lips, but it was still Hayden and she knew just how to get Jade off, even if it was mostly give and little get from on Jade's end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey drove to Jade's house. It was the first time Jade could remember coming in without so much as a buzz in a long time. She opened the door, Hayden waddling behind, to see not at all the jumbled mess of empty bottles and pizza boxes that she was used to. The mess was gone, and some of the old, ratty furniture was too, replaced by stuff Jade recognized from her apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You moved in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought we were past this, amnesia girl. Alright, I'll humor you. Getting knocked up has turned me into a total nympho, thank you hormones. And since a couple months back, I can't exactly reach, if you hadn't noticed already.\" She stretched her arms as far down as she could, blocked by the baby bulge. \"And I got tired of calling you all day from across town sooo...This was just easier. You didn't have any problem with it then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Mi casa, su casa.\"    </span></div></div>",

Jade continued to vomit for another minute or so, taking deep breaths when she was finished.<br>\r\n\"Ooh,\" Jade groaned. \"Where did that come from?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, you were pretty energetic out there. Maybe it's dehydration?\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Jade burped. \"Get me some Gatorade, would you babe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayden came back when Jade was wiping the sweat off of herself with a wet rag. \"Feeling any better?\"<br>\r\n\"A little,\" Jade said, taking and chugging Hayden's drink. \"I might just need to sleep it off.\"<br>\r\n\"It could just be a stomach bug,\" Hayden said, nodding her head. She and Jade flashed each other a little smile after a while and Hayden rested her head against Jade's chest and chuckled. \"Man, if you had puked on stage...that would have been so punk!\"<br>\r\nJade laughed and finished off the drink. \"Yeah, it would have been some real GG Allen shit.\" Hayden laughed and planted a kiss on Jade's bare breast.<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised you never got these pierced,\" Hayden said, stroking one of Jade's nipples with her index finger.<br>\r\nJade rolled her eyes. \"Always trying to get more business at your shop out of me, aren't you?\"<br>\r\nHayden laughed. \"Well, that and it would look so hot.\"<br>\r\nJade nodded and wiped herself with the towel again. \"Mmm, I'm still not feeling too great. I think I'm just going to head home. I've got work in the morning, after all.\" Jade added the last part with a derisive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade told the rest of her band how she was feeling and grabbed her gear, moving it into the back of her car with Hayden's help. \"Mind if you drive?\" Jade asked, rubbing her temples. \"I still feel like I might puke and I'd rather not do it on the steering wheel.\"<br>\r\nHayden chuckled and elbowed her girlfriend. \"Of course not. I'm not some frail little thing, like Anne.\"<br>\r\nJade scoffed. \"Why did I ever tell you about my ex-girlfriend before you.\"<br>\r\nHayden laughed and turned on the car, driving the two back to their apartment. Hayden unloaded the gear while Jade barfed in the street some more, trying to aim for the storm drain.<br>\r\n\"Out drinking with your weird friends again?\" Jade's elderly neighbor barked at her. Jade let out another wave of vomit while holding out her middle finger at her neighbor. \"Kids these days...\" her neighbor complained as she walked back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside, Jade washed her mouth out with a few glasses of water and proceeded to brush her teeth thoroughly, then flossed, then took a swig of Listerine. \"Ugh, that taste is still there,\" Jade complained. She walked out into the bedroom. Hayden was already in bed, down to just her tank top and underwear, reading a magazine. \"I guess no goodnight kiss, huh?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, not on your lips,\" Hayden said, wiggling her eyebrows. Jade smiled and stripped down, crawling into bed and lying down on her belly, naked breasts pressed against the mattress. Hayden put her magazine away and rolled over, kissing her lover's bare back.<br>\r\n\"I'll get you a great place at the next show,\" Jade muttered. \"I swear. I want to look you right in the eyes when I sing 'Die, My Darling.'\"<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm,\" Hayden continued to kiss Jade all across her back, giving special attention to a few shoulder blade tattoos she'd put there personally.<br>\r\n\"And when I start playing original songs, I'll be sure to have you close to the front,\" Jade said, yawning, her body tired from a hectic concert and a sudden bought of nausea.<br>\r\n\"Goodnight, Jade,\" Hayden said, stroking Jade's spiked hair.<br>\r\n\"Goonit, Hay,\" Jade mumbled, drifting off into a deep sleep</span></div></div>",

She hit the high note at the end of the chorus while an orgasm hit her. She stumbled back, somehow moaning almost-sorta in tune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she got that weird feeling again. So full, so bloated, and this time it didn't stop. It swelled until she started swelling with it. Her stomach rounded out, unmistakably pregnant and bulging by the second. Her rack followed suit, dribbling milk over her stomach. It didn't stop, forcing her to the ground. Neither had that orgasm. She rode the waves of pleasure while her womb grew more and more massive, surpassing triplets, pinning her helpless on her back, drowning in her own tit milk. So huge, so horny, so freaked out but too turned on to care. She screamed in ecstasy when she felt overwhelmed with the urge to push...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade shot up in her sheets, alarm clock blaring and doing nothing for that hangover. \"Man, I am fucked up,\" she said as she cursed herself for totally forgetting those lyrics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What kind of pregnancy is Jade having?</b>  </span></div></div>",

She stumbled to the bathroom and just stared at herself, the dialted, bloodshot eyes, the smeared makeup, the \"why yes, I am an Insomniac, fuck you for asking\" circles under her eyes. Her teeth screamed pack-a-day and overall, she looked like a meth-head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Haven't touched that stuff since highschool and coke is way out of my budget</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little angel on her shoulder told her to slow down, be responsible, take care of herself. The other one was busy murdering the first with an axe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't the mirror she wanted. After fumbling with the latch--If she had any happy pills, this would be the place to put 'em, couldn't open this thing to save her life. Worst birthday gift ever, Anne--she almost flung it off its hinges to reveal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing. This is what she got for using these hangover pills as part of this complete breakfast. Hair of the dog it was then, right after this wave of vomit that she split between the sink, the floor, and most of the toilet. A few more of those and a piss that felt like broken glass (teaching herself how to pee standing up made those summer camps totally worth it) and she was ready to attempt getting dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayden was gone. Jade wished she could move into her apartment which was loads better than this place but the walls there were so thin the whole neighborhood could hear them screwing and Hayd wasn't too fond of that. The irritatingly bright sunlight beaming in through the window got Jade's attention. What time was it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dove under the bed in search of last night's pants, then dug out her shitty old flip phone. 4:00. She was supposed to be at work two hours ago. At the heels of her initial reaction, \"Fuck it,\" chased a reminder of just how empty her fridge was. On top of that, she couldn't remember if it was two or three months of rent behind. She couldn't imagine begging Hayd for not-getting-kicked-on-the-street-money again. And the cherry on top, how many really for reals this time last chances had her boss given her now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing to go do that thing she really hated sounded like a half-way decent idea.   </span></div></div>",

She only had one bra that was even remotely safe for the public and she wasn't going to waste time digging around to find that thing. She threw on her \"please stop staring at my nipples\" workshirt, also the only shirt with a collar she owned. Jade did have a tie--and a corresponding tie fetish--work had actually forbidden her from wearing it. She got as far as opening the door before the breeze reminded her to fetch her, \"Yes those are the kind of stains you think they are\" pants. She screamed at her shoes while they refused to let her feet in. Her head the way it was, she wasn't sure if her feet were swollen or if she'd found an old pair. As much as Anne loved shoes, she couldn't be bothered at all to remember anyone's size but her own. It was times like this that made Jade happy that she'd celebrated their Christmas breakup with a flaming bag of dogshit right through their posh fancy-house window. Night in jail for attempted arson was the best New Years ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne f-bomb laden tirade later and minus her socks, Jade put the shoes in their place. After three ignored stop signs and a constant paranoia that a speeding ticket would turn into Driving under a Revoked Liscense, she made it to work. Globo-Mart. Fuck Globo-Mart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lenient hiring policy that was Jade's saving grace also meant that her fellow employees were about as useful as the garden tools her department sold. After the timeclock informed her that she wasn't fired yet, she discovered the joy that was a scheduled generated by some hick in fuck-off nowhere a million miles away. She had four hours of working solo to look forward to. It settled into the usual please kill me now monotony. Sell a birdhouse, carry dirt, pretend to give a shit to old people, sell a chainsaw, get lost in vivid daydream of going on a massacre with that chainsaw...almost throw up everywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, what was with this feeling. That was nowhere near the hardest she'd ever pushed herself. Was she sick? she thought that as some asshole sneezed twice all over a shelf. Definitely possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fuck that, I have an awesome immune system.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stomach cramp disagreed. Not really eating anything for the past two days then hurling up what little she had was doing wonders for her hunger. And now she had to pee again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Body, I hate you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her coworker arrived, she suppressed to urge to shove him into the woodchipper on display in favor of blitzing to the employee lounge restroom. Again, filthy public toilet, summer camp: best skill ever learned besides how to eat a girl out properly. To top off the cavalcade of bodily urges, some sick part in the back of her brain clicked on and screamed \"Please get off, right here, right now\" and it would not be ignored. She was forced into alternatively jilling and vomiting in what certainly qualified for her list of sickest moments in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> What the fuck is wrong with me?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCombining an orgasm and throw up was not fun. </span></div></div>",

Battling nausea the whole trip out to her car, she couldn't even manage to sit behind the wheel. Just the thought of driving put her off. If she tried, she'd kill somebody for sure. She dug for her phone and called Hayden for a lift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the employees picked up the phone, Jade didn't recognize the voice.

I'm like a leaky faucet today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make it quick, I was in the middle of giving a full chest to crotch death angel fertility goddess corset to a real cutie and I don't want a newbie wrecking my work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayden chuckled and pinched Jade's nipple though her sweaty shirt, \"Yeah, cute, just cute. You're sexy...peeing in my seat however, not sexy. Go, shoo, piss already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing out of the filthy--one of those where you have to go get the key and go around back--bathroom, Jade watched her hand shake with micro-tremors.

She was also definitely the better driver, weaving though the lanes until the turn off to where Jade lived was only a few minutes' distance. Hayden was actually quite the gearhead, if she wasn't working on a tattoo or a piercing or getting Jade off, she was under a hood, getting covered in oil. Jade wasn't sure just where she fit into Hayden's top 3 between tats and cars most of the time.It was such a headscratcher why her daily driver was this beat up old truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So about that tat you were working on, sounds pretty metal from what you've told me.

She wasn't cute, she was sexy. No denying that now. She broke out of the story when they came in, \"My favorite drawing lady! And you've brought a friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girlfriend actually,\" Hayden said, taking her place at the table, buzzing up her gun immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" said the client.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade, out since she was fifteen, was used to that kind of oh by now. nearly being beaten to death by dad when he found out, sometimes Jade thought Hayden had lucked out as an orphan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jade, meet Catie.

Women at work.\" she winked. Jade watched in silence as she slaved over filling in the final touches. Canvas aside, the tattoo itself lived up to Hayden's hype. From the smell and goop dripping onto the bed, Catie seemed to be enjoying it, twirling her long blonde hair that draped over the side with a finger while Hayden worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, \"Okay, that's it.\" Hayden said. \"I'd tell you to put on a shirt, but I kind of like the view.\" Jade elbowed her. Catie laughed as she climbed to her feet and made herself decent. She planted a kiss on Hayden's cheek before rushing out of the door, \"Can't stay, boyfriend waiting on me, buh bye.

People, especially people who hadn't had a penis inside of them since middle school, did not get pregnant overnight. It was a dream, she told herself.

This was.. a mistake.\" Jade said, finishing dressing and heading back out of her hide-hole and to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWork passed for Jade in a blur. She remembered helping out customers... poorly. She remembered getting chewed out by her bitch of a boss.. again. <br>\r\nShe remembered a killer craving for pizza... with anchovies and pineapple, which she satisfied. She remembered the bites of the hot greasy food filling the pit of her stomach, hoping to drown out the guilt and hunger pains with grease. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shift came to a close and she remembered getting into her car and driving back to her place. Her phone went off, and she saw it was Hayden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade couldn't face her. Not like this... Not like THIS, Jade thought, a hand absentmindedly going to her belly bulge. <br>\r\n\"Look, I don't know what the fuck you are, but I'm not pregnant. I don't care what my mind or anyone says. I'm not mom material. I drink lots, smoke more, and punk rock till the morning comes. Screaming brats and dirty diapers and big bellies don't fit into that equation. This has got to be some kind of ... stomach virus or some shit like that\" Jade said, taking to her belly without realizing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling outside her place, she got out of her car, and put one hand into the small of her quickly arching back. She pressed it in, trying to stretch out her back, when she heard the voice of her next door elderly neighbor Elizabeth. \"Oh my dear, are you really - - - \" Elizabeth's long silver hair appearing as she walked over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw you from next door, and I said.. That can't be Jade with that baby bump, but sure enough it is. How far along are you? Have I met the father? Heaven knows I haven't seen you with a young gentleman anytime recently. Oh dear, you're not going to carry on the way you are now are you? I mean that's certainty not a way for a mother-to-be to act. My daughter used to be alot like you before she got pregnant and I told her\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old battle-axe was droning on and on, and frequently violating Jade's personal space by frequently putting her hands on Jade's midsection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRage and fire and murder and anger were building up inside of Jade. She's had enough of this woman's shit day and day out never minding her own damn business, always judging... always judging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe should do something about it today.. but shit, did she really need someone else on her shit list? It was long enough. <br>\r\nAs Elizabeth prattle on, Jade reached into her pocket and fished out that coin. Better to leave these kind of decisions up to face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a strange coin my dear. You know, rare coins are a solid commodity when planning for your child's future. When I was \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade flipped it, looking at the old windbag prattle on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHead, she would tell this old bag what she really thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails, she's let it go.

Her hips had shifted under it, widened out--If a little birdie popped into her brain and said \"child-bearing hips\" she would grind it into pulp--and now, even worse, she could feel something in there, alive and weighing her down. Jade felt the warmth of Hayden sleeping past the horizon of her abdomen. Not-pregnant denial sex felt <i>good</i>, but that was the only upside. How the hell had this even happened? What was happening? A couple of days of being sick, then hungrier than a horse and filling up like a balloon. Nothing even vaguely resembling a man had been down there in years. It was weird, it was so...so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit, she had to pee. Whatever it was, the bladder was not on her side. That settled it, that was the first organ getting thrown away whenever the cyberpunk apocalypse dawns. She had to strain to sit up and waddle her way to the toilet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling...maybe this was magic-turn-you-into-a-fat-fucking-duck syndrome? she thought before a knock at the door interrupted her thinking. It startled Hayden awake, the artist flinging the sheets off, looking around in a dazed, half-awake frenzy like she'd just been told the Ruskies were bombing us and been given a newspaper to hide behind before realizing where she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not answering that,\" Jade said, naked in the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayden rolled her eyes and threw on some dry clothes from Jade's closet. In a shirt that showed off her abs because it was too small, Hayden went to open the door. She stopped when a Cheerio dropped out of her bangs. She wiped the cereal from her hair and turned the knob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Catie, in full-on bear, nearly smothering Hayden in her tits, hug mode. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So great to see you,\" Catie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some muffled mumbles, Hayden managed to disentangle herself, to see Catie with egg all over her face. \"Oh. It's you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"mm-huh. Yeah, me.\" Hayden gave a sardonic nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great to see you too. What're you doing- Oh, yeah right.\" Catie bounced a palm off her own forehead, \"Totally forgot you and her were...uh...I mean. This is awkward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. So what are <i>you</i> doing here? I don't make house calls for anyone except her,\" Hayden shot a hitch-hiker's thumb over her shoulder, \"And since you didn't want to see me in the first place...what's up, doc?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatie dug in her back pocket and pulled out two thin white strips, \"Tickets. To my race today. To thank you for this,\" she pointed at her bust, where the tattoo peaked past the lip of her pink bra. \"I meant to get 'em earlier but I really had to twist some elbows to get ahold of these and I wanted them to be a surprise, sooo I thought I'd pop over and give 'em to Jade so you and her could make some romance out of it all. It's at five, the track outside town--the one you volunteer at, you know the place. Whataya say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...don't know.\" Hayden glanced back inside to catch sight of Jade using the slump in her old worn out mattress--which had turned into a valley from struggling to support the new, heavier her--as a bowl for the cheerios spilled onto it. \"Maybe. Jade is...kinda sick. Might have to see a doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. That's not good for the baby at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know? How do you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bumped into her when she was at work the other day. Congratulations on that by the way. Gotta put up cute baby pictures in the shop when it's all over so I can see next time I come in for some work. Anyway, great seeing ya even if you can't make it. I understand. Gotta split, buh-bye.\" She did a little consciously cute wave, shaking her perfect ass on the way back to her sports car. What Hayden would give to get under the hood of that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car! the car, the car, she told herself, lying. That rack was all natural, she could tell that from when she'd run her buzz-gun over it. She could admit to being tempted. A little temptation was good for the blood, kept you alive, but Hayden was in this for the long haul. She knew <i>exactly</i> how her ring was going to look whenever they got around to that. But first they had to get though the now, and Jade getting bustier was not the worst side effect in the world. But still, it was unnatural, whatever it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey,\" Catie said, turning back with the convertible door half open, \"Love the new look.\" She gave a wink before speeding off. Hayden realized what she meant. The shirt was too small, the pants didn't exist. She slammed the door shut, red in the face. </span></div></div>",

She debated the tickets in her hand, watching Jade and her ersatz bowl in her periphery. She had fallen in love with <i>that</i>. World, mysterious ways, yadda, yadda...Mysterious indeed, exactly what the hell was happening? Was Space Jesus on his way? He'd make a hell of a band mascot, that was for sure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnough distractions. A doctor, they needed to work out what this was....but what were they going to tell him, \"Hi, my girlfriend has an eating disorder and swallows basketballs?\" Nope. They were gonna have to ride this one out and see what happened on the other side, whatever that may be. Who knew, maybe it would get them into those white dresses a little faster...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Merry Christmas,\" Hayden plopped the tickets onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's July.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figure of speech. You'll find it in the same book where they teach basic fucking table manners, you, sexy, disgusting slob you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade wiped her mouth clean and read the little white strips. \"This for real?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. You wanna do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When have I ever said no to that from you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayden blushed, \"I meant-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you meant, and you know what I meant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayden sighed and shook her head. <i>Never change.</i> So much for getting dressed. She bit her lip and not long after she was biting Jade's teat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Stop that! Enough biting alre- Oh! DON'T STOP! I am NOT pregnant! Not pregnant, don't stop...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stands were shitty metal bleachers, packed full, roasting in the sun and smelled of sweat and oil. Getting the increasingly-egg-shaped Jade up high enough to get a decent view was a massive hassle. Getting her food up there was an even bigger one. Hayden had no idea that much cotton candy existed in the whole world. And literal pounds of hotdogs drowned in relish, disappeared one after the other. Despite the constant crunch of popcorn being enough to drown out the engine roars, it was worth coming. Hours of cars going round and round the track, a few of them ones that Hayden'd had the pleasure of doing some tuning for during her volunteer hours with the local teams. The more professional league that Catie was in ran a time trial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her white and pink racing suit she got a big fat medal on a tiny podium. Not only a win, but a new record lap time for her class. More of those and she was onto big things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway into a Super Double Extra Mongo Size soda, Jade found herself waddling back towards the bathroom. On her way back, she heard a noise. Unmistakable, especially because she'd heard it recently, up close and personal. It was Catie, in the throws of passion, and when she'd followed it to its source, the trailer was rocking. She didn't dare knock, but with that kind of stimulation her hormones wouldn't let her resist going a-peekin'</span></div></div>",

Clinical nymphomania was not the worst condition in the world, and she certainly had the body to play the part. She was getting so worked up she could feel it in her bones. Time to really go to town, she slid her hand from her tit, across her rounding paunch...wait, what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of her sighed in disappointment. This was a dream, another of her legion of pregnant fantasies. She hadn't won that race--yet. The rest of her was too wild to care as she filled out and grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade watched her keep going at it as she ballooned, bigger and bigger, pregnant and moreso by the second. Catie lurched onto her feet as she surpassed Jade's size. Her bellybutton popped out, her stomach never looking back. She was as big as a nine month mother-about-to-be and still going and going, her hips widening out, deepening and deepening to accommodate her girth. Her chest was not left behind, swelling cup size after cup size, a torrent of milk flowing free along the way, ending up somewhere around a J cup if Jade were to judge it. It was incredible that she could stand at all, obviously over a hundred pounds in her stomach alone, her toned muscles bearing it with amazonian force. And her hands hadn't stopped, unable to reach her nethers, they played incessantly at her gigantic breasts. The way she cried out, Jade thought she might give birth right there until she realized it was an orgasm, a howl of pure bliss from the human blimp.   </span></div></div>",

As exhausted as Jade was, the idea of going another round with a frantic Catie got some sparks flying again down there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut should she call an ambulance instead? Just looking at Catie, she ought to be in some sort of hospital. Jade was never a fan of hospitals, especially since she woke up in so many after having finishing off a few too many bottles of Jack Daniels and she had to bring a friend or two inside when they got too eager with the needle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Having a hard time deciding? Flip me</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade opened her hand to see that weird coin in her palm again. What was it doing there? She could have sworn she'd left it in her pants pocket. Still, either option was as good in Jade's conflicted head. If Catie was crawling the walls thanks to her pregnant hormones, then the same sort of tickle had to be in Jade's head too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jade! I need you! Ride me! Make me feel good, you're the only one!\" Catie began screaming. Jade could see a puddle of milk starting to form on the floor by the doorway. All this noise and commotion was making it impossible to focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Don't think, just flip me!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, heads I go for round 2, tails we go to the hospital and call Hayden!\" Jade barked, flipping the coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me for what?\" Hayden said, walking in the door. \"I heard my name and...oh my god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hayd?!\" Jade choked out as she caught the coin as it landed on-</span></div></div>",

Her former silver hair that was normally in a messy bun flowed down past her shoulders, not to mention the pigment of her hair brightened considerably. Her hips had compressed and then expanded while her legs became plumper and more swollen. Her prematurely-lined face that was framed in sagging wrinkles had disappeared, replaced by a much more youthful appearance. The rings chiseled beneath her maternal eyes also had vanished completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the most bizarre change so far was that Elizabeth's once deflated stomach had expanded outwards until it had the look of an overdue pregnant woman.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Sometimes I wish you knew what it was like to be a mother!\" Rachel Glover yelled at her husband, Leon, who sat glued to the TV, nursing a beer. <br>\r\nThey didn't always fight, but it seemed to quickly becoming the norm around the Glover household. Ever since her husband took that promotion. <br>\r\nOh sure, the extra money was worth it, they needed it ever since her home business started slowing down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, the long hours and extra workload added extra stress onto the already stressful Glover household. The reason for the stress in Glover household was cleanliness, or lack thereof. Oh, it wasn't some disgusting pigsty, but it wasn't something you'd see in a magazine either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were always laundry to be washed and sorted, things that needed fixing, chores to be done. Several years ago, Rachel and Leon paid their children to help around the house; doing laundry, taking out the garbage, cleaning the house, general chores. They would spend their money on movies, video games, comic books, toys, whatever their son and daughter wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, her son and daughter, both teenagers in High School, had jobs. Real jobs that earned them real money. Real jobs that they had to balance with real school work, to get into a real college for their real futures. They day of pretend jobs as \"picking up toys, recycling papers\" were long gone, and as such, those once menial tasks began to pile up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore his promotion, her husband worked steady hours, at a steady pay, at a steady job, allowing him time to help out around the house. But ever since the promotion, his hours had become chaotic, his pay had doubled, and his free time was mostly reserved for the vacation time he had saved up for Thanksgiving week and two-week long Christmas holiday, with the occasional family trip, should it ever happen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't seen a non-working weekend off in a year. He'd work most of a Saturday, then try to relax by himself on a Sunday, before heading back to work on Monday to repeat the cycle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such, his helpfulness around the house ground to a dead stop. All he wanted to do now when he got home was relax, try to get in as much \"me time\" as he could before he would start his work day again bright and early the next day. This left all of the housework to fall on Rachel. <br>\r\nShe worked from home yes, and yes, that would allow her extra time in the day to, in the words of her husband \"Get done what needed to get done\", but that still didn't mean much to her. <br>\r\nGrocery shopping, errand running, house cleaning, dinner cooking, all of this took much longer than anyone in her family could be lead to believe. Factor that in with the small sewing business she set up for herself online, her days were packed to the brim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, her husband never really saw her home business as much of a job. He saw it as a way for her to earn some extra spending money for herself while she raised the kids. HE was the bread winner after all. The little amount she made did help with the bills, but hardly compared to what her husband made yearly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe make various little trinkets, blankets, baby clothes, and more from her home studio, selling them online via websites, and at country fairs and craft shows. It took up most of her time, but back then she had her children to help her out around the house when they got home early from school, allowing the place to always look spotless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow her children were teenagers with jobs, and the clutter around her house was pilling up. Everyday she asked her husband the same thing, \"Can't you help around her a little?\" and he always said the same thing \"I do. I pay the bills.\" The argument would usually escalate from there, eventually ending in the same way, Leon saying \"How hard can it be? You're home all day!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon still loved her very much, but the stress of his promotion was starting to get to him. While he kept in shape, (Lord knows how he could find the time Rachel frequently asked him), the new job duties were causing a strain in their marriage. They were arguing more, he was helping less, she was crying more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was expectantly bad, as dinner was late because her son's baseball practice ran over. After picking him up, doing the laundry, getting everything settled, dinner had just barely started cooking. Leon was not happy about this. Rachel was not happy about Leon not being happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey argued, for a long time. <br>\r\n\"Rachel, how hard can this be! I could do all this standing on my head!\" he shouted, his eyes not looking up from the TV.<br>\r\nShe had enough for today! <br>\r\n\"Sometimes I wish you knew what it was like to be a mother!\" Rachel screamed at the top of her lungs. <br>\r\nShe wasn't quite sure what that meant, but there was passion behind her words. She meant what she said, even if she wasn't quite sure what exactly she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon rolled his eyes, when there came a knock on their front door. Leon looked at her expectantly, and Rachel sighed and rolled her eyes. <br>\r\n<i>It will only get better. It has to. </i> she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the front door, to see nothing. <br>\r\nNo one was there. She looked around, and then a small glint of sliver caught her eye: It was a coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small little silver coin about the size of a quarter. It was covered in scratches, but the coin appeared to have what looked like a pregnant man and a pregnant woman are on the head of the coin, a happy look on their face, while on the tail end of the coin, are the same pregnant man and pregnant woman, a look of panic and fear on their face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What is this? A Coin? Where did it come from?</i> she thought as she picked it up. <br>\r\nShe examined the coin on both sides, looking at it in the porch light, the sun setting off in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" her husband bellowed from the couch. <br>\r\n\"It's no one!\" she said, still examining the coin. It was unlike anything she had ever seen ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip Me Rachel.</span> A voice that was not her own echoed sweetly through her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door and heading back into the living room, she could see a lot of activity down the street. The neighbors were outside talking. <br>\r\nHer husband sat on the couch, watching tv, drinking his beer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me Rachel</span> the voice commanded her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did what it asked, flipping the coin high into the air and catching it with one swift motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice catch Honey\" Leon said, in a sweet genuine tone. <br>\r\n<i>He could still be the sweet amazing man I married </i> she thought, looking at her closed hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Look</span> the voice commanded her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did, as her eyes full upon...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sandy was eighteen this year, and a veritable woman. It didn't matter if she never knew her mother. She practically raised her brothers for the absentee mom. She was used to her position as the only girl in the household, but knew it came with plenty of hardships. Life at school was better for Cassandra Dall. She had decent friends in Lila Torres and Holly Farrell, though both of them were more popular than the obstinate Sandy. She even had a nice boyfriend, Kevin Sharpe: a perfect stooge she could turn loose the minute she desired. He was the only thing in her life she had any control over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy eagerly waited as her father got home, expecting some sort of attention. It took a good thirty minutes for dad to even notice she was there. He gave a nod in her direction, but no further recognition. It dawned on Sandy very slowly that she wouldn't be celebrating tonight. At least, not at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be the tenth year in a row now. Ever since the day her mother left them all behind, her father couldn't be expected to remember his shoes in the morning, let alone a birthday cake. It only made things worse when Mitch left for college. And though she knew it would kill him, Sandy couldn't wait to escape this old town, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout notice, Sandy slipped out into the night in the mind to find herself a birthday present. She might as well treat herself if no one else would. After several blocks, she stopped into the local corner shop for her quick fix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. How may I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cashier spotted her right away. Sandy was surprised by the sudden attention. She approached the counter hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm looking for a present.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? How wonderful! For whom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Myself. It's my birthday today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, happy birthday! Isn't it a bit strange to buy yourself a present, however?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but it's just something I do. So what can you get me for--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached into her pockets, fishing for change. Sandy threw down a few coins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You poor girl. You couldn't even get a gumball with what's here. But you know what? Since it's your birthday--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man ducked behind the counter, and came up with a strange velvet box. He opened it to an engraved silver coin. A little pregnant woman peeked out at Sandy, smiling on the shiny surface of the coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about this little beauty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy pushed the box away and stepped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I don't collect coins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not just any coin, you see. It's special. It can really turn your life around, or so I've heard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy laughed to herself. What could a coin possibly do to change someone's life? Especially one as dysfunctional as hers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't possibly afford it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my gift to you, for your birthday. Didn't I say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why would I want--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, take it. It'll bring you such joy, I'm sure of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's worthless, isn't it? Are you just trying to get it off your hands?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That might be the most valuable object in existence, if what they say about it is true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. And what do they say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't remember. All I know is that it's supposed to give you the life you deserve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The life I deserve, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy looked long and hard at the box before making her decision. In a split second, she snatched the silver piece out of the storekeep's hand and held it in her palm. It was a lot heavier than she thought it would be. She turned it over in her hands again and again. The engraving changed expressions from happy to shocked, much to Sandy's amusement. The storekeep's eyes lit up to see Sandy holding his present. She pondered for a few more moments, then decided to keep it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take it. Better than nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. You won't regret it. And happy birthday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy walked out of the store and immediately regret filled her. Why in the world did she pick up this strange coin? It's almost as if it enchanted her. But out of the glare of the store lights, it looked entirely worthless. Was it even silver? She stuffed it in her pocket, too proud to return it now. Just then, her phone buzzed. Sandy swiftly opened her phone to find Kevin texting her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><span class=\"cteal\">[Hello?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Happy birthday, sweets.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Thanks, Kev.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Hey, whatcha up to?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Nothing really. Dad forgot my cake again. Whole b-day thing is kinda lame.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Sucks... Wanna come over?]<br>\r\n</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Sandy didn't seek out Kevin's company, especially at this hour. But she felt compelled to see him tonight. Perhaps he'd make up for the crummy evening she'd been having as of yet. Maybe he'd even gotten her a present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><span class=\"cteal\">[Sure. Can you pick me up?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Where?]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Out front of Griger's.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[You're out there?]<br>\r\n[...]<br>\r\n[I'll be there in 5.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[K. See you soon <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">]</span></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited maybe two minutes before Kevin pulled up beside her. She got in the rickety old car, and they drove off into the night. Sandy watched out the window for a good long while. Kevin wanted to break the silence, but couldn't find a good reason to. Finally, they were stuck at a stoplight, and Kevin spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, my parents aren't home tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy turned with the vaguest interest. Under the orange floodlights of the street, his blonde hair positively shined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna hang out there for a while?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy nodded to avoid catching his eye. She couldn't keep her eyes off his halo of golden hair, however. The longer she stared at him, the brighter the glow. The streetlights danced across his face, played upon his thin white shirt, coursed through the car at blinding speed. He was hurtling towards the suburbs, anticipating something big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna slow down there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry. Just thinking about stuff. Y'know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kev...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finally stopped in front of the Sharpe residence, and Kevin opened the door for Sandy like a true gentleman. By that time, the orange lights encircling him had driven Sandy crazy. So the moment that door swung wide, she leapt out at her waiting boyfriend and planted a kiss on his lips. He struggled to shut the door while holding her, and she just giggled with delight. At least she'd get something wonderful out of her birthday, now. Maybe that coin was magic, for bringing this spark to her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin and Sandy hustled inside. They whooped and hollered as they raced into Kevin's room, excited and playful. She tossed him onto the bed first, then he turned the tables on her and pressed her into his pillows. She laughed at his \"suave\" attempts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to keep this going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Kev. It's my birthday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, happy birthday to you, baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kissed her lips hard, then trailed down her neck. Sandy clutched at his back, and closed her eyes with sheer joy. The night lasted practically forever, with both of them hoping it never ended. After a long passionate affair, they both fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the night, Sandy woke up. Though she was more than comfortable in Kevin's arms, she wasn't too happy in her rough jeans. She slipped out of the bed and stood up in front of the closet doors. They were mirrored, so Sandy took the chance to straighten herself up. As Sandy removed her pants, she found the coin as it slipped out of her pocket. She remembered the cashier's words, then jokingly flipped the coin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It came up--</i></span></div></div>",

She then peered into her reflection for about five minutes, before a strange ill feeling passed over her. She clutched her stomach, and recoiled into a chair. The heady rush of sensations flooding her almost doubled her over. She staggered to her feet, collapsed onto the bed and curled up, trying to focus on something, anything else. She felt completely out of balance. Luckily, her groaning didn't wake Kevin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fell back into sleep and counted <i>one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine...<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">--- <b>Day One</b> ---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning came without much incident. Sandy woke only two more times that night to go to the bathroom. And though the ill feeling ebbed through the next few hours, it never got as strong as that moment before the mirror. However, that didn't ease her mind. The minute Kevin woke up, Sandy demanded to be taken home. None of the romance from the night before lingered the morning after for her; at least she hoped it was the same on his part. A one time deal, that wouldn't lead to any consequences. He glumly obliged her a ride home, and she spent the rest of the morning in solitude as she dressed for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this would be the day that she was bloated. Nothing fit the way it used to, making Sandy genuinely worry about herself. What could have caused all this? Was she sick? The reflux in her throat warned her of that truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, so this is what I get for my birthday. A little vomit, a heap of regret, and a stupid coin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was that coin? Had she left it at Kevin's? She dug around in her pockets and eventually pulled it out, still facing her with that same smile. Upon seeing it, she couldn't help but smile a little more. Everything would be okay, as long as she had that coin. It was her lucky charm. And who knows? Maybe it did work a little magic last night. How else would she have been motivated to share the night with Kevin? The farthest they'd ever gone was a little kiss on the cheek, and all of the sudden they were--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of nausea swept Sandy into the bathroom, making her regret her wandering thoughts. She wondered what she could have eaten that would be so violently fighting her. She hadn't eaten anything that whole evening; her dad made sure of that. Maybe that was her problem. She didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow would she manage the walk to school? Even at the peak of health, it was a staggering walk. In her current condition, it could be horrific. However, the only person who'd be able to drive her would be Kevin, as none of her friends had a car, Dad was at work (and hardly help regardless), and taxis were a joke around this town. It's only a few miles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Does she chance the hike or call up Kevin?</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A three mile jog was out of the question. Though she hated relying on him too much, Sandy knew that she had to ask Kevin for this. She had no doubt he'd be willing to help her, but he'd definitely want to talk about what happened last night. Sandy wasn't sure she knew the answers for herself at this point. Nevertheless, she pulled out her phone and jotted out a quick call for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cteal\"><span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\">[Kev?

They hadn't been dating that long, and after one night, he was throwing the word love around? She didn't dare reply back, for fear he'd misunderstand her. Heck, she was misunderstanding herself, after all the bizarre symptoms and peculiar emotional states. What had changed in her from seventeen to eighteen? Did becoming a \"true\" woman affect her more than she realized? And another thing, why was she asking so many questions of herself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy sighed and gave up the search for the perfect answer. Her life's complications were no different from any other's, she supposed. So why bother questioning them? She thought back to the blissful woman on the coin. Yes, she could be like that, too. Happy, contented. Pregnant. What a joke! As if that one night could affect her <i>that</i> suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin honked his horn. Without a second thought, Sandy snatched up her coin and her backpack and headed out. Kevin greeted her with that same smile, and Sandy had to stifle a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How're you feeling? Better? You didn't look so good this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psh, neither did you. I'm just not a morning person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer uncharacteristically cold response chilled Kevin. She held out for a moment, then apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I'm fine, since you were concerned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to know. I just thought that maybe--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy cut him off by turning up the radio. Kevin was good at reading subtle hints, so he didn't pry with any more questions. At least until they pulled up to the gates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin shut off the radio post haste, and turned fully to Sandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sandy, what happened last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, do you feel any different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I feel a day older.

So what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was this dream I had about us last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy didn't really want to hear it, but kept on listening anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the dream, we were- well, you were-- y'know--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm-- you know what we were doing last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here it comes: the moment Sandy had been dreading.

You had a dream where I was pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I thought it was weird. I mean, because you would know or tell me if you were, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin seemed to believe it wasn't a dream. This irked Sandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, that was odd. Don't think anything of it. I'll see you after school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you, sweets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned in to kiss her, but she offered her cheek instead. He was definitely getting too attached to her for his own good. She didn't want to push him further into this fantasy of his. They parted ways with a simple embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to find Lila and Holly. Let's hope Kev didn't talk to them, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach squeezed a bit, forcing Sandy to stop for a moment. The pain had subsided for a bit around Kevin, but the moment he left she was back into her own personal hell. If this continued, she might have to keep him around! The very idea...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clutched her stomach in pain. This was worse than a period, and she still had no idea what it was. At this point, a trip to the clinic sounded wonderful. Maybe the nurse could find out what was ailing her. But, then again, if she kept her friends waiting, there'd be more problems to worry about. The pain had subsided before, it would subside again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Should she make a pit stop at the nurse's office to see what's wrong, or meet up with her friends to get her mind off of things?</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sandy walked into the clinic without a care in the world, sure that she'd just come down with something that at worst would get her out of school for a few more days. No complaints there. She knocked on the door, and greeted the lounging nurse with a smile. That smile was quickly replaced by a little more reflux, as Sandy quickly took a seat. The nurse gave her a once over, then returned to her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy waited for the nurse to respond to her presence. Time ticked on, and the nurse seemed not to care. It was as if, in that one look, the nurse had decided Sandy wasn't worth the effort. Angrily, Sandy coughed. The nurse stirred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassandra Dall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you missed your period, Cassandra?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse shuffled through a desk drawer, pulling out a pamphlet of some sort. Sandy couldn't make it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple question: yes or no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy drew a blank. She couldn't remember her last period. Did that mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmph.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse grunted and pushed the pamphlet forward. <br>\r\nSandy squinted to read the fine print title: <u><b>Motherhood: A Teen's Guide</b></u>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was this nurse thinking? Just because she missed one period, she was automatically pregnant? This wasn't the first time the subject had come up, either. Was there some conspiracy to make Sandy regret an already awkward night even more? What about that coin that the shopkeep had given her? Wasn't it supposed to give her the life she deserved? She knew she didn't deserve this constant bullying from the universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's funny, but I'm not pregnant. I think I'm really sick, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been vomiting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, a lot recently...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse chuckled, and pushed the pamphlet even closer. Sandy fumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't be--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what they all say. Trust me, I know it when I see it. And I see it all over you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I only did it once, last--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last month, sure. I know. For whatever reason. So now it's up to you to handle it, like a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was only yesterda--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I know it was only yesterday you felt like a child. But you're eighteen now, and you're a woman. So act like one, and read the pamphlet! It'll tell you everything you need to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm <i>not</i> pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't believe me, go out and buy a testing kit. But you can save yourself a lot of money if you just trust me on this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a nice day, Ms. Dall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy slammed the door on her way out, blocking out the chuckles inside. Some help the nurse was. Now Sandy had even more problems on her hands. She couldn't get a proper diagnosis from the nurse because, as far as she was concerned, Sandy was one month pregnant. For all Sandy knew, she might be. She couldn't account for all the symptoms any better. But it didn't make sense. She'd never done that sort of thing before, only yesterday. Was it yesterday? Her mind drew a blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy looked at the pamphlet in her hands, then wondered whether or not to read it. In her opinion, she might as well know what's not happening to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guide covered the month by month stages of pregnancy, explaining the developments at each stage and offering advice for expectant mothers at each range. It had a paragraph on how to balance school and hospital schedules, fashion tips for managing a changing wardrobe, even a section on how family and friends factor in. The chipper outlook of the booklet cheered Sandy up a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least if I am pregnant, I'll know exactly what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed at the notion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the minute bell rung, warning all students to hurry to class. Sandy picked herself up and wandered over to first period. She practically slept through the entire morning, no surprise considering how late she'd been up. Lunch brought her to the table with Lila and Holly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sandy, you look a little... I dunno, bleak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's just---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy wondered if she should tell the truth to her friends. But did she even know what the truth was? Was she sick? Was she pregnant? And if so, wouldn't they want to know how? It worried her. She considered saying anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Does Sandy speak up, or let it slide?</i></span></div></div>",

Otherwise, they might start speculating and escalate the situation out of proportion. But how to word it without inviting further discussion?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I went to the nurse's office earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My gosh! Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. It's nothing too serious. She gave me something for it, so--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, for a second there I thought you were gonna drop a bomb on us or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly laughed, which unsettled Sandy a bit. Now she worried about what would happen if the true nature of her visit got out. She'd done well avoiding the question for the most part. But any hints towards what really happened and she'd become a laughing stock. Not on her agenda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains what Kevin was so worried about earlier. I talked with him--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Here it comes.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He seemed really worried about you, Sandy. He was blushing bad when we spoke. Did you guys--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly made a lewd gesture, and Lila slapped her for it. Playful Holly recoiled with a grin, but still eyed Sandy for the answer she deserved. Perhaps opening herself up so easily to friends like these wasn't the best choice. Sandy now had to defuse the situation before she ended up discussing her sexual history with the entire cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just celebrated my birthday together. Nothing you wouldn't do, right, Holly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pssh... Yeah. There's not much I wouldn't do, however.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave Sandy a coquettish smirk, and Sandy rolled her eyes. Leave it to Holly to make a self-deprecating joke all about the other person. Lila spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you two are done making innuendos, I have something to ask Sandy. It's <i>really</i> important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly shared a look with Lila, and the two of them spun on Sandy with big grins. Sandy was afraid for what would come next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since we didn't get a chance to see you yesterday, Holly and I---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We planned a big birthday bash this weekend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy gasped; half happy, half terrified.The weekend was three days away, and if her symptoms worsened by then, it could be devastating. Not attending a party in her honor was social suicide. But, if she did attend the party, and threw up again, the taunts and jeers following could haunt the rest of her senior year. It would be a tough call, one that she was willing to make to save her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holly had her dad rent out the clubhouse. You know the one. Almost never available, any time of year. We were <i>sooo</i> lucky to get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're free, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow how to handle the situation? She couldn't say no to that. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity. The clubhouse was the perfect party location; all of them spoke of going there at least once a week. And now, it was a reality. It just happened to fall right when Sandy was completely overwhelmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And don't worry about asking your dad to take you. Kev says he can get you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust the cherry on top: she'd have to ride up to the party of her dreams with the guy she couldn't handle. The pressure was closing in on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good. I'll see you there, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"8 PM Saturday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach churned again, forcing her to her feet. <i>If I make it until then,</i> she thought. She made a quick apology, and left her friends for the bathroom. There she stayed until the end of lunch, practically unable to move. Her mind drifted in and out of consciousness. At some point, she had a vision of herself in that closet door mirror again. This time, she was at least four months pregnant. Same as before, Kevin was lying on the bed, and she was examining herself. She ran her hands over the fullness of her body, and eventually found a cold spot. She pulled back her hand to find the coin resting in her palm, that permanent smile still affixed to the woman on the front. She peered deeper and deeper into the mystery woman's expression, until finally, the face started to resemble her own. As she looked back into the closet doors, she was now much further along than before, and still bearing that trademark smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe awoke with a jolt at the end of day bell, having lasted the rest of the day without being seen. She snuck out of the school utterly embarassed. Too shy to call up Kevin to give her a ride back home, she used the rest of the walk there to sort out her thoughts. Something was definitely up, and Sandy had the feeling it would only get worse from here on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs usual, she came home before Bradley and her father. Good. She didn't want them to see her in this state. She laid down on her bed and let her mind wander.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b><div align=\"center\">--- Day Two ---</div></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy woke up in the middle of the night yet again, this time with a tenderness all over. Her pajamas definitely weren't fitting like they used to. The pants clung to her hips and strained her gait. Her every step pounded in her head. She had to go to the bathroom yet again. At this rate, alerting the others to her presence was the least of her worries. It was humiliating to be entirely dependent on the nearest restroom. Sandy staggered her way down the hall, too strained to worry about her self-esteem. She shut the door behind her and hung over the sink, panting heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mirror caught Sandy's eye again. After silently locking the door, Sandy took the chance to examine herself in private. That's when she noticed quite a few changes about herself. Her wider hips stretched her drawstring to the point where she couldn't tie them off anymore. It wasn't just her pajama pants that were ill-fitting, but her nightshirt as well. Her reddish, swollen breasts had pushed their way out under the loose hanging garment. They itched to the touch, so Sandy avoided them as best she could. And though she'd eaten her fair share at lunch and dinner, her waistline would suggest otherwise. She brushed her hands over her slight stomach bulge with morbid curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInternally, a whole different set of changes were happening. Sandy's emotions flurried into one another as she struggled with a mix of happiness, trepidation, and outright fear. She had no idea what was happening to her, but the thought didn't scare her. A small voice in the back of her mind encouraged her to relax and let \"it\" happen, whatever it might be. Sandy had no idea what fate she was accepting, but the calming influence of her subconscious kept her from panicking at all these sudden developments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned to bed, eased on by her soothing inner voice. She hoped to get a few more hours sleep before she returned to school the next day. Unfortunately, the churning in her stomach didn't subside for longer than a few minutes at a time. Even with her continued trips up and down the hall, she managed to rest decently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning light streaked through Sandy's window and woke her. She stood up again, pangs still cropping up in her steps. It was much more bearable now, however. Sandy walked into the kitchen to prepare her breakfast. She pondered the pantry's contents, wondering what to eat. The taste for something sickeningly sweet was on her tongue. Bradley wouldn't miss some of his cereal, Sandy rationalized. She poured out a bowl discreetly, ate quickly, then moved on to packing lunch. A good ol' peanut butter sandwich sounded nice, so she brought out the ingredients. Something drove her to pick out the peach preserves from the cabinet as a jelly. Unusual, for a girl who normally didn't like peaches, but even more unusual was her choice of cucumbers as a topping after the fact. Even she eyed her creation with some disbelief, but her stomach didn't lie. It would make a very interesting meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy gauged herself before making the journey to school. She knew she had Kevin on hand if worst came to worst, after all. In the end, she opted to walk alone, enjoying the peace of mind it would bring her. She could talk to Kevin later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arrived at school with no further delays, a welcome surprise. Sandy found herself among Lila and Holly, then spent the rest of the morning happily chatting with the two of them. They sat in the school's courtyard with their backpacks splayed out. As Sandy went digging for her unfinished homework, Lila raised a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that sticking out of your bag, Sandy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy glanced down, and saw two papers edging out of her bag. One was the folded up homework paper, and the other was her pregnancy pamphlet. Before she could close the bag, Lila reached out and grabbed one of the two. Sandy squirmed in anticipation, not sure which paper she'd gotten. If it was the wrong one, the consequences could be disastrous. Sandy didn't want to look. Lila let out a little gasp.</span></div></div>",

She peeked out slowly at the paper in her friend's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortune smiled on Sandy today, as it was only the assignment for the day in Lila's hands. She took a sigh of relief, then snatched it back from her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you didn't have this homework finished, Sandy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know. I just wasn't feeling well, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know. So when's it due?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy clutched herself instinctually. Could they see it too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, Holly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The homework, silly. Do you know when it's due?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy shrugged and played the fool to detract attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh heh heh, no I don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it just so happens to be today, Sandy. How could you forget something this important?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLila pierced right through her with a cold gaze. Sandy knew that Lila wouldn't take any excuses, as was her nature. Holly, on the other hand, was much more lenient in regards to schooling. She had already forgiven Sandy for the issue. After all, it wasn't Holly's homework that Sandy would have to copy down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had other things on my plate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like Kevin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross, Holly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly laughed and eased the tension in the air. Lila wouldn't be satisfied with a response like that, but it'd have to do. Class was starting up all too soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you guys later! Bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye, Sandy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you in class later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLila's biting comment stung Sandy on her way out. In the back of her mind, Sandy worried that Lila might have seen the other pamphlet anyways, and was starting to suspect her. She might be making it worse by playing the fool around her very keen-eyed friend. Sandy considered how she would break the news to her friends if they did find out the truth. Would they even believe her story, about suddenly being pregnant? She hardly believed it herself, and apart from her bizarre morning, she had no real proof that was the case. In time, she'd know for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike before, the periods passed throughout the day without many notable occurrences. Sandy had to repeatedly use up her hall passes for the bathroom, but she'd gotten accustomed to her frequent trips by now. The teachers didn't care much for her leaving, either. Since it was the second semester of her senior year, most of the hard work was out of the way. Finals wouldn't be for a few more months, and of course prom loomed on the horizon, the perfect distraction. It was surprising to find someone even focused on their studies, like Lila. Everyone else daydreamed about that next big event. Sandy was just taking advantage of a common state of mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the moment arrived: the class just before lunch. She shared the period with Lila and Holly, and it was their only class together. It was also the class she'd unfortunately forgotten the homework for. As she pulled the packet from her backpack, she realized how many points this assignment cost. It could make or break her grade for the class. Now she knew why Lila made such a fuss over it; Sandy couldn't let this slide like the rest of her life until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the teacher coming around quickly, Sandy had to make a split second decision. Her current options were to turn it in empty or... Or... She struggled to come up with a plan. Just then, the urge to go to the bathroom rose inside her. Sandy realized that she had a way out, or two. Hastily she flipped through the pages of the packet, six in total. It would be tough to finish them in the time it took for her to go to the bathroom, but she could at least edge out a few pages. Then again, if the pressure of that was too much, she could always conveniently find an excuse to visit the nurse. She'd clearly been ill yesterday, so it wasn't much of a stretch to assume she'd be ill today. Hopefully her teacher could connect the dots for her and let her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher loomed a desk behind her. It was now or never.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Try to finish the assignment, or skip out to \"the nurse's office\"?</i></span></div></div>",

Lila swiveled in her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Sandy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! I need to borrow your homework?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh uh. Not this time. You're going to take responsibility for this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Lila! I can't fail this class.

Do us all a favor and help yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Lila turned her back on her friend and turned in her paper. There went Sandy's first chance. Now all she could do was hope that the assignment was short enough to do in a bathroom break...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy took a deep breath, then leapt to her feet. She flashed her hall pass to the teacher on the way out, hoping that her exit would divert attention from the unfinished packet in her hands. Sandy had a reputation to improve at this school, if she ever hoped to get out of this rut in her road. Plus, the last thing she needed was an F when faced with this mystery sickness. She couldn't keep letting the things in her life slip by her. If she did, she'd be no better than her dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it seems cruel to judge someone while sitting on the toilet, finishing yesterday's homework assignment. Sandy considered the irony for a moment. But there was no more time to lose; she put pen to paper and steadfastly wrote out her answers. Luckily, the problems were at least one word: dates and times. This was especially rare for a history packet. If she'd needed to write out full sentences, she would've been a goner. Everything in her brain started to click into place. It seems fortune was smiling on Sandy again as she finished the assignment in record time. Or what seemed like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy re-entered the classroom after a full twenty minutes, as those still awake gave her a glare. She wasn't getting any sympathy from her peers in this circumstance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, Sandy approached Mrs. Floyd's desk with confidence. The teacher took one look at the hastily scrawled page, then filed it away quietly. Sandy returned to her seat in a state of shock. Normally, Mrs. Floyd would have at least taken this opportunity to teach her some Aesop, or to make an example of her before the whole class. Rarely did any student escape a strict reprimand from her. Unwittingly, Sandy's eyes drifted back to Mrs. Floyd. She gazed at Sandy with this pitying expression, as if to say, \"I understand you.\" Sandy found it odd, as she didn't understand herself what could be the matter. She remembered a similar look from the nurse's office yesterday, when the nurse had declared the impossible. That worried her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the lesson droned on. Sandy tried as best as she could not to fall asleep, but something kept drawing her eyes shut. That same fatigue from early this morning cropped again with renewed force. It took all her strength just to keep from drooping into her arms. Lila prodded her awake from the adjacent seat, always glaring. Sandy rubbed her bruised shoulder and returned the look. She wondered how Lila would feel in her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach little conflict between Sandy and Lila drew the attention of Mrs. Floyd. Sandy tried to hide her shame with a grin, and Mrs. Floyd obligingly left her alone. Her kind behavior now irked Sandy. She wondered how she could have tamed the lionhearted Mrs. Floyd. And from the looks of it, so was Lila.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass ended suddenly. Lila packed up her belongings and left without a second glance at Sandy. She knew she'd have to make it up to her friend in the long run, but for now she'd leave Lila alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sandy gathered her things, she caught the eye of Mrs. Floyd on her. The teacher beckoned her to the front of the room. This didn't look good. Sandy reluctantly walked forward, hoping that this wouldn't be the horrible punishment she'd so far avoided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassandra--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Floyd was already making it personal. Sandy knew the worst would be coming now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something you want to tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy had diverted her gaze from Mrs. Floyd, expecting a tongue lashing like none other. When she finally looked her teacher in the eyes, she found a very mixed expression. Sandy didn't know how to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... sorry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing to be sorry about, Cassandra. I'm sure it's not your fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy was a little relieved that Mrs. Floyd didn't care about the homework. Maybe her behavior <i>had</i> made it obvious she wasn't all there. Mrs. Floyd continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got a call from the front office earlier, namely the clinic. About you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy was shocked that the nurse would have called anyone. She'd seemed so lazy yesterday, misdiagnosing her condition and refusing to help her after the fact. So why would she be calling Mrs. Floyd?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I know that it must be tough for you to handle this all on your own. So I want you to know that I'm here for you, if you need help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thanks, Mrs. Floyd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was extremely bizarre. Mrs. Floyd barely spoke to her students outside of class, and now she was trying to befriend her? It didn't add up. Sandy wanted to interject, when Mrs. Floyd started to speak again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been there, too, you know. When I was pregnant with my daughter Carol, I was in my first year of college. I was always tired, restless---\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you've got the wrong idea, Mrs. Floyd. I'm not pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Mrs. Floyd was confused. Perhaps Sandy said something she shouldn't have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just between us, okay? You can be honest with me. I'm not going to judge you. Like I said, I've been in your shoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not! I can't be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what we all say. Sometimes it just happens, completely unexpected. But we're all here to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, that's really nice, Mrs. Floyd. But for the last time, I'm really not pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Floyd sighed, and rolled back in her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just as stubborn as you about it, too. I won't hold you up anymore, Sandy. If you ever want someone to talk to about it, I'm here for you, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy didn't grace that one with a reply, and walked straight out of the room. First the nurse, and now Mrs. Floyd? Maybe even all her teachers. She'd been wondering why they'd treated her frequent departures with a grain of salt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLila and Holly would be waiting for her in the lunchroom. They'd probably find out about the nurse's mistake, too. Would they think the same thing? Did she really seem pregnant? For some reason, she really wished she could smile about all this. But it wouldn't be a laughing matter if people kept confusing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy walked into the cafeteria completely perplexed. How would she dispel the rumors about herself if even the teachers believed it? Worse yet, her mystery illness puffed her up to look like a baby carriage. She was even having a hard time believing it was just her body reacting to a nasty flu, and not a body growing inside her. In misery, she took a seat somewhere out of the public eye, deciding to eat alone instead of facing her friends. She pulled out her lunch from earlier, and chowed down. Lucky there was no one to watch her munching on the peanut butter, peach, and cucumber sandwich. It was surprisingly tasty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her peace of mind wouldn't last. Someone she knew would have to pass by soon enough, and <i>who else but...?</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Sandy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA familiar voice called out, one that Sandy wasn't too keen on hearing. Before she had time to turn around, Kevin sat himself beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was so worried about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed really hurt. Sandy didn't want to see his face like that, so she continued chowing down on her sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you eating? Is that <i>cucumber</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what if it is? Are you my dad now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy retorted vehemently at Kevin, taking him aback. When she finally got a look at his face, she boiled up to see him bearing that same pathetic expression as her teacher. She couldn't stand it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I waited outside the school for two hours yesterday, and you never showed up. I thought you'd gotten in trouble, but now I get it. You didn't want to see me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Exactly,</i> Sandy thought. But she couldn't bring herself to say that to him. He might be a pushover, but she wasn't about to bully him. He was, after all, still looking out for her. She took a breath, then finished off her sandwich. She released the tension in her shoulders, then turned to face Kevin completely. His eyes were filled with so much sadness and worry, like a puppy dog left out in the rain. With a face like that, Sandy couldn't just bark at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Kev. I should have told you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least text me next time if you're not going to be there. So I know you're okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anything were to happen to you, I don't know what I'd do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to get so worked up about me, Kev. I can handle myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just care about you, a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for caring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis glance shifted downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you care about me still?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do, silly! What makes you say that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin drew closer to Sandy, making her blush. Suddenly, he embraced her. His tight grasp, his blond curls brushing against the back of her neck, his soft little breaths all brought back the memories of two nights ago. Deep down, she knew she adored him. That night was proof enough in her mind. Her moods were just muddled by the onset of her illness, this pregnancy scare, and probably crazy hormones. She didn't know if she was ready to call it love, however, so she played her cards close to the chest. In time, who knows? Maybe things would change between them if she opened up more, but that would take a lot of time and a lot of trust. They'd only been dating a few months, hardly enough time to really get to know the whole person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin drew back with a slight smile on his face. He apparently remembered something funny, which brought the light back into his eyes and the laugh back into his lips. Sandy couldn't help but smile back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I imagine you've heard about the party by now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure have. You still want to drive me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy was looking forward to the drive after all. It meant more time getting to know Kevin, which, in the end, she really wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be looking forward to it, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them spent the rest of lunch chatting aimlessly about other things. Nothing too important, which was good for Sandy. She needed someone to get her mind off the past few days, and ironically Kevin handled the job perfectly. He didn't press her any further on the sandwich, too, which was a plus. By the time lunch was over, both of them felt significantly more relaxed. They rose to their feet together. Kevin put his hand on Sandy's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye, sweets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then planted a kiss on her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll text you later, Kev.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. See you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them set off for opposite sides of the campus. That was another snag in their relationship: no shared classes. Most of their time together was spent out of school. Not that Sandy minded, for Kevin also made a nice distraction from her other big problem at home. But, it would be nice to share a few periods of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy mulled her way through the rest of school without much event. Like in Mrs. Floyd, none of her teachers bothered her when she frequented the restroom. She wondered if she could use this to her advantage, but didn't linger on the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day ended and Sandy headed for the usual exit. On her way there, she ran into Holly, walking all by herself. Her friend looked a little bummed, so she stopped by to talk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sexy, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Sandy, it's you. Didn't see you at lunch, thought you'd gone home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I was here. Just had lunch with Kev.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ooh.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly gave a playful roll of the eyes, but didn't cheer up much. Sandy pressed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, Holly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's just the usual slew of problems. Cheer squad practice being cancelled for the third time this week, and, well, Seth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seth, again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeaaah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeth Hastings was Holly's on-again off-again boyfriend, and a constant troublemaker. Before her, he'd been rumored to date entire girls' teams, namely soccer, lacrosse, water polo, even debate and chess. Once he made his way to the senior cheerleaders, however, he was stopped dead in his tracks by Holly. They'd since dated for months or weeks at a time, but since old habits die hard, they'd end up breaking it off every so often. Not to say Holly herself didn't sometimes seek out other guys; she had a bit of a reputation herself. Yet, something always drew them back together, and Sandy never quite understood what. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed as if this was one of those break-up periods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what his problem is anymore! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should know Seth, it's in his nature to fool around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not fooling around anymore, Sandy. He just--- he wants to get serious with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get serious? He's one to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I said. But then he was all, 'We need to take this relationship to the next level.' And I didn't know what to say. I thought we were already pretty intimate. What's the next step beyond that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you guys have been on and off for quite a while now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just how we are. I thought he understood that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holly, do you even understand that? I mean, if you don't want to be with him--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I do, Sandy, I really do! I just don't know if I can do what he's asking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like he's asking you to marry him, Holly. Lighten up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly shot Sandy a bitter look. Sandy knew something was up now; Holly never took matters this seriously. Something Seth said must have really struck a chord with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we've still got the party this weekend. So if he's still bugging you, think of all the fun you can have without him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, you're right, Sandy. Thanks a bunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolly hugged her friend quickly before setting off in the other direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye now! See you tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya, Holly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy now stood before the exit, ready to walk home. She took her first few steps with a clearer mind, then immediately backtracked to the nearest restrooms for a quick pit stop. This condition was really taking it out of her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sandy had to laugh at the sight of her ten-year-old brother curled up in a pillow fort, his eyes glued to the screen. Just to mess with him, Sandy stepped right in the way when Bradley laid out his killshot. After a few seconds of dazed confusion, Bradley leapt to his feet and threw down the controller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fair! I almost beat him, and you messed me up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello to you, too, Braddles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrrrrrr...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing Bradley hated more than people interrupting his game were stupid nicknames. Sandy made a point to come up with a new one every time she saw him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can always try again, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't save!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, then maybe I taught you a lesson, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBradley sat back on the couch with his arms crossed. He turned away with a pout, causing Sandy to laugh even harder at him. Even though he could be a little brat, she didn't mind. Sandy actually liked children. When she started high school, she'd considered becoming a pediatrician, or even a teacher. When Bradley was a little younger, she babysat him and his friends on the weekends. So she'd grown up very fond of children, dreaming of having her own in the far off future. In the present, she still had to take care of Bradley, who'd grown out of the cute kid phase about a year ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're making dinner tonight, Sandy. Dad called and said he won't be home until late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you're going to help me, little brother. It's about time you learned something useful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm playing my game! I have to get back to Level 90.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be waiting for you, if you save it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBradley huffed and puffed for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you help, we'll go out for ice cream after dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped right up at the mention of a reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the afternoon went by pretty quickly. Sandy made sure to check for her homework this time, and finished a few lingering assignments she'd left over. Sandy actually got Bradley to clean his room up, too, with the same promise of ice cream. When they finally got to making the pizza bread for dinner, Bradley was so well behaved Sandy practically didn't know him. It made her fond of the days when they'd been so close. It was a pity he was doing it all for some cheap ice cream. True to her word, she bought him a tiny portion cup of ice cream. For herself, she snuck a whole pint into the cart. As long as Bradley didn't see...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later, Sandy put the ten year old to bed after a quick game session that evening. Once he was safely asleep, she took out the pint container and sat down to watch some TV. She fell asleep on the couch with the empty pint sitting on the counter.</span></div></div>",

Funny, considering it had been on her couch. She raised her arms up high and stretched. There was a twinge of pain in her lower back, but nothing she didn't expect from her bizarre sleeping posture. Sandy calmly walked into her room to pick up some clothes for the day. As she gathered her things, she noticed a pile of her clothes from the other day in a wad in the corner. She thought back to the coin, which she hadn't seen since her birthday. She almost went looking for it, before hearing Bradley stirring in the other room. If she wanted the bathroom to herself, she'd have to be quick about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy swept up her clothes with one arm and a towel with the other. Quickly she darted down the hall, locking herself into the bathroom. She reached around for the lights, then set her clothes on the counter. After a moment's pause, she stepped into the shower and washed away her troubles. Everything was going swimmingly, as if she was perfectly healthy again! But it was too good to be true, for just as she stepped out, she ducked headfirst into the toilet and vomited. She lost her footing after that, falling to the ground and staying there for a good five minutes. Once she regained awareness, she stood up before the mirror and tried to resume getting dressed. However, other issues stood out for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy slid into her underwear fairly easy, but when trying to blindly clasp her bra, she ran into a bit of difficulty. Her eyes flicked up to the mirror, where she caught a glimpse of something she definitely hadn't expected. Sandy jumped back in shock, sending the bra flying to the ground. In her reflection there were now two sizable spheres with dark, saucer-like circles in the middle. She poked one of them, cringing at its tenderness. She feebly lifted the bra to her chest, comparing the two. No wonder her bra wouldn't fit, she'd now swollen up at least a cup size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no explanation in Sandy's mind that could explain this sudden development. She'd stopped growing years ago, so there should be no reason for her breasts to start ballooning like this. Unless there was some truth to the nurse's statement...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a peek out the door, Sandy couldn't see Bradley down the hall. Good. She snuck back into her room, clothes in hand. Safely behind the confines of her own walls, she sat down and thought about what to do next. Just then, she saw the clock on the wall. It was actually two hours before school! Naturally, she'd woken up early, which explains why Bradley wasn't up. If she hurried now, she could get all the proof she needed. Griger's was just down the street, and was open practically twenty-four hours. She could buy a kit early, and time allowing, test herself. She might even find a new bra to wear for the day. But she needed to make a decision now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Should Sandy go to Griger's, or skip it and wait for school?</i></span></div></div>",

It was a large apartment, she shared it with a Brazilian man who surfs and his sexy curvaceous blonde girlfriend, she was a weather girl on the channel 5 news. Even though Antonio ( the Brazilian) was built like a tank designed by Tony Stark, it was the girlfriend that she actually preferred. Something about that long flowing hair and perfect body, makes her think about her little pudgy belly sometimes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left after Lonie decided she needed some well do rest after having pickles and ice cream with Jennifer.

No one except an old woman reading on her kindle, she knew the voice wasn't hers because the voice was sounding more like a British articulative man. <span class=\"cred\">don't worry, you can't see me, also, before we get into it, just think what you say instead of saying it, that way we miss your awkwardness</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" hey! \" Gwen objected out loud, drawing attention to herself. <span class=\"cred\">what did I say? Look don't worry about it, just think of me as your subconscious, or a mental version of Jarvis.</span> \" um alright?\" Gwen thought, looking forward trying not to look as weird as some of the others on the train. <span class=\"cred\">look, you remember that thing you picked up this morning, well it's an old artefact designed to show people what they want, sexually, here look at the women over there and flip the coin.</span> as if she was on auto-pilot she stared at one of the women and flipped the coin. Tails. The girl turned away from the man and hurled into her hand bag. \" Oh no! My UPhone, I just bought the 6s model!\" She cried as she sat down. \" uh that's not my fetish, I have been on 4chon and that's not what I like, <span class=\"cred\">okay sorry, that was just a test run, flip it on that other friend of hers.</span> she stared at the chubby raven haired slut wearing a cleavage bearing cocktail dress.

She was sitting in a restaurant with her favourite actress Kylie Manearo from her favourite sci fi series, The Plasma Beast Hunt! She was in costume, she has the hunter outfit on, a coat, a pregnant belly, her ray gun, wait hold on! She looked again, past her large cleavage and saw the huge protruding belly. She gentle touched it, yep it was real! Shen then looked back up to Kylie and realised that through the sexy attire she was wearing, she was heavily pregnant too. Her amazing, Peggy Carter face, man she never realised her chest size before, and that fantastic blue dress that showed off her incredible bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were eating a breathtakingly delicious meal when who else but John Ford the very tall, very handsome star from the werewolves of london movie shows up. She goes to kiss Kylie and Gently runs her belly. He then comes to you and does the same thing! \"The John Ford is rubbing my large and well sexy pregnant belly\" she thought looking back down shyly. <br>\r\n\" oh don't turn away miss\" John said carefully \" this our first time too\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" yeah, I have always dreamed of having a three way, but I didn't imagine it whilst in this condition!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A three way!?\" She blurted out loudly, causing people around them to look straight at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" sshhh, yes darling, but I'm sure you know about cravings. Don't worry, that's why we are here, to ease you into it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh god, she was thinking, why is she here? She knew she was bi, but this, tonight!? What the hell is going on!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was starting to get anxious, 3 very pregnant women pantsuits come in and drag you out. Your scream as Kylie tries to help but as you leave you see her in a pleasures state as her belly grows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke woke up to the sound of Sally turning on a blender. \" Holy crap! the rapture is here! Hide me in Gwen's bag and I can sneak in to heaven\" he yelled as he jumped up only to see Sally blending fruit. \" oh it's just you\" he said walking over to what he thought was the bathroom door. \" um don't go in there, that's, oh I don't care\" she muttered grabbing another banana to add to her smoothie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke looked in Gwen's messy room, action figures, signed memorabilia and cosplay clothes littered the floor. On the bed was Gwen who was still in yesterday's clothes. The contents of her bag were on the bed to. There was a packet of tiick tacks, her phone, a used pregnancy test, her book on dragons and a dusty/shiny coin. He picked up and looked at it as he left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" let me guess, you are gunna flip that coin, aren't you?\" Sally said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" hey don't mock my routine, I have it mastered. Here, heada or tails?\" Luke said accordingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I'm not playing your games\" Sally replied egotistically <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" seriously? What's the harm?\" He pleaded just hat little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,I choose heads\"  Sally said angrily surrendering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke flipped the coin in his perculiar way. Up and up into the air it soared as he looked at Sally. It landed on his palm with a light whack. He looked down and before he could say anything Sally was puking in the sink. \" tails\" he said smugly \" hey you don't need to act like that, I tell you what I'll do it again.\" He flipped the coin and it landed on tails a second time! \" see I got a gift! Maybe it's the smoothie.\" He said taking a wiff of it. \" girl you shouldn't be putting eggs and bananas together!\" He said jokingly. Placing the coin on the table. </span></div></div>",

She is ment to be at work in 10 minutes! In a blur she shoved everything into her bag with one hand, whilst the other tried putting on her blazer. In the matter of 3 minutes she was dressed and out the door completely ignoring Luke's and Sally's discussion. Well it was more like Luke's endless whit and Sally's endless puke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretching Luke decided it was Time to leave before he got sick. He took a quick shower, as he went into the kitchen he took one whiff and decided to get breakfast elsewhere. \" well it's been fun Sally, but I prefer my days to off with less of a bad smell, bye!\" Luke said, grabbing his bag, phone, wallet, Gwen's coin and his watch. He caught the next elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning across the lobby, Gwen nearly tripped over the Hudson twins. those lazy rich women. They are the same age as she and they are smooching off their parents! They two brunette giggled as she ran for the door just catching the 8:50 into town. The twins continued on with their business until they looked over to see Luke get off the elevator. They were in awe of his unshaven face, his shaggy hair and how his clothed made him look like he didn't care. The two girls waved him down. \"Excuse me!\" Candice called \" we were wondering if you could help us\". Luke looked at the dazzling, mouth wateringly gorgeous girls and suspected something. \"Hmmm, heads I go over there, tails I don't\" he said pulling out the pregnancy coin. Looking at the two girls he flicked it into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saunted over as Candice's belly expanded out of her striped shirt and Grace took a hurl in the trash bin next to them. \" good god, what's wrong with this building\" Luke thought as he got to them. \" what seems to be the trouble?\" Candice started rubbing her belly as Grace finished. \" I'm sorry to do this to you, but well my sister is just starting her pregnancy and I am towards the end, I was wondering if you could give me a belly rub.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure no problem\" he said shrugging his shoulders \" it's always nice to rub a pregnant belly\". Oh crap he thought, did he say that out loud? Candice smirked, and decided to make use of this oppurtunity. \" Man, you must be a professional\" she said as grace gave her a filthy look \" you know I'm here too\" she said annoyed at fact she had no attention her way what so ever. \" sorry, she's the one with the pregnant belly, I'm Luke by the way.\"<br>\r\n\" Nice to meet you, I'm Candice and my evil twin here is Grace\" Candice said sticking her tounge out at her sister, Grace rolled her eyes. \" oh that is perfect, do you think you could do my feet?\"<br>\r\n\" alright, but you two need to buy me breakfast\" he said eagerly, there was just something about pregnant women that was soo good! He started with the left foot, his days working in the masseuse were about to pay off. Within 5 seconds of massaging her now larger feet, Candice was almost at orgasm, not realising where she was. \" OOOOOOOHHHHHHHhhhhhhh don't stop!\" She squealed biting her bottom lip. By the end of it, Luke was sweating and Candice was broken, she had to push her tounge back in her mouth. \" sorry about that \" said grace, \" she can be a bit, vocal\"<br>\r\n\" I can tell,\" Luke said wiping sweat off his brow. \" so how about that breakfast?\" He said, looking down at the heavily pregnant woman gasping for air on the lobbies couch. \" yes, yes, breakfu- I mean sexfa- let's go.\" She gasped as they all got up and walked to the cafe across the street</span></div></div>",

Dustin?\" At his name being called, he turns with a customer service smile on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, how may I help-\" He cuts himself off, giving out a true smile to the person in front of him. \"Oh! Hi, Mrs. Smith!\" Mrs. Smith was one of the store's regular customers. Dustin helped her out on occasions whenever she needed something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just needed assistance trying to find some things my grandchildren want.\" She hold a shopping list in her hand.

I'm not what this is supposed to be but you can have it.\" She puts the item in Dustin's hand and quickly walks out to the parking lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDustin opens his palms up and stares. What she gave him was some kind of odd coin. On one of the faces was a pregnant man and pregnant woman who were smiling. He turns the coin around. On the other face was the same man and woman but this time they had panicked looks on their face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What a weird coin</i>, he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Newman!\" A voice barks. \"Get back to work!\" It was his boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDustin rolls his eyes. \"Sure thing.\" He pockets the coin and starts working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes later, he's off his shift. He clocks out then heads to his car. He drives home. Once he's there, he parks his car and heads to the door. Opening it up, he calls out to the living room. \"Dad, I'm home!\" He could smell something delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Dustin!\" In walks his father, Mark. Mark was a 'hot young thing\", in other words, a DILF. It helped that Mark was 15 when Dustin was born. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was work?\" Mark had on his apron.He wiped his hands on it and sat down next to Dustin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same old same old. Mrs. Smith came by. I helped her and stuff.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Father and son sit there in silence for a few good minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark then gets up and goes back to the kitchen. \"I'll call you when dinner is ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDustin digs into his pocket and pulls out the coin.

He touches it. <i>Hello babies, it's your Mama.</i> A kick greets him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dustin! Are you alright?

It was too much for Carol, so she left baby Dustin and a 17 year old Mark. It didn't help that Carol got pregnant again right after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark sighs.

She ran into the bathroom, barely making it. \"HURK!\" she let out, as the contents of her stomach were released into the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her lunch was lost into the bowl, a fog entered her mind, overwriting old memories with new ones.  A month of memories were modified, making her think that this nausea and vomiting had been going on for a while.  It also gave her the memory of having a sexual encounter with a guy she met at a party while drinking.  The fog left her brain around the same time she finished vomiting, never suspecting that anything unusual had happened in the first place.  \"Sorry, what were you saying, Betty?\" she asked as she left the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, like I said before you chucked up lunch, what do you want to do for your birthday nine days from now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a party, I guess.

Before she could examine that thought more closely, her stomach growled.  \"Ugh, I feel hungry enough to eat a whole pizza,\" she said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you said three days ago,\" Betty said, rolling her eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's what it feels like, so that's what I'm saying,\" Nicole retorted.

A strange tingling sensation started to dance across the skin of her impossibly flat stomach, and a foggy sensation began to creep into Nicole's mind. Nicole staggered, and held her hand against the wall to steady herself. Reality rapidly re-wrote itself and new memories began to replace Nicole's old ones. The last eight months of her life was partially erased and re-written, and Nicole's mind suddenly filled with memories that hadn't been there just moments before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The memory of having sex with that cute, dark haired guy she met at Chloe's beach party. Nicole could remember lying on the cool sand, his warm body writhing on top of her, his lightly calloused hands skimming over her soft skin. She could remember how oddly gentle he was, through the drunken haze, and how he had kissed her face over and over again as he pushed himself into her. She could remember them laughing about how sand had gotten everywhere, she could remember the dark haired guy pulling her up to her feet, and she could remember leaning against him as he led her back over to where the rest of the party had gathered around an enormous bonfire. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole remained frozen in place as memories flickered through her mind. Slowly, her stomach began to grow. It pushed out slowly into a slight curve, making it look as if Nicole was simply pushing her stomach out. It continued to steadily swell, rounding out into a potbelly that stuck out proudly from Nicole's otherwise slender frame. Her breasts grew a little fuller and started to push against her suddenly too-small bra, tanned flesh threatening to spill over the tops of the cups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nicole could remember being sick, sick enough that she had to force herself to go see a doctor. Her family's private doctor, to be precise. There he had bluntly told her to take a pregnancy test, and then had informed her that she was expecting. He hadn't seemed surprised, he knew what sort of life the party princess led, and he had simply given her the information on what to do from there on out. Nicole had stamped her foot and demanded an abortion, the doctor had informed her she was too far gone. She might of had all of the money in the world, but  no surgeon in the world would abort a pregnancy that advanced. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's stomach bloomed out into a firm baby bump, a taut ball that jutted out over the waistband of her unbuttoned denim shorts. It began to hang down a little from the weight and pulled at the small of Nicole's back. Her bellybutton popped as her belly surged outwards without warning. Her breasts swelled up another cup size, pushing against the thinning material of Nicole's now too small tank top. The growth began to slow, ever so slightly, as Nicole's pregnancy approached eight months. Her bump was a little on the larger size, she couldn't pull down her tank top over the expanded flesh if she wanted to,and her skin was as taut as a drum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you say, Betty?\" Nicole blinked at her friend as the last of her memories were slotted into place, \"I didn't hear you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said,\" Betty began again, rolling her eyes, \"Ugh, you've been so airheaded ever since you got knocked up! I said-\"</span></div></div>",

That's what you've become,\" replied Betty in a mocking tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole fumed.  Ever since she'd found out she was pregnant, Betty had been completely unsupportive.  Admittedly, no one she knew was really <i>happy</i> that she was now with child, herself included, but they'd all eventually learned to deal with it.  Betty, on the other hand, seemed to think that making fun of her was now part of her duties as her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like I'm fat for no good reason,\" she explained for what had to be the tenth time in the last month.  \"I'm pregnant.  This,\" she gestured to her larger frame, \"is part of the package.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may be so.  But that doesn't change the fact that you are a tubbo now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole scowled and crossed her arms, resting them on top of her bared belly.  It wouldn't be so bad if she was just giving her some light-hearted teasing.  Friends do that kind of thing all the time.  But Betty was being downright mean!  She knew Nicole was going through a hard time, and she was insisting on making it harder.  It was getting to the point where she wondered if they should even be friends anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wouldn't be so bad if you actually dressed like the fatty you are.  Got some plus-sizes or preggy clothes on you or something.\"  Betty flicked back her red hair over her shoulder and pointed at Nicole's stomach.  \"But you keep dressing like you did eight months ago!  You're not a size zero anymore, so stop acting like you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole looked away from Betty in a way that was meant to look haughty, but in reality was to hide the blush creeping up her face.  She hadn't really been preparing for the birth that would be coming in about a month's time.  She hadn't gotten any baby supplies or maternity clothes or anything like that.  Part of her had been trying to deny that this was actually happening to her.  And deep down inside her, she got a bit of a thrill showing off how large she was getting.  She liked baring her belly to the world.  But she wasn't about to admit that to anyone, even herself.  <i>'Still,'</i> she thought to herself, <i>'I should get some baby supplies.  I've been putting it off way too long.'</i>  \"You don't understand what I'm going through,\" she said out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and I don't want to.  Not if it means being a lardo like you,\" Betty scoffed.  \"I guess all the stories are wrong; fatties aren't jolly at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole growled in anger.  That was it!  She had enough of Betty's attitude!  \"I wish you were pregnant too!  See how you like it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me,</span> said a voice in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if that would ever happen,\" Betty rolled her eyes, \"I'm not an idiot like you, and I'll never be a fatso like you either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me,</span> the voice repeated.  <span class=\"clred\">Show her what it's like.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole took the coin that was still clutched in her hand, flipped it, and caught it, glaring at Betty all the while<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Now reveal her fate!</span> the voice echoed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the coin in her hand.

Additional weight appeared on other parts of her body. At the same time, Betty's clothes began to blur and change, becoming stylish but sensible maternity clothes. To Nicole's further astonishment, her <i>own</i> clothes changed, as well, until she was now dressed in maternity clothes, as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A new set of memories began to flood into Nicole's mind. <b>Both</b> she and Betty had gotten drunk and then pregnant at Chloe's beach party, each of a  result of one-night stands with guys they didn't even know. Nicole had gone into deep denial about her pregnancy, until Betty had snapped her out of it, dragging her along to buy maternity clothes and baby supplies. It was largely thanks to Betty and her mom that one room in Nicole's condo was now set up as a nursery.  They still quarreled a lot, but they were united by the shared shame dumped on them by their family and \"friends\" who derided them as the two \"loose\" girls who'd carelessly gotten pregnant.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My God\", thought Nicole, \"Did the coin do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAloud, she replied to her friend's last remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tubby'? 'Tubby' yourself, fatass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty frowned, and then smiled ruefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right, Nicki, I'm no better than you.  God, I'm going to have to <i>live</i> in the gym to shed all the weight I've gained from this kid. Anyway, is your  mom still not speaking to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\", said Nicole. \"She still hasn't forgiven me for sullying the family name - and for doing something so 'common'. She's as mad now as when I first told her. I think Daddy would like to come around, but he's too afraid of <i>her</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, they've completely cut you off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. Thank God my condo and car are completely paid for.  Plus, my Great-Uncle Horace left me a fair-sized chunk of money.  If I spend it carefully, I can live fairly comfortably off it at least until young Offspring starts grade school, but there won't be any more trips to the Caribbean for me anytime soon.  If my parents haven't come around by then, I'll probably get some kind of a part-time job to have some money coming in, to supplement my cash supply. Not that I'm qualified for much. You're lucky - your parents haven't shut <i>you</i> off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty smiled at that.  \"That's not how my Mom operates. Yeah, she's as supportive as can be, but it's all so she can have me where she can remind me how disappointed in me she is. There are times when I wish she <i>wasn't</i> speaking to me. God knows how Daddy would've reacted, if her were still alive.\"  Betty's father had passed away of cancer when she was quite young.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole replied,. \"Well, your Mom has helped <i>me</i> a lot, too. If she likes, she can disapprove of me sometimes to take the heat off of you a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty laughed at that, and Nicole joined her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty became more serious. \"To be honest, Nicki, I was kind of surprised that you didn't have this kid, well ' taken care of', you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I waited too long\", said Nicole. \"I was in total denial for months. By the time I got off my butt and went to the doctor, it was too late. I was too far along.  How about you? Did you ever think about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really\", said Betty. \"You know my family's Catholic. I don't take it very seriously, but my Mom does.  She would have made <i>your</i> Mom look mild by comparison if I'd'v'e even <i>said</i> the word 'abortion' in front of her. Anyway, Nicki, did you ever think about giving the kid up for adoption.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. It's funny - I didn't want a kid right now. I didn't plan for it, and God knows what kind of a  train wreck I'll be as a mom, but if I'm going to have this kid, I'm going to keep it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well\", said Betty. \"I gotta pee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me, too\" , said Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank God this place has two toilets\" said Betty, pulling out an ancient silver dollar that had belonged to her great-grandfather. \"Call it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heads\", said Nicole.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty flipped the coin.  \"Nertz\" she said, \"Heads, it is. OK, you can use the one on this floor, I'll drag my bloated carcass upstairs..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole used the trip to the toilet to think about what had happened.  she had flipped the coin and Betty had become pregnant. Time had been re-written and Betty didn't seem to have even. noticed, whereas she seemed to have <i>two</i> sets of memories in her head, although the new memories were somehow clearer, more \"real\". A thought struck her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute! If the coin had made <i>Betty</i> pregnant, did it somehow make <i>me</i> pregnant, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes! If she strained her mind really hard, she could pull up a <i>third</i> set of memories, now almost buried.  When she had found the coin, she hadn't been pregnant! It was only when she flipped it the first time and looked at herself in the mirror that it had happened! Just her luck that she found this crazy thing! Still, now that she had it, she had to figure out the best way to use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she came out of the bathroom, she heard Betty call her out to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm having a sandwich. You may as well come out here and get fatter with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two friends sat down to eat, they heard someone coming it the condo's front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll be Mom,\" said Betty. \"She said she might stop by.  WE'RE IN THE KITCHEN,MOM!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty's mother, Bridget O'Donnell, came into the kitchen, bearing a sack of groceries.  She'd had Betty quite young, so she was still in her early forties. She strongly resembled her daughter, and was still in good condition, and quite attractive for her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, my two fallen angels\", she said, hugging and kissing first Betty and then Nicole. \"I brought a few things for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, Mom\", you didn't need to do that\", said Betty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my pleasure, dear\", said her mother. \"Someone has to look after you girls.\"  She gave her daughter a half-humorous look.  \"Hopefully, you can do a better job bringing up <i>your</i> children than I did mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mo-om\", said Betty, rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget smiled, and then took on a serious look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was only twenty when I got pregnant with you, dear - just a kid. I really wasn't  prepared to be a mother yet, that's why I worry about you two.  I sometimes think that if only I could have a baby now, I'd finally be mature enough to take care of one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not too late, Mom, you're not so old\", said Betty. Bridget had never dated after her husband died, even when Betty had encouraged her to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, dear\" said Bridget, \"but I think I am. It's a shame, though. I think I might finally be good at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole grasped the coin in her hand, and thought about it. Should she do it? Should she give Bridget her chance to be a \"mature\" mom?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Interestingly, she seemed to be at the same stage of pregnancy as Nicole and Betty. Did the coin always do it that way, or was that just how it had happened so far?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore new memories came into Nicole's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She had already remembered how , when Betty had told her mother that she was pregnant, Betty had made her come along for moral support. Now, however, those memories changed. Now, she remembered how, when Betty nervously stammered out the truth about her condition, Bridget had not looked angry or disappointed, but instead had broken down into tears, and then confessed that <b>she</b> was pregnant, too.  When Betty and Nicole had picked their jaws up off the floor, Bridget had explained:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know, the same week that you two had your little adventure at the beach, I flew down to Martinique with the girls from my bridge club.  We had a fine time doing touristy stuff, and the girls went to bed early, but I couldn't sleep, so I went down to the hotel bar, and had a few cocktails. Well, there was this charming man there, about my same age, and we got to talking, and I had a few more cocktails, and he asked me up to his room, and I went, and, well, shenanigans occurred, you might say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mo-om!\" Betty had interjected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy's a woman, too, dear, and it had been <b>so</b> long.  It was foolish of me not to insist he use protection, though, especially in this day and age. Anyway, the girls never knew about it, and it was only long after I got home that I realized what had happened\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Betty and Bridget had become even closer, which was just as well. With both mother and daughter becoming pregnant after one-night stands, they had become the subject of much gossip and mean-spirited behavior from people who should have known better.  Bridget had become like a second mother to Nicole, as well. Bridget had insisted to trying to talk to Nicole's mother, Luciile, but that had not gone well. Lucille had all but thrown Bridget out of the house, accusing her of being a loose woman who had corrupted both of their daughters.  Since then, Betty's family had effectively become Nicole's family. Bridget had even made arrangements for the three women to live together at her house when the time came for post-natal recuperation.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole shook her herself out of her reverie.  Bridget was speaking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm going to head along, girls.  My sister, Patricia, and her daughter, Angela, are coming for a visit in two days, and I want to make sure the house is ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Bridget had taken her leave, Betty turned to Nicole and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need some fresh air. Let's go somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we could go to the mall and buy things, and we could go to the park and enjoy the wonders of nature, that sort of thing. I leave it up to you, your choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\", said Nicole, \"let's...\"</span></div></div>",

It wasn't that far away, and they both needed the exercise. It was a pleasant, sunny day, and the two mothers-to-be chatted amiably, while occasionally fielding \"when are you due?\" type questions from acquaintances or passersby.  When they got to the park, they sat down on a bench, and began to munch on the sandwiches.  Their idyll was suddenly disturbed by a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at you two, eating those fatty sandwiches.  It's bad enough you disrespected your bodies enough to let your yourselves get pregnant  by accident, but do you have to compound it by feeding your poor babies that unhealthy crap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole and Betty looked up. Sure enough, it was their \"friend\" Sylvia Bannerman, a.k.a. \"Sylvia the Fitnesss Fascist\". A short, rail-thin woman with short, black hair, Sylvia's mission in life was to harass anyone and everyone who was not as insanely dedicated to health and fitness as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Sylvia, it's <i>so</i> good to see you\", said Betty, in a voice which seemed to hint that maybe it wasn't really good to see her, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sylvia and Betty conversed/quarreled, Nicole thought to herself, \"If Sylvia had a baby of her own to worry about, maybe she wouldn't have so much time to worry about other people are up to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Nicole took the coin out of her pocket.

Irritatingly, Sylvia somehow manged to look heavily pregnant and yet thin and healthy at the same time.  All of her pregnancy weight seemed to have gone to her belly. The overall effect was as if she had swallowed a medicine ball whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew memories began to come into Nicole's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Sylvia had been present at Chloe's beach party, too, and had gotten pregnant there as well, as a result of a liaison with her then fianc\u00e9, Carl. As a result, her planned wedding to Carl had been moved up a bit,so as to avoid having a heavily-pregnant bride. Sylvia Bannerman was now Sylvia Hayes.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia had sat down next to Betty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true, I was careless, too\", she was saying, \"but at least I know who my baby's father is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty and Nicole had heard this often enough from Sylvia that they didn't even bother getting mad about it anymore. Instead, Betty was teasing Sylvia, waving a pepperoni sandwich under her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, have some, Sylvia!  I think you've proven that you like some nice, salty meat as much as we do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, Betty, that's gross!\" said Sylvia, cringing away from the proffered treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, another voice entered the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if it isn't my favorite trio of sex maniacs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole, Betty, and Sylvia all turned as one.  The speaker was a tall, brown-haired willowy woman, none other than Chloe D'Alphonse, hostess of the infamous beach party herself.  If one thing could be said to unite the three women she addressed, it was that they all loathed Chloe.  Nicole reflected on the weirdness of their social lives.  Because of various social conventions. Chloe had felt compelled to invite a certain set of people, even though she despised a goodly number of them. Her invitees, on the other hand, had felt compelled to attend, even though a goodly number of them despised Chloe and each other.  All in the name of social obligations!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty and Sylvia started double-teaming Chloe. Chloe responded by pointing out that her parents had nearly disowned her for using their beach house for such a \"decadent\" party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Nicole didn't even think about it. The minute the others were looking away form her, she took the coin out and flipped it, looking at Chloe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the coin came up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unlike Sylvia, Chloe at least had the good grace to look bloated and a but dump after her transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew memories came in to Nicole's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Despite being the hostess of the beach party, Chloe had found occasion for a little \"private time\" with her boyfriend. However, the next morning, she had had a huge, flaming row with him, followed by a fairly irrevocable break-up.  When her parents had been informed of her pregnancy, they <b>had</b> disowned her, and the ex-boyfriend had made himself scarce, refusing to take responsibility. She had been taken in by an aunt who had apparently had a similar event in her past, and who was therefore sympathetic. Chloe had recently been reconciled with her parents after a fashion, but she was still staying with her aunt. As a result of her altered history, Chloe was now somewhat less antagonistic to the others, owing to their shared predicament.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole sat quietly as Chloe, Betty and Sylvia more or less amiably discussed their philosophies of baby care.  Occasionally, she would put a word in, but she was in fact mulling over two competing ideas that were bouncing around in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was to seek out as many other girls that had been at the beach party as she could and use the coin to make them pregnant as well.  It had caused quite a stir in her little circle when four of the girls had become pregnant, what if she could manage eight, or a dozen,or more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other was that she had begun to use the coin compulsively, and was starting to worry if it was having a bad effect on her.  She remembered an anime she'd seen  once about a samurai who'd had a cursed sword.  It helped him win every battle, but with each victory it had eaten away at his soul, until finally the sword was using the samurai instead of the samurai using the sword. Was the coin beginning to use her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, she decided to go...</span></div></div>",

Frankly, I'm not at all sure that I want to see him again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I your point\", said Beryl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, girls\", said their mother, \"We have to make some hard decisions now about what we're going to do next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Nicole was distracted by the arrival of their waitress, who was asking if they were all set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good\", said Betty. how about you, Nic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm all set\", said Nicole. \"Lett us have the check, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And here is something for you</i>, she thought.

On the one hand, Betty would go ballistic when she learned what Nicole had done to <i>her</i>.  On the other hand, once she'd gotten over being angry, Betty might just <i>like</i> Nicole's plan.  Her sense of humor was just as twisted as Nicole's, and she might just enter into the plan wholeheartedly.

Perhaps pregnancy had changed their attitudes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, ladies\", said Guin. \"Boy, that sure was some party Chloe threw, wasn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that\", said Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was also a bit of a learning experience\", said Dolores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", said Tiffany, \"I really learned who my friends were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how reliable men aren't\", added Dolores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I learned what it's like to be the subject of gossip, rather than the one spreading it.

Nicole always thought that she should have sued her parents over that one, but apparently she came from an old German family that had once been something back in the days of the Holy Roman Empire, and they were quite proud of the name.  Viktoria was a genius and the only member of their social circle to take a genuine interest in developing her intellect. She was also a cold, emotionless woman. When Nicole had compared her to a Vulcan, Betty, who was something of a sci-fi nerd, had corrected her and saidthat she was more like a Cyberman. Betty and Nicole had judged that Viktoria would be unlikely to object to Nicole's \"Evil Plan\", if only because Viktoria cared so very little about what happened to her fellow humans.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViktoria had also been at Chloe's party, not because she cared for such things in and of themselves, but largely because her mother nagged her to maintain social connections, and her mother was one of the few people listened to, if only because she had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends made their way to the university library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard she's studying child psychology\", said Betty\", \"although I can't really imagine her caring for a child one way or another. Anyway, she's probably here in the psychology section.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey found Viktoria almost buried in a pile of books, studying one intently while taking copious notes. Viktoria was a petite brunette who might have been pretty, had she cared to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole looked at her, and said, \"A. Hem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViktoria looked up, a severe expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Winters. O'Donnell\", she said coldly. \"What are you two doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know\", smirked Nicole, patting her bulging belly, \"Just looking for books on child care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liar\", said Viktoria. \"You're both lazy women at the best of times, and in your conditions, coming all the way here for such a reason would be far too much effort.   You'd look up whatever information you wanted on-line, or, at most, go to your local library, or perhaps Barnes &amp; Noble. Why are you really here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, you got us\", said Nicole.  \"I'll tell you the truth, but you might find it even harder to believe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole nodded to Betty, and the duo pulled over some chairs, and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Viktoria, the truth is, we've come to consult you on a scientific matter\", said Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right\", said Viktoria, \"That is harder to believe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, you're the smartest person we know\", said Betty, \"and we've found something that we cheerfully admit is beyond us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That covers a lot of ground\", said Viktoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, <i>Freiin</i> von Frankenstein\", said Nicole, \"Was that sarcasm?  Careful, you'll be cracking jokes, next!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your  'scientific matter'\", said Viktoria, \"Get to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\", said Nicole, and told her the whole story of the coin as best she could remember it, from when she'd first found it, up to the present moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViktoria absorbed, the story in silence, and then said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting. All scientifically impossible, of course, but even two ignoramuses like you would know that. You admit your respect for my intelligence, so you couldn't possibly have expected me to believe you.  So, why come all the way here?   Too much effort for a joke that would have too little payoff.  I wonder... Of course, the only way to convince me is the way you, Winters, claim to have convinced O'Donnell.  Let me see this coin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole handed the coin to Viktoria, who studied it, carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\", said Viktoria , \"It seems to be made of gold, but I'd need to test it, to be sure. Well, have either of you a mirror?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty provided a hand mirror from her purse. Viktoria held it up in front of her face with one hand, and held the coin in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to test it on yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\", said Viktoria. \"On the infinitesimal chance that your story is true. I have been developing my own theory of child-rearing. I cannot reasonably expect anyone to give me their child to test my theory on, but if I had a child of my own, I could do as I thought best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd use your own kid as a test subject?\", asked Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe it would be for their own good\", said Viktoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis chilled even the relatively amoral Nicole, to the point where she considered trying to grab the coin back.

Her belly expanded, and her breasts and other parts of her body became larger. She was now eight months pregnant. Her clothing had morphed to suit her new bodily dimensions. Divergent memories entered her mind.  Part of her remembered that eight months ago she had tried and failed to bribe a cousin who worked for a sperm bank into providing her with the \"material\" she needed to artificially inseminate herself, but another part of her remembered succeeding in doing just that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she'd sat speechless for several minutes, Nicole nudged her, and said, \"Hey, Frankenstein, are you OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am experiencing an emotional reaction\", explained Viktoria.  \"'Shock', I think. \"It's all true. Good God, it's all true! I'm-I'm pregnant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course you are\", said Betty. \"You were pregnant when we got here.  To be honest, I was surprised.

To her left, she saw a tall redhead, maybe around nineteen or twenty years old, sitting at a computer terminal. She had headphones on, and appeared to be listening to an on-line lecture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViktoria flipped the coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard:  <span class=\"clred\">REALITY CHANGE!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead's belly expanded and her clothing altered. She was now three months pregnant by the looks of her, and didn't seem to have noticed a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViktoria looked to her right.  At another table, a woman in her mid-thirties or thereabouts, of Korean or perhaps Chinese descent, was reading a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViktoria flipped the coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain: <span class=\"clred\">REALITY CHANGE!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Viktoria saw no change at all, but when the woman shifted in her seat, she revealed only the faintest hint of a baby bump. She was probably no more than one month along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Interesting</i>, she thought.  <i>I wonder what determines how far along each woman is?  Perhaps it somehow reviews each woman's life and chooses the moment at which she was most likely to get pregnant?  Foolish to theorize without more data.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, she heard a familiar voice.  She looked up to see a heavyset woman in her late 40's, chatting with a teenage girl who strongly resembled her.  They were several rows away, and at such an angle that they could not see Nicole, Betty and Viktoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's that?\", asked Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hilda Waterhouse, my physics Professor\", explained Viktoria.  \"That's her daughter, Sheila,with her. Oh, I've got to do her!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViktoria looked at Hilda and flipped the coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">REALITY CHANGE!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHilda grew and grew, becoming downright huge,surely no more than two weeks away from giving birth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that broad  looks ready to pop\", said Nicole<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should do the daughter, too\", said Viktoria.  She looked at Sheila, and flipped the coin, but this time there were no words, no change, nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh\", said Viktoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\", asked Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried to use the coin on young Sheila, there, and nothing happened\", said Viktoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole looked nonplussed, and asked, \"Did you break it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know\", said Viktoria.  \"Let me try it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Sheila, and flipped the coin, again with no result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe there's something about her\", said Viktoria.  \"Let me try someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around and spotted Angela Perez, a dark-haired girl who was one of her classmates.  Not exactly a friend, but someone whose conversation was tolerable.  She flipped the coin, <span class=\"clred\">REALITY CHANGE!</span>, and Angela was now six months pregnant.

This represents a science beyond current human understanding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Science\", said Nicole. \"You don't think it could be magic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe in magic\", said Viktoria.  \"Are you familiar with Clarke's Third Law?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty surprised them both by quoting, \"'Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct\", said Viktoria, approvingly.  \"I'll need to research this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took out her smartphone, and took a picture of both sides of the coin, before handing it back to Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The 'Evil Plan' you described. What was the point of it, again?\", asked Viktoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just my own amusement\", replied Nicole. \"And a certain curiosity to see how my 'social circle' reacts when I've changed Chloe's little get-together from a run-of-the-mill 'beach bash' to a 'decadent orgy' at which female attendee got knocked up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a strange sense of humor\", said Viktoria.  \"It's quite similar to my own. I'd almost like to see that, myself.  You're going to try to do all 53 women that were there, without exception?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know that number so exactly?\", asked Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an excellent memory, and I've trained to make it as reliable as possible. Let's exchange contact info.  I'll send you a complete list as soon as I can.  In return, please text me if anything unusual happens with the coin, or if you learn anything new about it yourselves.  I'll let you know the results of my research  in a few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, thanks\", said Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they'd exchanged info with Viktoria, the two friends returned to Nicole's car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where to next?\", said Betty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole said:</span></div></div>",

Nicole did her best to feign surprise.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cReally\u201d, said Abigail.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWow\u201d, said Nicole, still trying to seem surprised. \u201cTo be honest I\u2019m kind of  - well, that is\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOut with it\u201d, said Abigail.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWell\u201d, said Nicole, \u201cI didn\u2019t think you and Daddy\u2026 well, sorry, but, I didn\u2019t think you two were still, you know, \u2018interested\u2019 in each other that way.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t\u201d said Abigail. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t touched me...that way\u2026 in over ten years. And frankly, I haven\u2019t missed it all that much.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cBut, then\u201d, said Nicole, \u201cIt can\u2019t be\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHis? No\u201d, said Abigail. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cDamn\u201d, said Nicole. \u201cDoes he know?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYes\u201d, said Abigail. \u201cI told him.  Even a man as unobservant as he is would have noticed soon.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d, asked Nicole.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to divorce, quietly\u201d, said Abigail. \u201cHe\u2019s been sleeping with his secretary Jane for years. I\u2019ve had proof for a long time, I could have cleaned him out if I\u2019d wanted to, but as long as he was discreet and didn\u2019t embarrass me, I didn\u2019t care. And of course, it also meant that he couldn\u2019t say much if I \u2018amused\u2019 myself occasionally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut this\u201d, she patted her belly, \u201cevens the playing field a bit. Anyway, we\u2019re going to be civilized about it, and split everything amicably. What you need to know is that we\u2019re going to be selling the house.  He\u2019s going to be moving into the penthouse he\u2019s kept downtown for \u2018late night business meetings\u2019, and I\u2019m going to be moving into the lake house. We\u2019ll be boxing up the stuff you left there. Try and let me know within the next month where you want it shipped to, whether here or storage or wherever.   Oh, and if there\u2019s any of the furniture there you always wanted, put your claim in, we\u2019re probably going to be getting rid of most of it.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOK, Mom, I will\u201d, said Nicole. \u201cSay, I gotta ask: Who\u2019s the father?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail smirked, and said, \"Let's put it this way: You didn't really think I liked tennis all that much, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ISTVAN?\", said Nicole. This time her surprise was unfeigned. Istvan was the pro at her mother's tennis club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was an attractive, muscular, blonde-haired man in his early thirties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Mom, that's a pretty good score for an old woman like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not <i>that</i> old\", sniffed Abigail in mock indignation. \"And there are certain advantages to being 'experienced'.  We mature women know some tricks that you young trollops haven't learned yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Trollops\"?</i>, thought Nicole. Aloud, she said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you told him about the baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\", said Abigail, and this time her indignation was real. \"The little rat made himself scarce. No one's seen him for a week.\" She sighed. \"Maybe it's just as well. He was fun to play with, but I wouldn't have wanted to marry him, or anything.  Listen to this:  He said that what first attracted him to me was that I looked like his mother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew, really?\", said Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe it or not\", said Abigail, \"there are lots of Oedipus wannabes out there. He used to make me spank him for being a bad boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, mother, we are now ending this portion of the conversation,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbigail laughed.  At that. She and Nicole chatted for a while before she finally decided she had to head home.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, Nicole was distracted from this by the fact that the coin began to glow brightly, dazzling her. When her eyes recovered, she turned on a lamp, and saw to her surprise that the coin had grown in size!  Before it had been about the size of a Kennedy half-dollar, but now it was the size of the old silver dollar that her grandfather carried as a good luck piece.  What could have caused this?  She thought about it for a while, until it occurred to her that it might be the number of time she'd used it, or the number of people she'd used it on. she did some quick math - if she only counted the two women she'd given quintuplets as one each, then Beverly was the fiftieth person she'd used the coin on.

She drove herself over to the house and let herself in. She wasn't the sentimental sort, but she found herself tearing up a bit as she walked around the place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she'd been there about fifteen minutes, she heard someone else letting themselves into the house. Returning to the foyer, she saw that it was her father and his secretary, Jane, a shapely young blonde not much older than Nicole herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So, he's been messing around on Mom with<b> her</b>?</i>, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAloud, she said, \"Hi, Daddy!

Was there any other of the stuff here that you especially wanted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was discussing the keepsakes that she wanted, Nicole decided to have a little \"fun\" with Jane. Walking around the room, she positioned herself so she could see Jane but Jane and her father wouldn't be able to see her hands.

If he got turned into a pregnant woman, would her parents become a lesbian couple? what would happen to <b>her</b> - would she become the product of artsem? What if she ceased to exist?  Still, part of her really wanted to do it, just to see what wowuld happen.</span></div></div>",

He was a tall, thin, dark-haired, skeevy-looking man with a<br>\r\npencil-thin mustache, and was wearing a lime-green leisure suit thathe must have found in his grandfather's closet, probably after the old man had died from shame from having such a loathsome grandson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViktoria flipped the coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammlt!\", she said, as their waitress got in the way at the critical moment., and earned herself a <span class=\"clred\">REALITY CHANGE!</span> that left her five months pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViktoria looked at Larry again just as he noticed her and grinned hisunspeakable grin. She flipped the coin again. One REALITY CHANGE!, and Larry was now a tall skanky-looking woman, rail-thin except for the obvious bulge of her pregnancy. She was wearing a lime-green cocktail dress that was painfully <b>not</b> designed as maternity wear. Vik's revulsion<br>\r\nat this sight was offset by new memories of a life in which she'd never known Larry. She smiled, and then handed the coin back to Nicole. Then she had to explain why she'd had it in the first place, since her two friends no longer remembered Larry. After that, the trio enjoyed a nice leisurely lunch.</span></div></div>",

They thus found themselves the center of more attention than they would have liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Nicole couldn't complain too much. Among the guests were included many of the girls that had been at Chloe's party that Nicole hadn't had a chance to use the coin on yet. Nicole, Betty and Viktoria kept busy, and between them, gave twenty-three girls a <span class=\"cmaroon\">REALITY CHANGE!</span>, leaving them all eight months pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the record, Janet Van Arsdale, Margaret O'Houlihan, Jessica Philpott, her sister Jessamine, Lorraine Braganza, Joyce Hubbard, Elvira Goldman, Moira Pak, Deborah Dinsdale, Odosiaku Nsukka, Indira Patel, Josephine Brown #1, Josephine Brown #2 (two unrelated girls of the same name), Midori Hayes, Rachel Hamilton, Loretta Jackson, Clarissa Davies, Maryam<br>\r\nAl-Qadry, Zinnia Wilcox, Theresa Lee, Mary-Anne Grant, Ginger Summers and Lucille Queen all joined the guests of honor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just five to go</i>, thought Nicole.  New memories came into her mind: Chloe's party now had been an undisguised orgy, with couples not even bothering to find private places to, well, \"couple\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust for fun, Nicole also handed out pregnancies to Tiffany's mother, two of her aunts, one of her younger sisters, and two of her older sisters.  Nicole tried the coin on Tiffany's grandmother, but nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There must be an upper age limit\", mused Viktoria. \"I wonder what it is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring a lull in conversation, Viktoria moaned wordlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, Vik?\", asked Betty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my mother\", Viktoria replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElspeth Von Frankenstein approached the table where her daughter sat with her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Viktoria\", she said, \"I trust you are keeping well, for your baby's sake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mother\", said Viktoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElspeth scanned Nicole and Betty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who are you, and  how did you get stuck with my spawn, here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother, these are my friends, Nicole Winters and Elizabeth O'Donnell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Your friends'?\", said Elspeth. \"You have friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's quite true, ma'am\", said Betty. \"We both love Vik very much. She's sweet and generous, and a lot of fun to be with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her mother's back, Viktoria beamed at Betty.  Nicole surreptitiously handed VIk the coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you quite well, dear?\", said Elspeth, putting a hand to Betty's forehead. \"A woman in your condition must take good care of herself, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViktoria didn't hesitate. She flipped the coin. One <span class=\"clred\">REALITY CHANGE!</span>, and Elspeth's belly developed the slight bump of a woman who was about a month-and-a-half pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElspeth continued: \"I suppose my other ungrateful offspring is hiding somewhere.\" She patted her stomach. \"Perhaps this child will appreciate what I do for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're pregnant, Mother?\", said Viktoria. \"Got Father drunk again, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElspeth glared at Viktoria and stalked off without a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\", said Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViktoria smiled at her friends.

Once her research was done, she ate a light supper and went to bed early.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, she got up early, ate breakfast, showered, dressed and hit the road.  She drove from her hometown of<br>\r\nEast Cowsills to the state capital, an hour's drive.  As she had determined the night before, the state legislature was in session. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had printed out the ages of all the legislators. She sat in the public viewing gallery, and, using the information she had gathered, tested the coin on the law-makers,seeing which ones it worked on. In a short while, she had determined that<br>\r\nthe coin's upper age limit was 58. It would not work on anyone 59 or older. In the process, she had turned 16 members of the state's legislature into pregnant women. She could have done more, but she was pretty sure that she'd used the coin on 99 people, and she wanted to save the hundredth for when she was with Betty and Vikki. Instead, she texted the results of her experiment to Viktoria, and enjoyed the new memories as they came into her head, and mused on the new political<br>\r\nreality she'd created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I've got to work out a way to visit Congress</i>, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed a quick lunch, and then drove back to East Cowsills. For the first time in her life, she listened to political talk radio on her way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce home, she grabbed a quick nap, and then went to pick up Betty, explaining to her friend how she'd spent het morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey met up with Viktoria at the library, in the same spot where they'd met her before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they'd exchanged greetings, Nicole said, \"Say, there's that Professor Waterhouse and her daughter, I wanna try the coin on the daughter again, now that she's one day over eighteen. Oh, and if it works, she'll be the hundredth person we've made pregnant with this thing, so let me know if you see anything odd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the younger Waterhouse, and flipped the coin.  She heard the <span class=\"clred\">REALITY CHANGE!</span>, and there was a bright flash of light. When her eyes cleared, she saw that the coin had again doubled in size. She looked at Betty and Vikki and saw them blinking in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you two see that?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\", said Viktoria, \"and what's more, I heard the voice this time, even though I wasn't the one who flipped it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me, too\", said Betty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at the Professor's daughter\", said Viktoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She doesn't look any different\", said Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder\", said Viktoria, \"if the lower age is retroactive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\", said Nicole. \"Ohh, you mean because she only turned 18 yesterday, she can't be more than a day pregnant, so no retroactive underage hanky-panky?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Essentially\", said Viktoria. \"I imagine that she now remembers 'celebrating' her coming-of-age with some guy during the last 24<br>\r\nhours.

She was accompanied by a bored-looking man in a chauffeur's uniform, and a tired-looking woman in a maid's uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Boadie\", she said. \"Waiting to pick up Glory? She's coming back from France today, isn't she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,hi, Nic\", said Boadie. \"That's right. What brings you to the airport, today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I was just bored\", said Nicole. \"So I decided to come in and look at the airport.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,Nicole\", said Boadie, \"You put the 'idle' in 'idle rich'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too true\", replied Nicole. \"You must admit, it's nice not having to do anything you don't want to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she chatted with Boadie, Nicole grasped the coin in her pocket, and gave Boadie a <span class=\"clred\">REALITY CHANGE!</span>, watching with quiet amusement as Boadie's belly expanded until she was three months pregnant. The maternity clothing she was now wearing was the most elegant Nic had ever seen. Another <span class=\"clred\">REALITY CHANGE!</span>, and the chauffeur was now a <i>chauffeuse</i> with only the slightest of baby bumps.  One more, and the maid was now seven months pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole and Boadie chatted until her sister's plane  began unloading its passengers.  If Boadie looked like a princess, her older sister, Gloriana Roxanne Worthington-Bailey looked like  a queen. Nicole gave her a <span class=\"clred\">REALITY CHANGE!</span> the moment she saw her.  Glory's baby bump indicated a two-month pregnancy.  Nicole gave a <span class=\"clred\">REALITY CHANGE!</span> to Glory's personal maid, another to Glory's friend (Beryllium or something, Nicole couldn't remember), and <i>{her/i} personal maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole chatted with the sisters briefly, and then left them to their reunion.She wandered around the airport for a while, using the coin on another nineteen people - some travelers and some airport employees - before deciding to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Shall I go home and rest up for whatever Betty's surprise is tonight, or shall I go do something else?</i>, thought Nicole</i></span></div></div>",

Around four, she got up and started getting ready. Betty and Viktoria came to her apartment. They had brought dinner with them. After they ate, they got ready to leave for the \"surprise\". Betty insisted on driving, and Viktoria insisted on blindfolding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a ten minute ride, Viktoria whipped off the blindfold, and said, \"It's a little early, but 'Happy Birthday!'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole gasped when she saw they were at the Opera House.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my God, you got tickets for <i>this</i> show!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe show in question was a one-night appearance by the Atherton Women's String Quintet,Nicole's favorite musical group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow, thank you so much!\", said Nicole, hugging her friend.Betty smiled. She had actually gotten tickets for herself and Nicole months ago. When they had become friends with Viktoria, she had used a desperate combination of bribery and coercion to score a ticket for  her, as well. She knew Vik wouldn't have complained at being left out, but she had wanted to include their new friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say\", said Nicole, \"What does this have to do with Astrid and Raylene?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\", said Betty. \"I happened to know that they were coming to the show tonight. In fact, there they are now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed to the two approaching young women. In her mind, Betty had often compared Astrid Lang and Raylene Ayanami to the anime characters Asuka Soryu Langley and Rei Ayanami,  and not just because of the similarities in their names,  Astrid was tall, with fiery red hair. Fortunately, she did not have Asuka's fiery temper.  Raylene looked l just like Rei, even down to dyeing her hair light blue. However, her heavy Texas accent kind of spoiled the illusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaylene spotted them first, and said, \"Howdy gals, how you doin'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole shared a smile with Betty and Viktoria, and Astrid and Raylene soon received a <span class=\"clred\">REALITY CHANGE!</span> each.  Soon both women were eight months pregnant.  Nicole had completed her plan at last! Thanks to her, every girl who had been at Chloe's party was pregnant. New memories came into her head. the party had been an unabashed orgy, with people going at it shamelessly without the least concern as to who was watching.  The neighbors had called the police, and only the fact that between them the girls' families pretty owned the city had kept the story out of the news media.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five women chatted for a while, and then went in to the show.  Nicole enjoyed the show immensely, but couldn't resist using the coin on the five musicians.  At the end of the concert, the group's leader said, \"This will be our last live show for a while. As you can see, we've been 'busy' off-stage.  But don't worry, we'll be back as soon as we can after our babies are born.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the concert, there was a brief get-together where some of the attendees  - Nicole, Betty and Viktoria among them - got to meet-and-greet with the musicians. Nicole was overjoyed to actually get to speak with her idols. That didn't stop her from using the coin on the group's agent and two of their \"roadies\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stopping there?\", asked Betty, when she saw Nicole put the coin away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", said Nicole. \"We're at 249. I'll wait to do  number 250 when we're alone and can focus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the get-together, Betty and Viktoria went back to Nicole's condo with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you ready for 250?\", asked Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two assented.  Nicole handed the coin to Viktoria. \"Here, you do one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViktoria accepted the coin, and walked over to the window and looked out. Her eyes lit on a young couple who were kissing passionately in a doorway across the street. Viktoria focused on the man, and gave him a <span class=\"clred\">REALITY CHANGE!</span> and then there were two girls kissing, one of them very pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned, and the three of them looked at the coin. It was now the size of a dinner plate.  The woman on the \"Heads\" side spoke, and this time, the trio heard her voice. She said:</span></div></div>",

A fourth beach chair had appeared, as if from nowhere, and Coinie sat down in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where to begin?\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the beginning?\", said Betty..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The beginning was a long time ago\" replied Coinie. \"Longer than time, really, as you understand time.  You see, I'm a member of  a race that originated in the universe before yours, before what you call the Big Bang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Before</i> the Big Bang?\", asked Viktoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\", said Coinie.  Universes come and go, rise and fall, are born and die. Our universe lived before yours, and there was a universe before ours. Possibly any number before ours. Someday your universe will end, and another will succeed it,and another after it. Anyway, my species evolved in the universe before yours. We were genetically identical to you humans - or rather, you're genetically identical to us. I'll get to that in a moment.  At any rate, our race evolved over millions of years, becoming incredibly powerful, with vast psychic powers, powers that might seem god-like to less-developed beings. Time passed, and we came to understand  that our universe was drawing towards its end.  Many of our race were resigned to this, believing that things had a natural beginning and a natural end, and that our end time had come. But a few of us decided we wanted to live on, so we developed a way to project ourselves outside of space-time. We survived the end of our universe and the beginning of yours.  We emerged into the new universe and began to explore. In time, we found the world that would become your Earth. At the time, it was lifeless and primitive.  Our leader proposed that we jump start the beginning of life on your world, plant the seeds of life as it had been on our old world, so that in time, a race like ours - a race that would be genetically identical to what we had once been, would arise.  However, one of us objected to this plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You?\", asked Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me\", replied Coinie.  \"I said it was pointless merely to recreate the same race all over again. I wanted us to try something new!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what, Coinie?\", asked Betty. \"Say, do you mind us calling you 'Coinie'? Do you have a real name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Coinie' is fine\", the elder being replied . \"I don't really have a name as you understand it. My people know each other by our brain patterns. Anyway, I told our leader that it was foolish to create a race that reproduced sexually. Just as you have, in our primitive days, we had endless trouble over sex. Men fighting over women, women fighting over men, men oppressing women, people oppressing people they thought of a 'sexual deviants'. How much better it would be to have a world where people reproduced asexually!  The leader condescended to put my idea to a vote, but they all voted against me.  I was so angry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\", asked Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I attempted to sabotage their plan\", said Coinie.  \"I got caught. They condensed my entire being down into what looked to you like a coin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my God!\", said Betty. \"Did it hurt? What did it feel like?\"<br>\r\n\"No\", said Coinie. \"I didn't feel a thing. My mind was entirely shut down. Their idea of mercy.  I was placed in a special container, and left at the scene of my 'crime'.  I would remain sealed away and 'shut down' until their experiment - the human race - came to fruition. I would be freed, and shown how well the experiment I had opposed had succeeded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you weren't supposed to be freed yet?\", asked Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\", said Coinie. \"Seismic shifts over the millennia damaged the container I was stored in. Even our technology isn't perfect.  Eventually, I must have been knocked loose, and kicked around util you found,me, Nicole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember having an urge to pick you up and flip you\", said Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure that was my mind reaching out to you on an unconscious level\", said Coinie. \"And the transformations and the pregnancies were me carrying out my deepest desire, to make this world what I want it to be. I'm afraid I manipulated you three on a subconscious level, making you want to use me more and more.  Sorry about that, it wasn't deliberate. But each time you did, I grew a little stronger, and woke up more and more.  It was only when I was freed that I really understood what had happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will your people realize what happened?\", asked Betty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a good chance, yes\", said Coinie. \"I've no idea where they are. They're not in this galaxy, I'd know it if they were., but I've no way of telling how far away they might be, so it's best I get on with my plans. Fortunately, it won't take long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it matter?\", asked Nicole. \"Won't they just undo whatever you do anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\", said Coinie. \"You might, but they wouldn't.  Disrupting an experiment is a big crime with us, remember?  If they catch me, they'll punish me for disrupting <i>their</i> experiment, but they won't disrupt <i>my</i> experiment. To them, that would make <b>them</b> as 'bad' as they think <b>I</b> am.  So, all I have to do is present them with a <i>fait accompli</i>, and no matter happens to me, Earth will be the Paradiise I always knew it could be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They won't kill you, will they?\", asked Betty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, probably just lock me up again, someplace more secure this time. Anyway, while they might not be here for a thousand years, they might be here in an hour, so I'd better get my but tin gear, as you folks like to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Coinie, what are you going to do?\", asked Viktoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch and see\", said Coinie.

Everyone under 18 will become pregnant the day they turn 18.  Everyone that lives will know the joy of being a mother without any need for sex, or any of its associated hang-ups.  Don't worry, I've cured all their physical or mental disabilities, and eliminated all hereditary diseases and conditions. Everyone's baby will be born healthy in mind and body. There will never again be what you called 'birth defects'.  And of course, their babies will all be daughters. I've introduced special 'regulators' into humanity's DNA.  Everyone will have at least one daughter, but women will have additional children as needed to keep the population at needed levels. Be happy! Never again will you suffer the disruptions caused by gender. Also, I've re-written everyone's memories - except for you three - no one now remembers that there ever was such a thing as men. For them, an asexual world is how it's always been\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know\", said Nicole, \"Some of us <i>liked</i> men. Some of us <i>liked</i> sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", said Betty, \"You've taken all the romance out of the world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, dears, it'll be hard for you three\", said Coinie.  \"But you'll see. It'll be a much better world. There'll still be love and romance of different kindsin the world, just a lot less of the madness that sex and lust  brought. Anyway, I better get a move on, I can sense that my 'friends' are on their way.

Only the three of them remembered otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three friends went back to their lives in the new world.  There was, as Coinie had hoped, a lot less conflict in the world, although it was not quite the Paradise she had hoped for.  In many ways, it was similar to the old world. One afternoon, when the three were together, Nicole asked Viktoria:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think Coinie really re-wrote all of human history?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so\", said Viktoria. I suspect she merely re-wrote people's memories and made the necessary physical alterations. For such a major change, the 'new' world seems too similar to the 'old' one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the time came for the three friends to give birth.  One of the characteristics of the new world was that maternity wards were much larger and better funded. Of course, being rich, the three friends went to a special private facility. They encountered many of the other girls from Chloe's party who were there at the same time.  Nicole named her daughter \"Samantha\", Betty named her daughter \"Patricia\", and Viktoria named her daughter  \"Bernadette\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a month after they gave birth, they noticed the first effects of Coinie's \"gift\".  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Moreover, the beginnings of a whole new school of physics began to develop in her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty, being a huge fan of manga and anime, had been studying Japanese on and off for several years. She'd never found it easy, and had never made much progress. Now she found herself soaring through Japanese lessons, and had memorized thousands of characters in a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole, who had never been \"mechanical\", found herself developing an instinctive understanding of how machinery worked.  Buying a set of tools, she took apart every device in her home, putting them back together, only with improvements that made them operate more efficiently.  She soon found herself inventing things that had never existed before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne afternoon, Nicole and Betty (with Samantha and Patricia) went to visit Viktoria (and Bernadette).  They chatted about various things for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole picked up Vikki's toaster and began re-inventing it. She said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess Coinie's 'gift' is starting to kick in\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\", said Viktoria. \"I'm starting to think that I won't bother going back to the university. I've learned pretty much everything I could learn there in the last month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've gotten fluent in Japanese\", said Betty. \"And I've started learning Korean and Chinese.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole set down Viktoria's toaster. It said: \"Mistress, would you or your guests like some toast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you just bring my toaster to life?\", asked Viktoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a certain definition of 'life'\", said Nicole.  \"Good, isn't it? Goddess, this is nuts! What are we going to become?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just glad I have you two in this with me\", said Betty.  \"Imagine going through this alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three friends soon noticed physical changes, as well.  Without even exercising, they quickly lost the weight they'd gained during pregnancy, and instead, soon became quite buff.  They didn't bulk up, but were soon quite fit, fitter than they'd ever been in their lives.  They found themselves able to lift quite heavy objects ,and run marathon distances at sprinting speeds and were now possessed of incredible stamina and endurance, able to easily get by on an hour of sleep a night - traits that were very handy for them as new mothers. However, after a few months, the changes tapered off, leaving them as super-geniuses with Olympic-level athletic skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\", said Nicole, \"Red Suit did say that the complete transformation would take a thousand years. Maybe it's going to be in stages, with a pause between changes so we can acclimate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViktoria allowed as that seemed like a logical idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey pooled their resources and bought a house together, one with a lab for Viktoria, a workshop for Nicole, and an extensive library, where Betty spent a great deal of time. Over the next few years, while they were caring for their daughters,  Betty became fluent in over a hundred languages, and began turning out literary masterpieces in most of them.   Nicole turned out dozens of world-changing inventions, and Viktoria  perfected gravity control which allowed easy colonization of the Solar System.  They were soon world-famous and even richer than they had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time their daughters reached adulthood, Betty had mastered every human language, Nicole had advanced the general level of human technology by about two hundred years, and Viktoria had designed and built starships, and was working on designing a teleporta tion system.  She and Nicole had agreed to work together to develop time travel once the teleporter was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen their daughters turned eighteen, they became pregnant, and so Nicole, Betty and Viktoria took time out to play doting grandmothers, although because they hadn't aged, they were very young-looking grandmas. Once their grand-daughters reached adulthood and had children of their own, the three friends withdrew form the world. They had invented a time machine, and had gone back before Coinie's arrival, only to discover that she <i>had</i> re-written all of human history after all!  The thought that they would have that level of power someday boggled their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few decades, they began to evolve some more. They found they were able to read each other's minds, after first just superficially, but then on very profound levels, so that soon they no longer had to speak to one another.  They also began developing telekinetic abilities, being able to move larger and larger objects just be thinking it. Their minds began to expand beyond human limitations as they began to have intimations regarding the underlying nature of reality that humans could never have understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs more time went by, they were able to read the minds of the women around them, and even to compel them to obey them if they wished. They didn't do much of this, not just out of their basic decency, but because they didn't really need anything done for them.  They no longer needed to eat or sleep, nor did heat or cold affect them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the centuries passed, and they continued to evolve, they continued to keep an eye on human progress, but they seldom interacted with individual humans. Before they knew it, a thousand years has passed, and they reached the height of their evolution. They now possessed goddess-like powers. When they chose to manifest physically, they had the same quality they'd noticed in Coinie - the humans that saw them said they looked like everyone' mothers at the same time.  They could re-shape reality on a global scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had debated what they would do for a long time. When the time came, they decided to...  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Later, she and Betty walked back to Betty's place. After another quick snack, she drove home. Once she was there,  she spent some time on-line trying to find information about the coin. Coming up dry, she thought about who to call for help.  The only person she knew that knew anything much about magic or the supernatural was Alice Wang, a girl she'd known in high school.  Alice was obsessed with studying anything to do with the supernatural or the paranormal.  She was also a thoroughgoing skeptic, and had already helped to debunk a number of fraudulent claims.  She would be the ideal person to ask.  The only problem was that Alice had good reason to dislike Nicole and her friends - they had often mocked her when they were in school together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole decided to try. She knew that Alice worked at the local campus library, so she called there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Campus Library Information Desk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, may I speak to Alice Wang, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One moment, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHold music played for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, this is Alice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice, this is Nicole Winters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole?\" said Alice, the surprise in her voice quite evident. \"To what do I owe the privilege?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm awful sorry to bother you, but could I see you this evening?  I know you have good reason not to like me much, but I'm at my wit's end.  I've found something  - unusual - and you're the only person I know that might be able to identify it.

Alice was a short, Chinese-American girl with log, black hair. Her parents had both died in a car accident when she was 15.  She'd lived the next few years with an aunt that she wasn't close to, and had moved out the minute she turned 18.  she was now putting herself through college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she saw Alice come out of the library, Nicole waved her over to her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Alice! Thanks very much for agreeing to see me!  Can we grab something to eat, and then go someplace private to talk? Offspring here demands to be fed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK\", said Alice, getting into the car. \"We can go to my apartment. there's a sandwich shop on the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two bought some sandwiches and then went back to Alice's small, somewhat dingy apartment.  Alice watched in astonishment as Nicole scarfed her meal.  Then she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Nicole, what's this all about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole sighed, and said, \"Let me tell you up front that this is going to sound crazy.  Hell, it sounds crazy to me, and I lived it.\" She then told Alice the whole story,from finding the coin down to the present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter listening to the story, Alice sighed and said, \"You were right. It does sound crazy.  Look, Nicole, I'm sorry, I really am, but there's no such thing as magic coins. I'm not saying this to be mean, or to get back at you for the way you girls treated me in school, it's just the truth. You're going through a very tough time right now. I can't imagine what it's like for you, I really can't But I know that pregnancy is a very stressful thing at the best of times.  Listen, my mother told me how she had vivid nightmares when she was carrying me. Giant rabbits were trying to kill her. She even started seeing them when she was awake. My father ended up sending her to a shrink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you think I'm delusional?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"i'm sorry, but, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not! Really, I wish I was. It would make life so much simpler...Can I ask you one thing? Will you at least look at the coin, and see if it looks like anything you've seen before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole took out the coin and handed it to Alice.  Alice took it and looked at it closely. It didn't look like anything she'd ever seen before. there was something creepy about it somehow. No wonder it had freaked Nicole out!  She felt a sudden urge to flip it. She shook her head and spoke to Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never seen anything like it. It doesn't really look that old, you know. It's probably something someone ran up as a gag, or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought struck her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Nicole, I'm gonna prove to you that there's nothing magical about this coin. I'm going to flip it while looking at myself in that mirror over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\", said Nicole \"You'll end up getting pregnant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I won't, Nicole. You'll see, nothing's going to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Nicole could say anything further, Alice walked over to the mirror, and flipped the coin.

She noticed a little spotting when she took off her panties, but didn't think much of it.  While \"that time of the month\" wasn't due for a couple of weeks, she occasionally got a little spotting in between periods, as women sometimes did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did some schoolwork, and then sat down to watch some TV. Without even thinking about it, she'd pulled a gallon of ice cream out of the freezer and started methodically devouring it.   She flipped channels and stopped on what appeared to be a movie about a lost kitten.  Before she knew it, she was engrossed in the kitten's adventures, becoming more and more emotionally involved. The film ended with the kitten having a joyful reunion with its mother. Alice found herself weeping buckets.  When she got a hold of herself, she looked down and noticed to her shock that the ice cream container was empty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, my God</i>, she thought, <i>I've become the cliched \"single woman sitting at home alone crying into her ice cream\"!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrying her eyes, she cleaned up her room, and went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Alice awoke feeling bloated and yet quite hungry.  She ate a big breakfast, and then hopped in the shower.  Afterwards, she looked at herself in the mirror. She couldn't decide whether she was getting a little pudgy or not. She'd have to watch that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she arrived at school, she found herself feeling a little irritable. When one of her classmates bumped into her, she snapped at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look out, you jerk, why don''t you watch where you're going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy there, kiddo!\" came a voice from behind her.  It was Emiko Matsumoto, her closest - well, only close, really - friend.   Emiko was a tall, sharp-looking <i>meganekko</i> with very dark red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Emi!\" said Alice. \"Sorry, I seem to be in a bit of a mood, today. We still  on for this weekend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, I'll be there around 7:00.\"  Emiko had agreed to spend the weekend at Alice's place so they could work on a presentation for their Medieval History class.  It wasn't due for a while yet, but neither of them liked to wait until the last minute.  Plus, they'd have fun hanging out, and it would get Emi out of the dorms for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice made it through her classes that morning without further incident, and then headed to lunch. Despite her earlier good intentions she ate a very big lunch.  That afternoon, she went to her shift at the library, and managed to keep her moodiness largely in check, having threatened to murder only one colleague, and only breaking into tears once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her way home, she picked up a bunch of snacks, some junk food and some healthy stuff. She didn't get any booze - neither she nor Emi were big drinkers.   She thought about Nicole. she hoped the girl was OK. Despite their former enmity, she found herself concerned for her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got home, she put her purchases away and started tidying up. It was just about 6:00 p.m. Emiko would be there in about an hour.  And so Day One ended for Alice. Day Two was about to begin. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shortly before 7:00, Alice suddenly felt ill. Racing to the toilet, she made it just in time before vomiting copiously.  When she had finished, she rinsed out her mouth with some mouthwash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, she heard the doorbell ring. She ran to answer it. It was Emiko, as expected. She let her friend in. She decided not to tell her friend that she'd been ill. She was afraid she might not want to stay, and for some reason, she really didn't want to be alone this weekend. Emiko, however, seemed to have noticed something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you OK, Alice? You look a little flushed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, I'm OK, I've just been zipping around all day, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK. Anyway, are you hungry? I'm really famished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice, realized that even though she had thrown up only minutes before, she was now really quite hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I'm starving! I don't feel like cooking, though. Is it alright if we order out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, what do you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about Chinese?\" asked Alice.  \"I could murder some pork fried rice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I thought you hated Chinese food!\" It had long been a running joke between the two that even though Alice was of Chinese ancestry, she didn't like Chinese food all that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't usually, but for some reason, tonight I've got a huge craving for pork fried rice. My mother used to make it pretty good, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A 'craving'?\" said Emiko, jokingly. \"You're not pregnant, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO, I am NOT pregnant!\" said Alice, with more vehemence than she had intended. Noticing the surprise on her friend's face, she tried to turn it into a joke. \"How could you think such a thing about me?\", she said, in what she hoped was a humorous voice.  At any rate,Emiko seemed to buy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK\", said Emiko, \"Chinese it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice phoned in a delivery order to the China Garden, and then said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While we're waiting for them, I'm going to change out of my work clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me, too.\" said Emiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice went into her room to change. It was only when she took off her work pants that she realized how tight they had become.  She thought about weighing herself, but was a little afraid to discover how much weight she'd put on.  When she took off her bra, she noticed that her breasts were sore. Had her breasts finally decided to grow to a respectable size after all these years?  She was a little old for a growth spurt. She put on a loose sweat shirt and sweat pants, and went out to the living room.  Emiko had changed into sweats and a t-shirt that would have looked big on Andre the Giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you always insist on wearing tents?\" asked Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just like loose-fitting clothes, that's all\", replied her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Loose-fitting is fine, but a family of three could live in that shirt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConversation went on in this vein until their food arrived. When it arrived, they took it into the living room and put on the TV.  Alice did justice to a serving of pork fried rice and another of beef chow mein. She finished up with a fortune cookie.  Her fortune read: \"You will soon receive a big surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, they worked on their presentation for a while. Their hearts weren't in it, so they stopped after an hour.  They sat down to watch TV. Alice took out another gallon of ice cream which had somehow found its way into her freezer. After giving Emiko a generous bowlful, she proceeded to demolish the rest of it herself. Emiko was astonished at her friend's appetite, but elected not to say anything. She couldn't help commenting later when she caught Alice unconsciously massaging her sore breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice, why are you feeling yourself up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not as though I can get anyone else to do it. Why, are you volunteering?\" said Alice, jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tempt me. it's the best offer I've had in far too long\", said Emiko, ruefully.  The two friends chatted amiably for a while. Eventually, bed time came. Alice opened up the couch bed for Emiko, and provided her with pillows and bedding, before retreating to her own room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Alice woke up at 5:00 a.m., feeling nauseated again. She went to the toilet and threw up. Fortunately, she didn't wake up Emiko, who famously slept like a stone. She went quietly back to bed and slept a few more hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a light breakfast, the two friends showered and got dressed.  Alice put on her loosest jeans, only to find that even they were a bit snug. When she came out of her room, Emiko complimented her on her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're almost glowing\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and Emiko did more schoolwork for a while.  At lunchtime, they went out to a local Italian restaurant.  Alice threw up in the ladies' room, again managing to conceal the fact from Emiko. On their way back to Alice's apartment, she felt a craving for pickles. She stopped at a convenience store to pick up a jar. She deliberately forced the cultural significance of a craving for pickles out of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat afternoon, they did some serious work on their presentation, largely finishing it.  Alice suddenly noticed an urgent need to pee. She stood up, and nearly fell over from dizziness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you OK?\" asked Emiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I just stood up too fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she came out of the bathroom, she noticed that it was nearly 6:00 p.m. on Saturday. Though she still didn't know it, she had just finished Day Two. Day Three was about to begin.</span></div></div>",

Stripping herself naked, she looked at her body in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts definitely seemed to be larger, and she was undeniably getting a bit of a belly.  The idea that it was the beginning of a baby bump occurred to her, but she defiantly thrust it away. <i>That is NOT possible</i>, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, they didn't even make the pretense of doing schoolwork, and instead simply enjoyed being together.  Emiko again chose to say nothing as Alice put away a prodigious amount of food, including the entire jar of pickles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Alice again woke up at 5:00, feeling queasy. She stumbled to the bathroom and vomited profusely.  This time, Emiko heard her, and raced to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice, are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Emi. did I wake you? My stomach was just bothering me a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko looked at her friend. During the night, her breasts had gotten noticeably larger, and her belly had expanded into an unmistakable \"baby bump\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my God, Alice, you ARE pregnant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice sat on the bathroom floor and shouted hysterically, her voice almost becoming a shriek:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't be pregnant! I can't ! I can't, I just can't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko sat down next to her friend, and put her arm around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, sweetie, but it sure looks like you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's reply startled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't be pregnant! Don't you see? If I'm pregnant, then magic is real!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Alice, who did this to you?\" A horrible thought struck her.  \"Alice, honey, were you raped?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\", came her friend's miserable reply.  \"If anything, I did this to myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice, what are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I tell you, you'll think  I'm crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice, dear, I already think you're crazy. Come into the living room, and tell me all about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko helped her friend to clean herself up, then brought her into the living room. Then she got her a glass of water, and  sat down next to her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Alice, tell me the whole story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmi listened in dismay as Alice told her the fantastic story about Nicole and the magical coin. When she finished, Alice smiled timidly at her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought Nicole was delusional, so I'll understand if you think so, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Alice, I don't know what happened to you, but I hope you understand that I just can't believe in a magic coin that makes people pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalmer now, Alice spoke again:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, then, tell me bluntly what you think happened to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmi sighed and thought for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then, you're obviously pregnant. So, either someone artificially inseminated you, which seems unlikely, or some guy did this to you.  Either way, it was so traumatic for you, that you went into deep denial.  Along comes this Nicole, who sounds deeply delusional herself, and her story gives you a rationalization for your own condition, so you start to believe it yourself, maybe even unconsciously. I'm no psychology major, but even I've heard of shared delusions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice sighed. \"Emi, that's a perfectly plausible explanation. The only problem is, it's just not true!\" She dissolved into tears again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko hugged her friend. \"Alice, whatever has happened to you, I want you to understand that I'm your friend and I'm here for you, no matter what.\"  Alice hugged her friend back fiercely, and began crying even harder.  The two friends sat on the chair in each other's arms until they both drifted off for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got up around 7:00, and Emiko made breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish you could meet Nicole\", said Alice. \"At least, talk to her a bit and hear her story for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would be interested to talk to her\", said Emiko. \"It's early now, we'll call her in a few hours. Have you been to a doctor since you realized you were pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should make you an appointment, ASAP. You use Doctor Gomulka, same as me, don't you?  Her office is closed on weekends,so we'll both blow off school and work on Monday and see if we can't get you an appointment that day. I'll go with you for moral support.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Emi, I appreciate that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, you're going to start having to make some hard choices. Do you want to keep this kid, or give it up for adoption?  If you do keep it, you may have to drop out of school - at least for a while - and go to work full time. Maybe you can go to school par-time once the kid is old enough. Perhaps you'll even be able to convince Aunt Emiko to babysit someitmes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Emi. God, I haven't even begun to think about stuff like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 10:00 a.m., they called Nicole. She answered right away, and agreed to come to Alice's apartment around Noon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arrived puncutally, and gasped when she saw Alice's condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, God, Alice, I'm so sorry I dragged you into this! So, this is what TAILS means, a delayed reaction?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess\", said Alice, \"although I seem to be making up for lost time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice ushered Nicole into her home, and introduced her to Emiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Nicole\", said Alice, \"Have you used the coin again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only once\", said Nicole, looking sheepish. \"As long as it's socked away in a drawer, I'm fine. When I have it on me, I swear I can hear it begging me to use it. Anyway, I stopped to pick up a bottle of water on my way over here, and  - you know Bunny Waterford?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice nodded. Bunny was a stuck-up snob, worse than Nicole had ever been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I pulled into the convenience store parking lot, she was there, and when she saw me, she started complaining to her boyfriend about how there were too many spots reserved for expectant mothers. I couldn't resist. One flip, and she was eight months pregnant, and complaining about how there weren't <b>enough</b> spots for expectant mothers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole noticed Emiko looking at her doubtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you must think I'm crazy, Emiko, and that I've made your friend crazy, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't have put it that way, but, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't blame you a bit. It all sounds nuts to me, and I'm living it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I see the coins?\" asked Emiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole took the coin out of her purse and placed it on the table.  Emiko picked it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful, Emiko!\" said Alice. \"That thing's dangerous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko waved a calming hand at her friend, and examined the coin, closely. There <b>was</b> something about it, She <b>did </b>feel an urge to flip it. But surely that was just psychological, wasn't it? She came to a decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies, I'm going to prove to you that this coin is not magical, the only way I can\", she said, stripping off her out-sized shirt, so that only her bra covered her upper body. She then beckoned the two women to follow her into Alice's bathroom, where she stood in front of the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Emi, NO!\" said Alice, realizing her friend's intention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emiko, this really isn't a good idea\", added Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko gestured for them to stand on either side of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice, Nicole, nothing is going to happen, I assure you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing happened to me at first, either\", said Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\", said Emiko, \"If it comes up TAILS, we'll know in a day or so, won't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the others could voice any further objections, Emiko looked at herself in the mirror and flipped the coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She began to shake, and controlled herself with an effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ladies\", she said, \"I have to admit that the whole 'magic pregnancy coin' theory is looking a whole lot more plausible to me right now. My apologies for doubting you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cupped her hands over her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to be interesting explaining <i>this</i> to my parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalmly, Emiko went and knelt down in front of the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BLAHHH-AAAH-AAAH-AARRRRRGH!\" she concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice and Nicole helped her clean herself up, and guided her back out to the couch. Alice fetched her some water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\", said Emiko. \"I think I'm sort of in shock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know exactly how you feel\", said Nicole. \"It was different for you, though. We all saw the change, and remembered it afterwards. and you only look about three months along, where I went straight to eight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear the voice?\" asked Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\", said Emiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard it, too\", said Alice, \"but I didn't want to admit it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'm in the same boat as you, Alice\" said Emiko. \"Or at least, a very similar boat. Now, I have to answer all the questions I told you <i>you'd</i> have to answer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Alice's turn to comfort her friend.  \"Whatever comes, Emi, we'll face it together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Alice\" said Emi. \" I do wish we knew more about this coin, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I researched it as best I could\", said Nicole, \"But I couldn't find out anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, too\",  said Alice, \"and I came up empty, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko sat and thought, \"I've got it, we should call Sheila McKenzie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, not her!\" said Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you think she's too ready to believe in things, but she has done a lot of good research.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko turned to Nicole to explain.  \"Sheila's a grad student, a specialist in magic and the paranormal. She and Alice have had some big fights over the years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, fine\" said Alice, \"We might as well try every possible angle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko called Sheila, and without saying too much, asked if they could see her, soon.  Sheila agreed to see them the next afternoon.  Alice, Nicole, and Emiko had lunch together, and then Nicole left, saying that she'd see them the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, Alice and Emiko sat quietly together for a while. As much as they had to talk about, both needed some quiet time to absorb what was going on with them. For awhile, they tried to do some schoolwork, but they both found their vision blurring a bit. They put it down to tired eyes and decided to just relax. Before they knew it, it was nearly 6:00. For Alice, Day Three had ended. Day Four was about to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the evening wore on, Alice found herself feeling increasingly energetic. Her stomach seemed to have finally settled, which was good, because her appetite was still quite hearty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Emiko, what would you like for dinner this evening?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could murder a pizza\", she said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good. What do you want on yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pepperoni, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice called a local pizzeria and ordered two large pepperoni pies.  They could have the leftovers cold for breakfast, if there were any. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the food arrived, the two friends quickly polished it off.  Alice reflected on the oddness of the situation.  In just a few days, her whole life - her whole way of <i>looking</i> at life - had been turned on its head.  But, somehow, now that she had accepted her predicament, she was oddly calm.  She was still afraid, she was still unsure what she was going to do, but she was at peace. Whatever happened, would happen. Now it was Emiko that was freaking out, Emiko who needed comforting.  It helped her to have someone to look after.  Once dinner was over, Emiko began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to call my parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko's father worked for the Ibaraki Corporation, a Japanese conglomerate. The year before Emiko was born, he had been sent to work for their American branch.  Because it was to be a long-term posting, he brought his wife with him.  Emiko had been born their first year in the U.S.  The year she turned 18, her parents had finally returned to Japan. Emiko, never having seen Japan, elected to remain in America.  Claiming U.S. citizenship, she began working her way through college. Her parents hadn't been happy, but they had acquiesced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you think they'll react?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They won't be happy, especially when I tell them I don't know who the father is. Heh, there <i>is</i> no father! Is it parthenogenesis, do you think? Will our babies be little copies of us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how I feel about having to raise up a little copy of me\", mused Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mom will be disappointed, and  worried\", continued Emiko, \"But I'm not worried about <i>her</i>. It's my dad who'll go ballistic. He still thinks of me as his little baby girl. Ah, well, no point in delaying. It'll be about 10:30 a.m, Sunday over there, so they should both be home.  Wish me luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice held her friend's hand as she called her parents.  The conversation was in Japanese, so she didn't know precisely what was said, but it was obviously very emotional. Before it was over, there was both shouting and tears. When it was over, Emiko buried her face in Alice's shoulder. When she finally raised her head, Alice asked her how it went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About how I expected. Mama was disappointed, Daddy was heartbroken. He couldn't make up his mind between insisting on flying out here tonight and insisting that I fly there immediately.  Mama talked him down off of that ledge, but then half talked <i>herself</i> into flying out here tonight. I talked her out of that, but she'll probably fly out here at some point. Anyway, they both still love me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't think about telling them the truth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not that brave. They <i>were</i> glad that I had someone with me. Oh, man, I'm exhausted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to turn in early?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Listen, don't take this the wrong way, but can I sleep with you tonight? I really don't want to be alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, but no getting fresh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Alice was woken by the sound of Emiko retching. She ran out to comfort her friend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to be over <i>your</i> nausea\", said Emiko, almost accusingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", said Alice. \"I'm just a little - BRRRAAARRRP- gassy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!\" said Emiko. \"Only you could make me laugh at a time like this. I'm lucky to have a friend like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so sweet\", said Alice. Smirking, she continued, \"I'd say it was enough to make me puke, but under the circumstances...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends ate breakfast.  When Alice went to get dressed, she realized that her midsection had expanded further. She wasn't surprised - she felt a good deal heavier. None of her regular pants or jeans fit her.  Even her baggiest sweat pants were snug on her.  She had to go without bra and panties - none of her underwear fit her properly. She had to wear her loosest shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going casual?\" said Emiko.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all I've got that fits. I got fatter overnight. At this rate, I don't see how I'm going to last nine months.  It can't be normal to get this big this fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we've established that this isn't a normal pregnancy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You know, I think my skin's a little darker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've heard of that happening to pregnant women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends spent a relaxed morning, talking about their plans for the future.  Nicole arrived around Noon, and the three had lunch together before driving over to Sheila's house. Nicole had the coin with her, but had resisted the urge to use it. Sheila answered her door, smiling. She was a large, busty blonde woman about 25 years old, built like a Valkyrie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, my two little skeptics, and who's your friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko introduced Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on in\", said Sheila, leading them into a spacious parlor filled with books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what brings you here today?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice, Emiko, and Nicole told Sheila their whole story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\", said Sheila afterwards. \"If anyone besides you two\" she said, meaning Alice and Emiko, \"came to me with a story like this, I'd throw them out. But whatever our differences, I know you two are too dedicated to the truth to lie about something like this. So, I believe that you believe what you're saying, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to Nicole, she said, \"May I see the coin, please?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\", said Nicole, taking the coin out of her purse, \"But be careful. I swear there's something in<i></i> that thing. And whatever you do, don't flip it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheila picked up the coin. Nicole was right, there <i>was</i> something in it. She could almost hear it it calling out to her, begging her to flip it.  With an effort, she put the coin down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know\", she said, \"I...</span></div></div>",

Wait right here.\" She left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were waiting, Alice and Emiko chatted quietly, while Nicole looked around the room.  On one wall, she spotted a large photograph.  There were eight people in it - two of them were older, presumably Sheila's parents.With them were five younger women, one of whom was obviously Sheila, and a younger man. After a few minutes, Sheila came back in to the room, carrying an old leatherbound book.  Nicole pointed to the photo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this your family, Sheila?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's right. There's Mom and Dad, my older sisters Jean, Carla, Patricia, and Anne, me, and my little brother, Lou.  Dad really wanted a son. Mom was game, but she kept producing girls. Finally they got lucky on the sixth try, and got Lou. Unfortunately, they spoiled him silly, and now he's a self-absorbed chauvinist brat. I often wonder how long my parents would have gone on if her hadn't come along.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down with the book in her lap, and resumed speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Great-Uncle Howard collected rare books. He probably had more rare books than the local campus library. When he died, he left me $500,000.00, and right of first refusal on his books.  I used the money to buy this house, and then filled it with his books. I kept them all. Since then, my main hobby has been cataloguing them, sorting them, getting rid of the ones I don't want.  This book is one of them.  Have any of you ever heard of Durnovarius?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three mothers-to-be confessed that they had not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Durnovarius\" said Sheila, unconsciously adopting a professorial tone, \"Was the pen name of a man who lived in Dorchester, in England, in the 12th Century.  His real name has not come down to us. He wrote extensive journals regarding what we would now call the paranormal, the inner secrets of reality.  Eventually, he fell afoul of the Church, and learned the inner secret of what it felt like to be burned alive. In the late Eighteenth Century, a man named Oswald Montmorency claimed to have found one of Durnovarius' journals and transcribed it.  Most people thought he'd made the whole thing up. Actually, most people thought he'd made <i>Durnovarius</i> up. let alone the journal.  Anyway, this is a copy of of said transcription.  The interesting thing is that there's a section in here that describes something that sounds an awful lot like your 'pregnancy coin'.  It's all in  Medieval Latin.  Fortunately, I happen to be quite fluent in Medieval Latin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheila looked up, obviously enjoying playing to her audience.  She opened the book, and began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'A curious item which has come into my possession is the Coin of Gignerus' - he goes on to give a lengthy description that exactly matches your coin on the table there. To continue: 'The coin is said to be the prison of an ancient fertility spirit, a creature mischievous but not malevolent. When the coin is flipped, then whichever side comes up, the next person that they who flipped the coin lays eyes on - even if it be his or her own reflection - be they eligible, will be made pregnant in one of two ways. The first is that they shall suddenly find themselves at some point in a normal pregnancy, which shall then proceed as normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that' what happened to me\", said Emiko<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very likely, dear\" said Sheila, continuing to read. \"'The second possibility is that the one seen will be undergo an accelerated pregnancy, which will be complete in nine days, with each day counting as though one month of a normal pregnancy'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait a minute!\" said Alice.\"Is that what happened to me? I'm going to have a baby in nine days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually\", said Sheila, \"When did you flip the coin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thursday, just before 6:00 p.m.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And today's Monday...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah\", said Alice. \"I was supposed to call Doctor Gomulka's office this morning, wasn't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's alright,dear\" said Emiko.  \"We can both make appointments, later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway\", said Sheila, \"It's 3:00 p.m. Monday, now, so you're almost at the end of your fourth day. I wouldn't make any plans for next Saturday, if I were you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next Saturday, my God...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko put an arm around her friend. \"Don't worry, dear, we'll get through it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheila began reading again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Now,when the coin is flipped, should it land smiling side up, events and memories shall be re-written, so that the pregnancy shall seem a naturally happening event, with none but the one who flipped the coin knowing the difference.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's what happened to me\", said Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheila read some more, \"'If, however, the frowning side comes up, then the pregnancy will be seen as a sudden, unnatural event, a shock to all affected. As to the matter of eligibility, all humans 18 years of age, or older, may be affected. If a given person be physically incapable of bearing a child, they will be adapted to do so'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Adapted'\", said Alice, \"I wonder what that means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows?\" said Sheila,  \" I wonder what happens if you use it on a woman that's already pregnant?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not find out right now!\" said Emiko. \"Does it say anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just that the coin won't always follow the normal rules of probability. One user may get the same result over and over, another may never get the same result twice. Also that any pregnancies that result will be trouble-free, or at least have only the troubles that even the best pregnancy might have, and that the babies will be born healthy and wholesome, whatever that means.

Looking at herself, she guessed that she must be around six months pregnant.  At the same time, new memories began to flood into her mind:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix months before, she'd attended a conference of medieval historians. She'd met Stephen Cortese, a dark-eyed handsome man. They'd hit it off, had a few drinks together, and one thing led to another, and they'd spent the night together.Nothing further had happened, and their time together had become simply a pleasant memory. Now, in her re-written history, about a month after the conference she'd realized that she was pregnant. She'd thought deeply over what she should do. She'd liked Stephen, but she hadn't loved him. Plus, he lived on the other side of the country. If she told him about the child, he'd feel obligated to be a part of its life, and probably to have a say in its upbringing.  She didn't want that, for herself, or even for him. It would force them both to make decisions that would disrupt both their lives.  So, she kept the secret of the child's paternity to herself. Her family weren't happy with it, but they'd come to accept it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheila was shaken from her reverie by Emiko's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Sheila, are you OK?  You're all spaced out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You - didn't see that?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See what?\" asked Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were pregnant when we came in\", said Emiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I wasn't\", said Sheila.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it\", said Nicole. \"You flipped the coin and the 'happy' side came up. So, that's what it's like when someone else does it. You don't even notice the difference.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You used the coin on yourself?\" said Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\", said Sheila. \"I wanted to know what it was like. I -um - I can't believe it...\" she took a moment to collect herself.  \"OK, now that I know it works, there's someone I know that I think would welcome being made pregnant. Can you ladies stick around for a while?  We could have an early dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three friends agreed, and the four of them went to Sheila's kitchen, where they set about preparing themselves dinner.  As they worked, Sheila explained what she had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My oldest sister, Jean, and her husband, they're desperate to have kids. But they can't. Nobody's fault, but they can't.  They've tried and tried, been to dozens of doctors, had all sorts of fertility drugs, artsem, the lot.  Every legal treatment, and some 'questionable' ones. We've tried to convince them to adopt, but it's no go. They want a child of \"'their own'. If anyone I know would welcome having this coin flipped at them, it would be her. I'd like to give her a call and have her come over here. Is tha tOk with all of you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\", said Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK\", said Emiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" said Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up, dear?\" said Emiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I just felt 'Junior' kick!

They could almost be twins, only Louise was a little shorter, and had her her done up in a ponytail.   New memories flooded into Sheila's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Louis McKenzie had been replaced by Louise McKenzie.  The arrival of another daughter had not lessened her parents' determination to have a son. After Louise, they had had six more daughters - Marie, June, Angela, Phyllis, Jennifer, and Gwendolyn - before her mother had finally said \"No more!\" Louise had married her long-time boyfriend about a year ago, and had announced her pregnancy shortly after Sheila had announced hers. Louise McKenzie was now Louise Carlson </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouise was showing the other a photo on her phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is me with my husband, Brad, and his sister, Gail, my best friend, and maid of honor at my wedding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Louise was talking to the others, Sheila looked a the family photo on the wall.  There were now fourteen people in the photo - her parents and their <b>twelve</b> daughters.  She looked at the six sisters that she had never seen before, but also had known all of their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Louise left, Sheila spoke to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I did it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You used the coin?\" said Nicole. \"You got your sister pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I got my <i>brother</i>  pregnant. Wow, you don't say <i>that</i> often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you don't have a brother\", said Emiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five minutes ago, I had four sisters and a brother. Now, I have eleven sisters and no brother.  The coin 'adapted' him by turning him into a woman. I'll miss him a little, but he was kind of a jerk. From my new memories, Louise seems to be nicer than Lou was.  Maybe he's better off as a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foursome returned to Sheila's living room.   Jean McKenzie McCormack arrived a short while later.  She was a bit shorter than Sheila or Louise, her hair was somewhat darker, and she wore glasses, but she otherwise looked very similar to her sisters. Sheila introduced Alice, Emiko and Nicole, and then began to speak to the matter at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jean, I want to apologize in advance. I've been discussing certain of your personal issues with people you don't know, without asking your permission. I promise you I wouldn't have done so if I didn't think there was a good reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What 'personal issues'?\", asked Jean, warily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your inability to become pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because each of these women has been made pregnant by a method which I'm reasonably certain you can't have known about. I think it would work for you, too, if you were willing to try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What method?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheila sighed. \"I'll tell you, but I warn you, that it's got something to do with my paranormal studies. It's going to sound a little 'out there'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean laughed, \"Sheila, bill and I have gone to two psychics, a faith healer and a self-proclaimed 'shamaness'.   I'm not sure it could sound more out there than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd be surprised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Sheila told Jean the story of the coin, with input from the others as needed.  She decided to leave out the story of Lou/Louise, for fear it would muddy the waters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\", said Jean. \"You were right, Sis, that story is definitely 'out there'.  So, all I need to do is look in the mirror and flip the coin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\", said Sheila\", that's right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well', anything's worth a shot.

Her breasts got bigger, and weight was added on in other places as well, but the most astonishing  part was watching her belly begin to grow and grow and grow until it was that of a woman seven months pregnant. At the same time, her clothes changed, becoming  maternity wear. New memories came into her head: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Several months before, after countless failed fertility treatments, after she'd given up hope, she'd found herself gaining weight, having odd cravings, and occasional bouts of nausea. At first, she hadn't believed it. She couldn't let herself believe, not after having had her hopes dashed so many times. finally, she'd  gone to see Doctor Tonya Jackson, her physician.When Tonya confirmed her pregnancy, Jean had been so overjoyed that she'd kissed poor Tonya full on the lips, before heading home to tell her husband Bill the good news.  there had been more kissing, too, and a good deal more than that, besides. Since then, she'd been walking on eggshells, making sure that nothing endangered her unborn child, but so far everything had gone swimmingly.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean snapped out of her reverie!  \"It worked! It worked! It worked!\" She embraced her sister, joyfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What worked?\" said Sheila. Jean showed her the coin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" said Sheila.  \"You mean, you used the coin? That's so weird!  I remember you telling me months ago that you were pregnant! This business of time being re-written is so disorienting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean\", said Jean. \"I have two sets of memories. Older memories telling that I came over today because you said you had something important to discuss with me, and newer memories telling me that I stopped by just because I was in the neighborhood.  That coin is amazing. Nicole, what are you planning to do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know\", said Nicole. It <b>is</b> amazing, but it's also dangerous. Using it becomes compulsive after a while.  It could be used to help people, but it could also mess up a lot of people's lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole, can I make a suggestion?\" asked Sheila.  \"Why don't you store the coin somewhere, while I research it some more? Let me see whether I can't find out more about it, maybe learn if there's some better way to control it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK\", said Nicole, \"I'll be in touch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole drove Alice and Emiko back to Emiko's apartment, stopping at Emiko's dorm so she could pick up more of her things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, I'd like to stay in touch with you two, as well\" said Nicole. \"I feel responsible for what happened to you. I know you flipped the coin yourselves, but you might never have even seen it if I hadn't brought it over here. God, when I think about what I've done to people's lives with that thing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice smiled at Nicole, \"Of course, we'll stay in touch! Us mommies have to stick together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And don't worry about it too much\", said Emiko. \"We'll get by, somehow. Drive safely, now, and don't get anyone pregnant on the way home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Alice and Emiko sat down to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's funny\", said Alice. \"I never thought I'd end up on such good terms with Nicole Winters.

My parents will lhep, but my dad's liable to start insisting I move to Japan if he thinks I'm here with nowhere to live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're more than welcome to move in here\", said Alice, \"I don't imagine the landlord will squawk, as long as the rent gets paid. It'll be crowded in here with both of us and baby. And then later, your baby. Hmm, I guess I'll have to go in to work tomorrow and make my excuses. I guess I'll just have to be one of those women you hear about who didn't even know they were pregnant until the kid was practically dropping out of them.  It's lame, but it'll have to do. I'm just a part-timer there, so I don't suppose they'll hold the job for me. God, I'll probably have to drop out of school, too, at least for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\"m hoping that I can make it out the school year\" said Emiko. \"And I can keep working at the cafe for a while yet, too. I think I will take you up on your generous offer to move in here.

How about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got some savings, but probably less than you. We'll just have to do the best we can. Other women deal with unexpected pregnancies all the time, we can do it, too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening they both spent time on-line researching pregnancy, and the resources available to new and expectant mothers.  That night, Alice had a horrific nightmare. Giant rabbits were chasing her, just as her mother had described years before. She walked out and climbed on to the couch bed next to Emiko. She recounted her dream to her friend, who reached out to comfort her until she fell asleep in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Tuesday, they woke up early and had a leisurely breakfast. Alice found walking difficult - the weight gain had made her clumsy. Later in the morning, they went and discussed their situation with the library and school officials. It was awkward, but they managed to get through it. They called the doctor's office, but were unable to get appointments until Friday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's just as well\", said Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\" asked Emiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I went in today, looking like I'm only five months pregnant, and show up at the hospital looking full-term on Saturday, that might raise a few uncomfortable questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose\", said Emiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ate lunch and then went to Emiko's dorm room to get more of her stuff.  The girls there helped them get their things out to Emiko's clunky old car. They went back to Alice's apartment and spent the afternoon unloading Emiko's stuff. Unfortunately, Emiko had to do most of the work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 3:00 p.m., the phone rang. It was...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Nicole, what's up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Alice, I've been thinking about some things, and I was wondering if I could come over there and talk to you and Emiko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, if you like, why don't you come over for dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK\", said Nicole, \"I'll be there in a little while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did she want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wants to talk about something. I invited over for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole arrived a little while later.  Alice noticed that it was nearly 6:00 p.m.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, I guess my sixth day has just started, thought Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice and Emiko greeted Nicole. they made small talk for a while before Nicole got down to business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies, I've been thinking. I know that sudden unexpected pregnancies must have been very hard on you. Not just emotionally, but financially as well, and I wanted to try to help.  Look, I'm not trying to play Lady Bountiful here, nor to salve my own conscience. Also, I'm not trying to imply that you two can't survive without my gracious assistance. I really do want to help. My whole life I've looked out for myself, But - and maybe it's impending motherhood - I've finally reached a point in my life where I want to help someone other than myself. Anyway, what I was thinking was, I live in a two bedroom condo, more space than I could ever need.  I wanted to offer for you two to come and stay with me. I wouldn't charge you rent, but if you didn't want to be beholden to me, we could leave it that you could pay me back whenever you got back on your feet again. It wouldn't be perfect, but it would enable you to at least have someplace to stay that you knew would be secure, although you would have to share a room, if you didn't mind that..  Plus, we could all help each other out once our kids arrive, and so on.  Anyway, I understand if you don't want to answer right way, and I won't take it personally if you say no. It's just, in my  own admittedly cement-headed way, I do want to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice and Emiko conferred briefly, and then Alice spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole, we do appreciate you offer, and we'd like time to talk it over tonight. Do you mind if we stop tomorrow to take a look at your place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" said Nicole, \" I thought you might. Why not come by around 10:00 a.m.?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice and Emiko agreed, and then the three sat down to dinner.  Later, after Nicole had left, Alice and Emiko discussed her offer. While both had some reservations, they agreed that the potential financial benefits were big enough that they couldn't dismiss it out of hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh\", said Alice, \"I swear my belly's gotten bigger just since dinner. My loosest shirt is too tight on me. I hate to buy maternity wear when I'm going to be giving birth in just a couple of days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I should buy some\", said Emiko. I'm going to be pregnant for months, yet.  I'll pick some up tomorrow after we're done at Nicole's and you can use it, too. For now, you'll just have to wear one of my 'tents'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey turned in early. That night, although neither of them said anything, Alice slept on the couch bed with Emiko. she seemed to feel an overwhelming need for human contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the next morning, Alice's belly had swollen even further, so that even the biggest of Emiko's 'tents' barely fit over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My hands and feet are swollen, too\" she said. \"And I'm thirsty. Emiko, get me a glass of water, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, 'Mom'\", said Emiko, smirking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at Nicole's place a few minutes early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, it sure is a fancy-looking place\", said Emiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And big!\" said Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole buzzed them in.  She gave them a tour of her condo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think of the place?\" asked Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very nice. And much bigger than I thought.  I knew your family was rich, but not this rich!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I heartily recommend  being born into  a rich family. I would've been in trouble if I'd had to earn it! So, would you like to live here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole, do you mind if Alice and have a quick chat  in private?\" asked Emiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all\", said Nicole, \"I'll just be in the other room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had left the room, the two friends conferred.  Then they called Nicole back into the room, and Alice said...</span></div></div>",

Unless we start having wild orgies, they're not going to make trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about tame orgies\", said Alice, jokingly, \"Are those OK?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\", said Nicole, laughing, \"Just not after ten at night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre these two a couple? she thought to herself.  I never thought so, but they sure didn't seem to mind sharing a bedroom. Ah, well .what of it? Not my business anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio had lunch together, discussing the logistics of their situation, making arrangements to have their stuff moved to Nicole's condo. Nicole had room in her storage space, so some of their stuff would go there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they drove to the mall to buy maternity wear, Emiko said to Alice, \"Did you see the look on Nicole's face when you mad ethat 'orgy' remark?

Once there, they rested for a while, and then began working which of their things they would take to Nicole's, and which they would put into storage.

Emiko had to help her out of bed and she found walking difficult.  When she got to the bathroom,she noticed that her breasts were leaking.  It was really starting to hit home to her that she was going to give birth in two days. She was also getting stretch marks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You OK in there, kid?\" said Emiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm just pregnant,  that's all. I'll get over it in a day or two. I'm also really itchy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled out for breakfast. She heard Emiko race into the bathroom behind her, and then the sound of her vomiting.  Poor thing, she thought, lowering herself into  a chair. Emiko joined her a while later.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThat morning, Alice called her landlady and let her know her situation.  The landlady was sympathetic and the call went smoothly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice's back was hurting her, so she spent most of the day sitting around, while Emiko worked on packing things up. Later, Emiko went out shopping for various baby things that Alice would need, having them all shipped to Nicole's condo. While Alice was sitting around, she spent time researching as much as she could about child care.  She really missed her mother - she had no close older female relatives to advise her in a situation like this.  Emiko was lucky, she at least would have more time to prepare, and could always consult with her mom, if need be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko came back from the  store, and plopped down onto the couch next to Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stairs are already  a pain for me\", said Emiko. \"I can't imagine what they'll be like in a couple of months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice smiled fondly at her friend. Emiko was making such an effort for her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,Emiko, you thought Nicole wondered if we were a couple. Maybe it's not so funny. I can't imagine loving anyone as much as I love you right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure that's not just the hormones talking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe a little\", smiled Alice. \"But I really do love you for everything you've done for me this week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you, too, sweetie\", said Emiko. \"Friends to the end.  Besides, your day to do things for me will come!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice smiled at her and said, \"I'm so glad I - BLAARRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko laughed, \"You always did have a way with words, dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn indigestion!\" came her friend's reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair kept busy with their preparations the rest of the afternoon. Eventually, Alice got hungry, and looked up to see if it was suppertime.  It was 5:45 p.m., just about time to eat, and just about the start of her eighth day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For the first time in several days, she didn't feel any heavier than she had when she'd gone to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater  that morning, they went to see Doctor Gomulka. Emiko went in first and Doctor Gomulka pronounced her and her baby healthy.  Alice went in next and did her best to make the pretense that hers was a normal pregnancy.  There were some awkward moments, but in the end, she pronounced Alice and her baby healthy as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, they had a light lunch. When they left the restaurant after they were done eating, Alice soon realized that Emiko wasn't driving them home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they pulled up at Nicole's condo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are we here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko opened the door with a key Nicole had given her, waving Alice in ahead of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's all dark in here\", said Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko flipped on the light switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SURPRISE!\" said Emiko, Nicole and Sheila.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" asked Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I couldn't let you get by without a baby shower, now could I?\" replied Emiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shower proceeded with the mixture of forced hilarity and good fellowship that such events usually entailed. When a quiet moment arrived, Sheila spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I ask you all a question? Don't answer it if it's too personal, but have any of you given serious consideration to giving your babies up for adoption. <br>\r\nI'm not saying you should, just asking if any of you thought about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emiko and I did talk about it\", said Alice,\"But neither of us liked the idea. I won't deny that I'm scared, but I'm determined to be a mother to this baby, no matter what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've always felt the same way\", said Nicole. \"Which is funny when you consider what a self-absrobed little twerp I'd always been up to that point. Why, are you thinking of giving up your baby, Sheila?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, I feel that same way as you all do. I just wondered if everyone else affected by the coin felt that way, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you mention it\", said Nicole, \"To my knowledge, all of the other affected women are keeping their babies. Do you think it's the coin affecting our thinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could be\", said Sheila. \"I'm still researching it. I may have some news next week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, keep us posted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn time, the party broke up. As Alice stood up to leave, her belly seemed to drop downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my God, I can breathe again!\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like your baby's dropped\" said Sheila. \"It's only a matter of time, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n When Emiko and Alice got home, it was just about 6:00 p.m.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is it</i>, thought Alice, <i>Sometime in the next 24 hours, I will become a mother!</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From time to time, she stopped to see how her friend was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice, can I get you anything?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Emi, I'm fi - AIIIEE - ne!\" said Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice, are you OK?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, I'm OK, just a bit of a contraction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,my God, the baby's not coming now, is it? Should we get you to the hospital?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Emi, you sound like an expectant father from a 60's sitcom! No, I don't think the baby's coming now. I'm pretty sure that was what they call a 'Braxton-Hicks' contraction.  Just my uterus firing a warning shot, is all. But since you ask, I could go for some more ice cream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko went to fetch the requested treat, and then came back and sat down next to Alice with a snack of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done with preparations?' asked Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", said Emiko, \"We're about as ready as we can be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good\", said Alice. \"Just sit with me a while.  I could use the human contact.\" She leaned her head on her friend's shoulder. \"It just occurred to me that this is probably my last night in this apartment. The place is kind of a dump, but I have some fond memories of my time here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\", said Emiko, \"We'll just have to make some new fond memories in the future. Say, Emiko, in all the rush, I never asked you - do you have any names in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, but I'm keeping them to myself until the kid is born. I'm not usually superstitious, but just this once, I don't want to jinx it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Alice awoke feeling surprisingly calm. Emiko, however, seemed to be a bundle of nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy lunch time, Alice couldn't stand it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit jumping around, Emi, you're like a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs. This baby may not come for hours, yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know\", said Emiko. \"I almost <b>do</b> feel like an expectant father, you know. As if there aren't going to be enough people assuming we're a couple as it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, Emiko?\" said Alice.\"I don't care if they do think that. I could think of worse partners to have than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko sat down next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, Alice, we've never discussed this, but I'm not really all that interested in boys...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me, neither\", said Alice. \"But, as interesting as this conversation is, I'm afraid we're going to have to postpone it. We've got something more immediately interesintg to talk about right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure my water just broke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay calm, Emi. Now, I've read that there's usually some time between a woman's water breaking and the start of her labor. However, because of the 'accelerated' nature of my pregnancy, I expect it to be sooner rather than la- AAAAIIIEEE- ter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmi called Doctor Gomulka and spoke to her, briefly. The doctor agreed that it sounded like it was time to take Alice to the hospital. In the meanwhile,  Alice called Sheila and Nicole to let them know what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Emiko drove Alice to the hospital, the mother-to-be's contractions began coming closer together. Fortunately, the hospital was nearby.  Emiko helped Alice check in, and then sat down to wait. Her wait was not a long one. It seemed like she had hardly sat down when  a nurse approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, you came in with Alice Wang, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's right. Is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, nothing's wrong. Your friend has just given birth, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, it was very fast. The doctor said he'd never seen such a quick delivery. Anyway, your friend and her daughter are just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaughter! So Alice had a girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When  can I see her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In just a little while. The doctor's just giving her a once-over, and then they'll move her to a room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was waiting, Emiko called Nicole and Sheila again.  Soon thereafter, she was ushered to Alice's room. Alice, looking exhausted but exultant, lay in a hospital bed with her newborn daughter in her arms. Emiko smiled. The baby looked just like Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, kiddo, won't you introduce me to your new friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice smiled. \"I've named her after my mother - and my dearest friend. Emiko, please meet Pearl Emiko Wang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears came to Emiko's eyes even as a big, beaming smile filled her face. Then she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You realize, of course, that you've given your baby initials that spell 'PEW'?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Within  a few short weeks it was Nicole's turn to give birth, as she had a healthy young son, George Peter Winters. That was the month of many births.  Soon after George's birth, Betty gave birth to a daughter, Margaret Mary O'Donnell. Bridget followed suit by giving birth to  a daughter of her own, Jean Moira O'Donnell. They heard also of the birth of Sylvia's son, William Harold Hayes, Chloe's daughter, Rhiannon Marielle D'Alphonse and even Bunny Waterford's son, Zachary Taylor Waterford-Harris.<br>\r\nAs she had previously planned, Nicole went to stay with the O'Donnells after she left the hospital, leaving Alice and Emiko on their own in her condo. She came back home after another month. All this time, Sheila - now effectively eight months pregnant - had been researching the coin.  That month, she was distracted somewhat by the birth of her sister Jean's son, Patrick Andrew McCormack, not to mention the imminence of her own child's birth. However, one day she had made a discovery that led to her asking Nicole, Emiko and Alice to come see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole hung up the phone, and went and spoke to Alice and Emiko, letting them know that Sheila wanted to see them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said to bring the babies along, too, she's finally got her place baby-proofed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two were free at the moment, so they agreed that now was a good a time as any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, then\", said Nicole, \"I'll let Tiffany know we're going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiffany\" was Tiffany Biltmore, Nicole's 18 year-old cousin, a petite blonde girl.  She had come to stay for the weekend at her mother's urging, in order to give Nicole and her friends whatever help they needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiff\", said Nicole, \"We're all going out to see a friend. We're taking the babies with us, so you're going to be on your own for the next few hours, at least. We'll probably have dinner  there, so feel free to help yourself to something here, or eat out, if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Nicki\", said Tiffany, \"maybe I'll take the bus downtown and meet up with one of my friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole smiled at her cousin. she was a good kid, still caught up in the world of partying and hanging out that Nicole had been a part of not that long ago. Nicole went into her room and took the coin out of its hiding place and set it down on top of her dresser next to a pile of loose change that she had set aside to sort and roll up later.  At that moment, she heard George begin to cry. She ran to the nursery and picked him up and began to comfort him. Just then, Tiffany, came into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to bother you, cuz, but I just remembered - the buses around here insist on exact change, right? I've got money on me but not much change.  Do you have any change I could borrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, just take whatever's on top of my dresser, that's fine.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmiko, now effectively five months pregnant, and Alice, carrying Pearl, came into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could one of you guys drive?\" asked Emiko. \"I'm starting to reach the point where it's hard for me to fit behind the wheel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistracted, Nicole left the condo, having forgotten to go back and get the coin.  It was only when they had sat down in Sheila's parlor that she remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap!\" she said. \"I left the coin on my dresser!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I imagine it'll be OK until we get back\", said Emiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so\", said Nicole. \"I sent Tiff in there to get some change for herself. She's not shifty or anything, but you know how that thing can call out to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to call her and ask about it?\" asked Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I better not\", said Nicole. \" I don't want to to draw her attention to it. Anyway, apart form cooing over everyone's babies, what did you want to see us for, Sheila?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've found another reference to the coin\", she said. \"It's in an old copy of the writings of Paul d'Austrasie, a Frankish monk living in the time of Charlemagne. I think he may have been one of Durnovarius' sources - if not his only source. Anyway, Brother Paul says pretty much the same things Durnovarius did, plus a few things more. One is that the coin is indestructible, at least by any known means. It has been cast into the hottest furnaces, and even into an active volcano, and still come out intact. Furthermore, he says that the spirit in the coin has sought down through the centuries the one through whom it will be reborn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Reborn'?\" asked Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, although I'm not quite sure what that means. I'm not sure Brother Paul did, either. However, I get the impression that he thought that the spirit - Gignerus, we'll call it - wants to escape from the coin and take on physical form.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, like, to possess someone?\" asked Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Nicki, Paul doesn't say. Of course, how he knew any of this, I have no idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there some way to recognize whoever is going to be the One?\" asked Emiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If there is, Brother Paul doesn't mention it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do about this coin, then?\" asked Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, apparently, we can't destroy it, and using it is dangerous and unpredictable.  We could toss it into the ocean, or bury it, but it'll just surface eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a safe deposit box at the bank\" said Nicole. \"Maybe we could store it in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a thought, Nic\" said Sheila.  \"That would be as secure a spot as we can manage. I mean, we're dealing with a magical object here, so we can never be 100% certain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's Saturday now\", said Nicole. \"The bank won't be open again until Monday. I'll bring it in then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the four friends began simply socializing, and eventually had dinner together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier, when Nicole had told her where to find her change, Tiffany had gone into her cousin's room and, spotting it on the dresser, had swept it all into her purse, inadvertently sweeping up the coin as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany took out her cellphone and called her boy friend, Joey MacDonald. As far as she was concerned, Joey was her soulmate. They had met in kindergarten, and had become fast friends after discovering that they were born on the exact same day. She really loved Joey - not simply because he was big, handsome and studly - which he was - but because he had such a great personality. They really meshed well together.  Tiffany liked to say that if Joey had been born a girl, she would have liked to have \"her\" as a best friend.  They arranged to meet at Von Steuben's, a moderately pricey restaurant downtown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left the house and walked down to the bus stop. When she saw the bus approaching, she reached into her purse for some change, and pulled out an odd-looking coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What the heck is this?</i> she thought. She reached in again, and pulled out some proper change, and got on the bus. Paying her fare, she sat down and looked at the coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It must be Nicole's. I  must've picked it up when I took her change.  Oh, well, I'll put it back when I go back.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the coin in her hand, she looked out the bus window. The bus stopped at a red light outside Fenneman's, a high-class department store. She perked up as she noticed her Auny Lucy, Nicole's mother, going into the store. A sudden urge to flip the coin came over her. She could almost hear it speaking:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">FLIP ME.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile staring at her aunt, she flipped the coin, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was a tall, well-built, brown-haired boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, babe, good to  see ya\", he said, leaning down to kiss her.

The two had known one another since kindergarten, and were as close as sisters. Tiffany always liked to say that if Josie had been born a boy she would have wanted to marry \"him\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends had celebrated their mutual eighteenth birthday three months before, with their friends Steve and Marty. Unfortunately, they hadn't celebrated as carefully as they should have, and both girls had gotten pregnant.  Their parents had gone ballistic when they found out. Fortunately for Tiffany, Marty had stood up and accepted responsibility.  Tiffany liked Marty, but didn't want to marry him. It had been agreed, however, that he would contribute to the child's upbringing, since Tiffany was determined to keep her baby. Things were worse for Josie - Steve had ratted on her, and skipped town. After their initial anger, her parents had been supportive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends enjoyed a leisurely meal, and then hung out together for a while.  Eventually, Tiffany noticed the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I should get back to my cousin's. She and her friends will be back before too long, and I've got to catch a bus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\", said Josie, \"I've got my car, why don't I drive you there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, thanks\", said Tiffany. \"You should meet my cousin. She and her friends are cool. They're all unwed mothers, so you don't have to worry about them being all judgmental.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, it was that they arrived back at Nicole's house shortly after Nicole and company arrived back home. After introductions were completed, Tiffany spoke to Nicole:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey, Nicki, I've got the rest of your change here, I'll put it back on the dresser. Oh, and sorry, I accidentally picked up your lucky charm or whatever it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany handed the coin back to Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kind of weird, isn't it? I dropped it and the old guy who picked it up acted like he'd seen a ghost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged and gestured to Josie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Jo, I'll show you around the place.\" Once the two younger women had left the room, Alice spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are the two that got pregnant on their eighteenth birthday, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I remember\", said Nicole. \"But if they had the coin all day, then maybe they just became pregnant this afternoon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither of them seemed weirded out or anything\", said Emiko. \"Whichever one of them flipped it ought to have had some reaction. It really freaked me out when I did it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this old guy they mentioned was the one who flipped it\" mused Nicole. \"It's hard to say without knowing more, but I can't really quiz them on it without getting them interested in it, and I don't want that. I feel bad. I was careless leaving it around like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carelees\", said Emiko, \"Or maybe it was the coin's influence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation stopped as Tiffany and Josie came back into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I better head along now\", said Josie. \"Nice to meet you all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and hugged Tiffany.  \"Talk to you later, Mommy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after Josie left, the phone rang. Nicole picked it up and answered flippantly, \"Hello, Winters Home for Unwed Mothers, how may we help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes went wide in astonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOM?\" she said.  \"Uh, uh, sure, Mom, tomorrow Noon is fine. What? Oh, yes, I love you, too. Bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to her friends. \"She wants to come and see me tomorrow. She has something important she needs to talk to me about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that Aunt Lucy?\", asked Tiffany, \"I saw her going into Fenneman's this afternoon, but she didn't see me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole went pale as a sudden thought struck her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong, Nic?\" asked Tiffany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ah - nothing. I'm just a little worn out, is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, while Tiffany was watching the babies, Nicole, Alice and Emiko went for a walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mom sounded really upset\", said Nicole, \"and for her to suddenly call me like this after not speaking to me for months...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Tiffany had the coin all afternoon\", said Emiko, \"and you think the two things might be connected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Emi, I'm so sick of that damned coin!\" said Nicole.  \"Monday I'm going to lock it in the bank and never take it out again.  I'm going to make sure that you two can get a hold of it if something happens to me, but I hope none of us will ever see it again after that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Emiko and Alice took Tiffany and Pearl out to lunch, so that Nicole could talk to her mother in private.  \"We'll be nearby if you need us, Nic\", said Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lucy arrived, she was wearing loose-fitting clothing, so it was hard for Nicole to tell whether she might be pregnant or not. Lucy was only in her middle forties, so it would not be impossible. She had a haunted look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, sweetie\", she said, when Nicole answered the door. \"Can I come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Mommy, of course you can!\" said Nicole, ushering her mother in and guiding her over to where baby George lay in his crib.  \"Come in meet your grandson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a beautiful boy\", said Lucy. \"He reminds me of my father, somehow. Oh, baby, I've been so bad to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy collapsed into Nicole's arms in a storm of tears. Wordlessly, Nicole guided her mother to the couch, trying to comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, Mom, it's alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not! I've been such a hypocrite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, what do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pregnant! Three months pregnant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh</i>, thought Nicole, <i>so it's true.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, how does that make you a hypocrite?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't understand! The baby isn't your father's!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSniffling, Lucy tried to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've tried to put a good face on it for you, but your father and I have had a marriage in name only for many years. Maybe we never had one.  When I married your father, he was reasonably attractive and from the right sort of family, and was nice enough. I convinced myself that I could love him. I tried. He tried, we thought maybe having you would help, but even then, it didn't work.  Don't misunderstand me - we both love you, but we've never really loved each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I never knew. I mean, you weren't the closest couple ever, but I just thought you weren't very demonstrative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should have been an actress\", said Lucy. \"No, we definitely weren't the closest couple. Your father hasn't touched me - not that way - in years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then how - ?\" asked Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm morally certain that your father's been sleeping with his secretaries for years. He's been very discreet - never done anything that I would be able to confront him with. I wasn't that bothered by it, as long as he didn't embarass me. It wasn't as though he was giving them anything I wanted, and he always made sure you were taken care of. I thought about finding a lover for years, but for years I couldn't work up the nerve, until finally I met a man who really made me feel desired - as a woman, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you didn't think I really liked tennis all that much, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was astonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean - STEFAN? Your TENNIS PRO?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, dear\", said Lucy, quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUT, MOTHER -\", said Nicole, before biting her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and say it, dear, I've earned it. In fact, I'll say it with you: three, two, one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW COMMON!\" the two said, together, laughing. Lucy touched her daughter's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's the first time I've laughed in a month. So, now you see my hypocrisy. After berating you for carelessly letting yourself get pregnant, I did the same thing myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So\", said Nicole, \"My mother is human, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\", said Lucy. \"Annoying, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, does Daddy know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did he take it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you must understand - I knew - or suspected at least - when I was about a month along. I was in total denial, until I began to show. Even then, I could hide it from him - we've had separate bedrooms for years. But then one day last week, he happened to take a call from Doctor Grundy, who mentioned my pregnancy to him, assuming her already knew. Your father confronted me on it, and I admittted the truth. Anyway, he's divorcing me.  Not that he really cares that I slept with Stefan, this is just a convenient excuse for him. Our lawyers are thrashing it out. I'll get the house - he's already moved out - and I still have the money I brought into the marriage.  Maybe it's for the best. the only good thing to come out of my marriage is you, dear. And now little George, too, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Mom, I am sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, dear, but in alot of ways, I brought it on myself. If you ever do marry, do yourself a favor and marry for the right reasons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom. what will you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The best I can. Try to be a better mother to my second child than I was to my first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Mommy, you know that I love you\" said Nicole, embracing her mother. \"Whatever has gone on between us, don't ever doubt that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sat and discussed the situation together. After the others came back, Nicole and Lucy explained the situation to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When Mom gets closer to her term, I'm going to stay with her for a while.  If you guys are still here by that time, you'll have to live without me, I'm afraid. In fact, I'd be happy to have you stay here, so that the place wouldn't be empty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foursome discused the situation for quite some time. The next day, Nicole took the coin to her bank, and had it locked up in her safe deposit box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coin stayed locked up...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The next month, Sheila had a son, Louis Henry McKenzie, Louise had a son, Michael Arthur Carlson,  Debbie had a son, Martin Howard Jackson, and Angelica had a son, Vittorio Luigi D\u2019Abruzzi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few months after that, Emiko had her baby.  This time it was Alice\u2019s turn to be the concerned partner, although she did have help from Emi\u2019s mom, Rumiko, who flew in from Japan.  Emiko had a daughter, who she named Rumiko Alice Matsumoto, after her mother and best friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few months further on, the last of the \u201cChildren of the Coin\u201d were born.  Tiffany had a daughter, Brittany Angela Biltmore, Josie had a daughter, Andrea Phyllis McDonald, and Lucille had a daughter, Henrietta Jane Winters, Nicole\u2019s new baby sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice and Emiko lived with Nicole for a while. Eventually, they moved out and into a home of their own. They had their challenges, but they faced them well.  The women who knew about the coin \u2013 Nicole, Alice, Emiko, Sheila and Jean \u2013 kept the secret to themselves, not telling even their closest friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty years went by.  The children grew up, leading mostly pleasant lives.  They all were friends to one degree or another. They knew nothing of the coin, or of how it connected them.  However, somewhere across town, something was happening that would change the lives of them all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarl Van Dijn was a wealthy man, who had made a lot of money, some honestly, some dishonestly.  Right now, he had a problem. His wife had discovered that he\u2019d been cheating on her for years.  However, instead of simply seeking a divorce, she had quietly spent years gathering hard evidence of his illegal business dealings, and was now blackmailing him.  He would have cheerfully had her \u201deliminated\u201d, but she had the evidence in a safe deposit box in a bank, with orders for the information to be made public if she had an \u201caccident\u201d. He had high hopes that the man he was speaking to today would help him resolve this problem.  The man in question was an extraordinarily nondescript that Karl knew only as \u201cMister Eight\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I would like you to do\u201d, said Karl.   \u201cBreak into this bank\u2019s vault, and empty out as many of the safe deposit boxes as you can.   Bring me the contents of this one box.  In return, I will pay you your usual fee, plus a forty per cent bonus.  The contents of the other boxes will be yours to do with as you see fit.  Can you do it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill you do it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMister Eight took his leave.  Karl was not surprised that he did not ask why Karl wanted him to rob so many other boxes when he only wanted the contents of one.  Perhaps he understood that Karl believed that if only his wife\u2019s box was robbed, she would immediately suspect that he was behind it, but that if the entire vault was robbed, she might think it was a coincidence.  Probably Mister Eight didn\u2019t care what Karl wanted, as long as he was paid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later, the town was rocked by the news of a daring bank robbery.  Mister Eight and his team had carried out their assignment perfectly.   Karl received the contents of his wife\u2019s deposit box. Unfortunately for him, his wife was cleverer than he thought and had planned for this eventuality. Things went badly for Karl from then on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMister Eight didn\u2019t care.  Elsewhere, he and his teammates \u2013 Miss Softly, Uncle Intention and the Pomeranian -  divided up their fee, and sorted out the other items they had stolen. Some they set aside to sell, some they aside to keep, and others they disposed of.  Afterwards, as was their habit, they went to a park near the river and sat on a bench, looking into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, everything is sorted?\u201d, asked Mister Eight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s just one last thing I meant to ask you about\u201d, said Uncle Intention.  He held up the Coin of Gignerus \u2013 one of the boxes had been Nicole\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d, asked Mister Eight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs far as I can tell, it\u2019s someone\u2019s lucky charm or something. Dunno why it was in the bank, but people do lock up some odd stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMister Eight took the coin and looked at it, and then at Uncle Intention and the Pomeranian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEither of you want it?\u201d, he asked. They both shook their heads. He turned to Miss Softly.  \u201cHow about you?\u201d  She shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill looking at her, he asked himself, \u201cDo <b>I{/b{ want it?\u201d  He thought about it, and said:<br>\r\n</b></span></div></div>",

For some time after it was stolen, they watched the news closely, looking for reports of unusual pregnancies. As months passed with no signs of the coin being used, they relaxed a little.  Perhaps whoever had stolen it had discarded it , not knowing what it was, and somehow having avoided its influence.  On the other hand, perhaps the coin was biding its time, and would allow itself to be \u201cfound\u201d when it was ready\u2026 As it happened, 21 years after the birth of the youngest of the 16 \u201cChildren of the Coin\u201d, the Coin of Gignerus finally re-surfaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Von Steuben\u2019s private function rooms was reserved that night for a triple birthday party. Three young women \u2013 Brittany Biltmore, Henrietta Winters and Andrea McDonald \u2013 were all celebrating their 21st birthdays.  The party was hosted jointly by several of the attendees. George Winters, who was Henrietta\u2019s nephew (although he was a few months older than her) was there.  George was a tall, dark-haired young man  with suave good looks.Also present were Meg O\u2019Donnell, her aunt Jeannie O\u2019Donnell (who was about the same age as her niece), Bill Hayes, Rhi D\u2019Alphonse, Pearl Wang and Rumi Matsumoto (who had bene brought up as sisters), Zach Waterford-Harris, Lou McKenzie, Mike Carlson and Pat McCormack (who were all first cousins), Marty Jackson and Vito D\u2019Abruzzi.  None of them knew about the Coin of Gignerus, of course.  They had grown up in the same area, and their mothers all knew one another. They were not aware of any other connection.  Pearl and Rumi knew there was some mystery concerning their fathers.  Neither of them knew who their fathers were, and their mothers would never speak about them.  As it was, both of them looked so much like clones of their moms, they sometimes used to wonder if they <i>were</i> clones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that night, no one was thinking about such things. Everyone was in a mood to party hearty, and so they did. Large amounts of food and even larger amounts of alcohol were consumed. The organizers had anticipated this, and had made sure that everyone had some way of getting home safely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one was second to George when it came to drinking that night \u2013 he was Nicole Winters\u2019 son, after all, and she had been something of a party girl in her day.  By the end of the night, George was so drunk he could barely stand, He had a dim notion that he should get some fresh air, so he wandered outside.   He ambled along aimlessly, until he found himself near the river, right where Mister Eight and his associates had sat about a year previously.<br>\r\nStumbling over a rock, he fell to his knees on the riverbank, narrowly avoiding falling in. After vomiting copiously into the river, he dimly noticed something under his left hand. It was a weird coin of some kind. He managed to get to his feet and squinted at the coin in the moonlight.  Through a boozy fog, he realized that it wasn\u2019t money.  Beginning to feel dizzy, he flipped the coin away from him.

He wasn\u2019t in his own bedroom! As he looked around, he realized that he <i>was</i> in his own room, but it had been re-decorated! It looked like a young woman\u2019s room. When he tried to shift in the bed, he realized that he felt oddly heavy.  He looked at himself and saw that he was wearing a pink nightgown and that there were two heavy weights on his chest where a woman\u2019s breasts would be.

Reaching further down, he soon ascertained that his \u201cmanhood\u201d was gone, replaced by a vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn shock, he got out of the bed, and stumbled into the bathroom.  He nearly fell, the extra weight made him awkward.   Naked, he looked at himself in the bathroom mirror. Looking back at him was a pretty, dark-haired woman who might have been his sister. She was heavily pregnant.   At that moment, new memories began to float into his head, alongside the old ones.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia Petra Winters had had a similar life to George. She\u2019d had many of the same friends, and had similar experiences.  Seven months earlier, she\u2019d gotten drunk at one of Rhi D\u2019Alphonse\u2019s beach parties, over-celebrating her own 21st birthday.  That night, she\u2019d fallen into the arms of some guy she didn\u2019t even know, and had gotten pregnant.  When she\u2019d told her mother, Nicole had looked rueful, and had told Georgia the story of her own conception.    <br>\r\n(Although Georgia didn\u2019t know it,  Nicole had gone to the bank the next day,  and checked to see that the Coin was still safely locked away. At that time, it was, and Nicole decided that Georgia\u2019s pregnancy was just a natural occurrence. )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia had bene at the birthday party last night, but because she was pregnant, she hadn\u2019t had any alcohol, and had made an early night of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head whirling,  George suddenly felt quite nauseous, and threw up into the toilet.   As he cleaned himself up, he heard a knock on his bedroom door. It was his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeorgia, are you OK? Can I come in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, Mom\u201d, said George, and the higher, feminine tone of his voice freaked him out even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her daughter, standing naked in the bathroom with a panicked look on her face, Nicole became concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBaby, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d, asked Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMommy, I think I\u2019m going crazy\u201d, said George, tearfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole embraced her daughter, and led her back to her bedroom.  Helping her back into her nightgown, Nicole sat Georgia on her bed, sitting down next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBaby, tell Mommy all about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge told Nicole in the best detail that he could what had happened. To his surprise, his mother seemed to accept his story without question. She hugged him and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeorgia \u2013 George \u2013 I want you to know one thing. You are <i>not</i> crazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can you be so sure?  It almost sounds like you know what caused this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I do. Look, I\u2019ll tell you all about it, but I\u2019ve got to make some phone calls first.  Take a shower, and get dressed.  Then we can talk while we have some breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge did as his mother asked. It was easy to let the \u201cGeorgia\u201d side of him handle things like hair, dressing and make-up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he went downstairs, Nicole had prepared a light breakfast. Suddenly, he was famished. He and his mother ate and chatted about inconsequentialities.  A few minutes later, the doorbell rang, and his \u201cAunts\u201d Emiko and Alice came into the room. They had let themselves in, as they still had keys to the condo.   They all sat down together over coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole sighed, and then told George the story of the Coin, with Alice and Emiko chiming in to verify and amplify when needed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow\u201d, said George. \u201cThis is all too much to take in.  Even though it happened to me, it\u2019s still hard to believe. And there\u2019s no way to undo this? I\u2019m going to have to be Georgia for the rest of my life?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, dear\u201d, said Nicole. \u201cBut I think you are. It will be hard, I know, but I think you\u2019ll find that the new memories will start to seem \u2018senior\u2019 to the old ones after a while.  It might be easier to be \u2018Georgia\u2019 than you think. And George or Georgia, you\u2019re still my baby and I will always love you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks , Mom\u201d, said George, hugging his mother. \u201cI love you, too.  So be it, I\u2019ll be \u2018Georgia\u2019 as best I can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia hugged her mother again and kissed her on the cheek.  \u201cSo, what now?\u201d, she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you to show us as best you can where you found that coin last night. We have to try to find it if we can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four women drove down to the riverside. Georgia sat on the bench while Nicole, Alice and Emiko searched thoroughly as they could without attracting anyone\u2019s attention.  Georgia chatted with another expectant mother who happened by.  After an hour\u2019s search\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If you think you can come in here, not only not support me as my best friend throughout my entire pregnancy, but also keep insulting me, and then think you can use my bathroom as a personal vomit bucket then you've got another thing coming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me through!\" Betty tried to weakly protest as she felt another round of nausea course through her.

We're through!\" Nicole punctuated this declaration by giving Betty a light shove towards the door with her belly. Betty was unable to speak at the moment, but the look of hatred she sent Nicole sent a clear enough message as she hurriedly hobbled out of Nicole's place, moaning and clutching her aching belly all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after Betty had left her room for good, Nicole had finally noticed that in all the excitement that her unborn child had woken up and began to kick fervently.

She <i>really</i> needed to go shopping for some baby supplies soon, seeing as she only had a month left until her due date. She knew money wasn't an issue, as her father, being a total pushover when it came to his little girl, had set her up with a large amount to support both her and his grandchild. Her mom was an entirely different matter at first, but as time had went on she'd come to find that she found herself rather excited at the prospect of a grandchild as well, and so Nicole was on relatively good terms with her mom, though not as much as her dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she headed outside to go shopping at the mall, she noticed one thing was missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Where did the coin disappear to?

Deciding that she'd seen enough, the red head began walking back home whilst thinking up a plan of revenge on Nicole. <i>Because as much as I liked seeing her puke her guts out, it's still not enough!</i> She vehemently declared, not even noticing that she'd flipped the coin again and caused a nearby woman to question why her belly was beginning to balloon out at an alarming rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yup,</i> Betty vowed silently, <i>one day there's gonna be a reckoning, and its name is gonna be Nicole Winters...</i></span></div></div>",

Once there, she took off her jacket and shoes and looked at herself in her bathroom mirror. Her skin had definitely lost some color, which was a bit of a feat for someone who tanned as much as Nicole. Taking a deep breath, she stood up a little straighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm okay,\" Nicole said to herself. \"I'm okaUUGH!\" Immediately, Nicole turned around and dry heaved into the toilet, gripping the sides. After the wave of nausea left her body, she paused and spat out the last bit of bile that remained and walked back over to her mirror. \"Not okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole filled up a cup of water and washed her mouth out, trying to eliminate the barf taste and get rid of some of the bad breath. She walked back to her bed and stripped out of the rest of her clothes, save for her underwear, and slipped on a white t-shirt. As Nicole crawled into bed, she could hear her phone buzz in her pants on the floor. Groaning, Nicole reached down and picked it up. Scrolling through her phone's notifications, it was nothing but people writing on her Facebook event wall that they were excited to go to her birthday party in a little over a week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the throngs of nausea, Nicole was much less interested in what a bunch of people she didn't know wanted to do at her party. These things were always just excuses for people to drink and dance and it never mattered what the occasion was or whose party it was. As a pretty avid party-goer, she knew this first hand. Groaning again, Nicole rolled over and awkwardly put the phone back on her pants, before feeling another lump in the pocket. Reaching down, Nicole pulled it out, looking at it in what little light the room had. It was the same weird coin she'd seen and picked up earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, this thing is weird-looking,\" Nicole mumbled to herself, placing it on her bedside table. \"I'll have to show it to someone later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Nicole curled her blankets around her and settled into bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Dream---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music was pounding and the lights were flashing. Everyone was cheering and the DJ was throwing out promotional swag while a promoter sprayed the crowd with champagne. Then, everyone turned and cheered even louder. Out came Nicole, carried by four guys in a portable \"party throne.\" And what's more, she was massively pregnant, only wearing a white tube top and a miniskirt, her bare belly totally on display for everyone to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The party mama's here at last!\" Nicole yelled, raising a glass of her own. Of course, it was filled with sparking white grape juice to match the champagne everyone else had. The music got even more dancey as Nicole was brought to the center of the floor, the room opening up so she could be let down. Nicole reached her hand out daintily as someone from the audience helped her step down. Rubbing her big belly with one hand, Nicole smiled seductively as she walked to each of the four, handsome men who carried and gave them a kiss, running her hand down their muscular bodies as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out to the middle of the floor, everyone flooded in, men and women, to dance with her. Nicole soaked it up, wigging her belly around as she grinded against anyone she could, letting people rub and kiss her inflated womb. Reaching into a pocket in her skirt, Nicole got out some cream and rubbed it against her belly, giving it a sparkling shine, and then sprinkled glitter across her motherly orb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she danced, a younger girl, probably a teenager, walked up to her. \"Mom!\" she yelled, \"when are you going to be done here? I can't look after little Kimmy all night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you'll be fine looking after your little sister!\" Nicole said back, swinging her hips back and forth with another handsome party-goer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let me know when we can drive back,\" the girl said. Then, Nicole paused and gripped her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh...I think you'll need to drive me,\" Nicole said, turning to face her daughter. \"Because the baby is coming NOW-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"know, like, We! are never, ever! Getting back tog-\" Nicole reached down and turned off her phone's alarm clock, lamenting having set it in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" Nicole said, turning around in bed and sitting up. One nice thing she noticed is she no longer felt nauseous. In fact, she felt totally fine. A little sleepy maybe, but otherwise good. Her bra felt a little tighter, was all, but she probably just slept on her chest funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nicole picked her phone up to check the exact time, she noticed that she'd gotten a lot of texts over the night from one number. It was-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nicole grumbled and flipped through the texts. &lt;Please call us&gt; &lt;Tried calling. Please pick up&gt; They were all mostly the same message. Nicole sat up and wiped her mouth with her wrist as she dialed home. The phone rang a few times and then a voice came on the other end. \"Hello Nicole.\"<br>\r\n\"Hello Daddy,\" Nicole said, lying back and relaxing. \"You wanted to talk to me?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes. Are you alright? You don't sound too good.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, I just felt a little sick last night,\" Nicole said. Actually, now that she thought about it, Nicole was surprised that her nausea went away as quickly as it did. Sure, she'd gotten some rest but...that shouldn't be all.<br>\r\nHer father cleared his throat and sighed on the other end. \"Nicole, were you out drinking again last night? We've told you so many times-\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, calm down Daddy, I can handle myself. And besides, I wasn't out drinking. I just got nauseous and went to bed early but I'm fine now. Did you want to talk to me to do anything besides harassing me about having fun?\"<br>\r\n\"Actually, yes. Your mother and I have been talking for a while now and...while we're fine supporting you financially through school, we both feel that you need to start taking some responsibility as well. So, we're going to keep paying for your condominium and other big charges, but we also want you to...to get a job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole almost dropped the phone out of her hands. \"A job, Daddy? You can't expect me to-\"<br>\r\n\"You cannot keep dodging responsibilities like this!\" Her father said back sternly. Nicole had her father wrapped around her finger pretty well, but when he got upset with her, it really came out. Likely a result of how bottled up he kept his emotions. \"I worked in university. Your cousins all work while they're in college. Even Danielle has a good job now that she's out of school and it's thanks to the work and effort she put in over the past four years. It's important that you do the same.\"<br>\r\n\"But Daddyyyy,\" Nicole whined.<br>\r\n\"I-I just...here's your mother,\" Nicole's father said quickly.<br>\r\n\"No, Daddy, do not-\"<br>\r\n\"Hello, Nicole,\" a smug, feminine voice said on the other end.<br>\r\n\"Hello, Mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole Winters had a shaky relationship with her parents. Roger Winters, her father, was relatively easy to manipulate. He wasn't much for sharing his emotions or listening to other's problems, so one easy way to keep Nicole from interacting with him was to fund her various needs and wants (mostly wants). As the head of a successful PR company, the Winters made a sizable income, so it wasn't as if Nicole's pleas for a car or Spring Break trips were going to bankrupt the family, so Roger was always willing to oblige. One major downside that Nicole saw was that Roger was also a somewhat strict traditionalist, so when Nicole crossed boundaries that he didn't approve of (like making out with a member of the varsity swim team on his couch when she was a freshman in high school), he could really give her the riot act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucille Winters, on the other hand, was never particularly fond of indulging her daughter's activities. Lucille was never that great of a mother, and as she maintained quite nearly all of her young looks over her life, she would always remind her daughter how important it was to look nice. She even took a few stabs at Nicole every now and then over the fact that Lucille never got plastic surgery but still looked like, as Nicole overheard some of her male classmates say, a stone cold fox. Nicole did not care for her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, your father told you about our decision, I hear,\" Lucille smiled behind the receiver. Nicole couldn't see this, of course, but she could sense it.<br>\r\n\"Yes, and I think it's ridiculous.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, it would be nice if you could learn the value of a dollar, dear. And some work might give you something to do. You're a smart girl, aren't you? You can figure something out.\"<br>\r\n\"You know, I noticed that Daddy said <u>he</u> worked in university, but never said that you did,\" Nicole said, getting out of bed and putting her hand on her hip for emphasis. As she did so, Nicole noticed that her hips felt a little wider than before...and maybe a little pudgier.<br>\r\n\"Oh, Nicole, don't be so petty. It was a different time. Women weren't as encouraged to work as they are now,\" Lucille smiled, swirling the glass of mimosa in her hand. \"I know you approve of the steps we've taken since then. After all, I see the bills for your birth control prescription we pay for.\"<br>\r\nNicole was still pressing her hand against her midsection, definitely noticing that it was a bit bigger than before. \"Nicole?\"<br>\r\n\"I...I'll call you back. We'll talk more about this later. I need to start my day,\" Nicole stammered. \"Goodbye, Mother.\"<br>\r\n\"Goodbye Nico-\" Nicole switched her phone off and threw it onto the bed, groaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is just great,\" Nicole said, shaking her head. \"And more stress from a job isn't going to help put this extra weight off...I need to go to the gym.\" <br>\r\nPacking up her bag, Nicole headed to the local gym. It was a part of the nearby university, which gave Nicole a wide array of cute, young guys to check out while she exercised. Usually, Nicole wore a jogging top that covered up just her chest and upper torso, showing off plenty of middrift and cleavage. But since she felt a little...larger than usual, she opted for a white t-shirt instead, while still keeping her tight running pants. The extra weight gain seemed to give her breasts and ass considerable attention too, which Nicole was certainly not complaining about. It was nice to get some added volume there without taking another trip to the cosmetic surgeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole went for a few miles on the elliptical, still smiling and flirting with passing-by guys as she did. It felt good that she could still turn so many heads and she was concerned less with her new weight gain. Although, truthfully, she felt much more tired than she normally did on the machine. As she finished up and was wiping down, one of the students who worked at the gym walked over to her. He was a tall, handsome guy with his hair shaved down almost to the skull and some fair facial stubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, nice job there. Most girls your size don't go that long on the machine,\" he said with a smile.<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, I come here a lot,\" Nicole smiled back. \"I like to keep my body nice and flexible.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" The guy said, nodding and grinning curiously. \"I'm Marcus.\"<br>\r\n\"Nicole,\" she said, moving her hair back gently. \"I'm having a 21st birthday party in a little over a week. Maybe I'll see you there.\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Marcus nodded again. <br>\r\n\"Sorry buddy, she's not interested,\" someone said from next to Nicole. She turned and saw the worst possible person: her ex-boyfriend Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chris, what are you-\"<br>\r\n\"She's not seeing anyone right now. That's what she keeps telling me!\" Chris said, throwing his hands up in the air. He was tall and handsome too, his chestnut hair down to his ears and a much thicker 5 o'clock shadow on his face. \"Besides,\" Chris said, raising his voice. \"She doesn't like black guys.\"<br>\r\n\"Chris, what the fuck!\" <br>\r\n\"I'll see you later,\" Marcus said, waving to Nicole and rolling his eyes at Chris. As soon as he turned his back, Nicole turned around and shoved Chris hard.<br>\r\n\"Seriously, what the fuck!\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, you told me you didn't want to go out with me because you were focusing on yourself. What gives?\"<br>\r\n\"We went out, Chris. It didn't work. I don't want to see you anymore,\" Nicole hissed back at him before pushing him out of her way.<br>\r\n\"See you at your 21st!\" Chris yelled back. Nicole scoffed and rolled her eyes, heading home immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she showered, Nicole closed her eyes and tried to think of something positive to get her mind off of the awful day so far. One positive is that, as she showered, Nicole could tell that her breasts had definitely gotten bigger.<br>\r\n\"I'll have to ask Daddy to pay for some new bras,\" she smiled, before frowning again. \"Or does he want me to pay for them with a 'job.' This is such bullshit.\"<br>\r\nClimbing out of the shower, Nicole decided to visit Betty and get better that way. They could drink, smoke weed, and gossip. That was always a fun way to kill time. Nicole got dressed, putting on a sweater to cover up some of her perceived doughiness and drove her Mercedes over to Betty's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, that sucks!\" Betty said as Nicole told her the story. \"So what are you going to do?\"<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" Nicole whined, muting the TV as \"Guy Code\" switched to a commercial. \"You're lucky that your parents still let you do what you want.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, besides making me go to college,\" Betty scoffed, spitting out her gum into a tissue. \"But that's not so bad, I guess. Plenty of good-looking guys on campus.\"<br>\r\n\"Mmm, yeah,\" Nicole smiled.<br>\r\n\"I'm going to get some beers. You want one, I'm guessing?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" Nicole said. \"It is not too early to drink for me today.\" Betty laughed and stood up, walking into the kitchen, bending over and looking through the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole felt a strange voice in her head. She noticed that her hand was in her pocket, fingers wrapped around...something. Pulling it out, it was the same coin she found yesterday. <i>I don't remember taking you with me</i>, Nicole thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole shrugged and flipped the coin, catching it as she looked over at Betty by the fridge.

There's something called balance, maybe try it sometime,\" Nicole said, approaching Betty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty didn't respond, as she placed a hand on her midriff.  Suddenly, her flat stomach began to slowly push outwards.  Betty pulled up her shirt, as her belly increasingly began to round out, passing the five months mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betty, what the fuck did you eat?\" Nicole asked, her eyes widening at the same rate that Betty's stomach did. Betty remained silent, and could only watch in horror as her stomach continued to grow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the growth stopped, giving Betty the appearance of a woman eight months pregnant, popped-out belly button and all.  \"I don't think I've ever seen bloating that bad before, damn.\" Nicole said, placing a hand to Betty's stomach, obviously oblivious to her friend's impending motherhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she felt the tautness of her Betty's round belly, she pulled her hand away.  \"Nicole, I don't think this is fucking bloating, okay?!\" Betty shouted in annoyance.  \"Why not?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I feel something moving.  In here.\" Betty said, placing a hand on her belly. \"Wait, so you're saying that you're pregnant?  We gotta get you to the hospital!\" Nicole said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me?  I'm not going out like this!  Just call Dr. Anderson and get him to do a house call!\" she pleaded, rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Nicole and Betty's families were close, they shared the same doctor.  Nicole grabbed her cell phone and dialed the doctor's office number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Anderson's office how may I help you?\" the secretary asked.  \"Hi, this is Nicole Winters.  Can I speak to Dr. Anderson please?\"she asked.  \"Dr. Anderson is currently in an appointment right now.  Would you like to leave a message?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  This is an emergency.  I need to talk to him right now.\" Nicole pleaded to the secretary.  \"Fine.  Hold on a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of waiting, the doctor picked up.  \"Nicole?  Is everything okay?\" he asked.  \"Uhm...something...happened to Betty.  You need to get here right away.\"  \"What happened?  Is she alright?\" he asked, with a tone of concern.  \"I can't explain it, really.  Just get here now.\" Nicole said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, okay.  I'll be right there,\" he said, hanging up the phone.  Nicole glanced at Betty, who was rubbing her belly.  Seeing this reminded Nicole of her own recent weight gain.  She went into the bathroom to see if she had grown at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the bathroom door, she pulled up her sweater and saw her belly.  It was slightly bigger than it was this morning, giving her the appearance of a woman three months pregnant.  The doorbell rang as she pulled down her sweater, confused at her midsection's slight growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole pulled Betty off the ground (a tough feat, all things considered), and ushered her towards the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole opened the door, and was greeted by Dr. Anderson, a grey-haired, bespectacled man in his early 50s.  Nicole knew Dr. Anderson on a personal level, as he had directed her to a few of the finest plastic surgeons i the area. \"Hey, Nicole.  Where's Betty?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole led him into the living room, and saw Betty sitting on the couch.  \"Oh my god!  Betty!\" he said, in utter shock.  \"What happened?\"  Nicole and Betty told Dr. Anderson what had happened, and he was clueless as to what had caused it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...this just doesn't make sense to me.  Betty, when was the last time that you had sex?\" he asked her.  \"A few weeks ago, but he used protection and I'm on the pill--I....don't know what's happening to me....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Betty could you lie down for a second?\" he asked her.  Betty lifted her legs up and lay on the couch, her large belly weighing her down.  Dr. Anderson felt around her belly.  \"Those are definitely kicks...\"he said.  He pressed a stethoscope to Betty's rounded middle, and was able to hear an extra heartbeat or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Betty, it would appear that you are pregnant.  Around 7-8 months I'm guessing.  Now, I'd like to run an ultrasound on you to really know what we're dealing with.  My next available appointment is two days from now.  Is that okay?\" he asked.  Betty nodded.  As Dr. Anderson walked out of the door, both of the girls' stomachs grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey decided to...</span></div></div>",

I'm pretty hungry too, so you don't have to be the only one pigging out. Besides, if you really are...pregnant, then you can always use that as an excuse to eat more.\" Nicole turned over and smiled at her friend. \"You don't have to be fat like me.\"<br>\r\nBetty rolled her eyes. \"Nicole, you aren't fat. You look hot. You always look hot.\" Betty rubbed Nicole's shoulders slowly. \"You're a sexy bitch, okay?\"<br>\r\nNicole scoffed. \"Yeah, yeah. Here, I'll order us something to eat. You won't have to leave the house and let anyone see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty complained silently as she rubbed her belly, looking at the massive ball of flesh with concern. After all, what was she supposed to do when she <u>did</u> have to leave the house and let people see her? Nicole pulled out her phone and scrolled through the take-out places she knew about. Then, a weird wave of hunger hit her. A very specific wave of hunger. At that moment, Nicole absolutely wanted Chinese food and would not rest until she got it. In no time, she dialed the Peking Palace and ordered a few boxes of lo mein, a few boxes of sweet and sour pork, and a box of pea pods. Betty raised her eyebrows when Nicole hung up the phone. \"Wow, you really do make me want to feel better.\"<br>\r\nNicole blushed. \"I said I was hungry, geez,\" she said quietly. Despite both being pretty shallow and bitchy people, Nicole and Betty remained close friends. They knew each other as little kids, both of their parents knowing each other at their local country club. The two of them had gone through scores of friends individually, but Nicole and Betty had always remained together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole sat next to Betty on the couch, smiling at her compassionately. \"So...what's it feel like?\"<br>\r\nBetty sighed and stroked her bare skin. There was plenty sticking out, her original top barely fitting her in the first place. \"It's not <b>terrible</b>, I guess. It doesn't hurt or anything. It's just really, really tight and I feel full. Like I just ate a shit load. And I can...you know...feel moving inside.\"<br>\r\nNicole nodded quietly. \"Can I feel?\"<br>\r\nBetty shrugged and rolled her shirt up some more. Nicole slowly put her hand down onto the slope of belly. Betty was right: it was unbelievably tight, but also a little soft. And warm, of course. Betty let out a little sigh. \"It feels kind of nice when you rub.\" Taking her cue, Nicole moved her palm all around Betty's belly. <br>\r\nNicole giggled and smiled back at her friend. Then, an image from last night's dream flashed through her head and Nicole moved her hand away. \"S-so, are you still going to go to class?\"<br>\r\nBetty shrugged again and threw her arms down. \"I dunno. I guess I have to, right? If I have to actually give birth to a baby...or two, I'll need a job or something and I'll need a college degree for that.\" Betty sighed again, wrapping her arms around her new baby bump. \"My parents can help support me too...if they don't cut me off because of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole frowned and moved her hand back to her friend's belly. \"Can't you explain how this just sort of happened?\"<br>\r\nBetty scoffed. \"If I told you I just 'became' pregnant, would you believe me?\" Nicole thought about it. Betty had a point.<br>\r\n\"Are you going to tell them?\"<br>\r\n\"I'll have to at some point,\" Betty said, patting her massive belly. \"I mean, look at me. If I don't tell them, they'll just figure it out on their own.\"<br>\r\n\"Well...I'll give you whatever help I can,\" Nicole said. Betty looked back at her friend, giving her a little smile.<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Nicky.\" Nicole smiled back, blushing a little, and the two rubbed Betty's belly and laughed at the little kicks and movements they felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sitting around like this for a while, the doorbell rang, echoing through the house. Nicole turned her legs and got off the couch, walking up the the front door. The delivery boy handed Nicole the food, smiling as he looked over her face and her ample chest. Nicole was used to being looked over like this. Hell, she dressed to encourage it. And her breasts had definitely gotten a little bigger lately. Nicole flashed him a polite smile and handed him the money and a tip as she took the food back. \"Alright Betty, let's eat until I look like you.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nicole and Betty ate vigorously, not caring about appearance or manners. Noodles, chicken, pea pods, everything was chewed and gulped down in a flash. Betty watched Nicole in almost awe as she kept working her way through a box of noodles, finishing off, belching, and then opening up the next box. \"Wow Nicky. I'm pregnant. What's your excuse?\" Betty laughed. Nicole turned to her friend with cheeks full of noodles, looking at her sadly. \"Just kidding, geez,\" Betty said, rubbing Nicole's shoulders. \"But really, I've never seen you eat like this before.\"<br>\r\nNicole slurped down her present mouthful and shrugged. \"Maybe it's stress-eating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pair worked down to their last mouthful, Nicole's phone started buzzing. She picked it up and rolled her eyes. \"My dad. Hang on.\" Nicole walked into Betty's bathroom and sat down on the bath's rim before answering the call. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n\"Hello Nicole,\" Roger Winters said on the other end. \"Good news. I was able to find you a possible job in the area.\"<br>\r\nNicole groaned. \"So you're really going to put me through this, Daddy?\"<br>\r\nHer father cleared his throat. \"Now Nicole, I put my neck out trying to secure you this job. I cashed in some favors getting you a position as a receptionist at an office. It's part-time so you won't be there all day and the work's not too hard. This should be a good opportunity for you.\"<br>\r\nNicole sighed again, leaning back slightly, pouting out her lips. \"So just like that? You're so nice, Daddy.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to continue funding you, so you can quit that act right now, Nicole.\"<br>\r\n\"Urgh, Daddy!\"<br>\r\n\"Your mother is already upset with me for finding you a job and not forcing you to do the job hunting yourself. Give it a try, will you?\"<br>\r\nNicole rolled her eyes. \"Fine. When do I start?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, you still have to interview for the position on Monday, and if they accept you, you'll start Tuesday.\"<br>\r\n\"Interview?\" Nicole almost yelled.<br>\r\n\"You'll do fine, Nicole. We can talk more at dinner tonight. You're coming over, aren't you? Your cousins are stopping by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's cousins. She knew exactly which ones he meant. Jenny, Stacy, and Rachel Winters. All the good looks and money that come with being a part of the Winters family, with added smugness and success. Each one had a strong start on their career and would always come to her house along with their parents to talk about how great their lives are. Rachel was engaged to a man set to be valedictorian at his law school, Stacy was a firey businesswoman who just got promoted to chief of her division at a massive software company, and Jenny, the smuggest of all (in Nicole's mind) was a news anchor and local celebrity. Nicole couldn't stand them and it didn't help that her parents constantly reminder her how close in age she was to all of them and how much they were managing to accomplish. Lucille Winters would also slyly throw in that they all look amazing and none of them had ever gotten plastic surgery. Of course, Nicole still thought she was much hotter than any of them and she was convinced that Jenny had some kind of work done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll be home tonight,\" Nicole sighed. Saturday night and she was having dinner with her relatives. Well, she could probably still catch some pretty good parties afterward. The good ones didn't get going until late. \"We'll talk more then.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay. Love you, honey,\" her father said unemphatically, hanging up the phone. Nicole pulled the phone away from her ear quickly and let out a long groan.<br>\r\n\"Okay in there?\" Betty asked. She opened the door slowly, her belly peeking out through the crack.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine. I have to eat dinner with my stupid, stuck-up cousins tonight and I've got a job interview Monday,\" Nicole said.<br>\r\n\"Well, at least you don't have to go look for a job,\" Betty said, rubbing her belly listlessly. <br>\r\n\"Why do you keep going that?\" Nicole asked.<br>\r\n\"Doing what?\" Betty responded. Nicole pointed to her rubbing hands and Betty quickly stopped, her whole face turning red. \"T-they just sort of do that on their own...\"<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" Nicole said, walking up and putting her hands on Betty's unexpected pregnant bump. \"I guess it is kind of fun.\" The two of them stood in the bathroom doorway as Nicole played with her friend's swollen womb.<br>\r\n\"Oof, let me through,\" Betty said after a while. Nicole looked at her inquisitively. \"I think they're...kicking my bladder. I have to pee really bad.\" Nicole blushed and got out of her friend's way, the door closing behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued to spend time together for about an hour, watching MTV and eating whatever Chinese food was leftover. Betty continued to rub her belly in small circles, every now and then letting out a little \"oh\" of surprise as her little ones kicked her. As the program ended, the credits for the next one started up. \"Sixteen and Pregnant.\"<br>\r\n\"Ugh, turn it off,\" Betty complained, waving her hand toward Nicole. Nicole obliged her, switching the TV off. \"At least those girls got to prepare for nine months to have a baby. How many weeks do you think I've got? One? A day?\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, it'll be alright,\" Nicole said, sitting close to her friend. \"I'm sure you've got time. You're not that big.\"<br>\r\n\"Liar.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, so you're huge, but when you go to the doctor, I'm sure things will be clearer. And your family's loaded so at least you'll be able to support the...the...\"<br>\r\n\"Babies. You can say babies in front of me, it's okay,\" Betty mumbled. \"And what am I supposed to do until then? I can't go to class like this! I can't go to parties! I won't be able to get laid.\"<br>\r\n\"I dunno about that, there's some guys who might be into pregnant girls,\" Nicole said. \"Besides...it looks like pregnancy gave you some bigger tits.\" She gently prodded Betty's engorged chest.<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Betty said, covering her breasts with her hands, her face turning red.<br>\r\n\"Look, it'll...it'll be okay. Just let me know if anything changes,\" Betty said, looking at her phone. \"Shit, I have to go. Keep me in the loop, okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Betty said quietly, heaving herself up to give Nicole a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole drove home and changed into something a little dressier and without any soy sauce stains. After some consideration, she put on a larger outfit that covered up some of her new weight gain. She was sure her mother would bring it up in front of everyone at the dinner table if she didn't take some sort of precaution. Driving to her parent's house, she pulled into the wide driveway, already filled with two cars and a board. The house itself was almost like a mansion: three stories with cut rock on the foundation and a huge, manicured lawn on the front. Nicole walked down the winding path with arranged stones and various fresh flowers to the front door and rung the doorbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole automatically reached into her pocket and pulled out the strange coin. <i>What am I doing</i>? she wondered to herself as she gave the coin a flip, catching it on her hand as the front door opened to reveal her-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nicole looked back at her mother and saw an astonishing sight. Lucille's mid-section began to swell and swell, just like it had for Betty, until Lucille appeared to be an overdue pregnant woman. She had been wearing dark pants and a light red blouse. Her outfit now strained to confine Lucille's incredible pregnant belly. Nicole's eyes bugged out of her head.<br>\r\n\"Mom...you're-\"<br>\r\n\"Nicole, honestly, hurry inside,\" Lucille said, resting her hands on her belly. \"We're all ready for dinner. I know you think starving yourself will keep you in shape but no one wants a girl who's too skinny, now get in here. You're acting like a child and I don't need any more of those.\" Lucille's left hand stroked the side of her belly almost by instinct at her last line.<br>\r\nNicole gripped her fists tightly. \"Jesus, Mother! Can you lay off me for one second? What happened to you?\"<br>\r\nLucille let out a long sigh. \"Nicole Shosanna Winters, we are not having a discussion about my <b>pregnancy</b> right now, do you understand me? We've had a thousand of these talks already.\"<br>\r\nNicole walked inside the house, if only to get a better look at her mother's belly. \"A thousand talks? What are you talking about? I mean...is this something that's happening to lots of people? The same thing happened to Betty a few hours ago.\"<br>\r\n\"What happened to Betty?\" Roger Winters asked as he walked into the foyer. \"Hello Nicole, glad you made it. Ready to eat?\"<br>\r\nNicole was stunned and hesitated on the next syllables out of her mouth when she heard a chorus of voices come into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that Nicole?\" Jenny said as she, Rachel, and Stacy walked into the room, each of them smiling and laughing. Jenny scooped Nicole up in a hug before setting her back down and looking her in the eye. \"I haven't seen you in so long!\"<br>\r\n\"Like a month,\" Nicole replied quietly. Jenny was a gorgeous blonde, about the same height as Nicole with a toned body, nice chest, and radiant, clear skin. Her cheeks were also pretty big and it gave her adorable dimples. <br>\r\n\"Well, let's eat!\" Stacy said eagerly, rubbing her hands together. \"Sorry Mom and Dad couldn't make it tonight, they had a charity ball Dad had to attend for work, but they both gave their regards.\" Stacy was just as gorgeous as Jenny, but quite a bit taller than her, with a dark beauty mark above her lip and jet-black hair tied in a bun.<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm starving,\" Rachel laughed. \"I had a dance class today to get ready for the wedding and it takes a lot out of you.\" Surprise, surprise: Rachel was a stone cold fox as well. Her long brown hair was wavy and draped over her shoulders nicely and she had the most piercing blue eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Nicole had even seen a surrealist movie in her life, she'd have a pretty good measuring stick for the dinner. Here, she was stuck with some of the most irritating and overbearing people she knew, all of them talking and laughing in her ear, but the entire time, Nicole was distracted by the impossibility of her mother's sudden pregnancy. Especially because no one was taking it as a surprise! They all acted like Lucille had been pregnant for, well, about nine months! Hell, more than that by the look of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Rachel broke the silence when it came to Lucille's pregnancy. \"You know, Aunt Lucille, you've really made me less afraid about having children of my own with Peter.\" Lucille smiled as she took a sip of water. (That was another shock to Nicole: her mother wasn't on her second glass of wine at this point in the meal. She <i>had</i> to be pregnant to stop that.)<br>\r\nJenny laughed. \"Peter's already talking about having kids? Man, he's something else!\" The two sisters giggled as Nicole took another big scoop of food and shoved it in her mouth rudely. Despite the big meal at Betty's, Nicole still felt voracious.<br>\r\n\"Nicole, please, show some manners. Why did we put you in those cotillion classes?\" Lucille said, setting her glass down.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Aunt Lucille isn't even eating like that and she has three mouths to feed!\" Stacy laughed.<br>\r\n\"Three?\" Nicole said, turning back to her mother.<br>\r\n\"Nicole, I swear your memory is so spacey sometimes,\" Roger said, shaking his head. \"Yes, your mother is having twins.\"<br>\r\n\"And we're not going to spoil them so much this time,\" Lucille said, her comment directed right at Nicole.<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know about that,\" Roger laughed, turning to his nieces. \"I might spoil these kids even more than I did Nicole.\"<br>\r\nThe four of them laughed while Nicole glared back at her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Stacy, you have a pretty big presentation next week, I hear,\" Roger said, interrupting another period of silence in the dinner conversation.<br>\r\n\"Yes, it'll be my first major action as the division chief and the upper management will be there. It should really determine my place in the company,\" Stacy smiled.<br>\r\n\"Well, I have plenty of business experience, so I can give you any help you need,\" he responded, turning to Jenny. \"And I hear you're hosting a big event next week as well?\"<br>\r\nJenny smiled. \"Yes, well, I'll be at the state fair and there should be some pretty interesting things going on there. Saying I'm \"hosting\" it might be a bit of a stretch, but I'll be doing most of my news station's coverage.\"<br>\r\nRoger beamed, turning to Nicole. \"Big events all around. And Nicole, you'll be interviewing for a new job next week too!\"<br>\r\nNicole forced a smile, not wanting to be outdone by her cousins. \"Yes, and I think I'll have a good shot at it.\"<br>\r\nLucille laughed as she took a sip of water, making a loud sound. \"I'm sorry, I just coughed,\" she said with a grin. \"Please, continue dear.\"<br>\r\n\"You know...I think I need to be excused for a moment,\" Nicole said, standing up and dropping her napkin on the plate. Nicole stormed into the bathroom and screamed loudly. \"Who does that...that knocked-up cow think she is? Oh, I'm not pretty enough or successful enough? Well, you know what I'm not? Pregnant in my fucking 50s!\" Nicole paused and thought about it again. \"Wait...wait...how is she pregnant anyway? I mean...she wasn't when I got here...or did I really just forget? Maybe seeing Betty just confused me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole walked back to the dining room, trying to look as composed and confident as she could.<br>\r\n\"Everything alright?\" Jenny asked in an innocent tone, batting her eyelids.<br>\r\n\"Oh yes,\" Nicole smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything's fine,\" Nicole said as she caught the coin, looking up at Jenny.</span></div></div>",

All of the levity that had been on her face was gone and Nicole took notice. The obnoxiously happy Winters sister was now a shy, worried woman. Nicole noticed that she didn't look quite as pretty as she did before either, but then she noticed why: Rachel's face was turning pale too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I think I need to be excused as well,\" Rachel said, holding her hand over her mouth and rushing to the bathroom. A muffled \"Move over, sis\" came from behind the door, followed by a second round of vomiting sounds, asynchronous with Jenny's. Nicole should have been thinking about the coincidence that all three of them were experiencing sudden nausea in such a short time-span. And it's not like she didn't notice. But Nicole was more preoccupied on the glee of watching her two peppy, better-than-you cousins fighting over the same toilet bowl to barf in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Good...</span> the voice seemed to cackle in Nicole's head.

Is it food poisoning? Lucille, how do you feel?\"<br>\r\nLucille Winters rubbed her massive pregnant belly slowly and sighed. \"Well, my stomach feels a little odd, but I tally that up to the two fetuses kicking and moving around in here.\" Lucille grinned and took another sip of water. \"But other than that, I feel fine.\"<br>\r\n\"Well I don't feel anything either,\" Roger said, turning to Nicole. \"Didn't you say you felt nauseous yesterday, Nicole?\"<br>\r\nShe nodded. \"Yeah, but I feel fine now.\"<br>\r\nAs Roger turned to Stacy, a little grin spread across her lips. \"How about you, Stacy?\"<br>\r\nThe grin spread. \"Well Uncle Roger, I feel a little odd too, but I took some medication in preparation.\"<br>\r\n\"Preparation...of what?\" Roger puzzled. Stacy's grin turned into a full-blown smile.<br>\r\n\"Preparation for morning sickness.\" Lucille's grin started to fade as she stared at her niece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel and Jenny walked out of the bathroom slowly, each covered in sweat and taking deep breaths. \"Morning sickness?\" Jenny asked. \"You mean, like...\"<br>\r\nStacy bit her lip and nodded eagerly. \"Yup. I already told Mom and Dad but...I'm pregnant!\"<br>\r\nJenny let out an enthusiastic but exhausted squeal and ran over, scooping her sister up in a big hug. \"Ohmigod! Ohmigod! Ohmigod!\" Rachel had a surprised look just like Roger, Lucille, and Nicole, but she still went over and joined in the group hug.<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright,\" Lucille said, heaving herself out of her seat, jutting her own pregnance forward. \"I'm happy for you too, Stacy, but what exactly is your plan? Is the father in the picture?\"<br>\r\nStacy shook her head. \"No, it was...unplanned, Aunt Lucille,\" she said, placing her hand over her own flat stomach (flatter than Nicole's right now, our hero noticed with envy). \"But, I have a very stable and high-paying job. And this is the modern way now. There's another woman at the company who was single but got pregnant through artificial insemination and she still managed to move up into one of the vice-president positions while caring for her one-year old.\" <br>\r\n\"Well, this is a happy occasion, anyhow,\" Roger said, getting up and joining in the big hug. Jenny looked over and smiled at Nicole.<br>\r\n\"C'mon cuz, join in!\" <br>\r\nNicole slowly walked over and hugged her family members, feeling her mother's pregnant belly rub against her on one side and Rachel's vomit breath on the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the family decided to call it quits on the dinner. Two episodes of vomiting and a pregnancy announcement would do that to a meal. Everyone continued to hug and talk to Stacy as they left. Nicole rolled her eyes, annoyed by the whole scene. Now Stacy's success would not only be rubbed in her face, but the fact that she's working at a great job while also caring for a new baby would be a deadly weapon of low self-confidence in Lucille's hands. Nicole looked over at her mother and shuddered to think about how much she'd rub her own pregnancy into Nicole's face. Especially how good she still looked despite being over 50 and pregnant with twins...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole and her parents were the last ones in the house and Nicole flipped through her phone, looking for messages from Betty. \"Well, I should be going,\" Nicole said, exhausted by the whole night, especially the two sudden pregnancies in her friend and mother.<br>\r\n\"We'll talk to you in the morning, Nicole,\" Roger said. \"I want to make sure everything goes well for you at the interview.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, you'll certainly need the help,\" Lucille smiled, wrapping her hands around her belly. Nicole scowled and headed out the door.<br>\r\n\"We'll talk, Daddy,\" she spat as she closed the door behind her, swearing from the steps to her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole got home and collapsed into her bed, groaning loudly. \"Here's to a better day tomorrow,\" she said, peeling out of her clothes and running her hands over her slight paunch. \"And hopefully, more work to get rid of this fat.\" And with that, Nicole fell into a deep, tired sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Nicole had another dream where she boasted a massive pregnant belly. This time, she was wearing maternity lingerie as two, large hands caressed her from behind.<br>\r\n\"Mmm, Marcus,\" she moaned, wiggling her ass around her lover's crotch. Marcus smiled and pushed against Nicole, rubbing her belly lovingly.<br>\r\n\"Our kids are growing big, huh?\" he said, kissing her on the ear.<br>\r\n\"Yes, I can't wait for you to put another litter in there. Maybe more next time,\" Nicole purred. Suddenly, the door opened and Lucille, Jenny, Rachel, and Stacy all marched into the room angrily, each with their own big pregnant belly.<br>\r\n\"Hey! Get away from the father of my children!\" Jenny barked, pointing at Nicole. <br>\r\n\"W-what?\" Nicole said, the dream world starting to shift all around her. Rachel, Stacy, and even Lucille all nodded.<br>\r\n\"Yes, he got me pregnant first,\" Lucile said. \"Of course he would. I'll always look better than you.\" Lucille clutched her belly and smiled. \"And I'm even going into labor before you. I'll be a mother again before you!\"<br>\r\n\"No! I'll get these babies out first!\" Nicole yelled, pushing hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole woke up in her bed, muttered about babies. She looked around quickly, vaguely remembering the dream but still feeling like it was so vivid that it must be real. Nicole pulled the sheets off and noticed something with a groan. She looked even fatter today. In fact, she looked like she had a full-on pot belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" Nicole whined, falling back into bed when she heard a few knocks at her front door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Nicole?\" A muffled voice said. \"It's-</span></div></div>",

I can't let him see me like this!</i> she thought referring to her pot belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole puttered into the kitchen (while she noticed that her increase in weight had slightly altered her walk), and began to fiddle with the cabinets and stove, to make it appear that she was busy.  \"Um-door's open!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris opened the door, and entered the living room.  \"Nicole? I'd like to talk to you for a second,\" he said.  \"In the kitchen,\" Nicole mumbled, a hint of nervousness in her voice.  Nicole opened the pantry, appearing to look for food, her back facing Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Nicole, I'm sorry for the way that I acted at the gym, but the guy had it coming!  I mean, he can't just come up to you and immediately be your boyfriend!  Shit, I worked years for that, Nicole!\" he shouted, exasperated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's NOT my boyfriend.  I just met they guy, Chris!  It's not a big deal that he's going to my party!\" Nicole said.  Staring at the food in the pantry made her very hungry, as the audible growl from her stomach showed.  Again, she had garnered some odd cravings.  She grabbed the jar of pickles, and also grabbed a jar of Nutella.  Nicole began to eat this disgusting combination ravenously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if he's not your boyfriend, then you should take me back.  I've changed, Nicole.  For real this time.\" he said.  Nicole finished chewing.  \"Chris, this is the fifth time you've told me this.  Sorry, it's not gonna happen.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you at least look at me?\" he asked.  He grabbed her shoulder and spun her around.  \"Nicole, what the fuck?\" he yelled, finally getting a look at her swollen belly, which was roughly the size of a woman five months pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did that dick at the gym do this to you?  I swear to god...Wait, wait...is it mine?\" he asked.  \"What?  No, no, no.  I'm not pregnant, Chris! For fuck's sake, I've just put on some weight.\" she said, covering her belly with her arms.  \"Well, you might want to go to the gym more, because you honestly look pregnant!\" he said.  \"Ok, asshole.  Get the fuck out!\" she yelled, shoving him out of the door, slamming it shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So insensitive...\" she said, absentmindedly rubbing her belly.  Returning to her bedroom, she removed her tank top and looked at herself in the mirror.  \"He is right, though.  I do look pregnant...\" she said, poking her stomach, noticing that it was still hard.  Nicole decided that she needed to go to the gym.  She put on a pair of yoga pants and the sweater she donned yesterday.  To her horror, her belly was clearly visible.  \"Shit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole grabbed her car keys and left the house.  Entering her car, she realized that her belly was pressing into the steering wheel.  She adjusted the seat, and took off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her way, she recieved a call.  It was from...</span></div></div>",

It was a big enough hassle having her father try to talk to her again, especially after the miserable family interactions she'd had the past day, but she had really hoped Betty had gotten a hold of her. Ideally to tell Nicole that the whole sudden pregnancy was just a weird bout of indigestion or kidney stones or...something. Pregnancy seemed to be following Nicole wherever she went. Her mother and Betty turned from regular women into baby-filled blimps in the blink of an eye and Stacy gave her big announcement at dinner last night. And Chris' obnoxious comment certainly didn't help either...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Daddy?\" Nicole said, putting her phone on speaker. Obviously, the college town had restrictions on cell phone usage while driving, but Nicole was pretty accustomed to getting and doing what she wanted. Although given her present condition, she should have been more concerned with her motor safety.<br>\r\n\"Hello Nicole,\" Roger Winters said. \"You left dinner pretty soon last night so I didn't get to talk to you about the job interview.\"<br>\r\n<i>Right, that</i>, Nicole remembered with a grumble. \"Yeah, well, dinner got pretty weird. Everyone started barfing and Stacy and Mother suddenly announced that they were pregnant.<br>\r\nRoger chuckled in confusion. \"Well, Stacy certainly did, but you know that your mother's been pregnant for quite some time. I wouldn't say she just dropped that news on us last night.\"<br>\r\nNicole rolled her eyes. \"Okay, I wish you would both stop saying that to me. Is this some sort of prank as punishment? I'm going to the interview, isn't that enough?\"<br>\r\nRoger paused. \"I'm not sure what you're talking about, but good to hear about the interview.\" Damn, Nicole had inadvertently handed her father a perfect segue. \"I emailed you the exact time and address so you've got it down exactly. I know the people doing the interviewing and you should be fine.\"<br>\r\n\"People...plural?\" Nicole asked. This was turning out a little scarier than she'd expected.<br>\r\n\"Yes, three of the office's department heads will need to talk to you for the position. The manager, the head of HR, and the head of administrations. But you'll do fine. You'll be a fine receptionist.\"<br>\r\n\"A receptionist?\" Nicole said with a raised eyebrow, pulling into the gym. \"You made it sound like I would have a position with a little more flair, like a secretary.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't look at it that way, Nicole,\" Roger said on the other end. It was clear that he was trying to move onto something else, the sound of moving papers audible on Nicole's end. \"Think about Megan Draper. She was glamorous, wasn't she?\"<br>\r\nNicole rolled her eyes. <i>Yeah, to old guys like you maybe</i>.<br>\r\n\"Well, I've got to go, Nicole, but we'll be back in touch. You'll do great. Good-bye.\" Roger hung up in his typical, dry, stentorian voice, leaving Nicole to throw her phone down into the passenger seat in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the gym, Nicole was running furiously on the elliptical machine, looking around nervously to see if any other people (especially other girls who were as catty as her) were looking at her recent, bulging middle. That made her exercising a little more difficult than usual. It also didn't help that her sports bra was digging into her skin even more than yesterday. <i>Damn, I'm getting fat everywhere</i>! Nicole thought to herself. Her yoga pants were also hugging more tightly than she'd like. And, like the last time she was at the gym, she was way more tired than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was dripping with sweat as the machine switched to \"cool down\" and she relaxed, still trying her luck at flirting with other guys at the gym. She managed to get plenty of interested smiles and once-overs, although a few stopped at her belly and walked away. Nicole felt bad, but she'd expected some of it. But she noticed more and more guys were looking less interested in her, and a few girls pointing and whispering about her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat really set Nicole off was when one girl walked up to her; she looked like she was about 18 or 19. \"H-hi,\" the girl said. \"I just wanted to say...I think it's really brave of you to go to college here while pregnant.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm not a student here,\" Nicole said, smiling as politely as she could fake while wiping sweat off her forehead. Then, she stopped and turned back to the girl. \"Wait...I'm not pregnant! You think I'm pregnant?\" Nicole was furious and lifted up her sweater to show her new potbelly. \"Just because I got a little fat doesn't mean I'm fucking pregnant!\"<br>\r\nIt wasn't just \"a little fat.\" Nicole did have a clear rounding in her stomach and it was still hard and tightly concentrated. However, that wasn't why the girl had come over.<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry, I was told by some other girl here that you were pregnant,\" the girl squeaked.<br>\r\n\"Who?\" Nicole bellowed.<br>\r\n\"C-Claire Reynolds, from Sigma Mu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire Reynolds. Nicole and Claire had been as close to mortal enemies as two high school girls could be. They were like the United States and the Soviet Union in a Cold War of throwing shade. Claire was actually a student at the local college where Nicole lived and did what she could to make Nicole's life miserable when she could. Telling people Nicole was pregnant was a new tactic, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when you see Claire, tell her I'm looking for her,\" Nicole growled. \"And tell her I'm not pregnant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, but you'll need to keep it down please,\" a voice said behind Nicole. She turned around to see Marcus again in his campus fitness outfit. \"Oh...Nicole, right?\" He smiled.<br>\r\nNicole smiled back, letting out a relieved sigh. \"Yeah. And you're Marcus. I remember you.\" She left out his little cameo in her last dream and looked him over a few times. \"Sorry about that, I was just a little upset. Working out can do that to you.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know what you mean,\" Marcus smiled with a little laugh. \"When I'm done with a big set of lifts, sometimes I feel like I just want to go wild.\"<br>\r\nNicole bit her lip. <i>You could go wild on me anytime you want</i>. \"Yeah,\" she said with a little laugh of her own.<br>\r\n\"So,\" Marcus said with a pause. \"Would you like to get together and go for a run sometime? And maybe we could get something to eat after?\"<br>\r\nNicole felt her heart soar. \"Yes, that would be great!\" They exchanged numbers and Nicole left, chuckling giddily. <i>Who cares if I look fat</i>? Nicole thought to herself. <i>I've got a date with that hot guy and I turn 21 in nearly a week. Nothing could go wrong</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she got to her car, Nicole's phone rang and she found out that, in fact, something could go wrong.</span></div></div>",

It annoyed the hell out of Nicole.<br>\r\n\"Hi Jenny,\" Nicole said, putting on her own phony, pleased voice. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, there's a former governor giving a speech at that college you live near tonight and I was hoping you could help show me around so I could interview some students,\" Jenny said with a sweet tone. \"Rachel and Stacy are coming too. They want to see their little sis in action.\" Jenny giggled. Nicole rolled her eyes. \"Oh! And when it's done, could you give us a tour of the campus? That would be so, so cool.\"<br>\r\n\"I-I guess so,\" Nicole said, annoyed that Jenny's warm personality, however fake and malicious it might be, made it hard to say no to her. \"Sure, I can do that.\"<br>\r\n\"And, do you think you could get me into that college gym?\" Jenny added with a giggle. \"I don't want to pay for a gym membership and it looks like it's made me put on a little bit of weight, so I was hoping to get in some exercising to clear my head and get in shape while I'm here.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Nicole said, a little pleased to hear that she wasn't the only one getting fat in the family.<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Jenny said with another giggle. \"You know, that university has such a nice campus. It's a shame you don't actually go there.\" And with that, Jenny hung up. Nicole let out a furious shriek and threw her phone down angrily for the second time today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack home, Nicole took a shower, her hands moving across her rounded middle as the warm water fell down on her. \"Why is it so hard?\" Nicole muttered to herself. \"Maybe it's my abs because I've been going to the gym so much.\" That lifted her spirits a bit. She was also keenly aware of her cup size upgrade in the past few days and felt like her hips had gotten a bit wider. Nicole didn't think she looked that bad, really. Maybe she was getting a little hotter in preparation for her big birthday bash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole heard her doorbell ring as she got out of the shower. Wrapping a towel around her body and hair and putting on a bathrobe, she walked to the front door and looked the peephole and saw Betty's face. \"Finally!\" Nicole said to herself as she turned the doorknob. \"I'll see Betty, learn everything was okay, and things can go back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole opened the door and saw that things were not back to normal at all. Betty was wearing sweatpants and a spaghetti strap top that showed off plenty of her bare pregnant belly. \"Hi Nicole. Can I come in?\"<br>\r\n\"Betty, Jesus Christ! What if someone saw you?\" Nicole yelled, grabbing Betty's arm and bringing her friend inside. \"So, you're still...\"<br>\r\n\"Pregnant?\" Betty said, rolling her eyes and putting her hands on her hips. Well, she tried to put them on her hips, but the new addition to her midsection meant that Betty's hands missed slightly and ended up cradling her pregnant orb from below.<br>\r\n\"Hey, we don't know if you're pregnant yet,\" Nicole said quickly, trying to avoid the impossible scenario before her. Betty had suddenly become pregnant. And so did her mother. And now people were calling her pregnant too.<br>\r\n\"Nicole, it's real,\" Betty said, moving her hands further around her belly. \"I'm pregnant. I can feel the babies moving and kicking inside me. I...I know what this is.\" Betty sighed and looked down at her belly. \"I guess it's maternal instinct.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole held her friend's hand and guided her to the couch. \"Hey, hey, it'll be ok,\" Nicole said with a weak smile. As she sat down on the couch, she took off her bathroom and loosened her towel some. Betty caught a glimpse of Nicole's stomach and looked up at her friend.<br>\r\n\"Nicole?...why didn't you tell me that you were too?\"<br>\r\nNicole looked at Betty with a confused look. \"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\nBetty pointed at Nicole's bulging stomach. \"You're pregnant too?\"<br>\r\nNicole's face flushed. \"No, I'm not pregnant! I just got a little fat, okay?\" She was shaking all over. Betty put her hand on Nicole's shoulder.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said anything,\" Betty said, resting her head on her friend's shoulder. \"Things have been crazy, I don't want to fight.\" Betty let out a sigh. \"I don't have any other clothes. These are the stretchiest, baggiest things I own. And I have to go back to school pretty soon. I can't keep missing classes.\"<br>\r\nNicole chuckled a little. \"Well, I'd say you can use my mom's old maternity clothes but...I think she's using them now.\"<br>\r\nBetty looked up at Nicole. \"Your mom's pregnant? But isn't she...old?\"<br>\r\nNicole rolled her eyes. \"Yeah, no kidding she's old.\" She paused to decide whether she should tell Betty the full story and decided it was only fair to her. \"Actually...the same thing happened to her that happened to you. I went home and she walked out like usual, and then she suddenly grew a big, pregnant belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty sat up straight with a concerned look. \"R-really?\"<br>\r\nNicole nodded. \"Yeah, except, she acted like she'd always been pregnant. It didn't just 'suddenly happen' from her point of view. And no one else was freaking out about it either. Everyone acted like she had been pregnant for a while now.\"<br>\r\nBetty looked at Nicole. \"You think this is, like, contagious? That something's going around making people pregnant?\"<br>\r\nNicole shrugged. \"I dunno, that sounds impossible.\"<br>\r\nBetty rubbed her belly in big circles. \"So is this.\"<br>\r\nNicole swallowed nervously. <i>If this really is going around, I hope it doesn't get me next</i>, she thought to herself. \"Well...yeah. When's your appointment with the doctor to get everything checked out?\"<br>\r\nBetty leaned back and puckered her lips in thought. \"Tomorrow, actually.\" She turned to her friend. \"W-would you come with me? I've never exactly gotten an ultrasound before and I hate hospitals.\"<br>\r\nNicole smiled. \"Of course, Betty babe.\" The two hugged closely, Nicole blushing as her new endowments were pressing against Betty's own breasts. <i>Yep, definitely bigger</i>, she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole gave Betty a bulkier coat to hide her pregnance a bit better and waved her out the door and back to her own place. Nicole sighed and went to change, noticing her belly once again as she changed. \"I guess I do look kind of pregnant,\" she muttered to herself. \"I don't get how all this fat got here in such a sort time...I guess I just haven't been paying attention. Or maybe it's all the stress Daddy is putting on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole put on her outfit and-</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nicole got a text from Jenny, letting her cousin know that she and her two sisters had arrived on campus. Nicole let out a sign and walked out the door. Much to her surprise, Jenny's car, a dazzling new Mercedes, was parked right in her own driveway. Jenny got out of the driver's seat and Rachel and Stacy came out of the other seats. Jenny waved to her cousin. \"Hi Nicki! We thought it would be easier to come right here!\"<br>\r\nNicole faked a smile and a laugh, like always. \"Great, now we can all just drive straight there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy and Jenny both walked over and gave Nicole a shallow hug. Nicole could tell that they both put on a little weight since yesterday. Jenny was still wearing her tight, bright outfit that showed off her curves so any extra pounds she put on were easier to see. It made sense that Stacy was a little bigger. After all, she'd announced that she was pregnant yesterday. But still, Nicole thought she was showing a little early. <i>Maybe Stacy's been pregnant  longer and only told us recently</i>, Nicole thought, trying to remember what she looked like yesterday. Rachel walked over with less energy that usual and gave Nicole an even weaker hug than the other two. <i>Rachel's gotten a little pudgier too</i>, Nicole thought to herself. <i>It must be that stomach bug that hit us all the past few days</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole got into the passenger seat and the four Winters girls drove over to the nearby university. They parked in an already-crowded lot, with people coming from all over to hear the former governor speak. Nicole wasn't sure how good of a tour guide she'd be. She only went to the gym to work out and watch basketball games and to the nearby apartments and frat houses for parties and boys. But, Nicole had run through campus enough times to be able to show some things. The four walked around and Nicole was keenly aware that her three gorgeous cousins were taking away the attention she usually gets. Especially Jenny. A few guys even asked for her number, but she giggled and politely turned them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's a nice self-esteem boost, that I'm still getting pick-up lines even when I put this weight on,\" Jenny laughed. \"I might just be bloated, though. Nicole, you look like you've had the same bloating for a while!\" Jenny and Stacy both giggled a little as Nicole's face flushed. She closed her sweatshirt a little more to try and cover the belly she was developing (and would continue to develop for the next seven days).<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it'll go away in a few days,\" Nicole said in a hurried tone. \"I work out all the time. I'm even going out with one of the guys from the gym.\"<br>\r\nAll three cousins oooh'd at this. \"A guy who spends that much time at the gym must be pretty cute,\" Stacy purred.<br>\r\n\"He is,\" Nicole said, flashing her a malicious grin. <br>\r\n\"Be careful or else you'll end up pregnant like me,\" Stacy said with a laugh, rubbing her relatively flat belly. Jenny laughed along with her, but Rachel turned her head away with a melancholy expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I'm not getting pregnant,\" Nicole said with a scoff. \"I would hate that.\"<br>\r\n\"Seeing your mom pregnant at her age probably doesn't help,\" Jenny said. \"Although Aunt Lucille is carrying it pretty well. Especially with twins.\"<br>\r\nStacy nodded and let out a sigh. \"I hope I don't end up carrying twins. I go for an ultrasound tomorrow so I'll know the exact number in here.\" Stacy rolled up her shirt and padded her bare belly for emphasis. \"Although I am pretty big for just two months...\"<br>\r\n\"I-I have to go to the bathroom, excuse me,\" Rachel said quickly, walking away quickly. Jenny and Stacy both looked at each other and shrugged.<br>\r\n\"We might try to get some food now, Nicole,\" Stacy said. \"I'm getting cravings.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty hungry too, but I wouldn't call it cravings,\" Jenny said with a laugh. \"Are you coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole hesitated. \"I'll meet up with you,\" she said. Nicole wanted any chance to get away from her bitchy cousins. All they were doing was making her feel miserable. Her two cousins shrugged again and walked off, still laughing and gossiping. Nicole wandered around the campus, going toward some buildings she actually recognized. On the way, a group of girls walked up to her, with one familiar girl at the front. \"Oh my god, I didn't realize how big the baby bump would be up close.\"<br>\r\nNicole looked over at the front girl with a scornful look. \"Hello Claire.\"<br>\r\nClaire Reynolds smirked, with the rest of her sorority behind her. \"Hi Nicole. So, planning on having a baby shower on the same day as your 21st birthday?\"<br>\r\nNicole fumed. \"I'm not pregnant! I had a stomach virus and it gave me some bloating, okay?\" Nicole smiled evilly. \"But, since I've been going to the gym to work off the weight, I'm not dating one of the hottest guys on campus who works there.\" Nicole was embellishing a little, but that's the way the game is played.<br>\r\nClaire raised an eyebrow. \"Oh really? He won't leave you when you try to pass this baby off as his?\"<br>\r\nNicole wanted to scream. \"Stop telling people I'm pregnant! It's a really childish, shitty move, Claire!\"<br>\r\nClaire chuckled again and started to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What?</i> Nicole thought, hearing the same mysterious voice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Get revenge. Flip me!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole reached into her pocket and fished out the coin, watching Claire as she walked away. \"Hey, come back here!\" Nicole yelled, feeling that Claire needed to be close by for some reason. As she fumbled, Nicole dropped the coin on the ground. She bent down to pick it up and looked around, but Claire was gone in a sea of students. One guy carrying books hunched over and ran to barf in the middle of the quad, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Damn, she got away</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Got away from what</i>? Nicole wondered. As she walked back to the main building, she ran across Rachel. It was clear that she'd been crying some. \"Rachel?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh...hi Nicole,\" Rachel said in an embarrassed voice.<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Nicole had always felt that Rachel was the nicest out of the three sisters, maybe because she was the middle sibling.<br>\r\nRachel let out a sigh. \"Promise you won't tell anyone?\"<br>\r\nNicole nodded. Deep down, she wanted dirt and gossip and it sounded like Rachel had some. After all, she wasn't <u>that</u> much nicer than her sisters.<br>\r\n\"Well...I'm pregnant,\" Rachel said. \"Two months now.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Nicole said, not finding the news as juicy as she'd hoped.<br>\r\n\"But...the baby isn't Peter's.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Nicole said. This was big after all!<br>\r\n\"So Stacy's constant talking about her own pregnancy and being happy with it...it's tough.\"<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" Nicole said, trying to stifle a grin. Rachel wrapped her up in a big hug. <br>\r\n\"Thanks Nicole. You're a great cousin.\" Rachel gave Nicole a little kiss on the forehead. \"But it's getting pretty close to time for Jenny to set up. I should probably go over to her or else she and Stacy will get suspicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel and Nicole walked over to the campus cafeteria where Jenny and Stacy had clearly polished off a massive meal. \"Before you say anything,\" Stacy said with a smile. \"Most of the eating was done by Jenny.\"<br>\r\n\"That's not true!\" Jenny lied with a grin. \"I've just been feeling a little hungrier lately, but I'm not some kind of pig!\" She turned to Nicole. \"But I can use your campus gym after this, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Nicole said with a fake smile. She had to hold back on this new Rachel news for when she really needed it.<br>\r\nThe three sisters thanked her for the tour and went to the auditorium to help Jenny prepare for her news coverage and interviews. Nicole said goodbye to them and walked around campus some more, wondering how long she'd have to wait for a ride back and whether she should just brave walking to her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Marcus jogged past her on the quad's perimeter. \"Nicole! Hey!\" he said with a laugh. \"I tried to call you, but you never picked up.\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I was with family and I wasn't paying attention,\" Nicole said with a giddy smile. Seeing Marcus cheered her right up, especially in his tight, sexy running clothes.<br>\r\n\"I'm almost done with my run for the day. Want to get something to eat after?\" He asked.<br>\r\nNicole smirked and nodded. <i>Take that, cousins</i>, she thought, cackling to herself. <i>Instead of working or dealing with pregnancy stuff, I'm going out with a hot guy</i>.</span></div></div>",

Think you can keep up?\" Marcus smirked.  \"For sure, I'll be right next to you.\" she replied with a grin, although she was nervous, considering her recent 'weight gain'.  Marcus took off, much faster than Nicole had thought.  She tried to run her normal speed, but it was seemingly impossible.  She followed Marcus across the campus, and they ended up in the parking lot of a burger joint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sorry about that.  You ready to eat?\" he asked.  \"Yeah...yeah...let's go...\" she huffed, trying to regain her breath, while her belly was grumbling.  \"Hopefully you won't take too much out of my paycheck, it looks like you're well fed.\" he chuckled, obviously referring to Nicole's rounding middle.  She replied with a fake laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Marcus ordered a burger and a salad, along with a bottle of water.  Nicole, however, ordered two double cheeseburgers, fries, and a large shake.  Marcus didn't even know how to reply to this event, and just watched Nicole eat.  \"So, Nicole, what were you doing on campus earlier today?\" he asked, while Nicole finished munching.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was showing a few of my cousins around, but I'm really glad we ran into each other,  I can't sta--\"she said, before being interrupted by a light fluttering in her belly, like there were butterflies in her stomach.  She gave her middle a slight rub, and thought nothing more of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole, you alright?\" he asked.  \"Oh...yeah.  I can't stand them, they're just really stuck up and selfish.\" she said, unaware of the irony in that statement.  \"I know the feeling.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued to talk for the next hour, telling each other about their families and other personal things, including the pregnancies surrounding Nicole.  \"For real, that's crazy.  All of my cousins are guys, so I don't think they have to worry about that, unless they have a few baby mamas on the side.\" he joked.  The two got up and approached the restaurant's exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me, Nicole.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the coin from her pocked, and gave it a flip, as she turned around to catch it, she caught sight of a frat boy.  \"Nice one.\" Marcus grinned.  They exited the restaurant, oblivious to the pandemonium that was unfolding as the frat boy's stomach began ballooning out in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcus gave Nicole a ride home, and they soon arrived.  \"I had a really nice time, Nicole.\" Marcus said with a grin.  \"Yeah?  Me too.  We should do this again sometime.\" she replied.  Marcus agreed, and gave her a goodnight kiss before Nicole walked into her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole entered her bedroom and undressed.  Her belly appeared a bit bigger than before, to her bemusement.  She placed a hand on her rounding middle, and the light fluttering returned.  \"What the hell?\" she asked herself, as the fluttering ceased.  Nicole stifled a yawn, and lay down on her bed, which gave a small creak.  She was asleep within minutes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nicole was rolling around in bed, moaning and grumbling. Finally, she opened her eyes, blinking a few times in the dark. \"Mmgfh,\" she complained, reaching for her phone on the dresser drawer. 2:23 AM. \"What the fuck,\" Nicole groaned. Why had she woken up this early? A rumble emanated from her stomach and she realized why. She was hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole slid out of bed and walked into her kitchen, rubbing her eyes and yawning. She reached down and opened the fridge, wincing as the light shown brightly through. But in the fridge's light, Nicole could see something else: her belly. There was no doubt about it now: Nicole looked absolutely pregnant.  There was a wide and obvious curve that made her look at least seven months pregnant. Her belly button was now a little nub sticking out of her body. It was like one of those monitors you put in a turkey that pop out when the cooking is done. And boy did she look \"done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...this isn't just fat or gas,\" Nicole muttered to herself. \"This has to be something else.\" Sure enough, Nicole felt more of the fluttering from yesterday. At first, it just felt like something ran across her belly, but then the tingling and moving sensation spread across the entire womb and the tickling was turning into pushing and moving. <i>Like there's something in there...multiple somethings</i>, Nicole thought. She was terrified but her hunger kept overtaking her. Nicole reached into the fridge and grabbed whatever leftovers were the closest and didn't require any preparation. Flipping on her bedside lamp, Nicole started eating in bed, rubbing her belly with one hand. \"I really do look...pregnant now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time, Nicole was able to polish off her late night meal and settled back into bed. Immediately, she realized it would be harder now with her bigger belly. When she tried to lay face down, her belly pressed uncomfortably against her. When she tried to lie on her back, her breasts, which swelled even more overnight, weighed too heavily on her (Nicole cursed getting those implants now). And lying on her side was too awkward and too heavy. In the end, Nicole used her pillow to prop up her back and sat sitting up and leaning against the bedpost. It was surprisingly comfortable and she drifted off to sleep, not realizing that she was cradling and rubbing her belly with her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole woke up at a far more pleasant hour and stretched happily. More maternal hormones were flowing through her now which put Nicole in a better mood, even if she didn't realize it yet. She groaned as she got up, the t-shirt she slept in becoming increasingly cumbersome as she'd gotten bigger. \"I might have to switch to just sleeping in my underwear,\" Nicole remarked to herself, rubbing her sensitive breasts. \"Speaking of which: I need a bra that fits better now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole had a breakfast that was just as vigorous as her fast food meal the night before and her late night snack that same morning. All throughout, she unconsciously rubbed her new belly, angrily groaning each time she caught herself. When she finished her breakfast and cried out after she noticed her belly rubbing again, she felt the kicking inside her again. \"Quiet down, you!\" Nicole yelled at her belly. \"Wait, what am I saying? There's no one in my belly! I'm not pregnant! I can't be pregnant!\" Nicole paused. \"I-I mean...there's no way I could get this big this soon...\" Nicole checked her phone and saw that Betty had texted her a reminder to drive her to the doctor's. \"Maybe I should get an ultrasound while I'm there too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Betty's, Nicole braced herself for the reaction she knew she would get when she opened the door. Betty waddled out, in her typical attire that didn't match her present condition at all. Her jaw dropped. \"Nicole...\"<br>\r\nNicole sighed. \"I know...weird, right? I'm going to get an ultrasound along with you, if you don't mind.\" Betty shook her head and wrapped Nicole up in a big hug, their swollen bellies pressing against one another.<br>\r\n\"Oh, Nicole, I'm so sorry...what is happening to us?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Betty, but hopefully the doctor can give us some answers.\" Nicole paused as Betty broke the hug. \"And maybe afterwards, we can go buy some maternity clothes, huh? We'll probably both need them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the drive over, both friends didn't speak much. Betty mostly looked between the passing scenery and her own big belly. Finally, Nicole broke the silence. \"What does it feel like when they kick and move?\"<br>\r\nBetty shrugged. \"It's hard to explain. It's just like something's rolling and swimming inside me. I can feel...them...separate from my own body.\" Betty looked over at Nicole with a little smile. It felt better to talk about these things, especially with her closest friend. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n\"I think I'm getting the same thing,\" Nicole said softly, rubbing the side of her belly with one hand. \"It's not very strong or anything, but there's definitely some...some movement.\"<br>\r\nBetty sighed and reached over to feel her friend's belly. \"Yeah, I can feel a little something.\" Betty blushed. \"Geez, I'm talking like some old lady midwife. I've only been pregnant for three days, what do I know?\"<br>\r\n\"A lot more than me,\" Nicole said as they pulled into the hospital parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole sat patiently as Dr. Anderson ran the ultrasound wand over Betty's huge belly. Sure enough, there were two, distinguishable figures on the screen. \"That's twins,\" the doctor said.<br>\r\nBetty let out a long sigh. It really did happen. One second she was as fit and flat as any other girl, the next, she was full term with twins. \"How could this happen?\" Betty asked. \"I told you, I wasn't pregnant. Nicole can attest to that. Suddenly, boom, pregnant!\"<br>\r\nDr. Anderson shook his head. \"It's a mystery, for sure. Sometimes pregnancies can be atypical and not really show up. Maybe you were already pregnant and it suddenly slipped into place so it was visible.\"<br>\r\n\"But I didn't have any symptoms. I've had my period!\" Betty protested. The doctor just shrugged and shook his head again.<br>\r\n\"Like I said, it's a mystery, but pregnancy is a mysterious process medicine still doesn't fully understand.\"<br>\r\n\"Well...alright, thank you for letting me know, doctor. And you won't tell my parents yet, right?\" Betty said, raising one eyebrow. Dr. Anderson smiled and winked. \"Okay. Now, my friend Nicole thinks she's having the same thing happen to her as me. Nic...Nicole?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole got stage fright and left the doctor's room. It really happened. Betty was pregnant. Which means she could be pregnant too. Sudden, unexplained pregnancy. What was the world coming to? If Nicole really was pregnant, she didn't want to know about it. She walked down the halls of the OB/GYN office before running into a familiar face. \"Nicole?\"<br>\r\n\"Stacy?\" Nicole said. One of the three worst people to run into. Well, add her mother for four. \"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n\"Pregnant, remember?\" Stacy giggled, pointing to her own belly. It was bigger than yesterday, looking like a little potbelly. \"And I just got the big news: triplets! Can you believe it? I really outclassed Aunt Lucille.\"<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" Nicole said, feeling dizzy. Triplets?<br>\r\n\"Hey, why are you here anyway?\" Stacy asked, before looking down at Nicole's own belly. \"Oh my god.\" Stacy could hardly hide her smile. \"Are you-\"<br>\r\n\"Don't,\" Nicole said, pointing her finger angrily at her cousin. She gulped. \"Don't tell anybody, okay? Please? I'll do it on my...own time.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Stacy said with a smile, walking past her cousin with a gorgeous pregnant gait. \"Congratulations, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole screamed silently and hustled back to Dr. Anderson's as quickly as her big belly would let her. She had to know for sure now, lest Stacy spread rumors. On the way, she ran into another family member. \"Rachel?\"<br>\r\n\"Nicole?\" Rachel said, looking as scared as Nicole. \"I-I was just hear to check on...well, you know.\" Nicole couldn't believe it. Rachel looked as big as Nicole did yesterday! \"And the news just keeps getting better and better...it's quadruplets.\"<br>\r\nNicole's jaw dropped. \"R-really?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Rachel said nervously, rubbing her own little belly before noticing Nicole's. \"Wait...are you-\"<br>\r\n\"I won't tell anyone about you, now do the same for me,\" Nicole said, waddling back toward Dr. Anderson's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the office, Nicole was breathing nervously, holding Betty's hand as the doctor applied the wand. \"It's alright to be nervous. I get lots of patients like that all the time.\"<br>\r\n<i>Probably not too many like Betty and me</i>, Nicole thought as the image came on screen.<br>\r\n\"Well...huh, that's unusual but...you're definitely pregnant,\" Dr. Anderson said. Nicole's heart sank. How could she be pregnant? Just days before her 21st birthday, no less. <br>\r\n\"Wait, what's the unusual part?\" Betty asked. Nicole looked at her and then back at the doctor.<br>\r\n\"Well...you're about four months pregnant so it might be a little hard to tell at this point but it looks like quadruplets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole could only stammer out one word. \"What?\"</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m seeing four heartbeats here.\" The doctor said, still running the wand over Nicole's belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can't believe it</i> Nicole turned her head away from the screen, gazing over the back of the doctor. Tears began to form in the corners of her eyes, Nicole trying to blink them away. She found herself looking in the mirror on the other side of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What am I going to do?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nObediently, the hand not grasping Betty\u2019s pulled the coin out of her pocket, flipping it and catching it in one motion. Unbeknownst to her, the coin landed heads. Quietly, her belly grew underneath Dr. Anderson's hand. Bigger and bigger until she was almost as big as Betty. Her breasts swelled in her already undersized shirt, the seams beginning to split. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Dr. Anderson exclaimed, \"Five, six...seven! Seven, not four\" His wand sped over previously non-existent belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-seven?\" Nicole whispered. She looked back at Betty, whose face had dropped \"I-I thought you said four.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I did, but it looks like the others were hiding behind each other. This tends to happen with pregnancies that have a high number of fetuses.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was speechless. She looked over her huge belly, and realized she was only going to get bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a little disappointed, Nicole. You too, Betty.\" Dr. Anderson said, turning off the ultrasound machine and handing her some paper towels, \"You two should have known to come in earlier, getting as big as you are.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I guess I wasn't thinking clearly.\" Nicole began wiping the gel off of her expanded stomach<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I guess I could have come in yesterday, that would have been the only time I could have come in earlier. Was I this big this morning?</i> Her hands felt puny as she rubbed the rest of the gel off herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I just kind of blew up.\u201d Betty chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You\u2019re just lucky that there are no complications yet. I want you both in here again at the end of the week.\u201d The doctor stripped his gloves off and walked towards the door. \u201cOh, and congratulations.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just in time for my party\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betty\" Nicole got off of the table and stood, feeling her belly settle into her pelvis, \"what are we going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty stared at Nicole\u2019s belly for a moment before closing her eyes and taking a deep breath \"We're going to take a moment, step out that door and do what we do best. Shop.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of herself, Nicole grinned. Then she smiled. Then she let out a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shop? You want to shop, <b>now</b>? Like this?\" Nicole thrust out her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I know I don't have any clothes that fit. And from the looks of things, neither do you.\" Nicole turned around to face the mirror again. Her belly was totally uncovered. A giant tan oval, it stuck out over a foot from her body. Her breasts were crammed into her tiny t-shirt, the seams threatening to burst at any moment. Any slack in her sweatpants had gone out the door, ass and hips straining against the cotton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I look...hot</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments hesitation, Nicole squeaked out, \"Yeah...let's go shopping.\" The two waddled out to Nicole's car, Nicole noticing a disturbing amount of symmetry between their bellies. She squeezed into the driver's seat, pushing the chair back as far as it would go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I don't remember being this cramped on the way over...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pair arrived at the mall, Nicole began to question how well-thought out their plan actually was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betty, I'm not so sure I want to go outside right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? You're going to let me go in there and get judged alone? You can't keep denying this forever.\" Betty rubbed the side of Nicole's vast womb. She didn't notice Nicole's blush at her touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, we'll do this together. Two babes who just happened to get knocked up in the last week.\" With that, Betty swung herself out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair waddled into the mall. Immediately, every eye was upon them. Eyes were drawn to them like pendulum swaying from side to side. Nicole cast a glance behind to see a fair few just as captured by her departure. She grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I <b>do</b> look hot.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnlookers found Nicole\u2019s hips swaying just a little bit more as the pair made their way to \"The Baby Bump\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well that\u2019s\u2026appropriate.</i> Nicole mused, rubbing the side of her belly. The two girls made their way to the back of the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I don\u2019t see why they would put the stuff for the biggest girls in the back. It\u2019s just inconsiderate to make us walk all that way.\u201d Betty complained, a light sheen of perspiration forming on her stomach. The two found the selection to be surprisingly diverse, plenty of options for the growing girls. Nicole\u2019s fears were founded when she discovered that everything Betty could fit into, fit Nicole almost as well. Except for the chest. Once Nicole took off her tiny shirt, there was no getting it back on. Even without the implants they would have been huge. Now, she was flying down the alphabet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole walked out of the changing room, feeling much more comfortable in her new purchases, until someone grabbed her from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c32I? How did you even find one in your size?\u201d Betty released Nicole, who stuffed the tag back into her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk, you\u2019re only a few sizes behind.\u201d Nicole tried to cross her arms over her new bust to pout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty laughed, her own sizeable bust bouncing, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go. We\u2019ve been here for hours.\u201d The two girls checked out with their numerous purchases, each paying with a parent\u2019s credit card. Nicole had to admit, she looked good.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"H-Hey N-Nicole?\" A shaky voice answered Nicole back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel?\" Nicole responded back in a confused manner. Her cousin sounded as if she was having to hold back tears judging from the tone of her voice and the occasional sniffle she heard on the other end. <i>What the hell is wrong with her?</i> Nicole wondered, <i>and if something is wrong how come she's calling <b>me</b> of all people?</i> Indeed, Nicole knew it was no secret that she and cousins had never gotten along very well, and it showed a lot in the way they spoke to each other. <i>Heck it's probably half the reason mom invites them over so much,</i> Nicole thought snidely. However, Nicole decided to bite the bullet and see where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh Nicole thank God you picked up!\" Rachel gave an audible sigh of relief after hearing Nicole answer, before reverting back to her shaky tone of voice, \"I was worried that you wouldn't pick up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She was looking for me specifically? Okay now I <b>know</b> something must really be up...</i> Nicole thought, obviously baffled by her cousin's words. \"Rachel what's wrong? Is everything all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...not really...I-I...\" Nicole was a bit annoyed by the fact that her cousin wasn't just spitting out what she wanted already, and she dearly wanted to voice her irritation, but with a frustrated sigh she calmed herself to at least keep entertaining the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel? What is it?\" She asked pointedly, hoping the straightforward approach would work best so she could get her cousin out of her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look...can you...can we talk somewhere privately right now? I-I just...need someone to talk to...\" Her cousin responded, sounding like she was about to burst into tears again. \"C-can I come over to your place in a l-little bit?\" Nicole groaned inwardly at this since she had planned on spending the day with Betty and sorting out this pregnancy business as best she could, but it looked like she was going to have to put a hold on those plans since from the sound of her cousin this talk was obviously something that shouldn't be dismissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...come by in half an hour while I get back to the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thanks, I'll b-be there.\" Her cousin said as Nicole heard her hang up. However, what surprised Nicole was the fact that her cousin had said it in a tone that Nicole had never heard them use towards her before: <i>gratitude.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole? What's up?\" Nicole was snapped out of her thoughts as she realized that Betty didn't know what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that was Rachel.\" She told her as Betty's eyebrows furrowed in recognition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel? Your cousin? What did she want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really sure,\" Nicole shrugged, \"she just told me that she needed someone to talk to really badly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she decided to call you, the person that she and your other cousins get along with the least, to talk to?\" Betty asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right? I guess it must be pretty bad then, so I guess we're gonna have to cut this trip short...\" Nicole whined with a pout as she looked longingly all the stores that she didn't get to shop at yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe another day then.\" Betty said as she hit her friend's shoulder playfully to snap her out of it. \"Besides, maybe this is your chance to bond and have at least <i>one</i> cousin you can call a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psh...friends? With <i>my</i> cousins?\" Nicole asked in mock horror, \"what is this the apocalypse?\" Both of the girls giggled at the joke before Nicole placed a hand under her chin thoughtfully, <i>I guess it would be kind of nice to not hate at least Rachel though...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the girls grabbed ahold of their acquired purchases and waddled as fast as they could back to their car. After placing the clothes they had bought, or rather their parents's credit cards had bought, in the trunk, Nicole once again settled herself into the driver's seat of the car. For the second time today she felt the tip of her belly rubbing lightly against the steering wheel and looked back to see if the seat was already pushed back, and indeed it was. She looked over to Betty, who's belly seemed to mirror her own in size shape, at least for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright Nicole?\" Betty asked, raising an eyebrow curiously at her friend's pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betty...\" Nicole hesitated briefly before going on, \"do I look...<i>bigger</i> than before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Nicole,\" Betty gave her a playful grin, \"you've got like seven kids stuffed in that thing so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I meant!\" Nicole yelled, but couldn't suppress the grin from spreading across her face, \"I meant like...I don't know...like before we went for the ultrasounds...\" She trailed off as her friend's grin faded and turned into a thoughtful look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Betty said hesitantly, \"I'm <i>pretty</i> sure you were always that big right? I mean we woke up this morning and you were about the same size as me right?\" She asked more to herself than to Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I mean...I sure feel like I've always been this big...\" Nicole placed her hands and felt the taut skin of her belly, the light reflecting off the sweat that had come from the strain of carrying all seven of her children throughout the mall. She felt Betty place a reassuring hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey come on Nicky,\" She said with a look of assurance, \"don't think too hard on it you know? This whole thing's been pretty crazy so I wouldn't be surprised if our memories are a little fuzzy with all that's been going on. Besides, it's not like your belly grew while you were having the ultrasound or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\" Nicole shook her head. She still wasn't sure that she'd been this big at the start of the day, but common sense told her that it was impossible for that to have been true. <i>Well, not like this situation isn't impossible already.</i> She thought absentmindedly as she started up her car and prepared to drive home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car ride to Betty's house was pretty uneventful as the two friend talked about their purchases and lamented at how they weren't able to buy more. After only a few minutes of idle chit-chat they arrived at Betty's house, and Nicole helped her put away the clothes she had bought before bidding her friend goodbye and settling back into her car for the drive home, which wasn't long as she didn't live too far from Betty's house anyways, and before long she had gotten home and stowed away her own ensembles in her closet while changing into a light purple long sleeve shirt which managed to cover all of her belly quite nicely, and a comfortable pair of black sweatpants that fit her just right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing in contentment, she went to lay down on the couch and prepared to wait for her cousin's arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later, the doorbell rang and Nicole heaved herself upright before yawning and arching her back to stretch. After a few moments of waking herself up she waddled over and opened the door and saw that it was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nicole opened the door with another yawn, as she was still a bit sleepy from the little nap that she'd taken earlier on the sofa. However, she woke right up as she found a sobbing Rachel almost tackle her full force, which almost made her lose her balance, but luckily the added weight of her belly, breasts, thighs, and rear were able to keep her standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Rachel? Wha-\" Was all a bewildered Nicole had time to utter before her cousin stopped sobbing and began to outright bawl. However, due to Rachel being too busy crying over who knows what, Nicole found her cousin burying her tear-stained face into her quite sizeable bust, which had only grown even larger since her pregnancy had started. Turning a shade of crimson as she bit her lip to keep herself from moaning, her breasts were quite sensitive to even the smallest touch after all, she found herself awkwardly rubbing Rachel's back in a lame attempt to calm her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about half a minute of this Nicole realized that this was getting them nowhere and pulled Rachel's face out of her cleavage and tried to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh Nicole, it's h-horrible!\" She wailed. Nicole rolled her eyes as she desperately wanted to make some sort of sarcastic remark, but held her tongue as she knew that acting like she usually would to her cousin's probably wouldn't help the situation at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh...\" Nicole nervously wrapped an arm around her cousin and tried to quiet her down, \"come on Rachel it's ok...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no it's not...\" Her cousin whimpered as she continued to sob into her hands. Nicole shook her head and sighed at this before figuring that the couch would be the best place to talk, and so after a bit of coaxing she managed to lead her cousin over to the couch, where she set her cousin down in an abrupt manner before sighing in relief as she sat down beside her, feeling the strain of carrying the weight of seven children being temporarily lifted off of her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel?\" Nicole tried to snap her cousin out of her crying fit, but the attempt proved fruitless as her cousin continued to weep. Sighing in frustration, Nicole opted to make herself comfortable and sit back on the couch while keeping one hand to rub her cousin's back, while she absentmindedly repeated reassuring phrases such as \"there there,\" and \"that's it, let it all out,\" while the other hand she used to explore her what looked to be full term with twins belly. However, since it was filled with seven, she found that even though her's and Betty's bellies were around the same size, there was barely any of the movement in her womb unlike the soccer match that she had felt going inside her best friend's abdomen. She felt the occasional light flutter of a kick here and there, and found that even though she had wished that this pregnancy was nothing more than a dream, she felt strangely giddy and even excited at feeling her unborn children move around inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of feeling her brood move around a bit, she noticed that Rachel's sobs had began to peter out, and she looked over to find her cousin wiping her eyes, and while she was sniffling a few times here and there, for the most part she seemed to actually be in a condition to talk now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Though I would have preferred her to cry on something other than my new shirt...</i> Nicole thought, a little irritated as she looked down at her shirt to find the wet-spots that signified the places where her cousin's tears had stained. She pulled her mind away from this train though and figured that maybe now her cousin would be able to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Nicole...\" Her cousin sniffed and wiped her eyes to dry them, \"I really needed a good cry like that, and I'm glad you were willing to let me come over and do that...\" She finished before giving what must have been the first <i>genuine</i> smile that Nicole had ever received from one of her cousins, or at least one that didn't give off the impression that they were plotting something against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Uh...no problem I guess?\" Nicole stuttered. <i>Is she actually...thanking me?</i> Nicole shrugged inwardly, <i>huh...first time for everything I guess.</i> \"But what in the world had you so broken up Rachel? I mean-\" Nicole stopped as she remembered how earlier in the day, before she and Betty had gone in for their ultrasounds, she had briefly talked to Rachel before going in, and had found out that Rachel was pregnant with quadruplets. \"-oh...wait this about what happened today isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah.\" Rachel nodded sadly as she confirmed Nicole's suspicions. \"I-I just don't know what to do...I mean I always wanted to have kids one day...but <i>now</i>, and so suddenly? What will my boyfriend say? Oh God what will my parents, or aunt Lucy and uncle Roger think?!?\" She yelled as her lip quivered, and Nicole couldn't help but feel a great deal of sympathy towards her cousin as she remembered that she'd felt the same way when the signs of her pregnancy had started showing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, c'mere Rach...\" Scooting over towards her cousin, Nicole wrapped Rachel in a comforting hug that actually felt as if for the first time that they weren't mortal enemies, or glorified strangers. Rather, as Rachel wrapped her arms around Nicole in return while letting out a few light sobs, they felt that for the first time, they were actually family. \"I mean come on, I know how you feel to be honest.\" Nicole confessed, turning to her cousin after they had broken the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really?\" Rachel looked up in astonishment at Nicole, who smiled warmly back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, I definitely know the feeling, though of course on me it shows way more than it does on you,\" Nicole giggled as she patted her belly for emphasis, and <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh my God! Nicole!\" Rachel gasped as she realized that this entire time she had been unaware of her cousin's belly, which in comparison to her own, made her look absolutely tiny. \"You're huge!\" She added in shock as she placed a hand on top Nicole's own growing middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh <i>thanks</i>!\" Nicole snidely remarked with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eep!\" Her cousin turned a bright red as she realized what she'd just said. \"I didn't mean-\" her hasty attempt to correct herself was cut off by a laugh from Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw Rachel lighten up!\" Nicole said with a proud smirk at having fooled her cousin, \"I know I'm pretty huge, though it's to be expected with how many I have inside here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" This piqued Rachel's interest. \"How many are you having?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Brace yourself cous...cause you ain't got nothing on me right now...</i> Nicole sighed inwardly as she spoke, \"I'm having seven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>SEVEN</i>???\" Nicole snickered to herself as she saw Rachel's eyes practically bugging out at the news. \"And here I thought I was having the worst luck with just <i>four</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup...\" Nicole chuckled, \"and the worst part is nobody knows except me, you, and Betty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even your parents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding? I'm still trying to figure out how to even tell them! I know they'll probably kill me though!\" Nicole huffed and hit her head lightly against the back cushion of the couch in irritation at the mention of her parents. <i>Though at this point they could probably figure it out by just looking at me...</i> she thought gloomily as she placed both hands on the top of her swollen womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...no kidding...\" Rachel agreed. \"My parents would probably do the same, or even worse, and I'm not even having as many as you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess with a mom and dad it's not about how many you have, but just that you're <i>having</i> one that counts in their minds.\" Nicole remarked as the two shared a laugh that soon faded into a comfortable silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole?\" Rachel asked, breaking the barrier as her cousin turned her head back towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Rach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we gonna do...about both of our parents I mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really sure if there's really anything to do but tell them. I mean sure they'll be mad but they have to calm down eventually right?\" Nicole reached over and squeezed her cousin's hand reassuringly. \"But whatever happens at least we both know we have someone that knows what we're going through right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\" Rachel trailed off, before giving her cousin a warm smile, \"thanks Rachel...\" and stopped talking as she once again welcomed silence for the both of them. After a while of enjoying the unusually calm atmosphere between themselves Rachel finally got up and walked over to the door. \"Well, guess I'm gonna head out then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty then...\" Nicole said quietly, as she actually felt sad for once that her cousin was leaving. \"See ya later Rachel...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya Nicole...\" Rachel responded in an equally quiet manner, before turning to head out the door. Right before she left however, she turned back one last time. \"Nicole?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Rachel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to say, that even though I don't like this pregnancy happening to me, that I'm glad that it was able to make us behave like actual cousin's for once.\" She said beaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know...strangely enough I feel the same way Rachel.\" Nicole agreed as she returned an equally joyful grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worth it?\" Her cousin asked with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we'll see how much it hurts going into labor and then I'll tell you.\" Nicole joked as the both of them gave a hearty chuckle before Rachel finally left. After hearing the door shut Nicole gave a tired, yet happy sigh as she lay on her side, leaving her belly to jut out a good foot from the edge of the couch as she made the furniture her temporary bed. <i>Guess you were right Betty...</i> she thought with a soft smile after closing her eyes, <i>I guess this pregnancy business really <b>was</b> good for something after all...</i> Nicole let her thoughts drift away before giving one last yawn before finally falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Morning came, and the sun heralded its arrival by peeking in through the blinds in Nicole's living room. Unfortunately for her, since she had chosen to fall asleep on the couch after yesterday's events, she ended up getting a rude awakening via a face-full of sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph...seriously?\" She mumbled groggily to herself as she winced as she felt the ray of warmth assault her visage, \"bad idea to sleep on the couch I guess...\" Annoyed by the sun's intrusion upon her sleep, she pulled her arms over her face to block it, which managed to keep the blinding ball of light from her eyes much to her satisfaction. However, seconds later an audible growl came from her midsection, making her give a sigh of defeat as she felt an immense pang of hunger wash over her which she knew meant that she needed food ASAP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point she decided to give up on the idea of sleep altogether and gave a petite yawn before heaving herself up. However, she kept her eyes closed in a vain attempt to at least pretend that she was still peacefully asleep. Curiously, she noticed that for some reason she felt a lot more...heavy and lethargic this morning. <i>Huh...I guess that trip to the doctor's and the mall really took a lot out of me...</i> She mused as she got up to go get herself some breakfast, only for her to find that the task of getting up off the couch had significantly risen in difficulty from yesterday evening as she found herself falling backwards onto the couch after only getting halfway off the couch. This brought enough of a wake up call to her that something was definitely off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole opened her eyes hesitantly, and upon seeing what was in front of her, let out a gasp of horror and felt her eyes shoot open in shock at the sight that met them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had thought that she was huge the day before, and was accurate in saying that since her belly's size was akin to that of a woman that was carrying twins at full term, a.k.a Betty. The enormous tan oval that made up her midsection however, put her size yesterday to shame. The light purple long-sleeve that she'd picked out yesterday that had kept all of her pregnant form hidden did nothing to stop the display of her gravid middle now, having ridden all the way up until it had hit her breasts, which thankfully seemed to have retained their size, though Nicole did notice that they felt oddly heavy today. She noted with dismay that her sweatpants a good deal tighter and knew that her butt had grown as well as she felt the cool air of the living room brushing the top of her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...calm down Nicole...\" She whispered shakily to herself, \"just get yourself to the bathroom and look in the mirror, and see if it's really as bad as it looks...\" She took a couple of deep breaths to calm her nerves before trying to get up. This took a lot of effort however as she felt that her weight had increased a fair amount and almost lost her balance a couple of times. Eventually though, she managed to stand upright, arching her back to stretch as she felt it tense up at the amount of pregnant weight it was supporting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nicole started down the hall, she noticed that her pregnant gait had become even more pronounced, and slower than yesterday. <i>Oh God I can barely move like this!</i> She thought panicking, <i>No! No...just focus on getting to the bathroom...</i> she steeled herself and continued down the hall, noticing that even such a short walk through her house was tiring to her as perspiration began to form on her brow and belly. By the time she had reached the bathroom her leg muscles were crying out for rest as she puffed tiredly into her destination, leaning back on the counter as she gulped down air in order to catch her breath. After a few minutes of regaining her composure, she turned and faced the mirror, hoping that somehow she wasn't as big as she felt, only for that hope to be instantly snuffed out as she fought back a scream at the sight of her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly had definitely hit a growth spurt, as she figured it had almost doubled in size, now starting to grow up and to the sides as well as outward, her belly button popped out like the peak atop a mountain. She also found that her assumption about the growth of her derriere was true as well as she saw that the black sweatpants were now taut and had even ridden down some, giving the world quite the inviting view of her backside. She stood there in shock for what felt like hours as a multitude of thoughts ran through her head. Among them were inquiries of \"how could I possibly have gotten so big overnight,\" and \"how big am I even going to get?\" To her surprise though, one thought came to the forefront of her mind above all else: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am unbelievably...<i><b>hot</b></i>,\" she gasped as she admired her pregnant form. She couldn't believe how amazing it was! Her huge, swollen breasts, her great, heaving, pregnant belly, her voluptuous and tantalizing rear! She found her new gravid form to be absolutely sexy and blushed a hue of red that would outrank even the ripest of tomatoes at the thoughts she was having about herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she was interrupted from her admiration by a new sensation. It left as quickly as it came, and she might have missed it had she not felt it come and go so suddenly. She froze and waited to see if it would come again, keeping her eye on the mirror just in case. Sure enough, a few seconds later she felt something push out lightly on the top of the vast expanse of belly while seeing a visible indent in her skin rise up. She felt her breath catch and watched as it lingered a bit and even moved down and to the left a bit before receding back into her womb. Immediately, whether it was up to intuition or the maternal hormones, she knew what was going on and felt tears of joy begin to well up into her eyes as she realized that her children were beginning to kick. \"I really <i>am</i> pregnant aren't I?\" She whispered to herself as a huge smile began to form on her face, and as she felt as well as saw her children kick and move more and more she found herself caressing her belly in an almost motherly fashion, rubbing gently in each and every place that she felt her seven children kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this state of maternal bliss didn't last long as after a few minutes Nicole heard a knock at the door. After sighing dreamily at the happiness she was feeling from that session, she wondered in confusion who would be visiting her right now. Of course, she groaned tiredly as she knew that answering the door meant having to walk all the way back to the living room, but knew that she'd have to move at some point and set off slowly waddling back to the living room. After a minute or two of carefully making her way there, she rested for a couple of seconds while still hearing the knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright hang on! Geez...\" she sighed in exasperation before opening the door, only to find none other than...\"</span></div></div>",

Whether it was because she wanted to remind her daughter about the job interview she had coming up, or whether it was indeed just a spontaneous visit Nicole didn't know or care. Either way, she knew that right now she was dead, and chose at this moment to starting writing her will mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hello Nicole I-\" Lucille Winters started off cheery enough for about all of five seconds before looking down, and found herself speechless, not even noticing her jaw's efforts to try and stretch all the way to the ground as her mouth opened and tried to form words. Normally, Nicole would find this sort of reaction hilarious if not for the fact that she was quivering in fear at the fact that whatever came next would not be pretty at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-um...hey mom...what bring you here?\" She tried lamely in an attempt to engage in a casual conversation with her pregnant mother. However, all this did was bring her mom out of her shocked state as her look of bewilderment turned into an icy glare that made Nicole shiver even more and subconsciously hug her belly as if trying to hide her unborn children from her mother's impending wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>Nicole. Shosanna. Winters.</b></i>\" Nicole flinched as she heard her mother say her full name in what might be the calmest voice she'd ever heard her mother use with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes mother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you have some <b>explaining</b> to do.\" Despite the even tone of voice her mother said this in, Nicole knew that this tone of voice meant only one thing. Lucille Winters was absolutely furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen mom I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>YOU WHAT?!?</b></i>\" Her mother cut her off, finally showing her rage as her voice made Nicole shrink and take a few steps back into the living room. \"<b>You forgot to take your birth control Nicole? Is that it?!? <i>OH</i> or maybe you decided that it'd be <i>fine</i> and that you could take a chance with these things!</b> \" Nicole could only whimper in fear as she found her mother continuing to step towards her with each and every word she shouted, and even though she knew that her own orb of life utterly dwarfed her mother's in terms of size, Nicole felt that her mom's presence was much larger than her's at the moment. \"<b>So just<i> WHAT</i> can you say that would even somewhat justify <i>this</i>?!?</b>\" Lucille yelled furiously as she poked Nicole's pregnant tummy in an accusing manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mom I-I don't...\" Nicole stuttered, absolutely terrified by her mother as tears began to form in her eyes, \"I don't know how...it just...happened.\" This was obviously not the response her mother was looking for as her mother's face somehow managed to look even more angry at hearing this. Suddenly though, Lucille's face changed from a vehement rage to an eerily calm fashion as she began laughing bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can't say I didn't picture this happening at some point now that I think about it.\" Her mother said as she smirked darkly. \"You were always such a spoiled little brat who never worked for anything in her life except to party,get drunk, and bed as many guys as possible.\" Her mother laughed harshly at this while Nicole could only cry silently. \"Heh, I guess it was only a matter of time before it all came back to haunt you like <i>this</i>.\" Lucille grinned mockingly as she gave her daughter's much larger belly a few pats. \"Just how many little future money-grubbing parasites have you got in that thing anyways?\" She asked more out of disgust than curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Seven...\" Nicole whispered quietly as she saw her mother's face take on a look of absolute surprise before she started laughing. However, this was warm or happy laughter, it was a cruel, mocking laugh that only made it harder for Nicole to keep herself from outright mourning in the same manner Rachel had done yesterday afternoon. Fortunately, as Nicole felt her lips quiver, and a sob about to escape, her mother's laughs soon turned into snickers before she finally regained her composure and gave her daughter a cold look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then I suppose you'll know how it feels to have some ungrateful little creature mooching off of your funds for the rest of your life, except multiplied by seven!\" Her mother said, giving her a hollow smile. \"I suppose with this...heavy bit of news I'll be taking my leave.\" Nicole looked up in surprise at this, and saw her mother waddling towards the still open door. <i>She's seriously not going to do anything then?</i> She asked herself in a vain hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make no mistake though Nicole,\" Her mother added with her back turned to her as if hearing her thoughts, \"even though I fully expected this to happen, I mean with your lifestyle how could it not, you are most certainly in deep trouble.\" Her mother spat. \"We'll be having a very long talk with your father tomorrow, and you can show your <i>dear</i> cousins what happens when someone lives the kind of hedonistic lifestyle you do.\" She added that last part in more to mock her than anything Nicole figured. \"Goodbye <i>daughter</i>.\" Lucille drawled out the word as if it was completely foreign to her before stomping furiously out the door and slamming it behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole could only stumble back and fall in a heap onto the couch as she let the waterworks flow, tears flowing like rivers down the sides of her face. She didn't know how long she cried for, only that it was certainly more than an hour before she finally began to stop as she shakily made her way back to the bathroom. Looking at her reflection in the mirror, she saw that the encounter with her mother had left her worse for the wear. Her usually straightened gorgeous blonde locks were in disarray, her blue eyes were veiny and bloodshot from all the crying she had done, and worst of all, her children were kicking up a storm in response to the stressful situation and she hadn't eaten at all, leaving her completely famished. Now, with all that had happened in the morning and looking at her reflection before her mother had come over, Nicole had seen an expansion in both her butt, and especially her belly, and with both of those features having made themselves so readily apparent, she easily assumed from the size comparison of her belly that her breasts hadn't grown at all. This of course was not the case as she suddenly noticed that her bra felt unusually tight, and that the certain heaviness that her breasts had been feeling all day was even more prominent than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what the hell is wrong now?\" She growled angrily as she cupped her boobs and jiggled them in frustration, as if trying to make the feeling go away by shaking it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*SNAP!*</b> This had proven to be the wrong thing to do as that much of a ruckus caused her already strained bra to be pushed past its limit and finally give out. Nicole stared in shock and reached inside to remove the now too small undergarment. <i>Great...</i> she thought sadly, <i>guess me and Betty are gonna need another shopping trip...</i> she looked up and furrowed her brows angrily, <i>and to top it all off that fat <b>cow</b> made me get tear-stains on my new shirt!</i> However, upon closer inspection she realized something, the stains on her shirt were not clear like tears would be. These stains trailed down her shirt starting around her chest area, leaving a wavering trail of white that oddly looked a lot like- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Milk...\" Nicole breathed out, now adding lactation stains as yet another reason to the list of why today was already the worst day ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as she really had no tears left to cry with since her earlier episode used them all up, Nicole knew she needed someone to talk to. Someone who she knew would at least comfort her in her time of need, and so after having a brief battle with getting her cellphone out of her sweatpants pocket, it being harder to do now that her center of gravity was thrown off, and due to the fact that her belly and breasts largely obstructed her view, she decided to call...</span></div></div>",

And waited. The only advice she heard from Betty was how to leave a message after the beep. Nicole hurriedly called again, hand trembling a bit. Again there was no answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If Betty can't help me...who can?</i> She felt her eyes begin to well up again before she had a thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Rachel does owe me one...</i> Scrolling through her phone she found her cousin's name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment the line clicked, \"Nicole? Nicole is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hi Rachel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you've ever called me, what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I...\" Nicole found herself at a loss for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a tiny voice Nicole managed to spit out, \"Would you mind coming over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be there.\" The line clicked and went dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel? Rachel?\" Nicole looked at her phone, the blank screen revealing nothing. Dropping her head backwards into the couch cushion, she sighed. A growl burst forth from her engorged midsection. During the confrontation with her mother, Nicole had completely forgotten about breakfast. But her body hadn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright. Let's get a little something to eat.\" Another growl came forth, much louder than the first. Nicole rolled her eyes. \"Or a lot something to eat.\" She repeated her earlier maneuver scooting her backside towards the edge of the couch and thrusting upwards, but found herself falling backwards instead of toppling forwards. Grimacing, Nicole repeated her movements, again crashing back down to Earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kidding me.\" Nicole slumped in her seat, her purple-clad breasts and tanned belly blocking her view almost entirely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Now what?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she began to accept her fate, a sharp rapping came from the front door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole? Nicole are you okay?\" Rachel's voice was muffled, but Nicole could hear the concern in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She's worried about me...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm okay, the door's unlocked.\" The handle turned and in waddled Rachel. Glancing about for a second she found Nicole on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God! Nicole!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" Nicole nervously laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently my cousin, the most pregnant woman in the U.S., what happened?\" She offered her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I had a...<i>little</i> growth spurt last night.\" The girls grunted as Rachel got to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woooow\" Rachel marveled at the vast expanse of her cousin's stomach, \"Can I?\" Nicole blushed and nodded. Rachel slowly grasped the sides of her belly, gradually making her way outwards. Nicole closed her eyes, tingles going up her spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this is all you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither can I\" Nicole purred, her eyes still closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I can't believe this is all you either!\" Nicole opened her eyes to feel a light pat on her bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey! It's not <b>that</b> big...is it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel smirked, placing her hand on a cocked hip, \"Nicole, you have more junk in your trunk than half the women on this floor.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole looked over her shoulder and popped her hip, \"But I'm the only one who makes it look this good.\" Both girls burst out laughing, their respective assets set bouncing. Wiping a tear from her eye, Rachel spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So was that all you needed? A crane to get you off the couch?\" Nicole's face sank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no. M-my mom came over this morning.\" Nicole told her whole story. From when she first started noticing her belly, to dinner at her parent's house, all the way up until her mom berated her this morning. To her credit, Rachel listened intently without interruption, only handing her the occasional tissue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I'm crazy don't you?\" Nicole said, blowing her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I think this is crazy\" pointing to her stomach, \"and this\" gesturing towards her own, \"but not you.\" After a night of growth, Rachel was doing her best to make up for lost time. Looking to all the world like she was eight or nine months pregnant, her growth had clearly outstripped her outfits. Her breasts were much heavier behind her thin shirt and her belly made itself known poking out from under it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you think I should do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel let out a small breath and raised her eyes to the ceiling. After a moment, she spoke, \"Before we start investigating magical pregnancies, I think you should go to the interviews.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this? You can't be serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the only way to show your parents you <b>are</b> serious.\" Nicole wanted to look down at her feet, but only found her cleavage instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...I wasn't sure I could do this before, but now...\" She trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, c'mere\" Rachel waddled over to her cousin, clasping her around the shoulder. \"I'll help you pick out an outfit and drop you off. You've got this.\" Nicole couldn't help but smile. She had never received this sort of support from anyone in her family. And here was Rachel, with her own problems and issues helping Nicole with hers. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Thanks Rachel.\" She turned to hug her cousin but found it practically impossible. Her bump operated as a blockade, keeping anyone from getting a couple feet from her front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess we should get used to that.\" The girls shared another laugh. Simultaneously, a pair of growls erupted from the girls' stomachs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should probably eat before I go.\" Nicole slowly waddled her way to the kitchen. \"Come on, join me, I know you're hungrrryy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shouldn't...I already ate a ton before I left this morning. But what the hell, we're growing girls, right?\" During the next hour, Nicole and Rachel set about demolishing Nicole's food supply. Dozens of eggs, pounds of bacon, hash browns, loaves of bread. The whole milk flowed like water. In a surprise to both, Rachel was the one who ate the most. Her stomach was visibly bigger, repulsing her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, I can't believe we ate that much.\" Rachel groaned, massaging her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me either. I think I might burst.\" Rachel was splayed out on her easy chair, rubbing what she could of her own stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seconds?\" The girls laughed as best they could with their lungs being crushed. Nicole couldn't remember the last time she had a good time with her family. Discounting shopping trips with her father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, let's get you dressed.\" The two sluggishly made their way to Nicole's closet. The two began searching through her newest purchases. The dress she had worn the day before was the first thing passed over. After some trial and error, all dresses were discarded, as was anything with buttons up the front. After an exhaustive search, Rachel came to a conclusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to have to show your belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is absolutely no way. There is no way they'd take me seriously with a gigantic tan belly in their face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel shrugged, \"Look, we have one skirt that can fit over your ass, and barely at that. That green turtleneck looks the best, but we still have nothing that comes close to covering <b>that</b>. It's either we use a tarp, you go bare-belly or not at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole bit her lip. Coming to terms with being hugely pregnant was one thing; going out in public flaunting it in everyone's faces was quite another. As she imagined everyone staring at her, one face came to the forefront. Her mother's. Growling, she grabbed the clothes and began pulling the sweater over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, Nicole? Might want to put on a bra first unless you want to put someone's eye out.\" Squeezing into another maternity bra, Nicole set about getting dressed. The turtleneck went on well enough, wrapping tightly around her endowments. She similarly had trouble pulling her pencil skirt over her wide bottom and hips. Eventually, it popped up, barely covering her lower curves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" Nicole said breathlessly, \"how do I look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a receptionist. A really, really pregnant receptionist. Now come on, you're going to be late.\" After squeezing into the clothes, Nicole had to squeeze into Rachel's car. Even with the seat pushed all the way back, her belly brushed the dashboard. After a few minutes, the girls arrived at the address her father provided. As luck would have it, there was a spot in the front open. Thankful for the first time that week, Nicole heaved herself out of the car. The two girls waddled through the double doors into the lobby. A receptionist preoccupied with answering phones didn't notice the girls come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Ahem* Nicole cleared her throat. The receptionist put on her fake smile, and turned only to be met by Nicole's belly. Grin falling, she stared open-mouthed. Nicole felt her face burn brighter than ever before. After a few moments, Rachel spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole Winters here for a job interview.\" Blinking and shaking her head, the secretary came back to Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, we're not hiring any...expecting mothers right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're mistaken. She has a scheduled interview for 11 AM.\" The receptionist's cheery grin faded, replaced by a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I don't care if you have an appointment. No knocked up slut is going to get hired here.\" With that, she turned back to the phone. Nicole's face burned again, this time with rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip Me</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging a hand into her impossibly tight pocket, she grabbed the unnaturally cool coin. Flipping it and catching it in one motion, she slipped the coin back. Immediately the receptionist began to grow. Within an instant, her belly filled her lap and her breasts filled her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Reality Change</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry, I don't know what came over me. Us soon-to-be mothers have to stick together, right? You said your name was Rachel Winters? Of course, you\u2019re right here. You're on floor three, room 304. Just take your first right. Good luck.\" The girls waddled to the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was...weird, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't...whatever. I'll wait down here, alright? You've got this.\" Rachel took Nicole's hand in hers and squeezed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Rachel...for everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what family's for, right?\" Rachel let her hand fall away, making her way back to the lobby. The elevator doors opened and Nicole stepped in. A bell sounded, announcing her floor. She turned down the padded hallway. Finding room 204, she took a deep breath and knocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" A muffled voice called. She entered and found herself staring at...</span></div></div>",

Slightly older than Rachel\u2019s cousins, Lisa Stinton held a position beyond her years. Nicole had a few ideas about how she achieved this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraightening her back, Rachel waddled forward and extended her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m Rachel Winters. Lovely to meet you Lisa.\u201d Pivoting the chair, Rachel squished her swollen butt into its tiny frame parallel to the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026nice to meet you too\u2026\u201d Lisa had yet to take her eyes off of Rachel\u2019s belly. After a minute of silence Rachel cleared her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Of course, I\u2019m so sorry. Your father did not mention your\u2026condition. That might prove\u2026tricky down the line.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel felt her stomach drop, \u201cTricky how?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, taking you on as a full-time employee would automatically entitle you to benefits, one of which is maternity leave. It doesn\u2019t quite make sense to hire you only for you to leave. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Lisa shuffled papers on her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, so you\u2019re turning me down already? I don\u2019t even get a chance for the other two interviews?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, there\u2019s nothing I can do. Good luck in the future.\u201d Lisa turned to her computer and began typing, oblivious to Nicole\u2019s hateful grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip Me</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nothing you can do, huh? How about this?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole flipped the coin, catching it as it landed heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Reality Change</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Lisa began to show the effects. Her starched white blouse began to billow out. Her already large breasts became even larger, close to the size of her head. Even with the increasing size, gaps between the buttons showed hints of a pink bra. Formerly flat, her stomach burst out, filling her lap and pushing her away from her desk. Bigger than a woman at term it continued to grow. Reaching a size close to Rachel, she finally stopped, a full two feet away from her keyboard. A skin-tight pencil skirt crept up her thighs, revealing  her slightly thicker legs. Her ass seemed to mirror Rachel\u2019s, pushing out of the gaps in her rolling chair. Panting, Lisa turned back towards Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-of c-course, ex-exceptions can be m-made.\u201d She wiped her brow, a sheen of perspiration had formed during her growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay? What just happened?\u201d Rachel was sure she had just changed somehow, but she couldn\u2019t put her finger on it. Was it her belly? Boobs? Something else? It was the strangest sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu she just couldn\u2019t shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I\u2019m fine, I\u2019m sure you know how it is. Just getting up when you\u2019re this big is exercise enough.\u201d Lisa chuckled, upper body jiggling. Rachel gave a half-hearted laugh, the situation still bothering her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, down to business. Now, you don\u2019t have to answer this, but how far along are you?\u201d Thinking back to the doctor\u2019s appointment yesterday, Nicole answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA little over four months.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. And I thought having four kids was three too many,\u201d She patted her side, \u201chow many are you having?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, seven, but look, Lisa, if I can\u2019t get the job I\u2019d just as well go, I can-\u201c Lisa whistled, cutting Rachel off this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeven? Wow. Look, I\u2019m sorry I had to be rough on you at first. I know how hard it is to be a working mom. Seeing as you\u2019re only four months pregnant, right?\u201d Nicole vigorously nodded. \u201cThen there\u2019s no reason not to hire you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d Nicole sat up in her chair, taking a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust hold on a minute, I have to ask you a few questions first.\u201d Nicole collapsed back into her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you type at least 70 wpm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm, yeah. I think over 90 last time I checked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you answer the phone in a polite and professional manner?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole mimed holding a phone to her ear, \u201cHello, R&amp;R Industries, Nicole speaking. How may I direct your call? One moment sir.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect. And can you operate a multi-line telephone?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was practically born with a phone in my hand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen congratulations.\u201d This time it was Lisa who offered her hand. Nicole took it, tentatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs long as nothing comes up in the other interviews, you\u2019ve got the job.\u201d Nicole could have kissed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, thank you so much, I can\u2019t thank you enough, my dad will be so happy-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow hold on, you haven\u2019t got the job yet. Thank me after the next two interviews. Your next one is on the 6th floor, room 627.\u201d The two women rose, each prying their asses out of their seats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow the next guy, Mitch? The head of HR? He\u2019s kind of a perv. Little ironic, huh? So look out.\u201d Nicole nodded, thankful for the advice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love your gall, by the way. Why try and hide something that big, right?\u201d Lisa rubbed her own naked stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore of a forced choice than anything.\u201d Nicole awkwardly smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnock \u2018em dead.\u201d Nicole slowly closed the door behind her. Unable to contain herself any longer, she pumped her fists into the air, jumping for joy. Well, it was more of a tippy toes than a jump. Nicole had all the confidence in the world. Waddling back to the elevator with renewed strength, she pried her phone from her pocket. Texting Rachel giving her the good news, she hopped on the elevator to the 6th floor. Unlike the first ride, a man accompanied her on this ride. She could feel his roving eyes behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe <b>loved</b> it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bell rang for the 6th floor, she waddled out and bent over ever so slightly revealing the bottom of her plump cheeks. Looking over her shoulder she could see the man turn bright red and furiously press the close-door button. Nicole snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I am the hottest woman in this building. Nothing is going to stop me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a pinching around her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Except maybe a bra.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRetreating to the ladies\u2019 room, she stripped off her sweater to find her maternity bra woefully too tight. Her breasts were overflowing the cups and the straps were digging into her shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can\u2019t go braless, but this thing is hurting too much. What do I do? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Nicole was about to text Rachel, she remembered what Lisa had told her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Big perv, eh? </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRipping off her bra and tossing in the trash can, she got back into her sweater and waddled out. Feeling the release of the confines of the bra, she put the fact that she had outgrown a bra in a day out of her mind. Finding the right door, she knocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. van Gundy?\u201d Using her huskier voice had worked for picking up boys; why couldn\u2019t it work for getting a job?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-come in.\u201d Nicole opened the door and found\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nicole smiled sweetly as she waddled into the office, her belly bumping against the chair she was trying to sexily slide into. Mitch van Gundy was just as she expected: a silver-haired older guy, face covered in a soft mask of beard stubble, already growing back after his morning shave. Nicole batted her lashes at him. She had plenty of experience with getting older men to do what she wanted, thanks to years of experience with her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, I'm Nicole Winters. I'm interviewing for a job here as a receptionist and Lisa Stinton sent me to your office,\" Nicole said, one hand moving to her wide hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitch looked at her with a big, surprised gaze. \"This whole damn office is turning into some sort of lamaze class or nursery,\" he said, clicking out of something on his computer and bringing over a folder. \"Please, have a seat and we'll get started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole took one look at the small wooden chair Mitch had for visitors and one look at her belly and knew she wasn't going in there. \"I'll just stand, if you don't mind,\" Nicole said, patting her belly. \"Sometimes it's good to be on my feet and get a little bit of exercise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitch shrugged and looked back at his papers. The smile slowly faded from Nicole's face. She underestimated the effect her pregnancy would have on everyone. This guy seemed too stuffy to fully \"appreciate\" Nicole's looks. Mitch van Gundy was, in fact, quite a stuffy guy and he started working at the office, the only jobs women were getting were receptionists. Now he had that Lisa Stinton breathing down his neck and everything was changing. And what's more, he had a coworker who was pregnant! Well, he was in no mood to keep that trend going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, first question,\" Mitch said, looking up at Nicole, half of her belly above the desk. \"What's your college experience?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None. I decided I wanted to start getting professional experience as soon as I could,\" Nicole lied, bending down and pointing to her file on Mitch's desk, making sure her cleavage, now unencumbered by her bra, was up front. \"You can see here, I was recommended to come here by my father, Roger Winters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitch looked at Nicole's chest as he responded. \"Yes, we have a history of working with Mr. Winters.\" A thin line of sweat accumulated on his forehead. \"W-well then, next question...what is your previous job experience?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole had never worked a day in her life but needed something to keep this old perv's attention. \"Food service. I was a waitress at Hooter's.\" Nicole stood up and put one hand on her hip, popping it out while miming carrying a tray of food. \"Can't you picture me serving you? 'I've got a big order of buffalo wings. Now, I heard it was someone's birthday?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitch slowly started to grin. \"Is that so? Well, some day you'll have to show us all your old outfit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole giggled, trying to sound as flirty as she could. \"I'l see, but it might not fit over this big ball anymore,\" she said, patting her massive womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitch's grin vanished and he cleared his throat, going back to his notes. <i>Damn</i>, she thought, <i>Shouldn't have reminded him about the pregnancy</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Winters, let me be very frank,\" Mitch said, crossing his hands and looking at Nicole. Well, he was looking at her chest, but he continued all the same. \"I am the head of human resources here at R&amp;R Industries. My job is to make sure all of our employees work well together. I keep the order and R&amp;R is a successful business because of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat could not be further from the truth. Mitch van Gundy, though his actions, made R&amp;R Industries one of the top companies in the country for sexual harassment. Ass patting, breast groping, rude comments, and nearly anything else you could imagine. It was a real piece of work. Little did Nicole know, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And frankly, having pregnant employees ruins that cohesion,\" Mitch continued. \"You draw attention away with your aches and needs until you're on a long vacation to have your kids and come back not caring about your work. Legally, I can't refuse to hire you just because you're pregnant, unfortunately. Unless you're going to pop out your kids soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I'm just four months along,\" Nicole said, running her hands up her sides. \"I've got a long way to grow.\" She made this last comment as her hands were near her breasts, which was no accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gesture was not lost on Mitch. \"Well, in that case...let's see, you were already approved by Lisa and you do have a good recommendation. But you're also pregnant and young.\" He looked back up at her. \"But there's a few things about you I wouldn't mind seeing around the office every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was a little taken aback by his openness at this point. \"So, what'll it be, Mitch?\" She said with pouting lips, bending down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a toss-up for me,\" Mitch said quietly, stroking his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole nodded to the voice in her head and reached into her pocket, bringing the coin, which had been very useful lately, out into the open and gave it a quick flip. Tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitch suddenly turned pale and looked around the room, where there was no trashcan in sight. \"Umm...if y-you'd excuse me a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole took a small step and blocked Mitch's way with her belly. \"Oh, Mitch, you can't leave until I know,\" she said cutely, looking at him. \"C'mon, it's an easy decision to make.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss, get out of my-\" Mitch let out a small burp and gripped his stomach. \"Okay, okay, you've got it, now just get out of my way.\" Nicole smiled triumphantly as she turned her belly, letting Mitch run to the bathroom. Grinning, Nicole waddled back to the elevator and returned to Lisa's office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot finding her, Nicole waddled around until she came across Lisa resting against the wall by the water cooler, rubbing and stroking her bare belly as she polished off a cup of water and refilled it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Nicole,\" Lisa smiled, gulping down the water. \"Sorry if you were looking for me. Drinking cool water calms these four down, it seems,\" she said, stroking the side of her round bulge. \"You're only four months along but you should start feeling kicking soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so,\" Nicole said. Actually, she hadn't thought about that aspect of pregnancy yet, it just sounded like something that would make Lisa happy. But it was something she would have to accept eventually. She was, after all, pregnant. \"Anyway, I just finished interviewing with Mitch and he approved me. Who do I go to now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa raised her eyebrow, assuming Mitch took one look at Nicole's chest and agreed to hire her. \"Last up is the head of administrations, just down the hall. Good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Nicole smiled, waddling off to the last obstacle to her getting a job and getting her father and pregnant mother off her back.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rachel sighed frustratedly and dropped her head on the steering wheel of her car. She was absolutely bored, and normally she'd have no trouble finding something to do, this was the busiest part of the city after all, except there was one thing in her way, inner city traffic. She muttered quiet curses as she heard the car behind her honk angrily and looked up from her makeshift blindfold. She pushed on the gas pedal lightly and felt as her car lurched forward in response, she sped up as much as she could in an attempt to at least feel some sort of freedom from her car-based prison, if only for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw forget it!\" She grumbled, parking in a nearby vacant lot. Figuring that at this rate she'd be getting nowhere fast, she leaned her seat back and decided to wait. However, as fate would have it, she felt her phone vibrate, and looked at it to find a text from Nicole telling her to come pick her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well back into the fray...\" She sighed and started her car, pulling out of the lot and then headed for the building Nicole was being interviewed at. <i>Speaking of Nicole... a lot has happened with her lately hasn't it...</i> She thought to herself. Thinking back on the past couple of days that she'd arrived along with her other cousins she realized that the events as of late seemed to be centered around the Winters family. Literally one thing after the other, first it was her aunt Lucy announcing, or rather showing, that she was pregnant, then Stacy, and now Nicole and herself? It was all too surreal in her mind. Strangely enough Jenny seemed to be the only one unaffected by this weird pregnancy epidemic, but from how she was acting, Rachel wouldn't be too surprised if she had an announcement of her own to make pretty soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis line of thought made her trickle back down to two factors. Her cousin Nicole, and herself. Before this all had started, she hadn't been one to be as catty or as biting with her remarks as her other cousins were, and so she'd never really liked to make fun of Nicole. Of course, after hearing from aunt Lucille and the behind the back comments her other cousins made about her, she had subconsciously began to accept this as the truth. They had called her spoiled, bratty, and the laziest person they'd ever met, and also usually worked in the fact that she liked to mooch off of her father's bank account. Of course, while all of the above was true, after yesterday, she'd come to realize that maybe under different circumstances, they would have seen that Nicole was actually a pretty nice person if you treated her right, and had something to sympathize about, in this case, lamenting a pregnancy. Despite this fact, she knew that after this, even if her cousins and parents didn't have her back, Nicole would know that at least Rachel had hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Besides,</i> she giggled to herself, <i>it'd be great if we could babysit for each other. God knows that it's going to be havoc trying to take care of four and seven children...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's another thing...</i> She realized. The pregnancies. Now she didn't know why, but even though the doctor had told her that she was only about 4 months along, she had felt like it was only a couple days strangely enough. Nicole however...she hadn't even been showing a couple of days ago, and now to this morning she'd ballooned out to an impossible size. Even yesterday she had looked much too big compared to the day before, seven children or not, no one could possibly gestate that fast...could they? <i>Something weird is going on...</i> Rachel thought to herself, brows furrowing, <i>and even if Nicole doesn't realize it, we need to figure out what it is...and fast!</i> As she finished the thought, she placed a hand on her belly, letting out a squeak at feeling a particularly strong kick from one of her quadruplets. She definitely wasn't used to this-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Rachel!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wagh!\" Rachel shrieked and jumped in her seat, not realizing that she'd been parked in front of the building where Nicole had gone to. Also, her cousin had somehow evaded her eyesight, even with that ridiculously large belly, opened the door, and gotten in. <i>Either I'm really bad at being aware of things, she's a pregnant ninja, or I was<b> really</b> deep in thought...</i> she decided to go with option three and turned to face her cousin. Looking up past the gigantic tan belly that was in front of her, she gave her cousin a glare. \"Not funny Nicole! You nearly made me have a heart attack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not my fault you were zoned out like that!\" Nicole giggled, sticking her tongue out playfully, \"besides how could you even miss something like this, \" she gave her belly a pat, \"getting into your car hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just thinking.\" Rachel replied with a roll of her eyes at her cousin's immature response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? About what? Must have been pretty good to make you miss my fat*** getting in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nevermind, wasn't really important,\" Nicole's face fell, and Rachel could tell she wanted to press the issue, and so she quickly switched the subject to something else, \"so uh how'd the interviews go?\" All of a sudden Rachel heard Nicole fall quiet, and raised her eyebrow in confusion. \"Nicole? you back there? Did you get the job?\" She looked back to find her cousin...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The first woman was knocked up so she was easy to get to sympathize with me.\" Nicole laughed at her words. \"Geez, I've only known I was pregnant for a few days and I can already bond with other pregnant women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel smiled back, knowing exactly what Nicole was talking about. While the circumstances behind Rachel's pregnancy weren't...ideal, she was looking forward to using it to squeeze sympathy and benefits out of other people. Rachel and her sisters may not be as spoiled as their cousin, but they knew how to manipulate people to get what they wanted. Still, part of Nicole's comment confused her some. A few days? Nicole looked like she was due to go into labor last month. How did she only know about her pregnancy recently?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then the second and third guy were both perverts who were pretty easy to manipulate. The second guy was a jerk and complained about pregnant women working there but he couldn't keep his eyes off of my chest. Luckily, he ran off to the bathroom so he had to make a quick decision and thought with his dick, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel chuckled. She had never been all that kind to Nicole, but spending time with her like this and joining in on her bitchy capers was fun. \"And the third guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Total perv, through and through,\" Nicole said, smiling with a little shudder. \"He paced around me, eyes all over. I thought he'd actually try and cop a feel at one point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you still want to work there?\" Rachel said, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything to get Daddy off my back,\" Nicole said, rolling her eyes. \"And it's paid pretty well. Besides, look at me. I've had guys hitting on me all through middle and high school. There's probably not a lot of guys who'll want to hit on me now, anyway,\" Nicole added, running her hands up and down her gigantic belly. \"I'd say I could bring my big, muscular boyfriend around one day to scare people off but...he hasn't seen me like this yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel looked over and saw the signs of sadness begin to crack Nicole's positive outlook. \"Well, how serious are you two? You should tell him that he's going to have-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not his!\" Nicole said loudly, crossing her arms, which only served to squish and emphasize her chest more. \"Can you drive already? These brats are kicking my bladder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel powered up the car and headed back to Nicole's apartment, looking over at her cousin, both to see how she was doing and to catch a glimpse of her impossibly big belly. It was a rare sight, after all. \"Sorry I...pressed the issue,\" Rachel finally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" Nicole said. \"You didn't know. This is all new to me too.\" She turned back to Rachel and smiled a little. \"You know, I always hated you and your sisters but...today you're been okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel smiled at her cousin. \"We're not always so hot about you. Especially Jenny. Since you're the closest in age of the three of us, she feels like she has to especially one-up you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might have guessed,\" Nicole smirked. \"Well, she's not a pregnant cow so she might have that one-up for sure now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel giggled a little, both unaware that Jenny was pregnant with quintuplets, doomed to grow by one month each day. Right as they pulled into Nicole's apartment, Rachel started to turn red as Nicole struggled to get out. Her belly pushed against the front of the car, making her nervous she might set off an airbag, and turned her wide hips sideways to get out of the seat. Her belly bounced and sloshed around as she stepped out. Rachel was amazed she snuck into the car in the first place with all this difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Nicole?\" Rachel said slowly. Nicole stuck her hips out and waddled around to Rachel's window, panting when she got there. \"Since I didn't blab about your pregnancy, would it be okay if I confided a secret in you?\" Her face got even redder. \"I feel like I'm going to explode if I don't get it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Nicole would have smiled like a snake and then told everyone her bitch cousin's secret, but she was seeing a different side to Rachel. \"Sure, Rachel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel took a deep breath. \"The baby...the babies aren't Peter's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole scrunched her eyebrows. \"R-really?\" Rachel showed off how she was getting married to hunky, successful Peter all the time. And she got knocked up with some other guy's kids? The old Nicole would DEFINITELY have broadcast this information but she felt differently. Maybe sharing a pregnancy really did make her sympathize with her cousin. \"Do you know who the father is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel nodded. \"Yeah, but is it okay if I don't talk about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole smiled with compassion for what might be the first time in her life. \"Sure. Hey, do you want to...hang out with my friend and me tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel blinked in surprise. \"Well, Peter's out of town for the day but...are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just me and my other pregnant friend chatting, eating take-out,\" Nicole said. \"Think you can handle that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel smiled and turned off the car, undoing her seatbelt. \"I think so.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Whew. That-that's enough exercise for the day\" Nicole wheezed. Carrying her belly from Nicole's car to her apartment now a Herculean effort. She collapsed onto her couch, ignoring the squeaks it emitted. She let the day's events wash over herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I have a job. I never thought I'd have a job. Guess I never thought I'd be a mom either.</i> Nicole rubbed her belly, smiling at the kicks she felt. Looking up, she saw Rachel slowly waddling around her living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're confused, but this is what an apartment looks like when someone with good taste decorates it.\" Rachel slowly turned towards Nicole, eyebrow cocked only to be met with a billion-watt grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel rolled her eyes, \"Oh please, you wouldn't know good taste it if bit you in your fat ass.\" The two girls smiled. The two felt familiar with each other even though they had never spent more than a few hours in a row with each other. A few moments of silence passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think you should call your parents about the job?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole waved her hand, \"I'm sure daddy already knows. If not, they can wait till tomorrow. Let Lucille think I'm a total failure for another few hours.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here.\" Nicole wriggled her fingers in the air. \"I'll go change and call Betty and we can get this party started.\" Waddling into her room, Nicole tugged at the hem of her sweater. Finding it caught around her bust, there was little to no give, she tugged harder. Nothing. Pulling with all her strength, Nicole was finally able to unleash her breasts. As they bounced to a standstill, Nicole felt her breath catch in her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel? Could you come in here?\" Nicole eyed her breasts with caution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear Nicole, if you got stuck I'll nev-Holy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm not seeing things.\" Nicole made her way over to Rachel, jaw slack. \"Where's the bra you wore today, there's no way that could have fit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eheheheh...I kinda threw it away before my second meeting.\" Nicole looked downward, blush spreading across her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...the pregnant lady from the first interview told me he was a huge perv! And...it didn't fit anymore.\" Rachel dropped her jaw again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to go back to the doctor <b>tomorrow</b>. There's no way that can be normal. There's no way <b>this</b> can be normal.\" She said, gesturing to her own swollen belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow.\" Nicole nodded. She had tried to put on a happy face around Rachel, but there was no denying she was more than a little worried. But there was nothing to be done tonight except eat and celebrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop gawking and get out, you perv. Let me get changed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitch.\" Rachel winked as she waddled out. Finding the zipper on the back of her skirt close to bursting open, she was able to free herself from the oppressive clothing. Examining herself in the mirror, Rachel could see she was bigger. Nothing close to the previous night, but enough to be noticeable. Gently cupping her breasts in the mirror, she couldn't help but notice they were rapidly approaching the size of her head. A shiver ran down her spine, her nails digging into her soft flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wish Marcus was here. Even with this belly he couldn't resist me.</i> Nicole turned around and popped a hip, watching her ridiculous backside wobble. Grabbing the clothes she had worn the night before, not encouraged with the fit. Her purple-shirt had been turned into an ill-fitting crop top, straining to keep Nicole decent. Her sweatpants similarly struggled, skin tight and riding down. Nicole looked at herself once more in the mirror, shrugged, and waddled into the living room to find Rachel on the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty minutes? Great. Thanks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just ordering a mountain of Chinese. I owe you for breakfast.\" Nicole remembered the feast the girls had had that morning, completely cleaning out her fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should call Betty, don't want her to miss out.\" Grabbing her phone from deep within her cleavage, Nicole got Betty on the first ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God, Nicole? I'm so sorry, I lost my keys this morning I thought I had a contraction and I was freaking out, but it turned out to be indigestion, I didn't know what to do-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betty, it's alright. Everything's fine. Come on over, we can talk about everything.\" Nicole hoped that her growth spurt wouldn't put Betty off too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Al-alright. I'll be there in ten.\" It was all the girls could do to ignore their growling stomachs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Nicole drummed her fingers on her belly. \"Who's the guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel groaned. \"Come on Nicole, I don't want to do this right now. I thought we were supposed to have fun tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, this <b>is</b> fun, you can trust me. We've been friends for almost two days now.\" Nicole leaned forward as much as she could, eyes glinting. Rachel was uneasy. It was hard enough to admit she was having someone other than Peter's babies, but telling someone who it was? And that someone being Nicole? The whole situation was a mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I mean, it's really, I don't know how to say-\" With impeccable timing, the doorbell rang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole rocked herself up, \u201cThat\u2019ll be Betty. To be continued.\u201d Waddling to the door, she threw it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you say you spend the night, sexy? I could use some company.\u201d After a moment\u2019s silence, Nicole peeked around her frontage to see that it was not in fact Betty, but a small Asian man carrying what looked to be hundreds of small white boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhmm,\u201d He stuttered, \u201cdelivery for Rachel?\u201d Rachel quickly shoved Nicole out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry about her\u2026cravings, you know?\u201d The man bobbed his head up and down. Free of his obligation, the man skittered down the hall, running right past Betty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh, Nicole?\u201d Betty watched the man run around the corner, \u201cDid you just try and seduce the Chinese take-out guy?\u201d She waddled into the apartment, seams of her dress straining against her curves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole spread herself between the archways of her hallway, \u201cYou tell me, could you resist this body?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty could only stop and stare, \u201cNicole? How-what, what happened to your belly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole felt her cheeks grow warm, \u201cI, uh, had a bit of a growth spurt last night. Come on, I\u2019ll tell you all about it.\u201d The three girls sat down and Nicole explained everything that had happened that day from her job, to her mother and her belly. They had a laughing fit over Mitch van Gundy and his completely transparent leering. Each girl took turns telling their story. Accustomed to cheering with mixed drinks, the girls had to make due with sparkling water. Noticing a certain amount of similarity to their growth, all three girls decided to make another trip to the doctor the next day. Stuffing themselves with food instead of children, the three girls quickly fell asleep where they sat, until\u2026</span></div></div>",

Stretching into a yawn she did her best to ignore the tug on her back. Try as she might, Nicole could not navigate to the bathroom with her eyes closed. Even with the slightest of squints, she was alarmed by how much more of her blurry torso there was compared to less than twelve hours ago. Despite the fact that her stomach outgrowing her was a very real concern, she couldn\u2019t help but notice her rather large entry in the T&amp;A compendium. Bouncing on her toes Nicole giggled at how long her breasts and butt bounced. Waddling into the living room, she did not find her guests but a note instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hey skank, Rachel and I had work/class.

After a solid few minutes of imagining Marcus smothered in her cleavage, Nicole felt her phone vibrate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA W-2? What is tha-Oh! My job! I have to tell Daddy!\u201d Excitedly, Nicole dialed her home number. And waited. And waited. After the eighth ring, she was about to hang up before the call was picked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-hello? Hello who\u2026who is this?\u201d Lucille answered, voice strained. Nicole inwardly groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello mother. It\u2019s me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Nicole felt a shiver roll down her spine. \u201cHello.\u201d Nicole swore she could fell the temperature in the room drop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs Daddy home? I wanted to tell him that I got the job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you did, did you? Well. Congratulations. You\u2026you\u2019re finally becoming a single working mother at 21.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMother, please. If I could just speak to Da-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour father is not home. But r-rest assured that when he returns from his business trip, he wi-will be certain to hear about your \u201ccondition\u201d. He will finally know you for the <i>harlot </i>that you are-\u201d. Nicole could feel the color rising in her cheeks. She had bit her tongue long enough. Just as she was about to lose her temper she heard something in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMother? Is there someone there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no one-it\u2019s the maid. Go back to work!\u201d She screeched. \u201cNicole, I will talk to you when your father returns. Goodbye.\u201d Nicole let the phone dangle from her wrist for a moment before stuffing it into her pocket. She was nearly one-hundred percent sure that it was a man speaking. Nicole did have that great aunt Sylvia with the deep voice, but she was fairly certain Lucile wouldn\u2019t invite her over for brunch. Moreover, the Winters\u2019 maid was a woman and was scheduled for tomorrow, not today. Nicole tried to cross her arms but only pushed her breasts closer towards her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Could Lucille really be cheating on Daddy?<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nNicole paced through her room, hands swirling on her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If Lucille\u2019s sleeping with someone else, maybe that explains why she\u2019s pregnant! That still doesn\u2019t explain why she got huge all of a sudden. </i>Nicole glanced up in thought before landing back on her own belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Or why I am. </i>Nicole plodded around a bit more, but quickly ran out of energy. She decided that if she was going to be wearing ill-fitting clothes all day they could at least be clean. As she made her way to her room, she unconsciously reached into her pocket, grabbing the coin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me. </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she had before, Nicole flipped the coin in the air. Only this time, she noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I do-\u201c She stopped as the coin landed face down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Tails. No reality change.</span> The voice in her head boomed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Nicole looked up just in time to see herself get even larger. Nicole watched as her already undersized shirt retreated up the slope of her belly, breasts growing heavier and fatter with every second. Her belly pressed forward, intent on meeting its reflection. The sweatpants that had just kept her cheeks contained this morning slid further and further down showing her barely there underwear. Just as Nicole thought she would never stop growing, she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegaining her balanced, Nicole looked over her body with wide eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026wow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was difficult to tell but Nicole was fairly certain there were even more kicking feet than before. After a few moments attempting to calm down her excited womb, Nicole slowly brought the coin up to eye level. Examining the markings again she found that the side it had landed on, tails she was assuming, had two dismayed figures. Two pregnant figures. Instead of the scheduled panic attack of becoming even more pregnant, the wheels in Nicole\u2019s head began to turn ever so slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>There\u2019s just no way\u2026I have to test it.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole slowly waddled out of her room, each step heavier and more ponderous than just a few minutes before. Nicole was forced to peer over the remains of her shirt revealing her now naked breasts. Piled up as high as they were, Nicole was sure they would have hung to her naval had her belly not been in the way. They were easily wider than her shoulders. Feeling a draft, Nicole turned to see that her pants had been forced all the way down and only hung on her wide hips. She might as well have been wearing a thong, only the band of her underwear was visible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Nicole was on mission. Ignoring her torn shirt and bare bottom, Nicole barged outside. Finding no one in the hallway, she waddled over to the mailboxes. Immediately she spotted her neighbor. A short, raven-haired girl who loved to party when Nicole was trying to get her beauty sleep. Never mind if it was after some partying herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole flipped the coin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Tails. No reality change.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe familiar voice rang out. In an instant the girl was doubled over, cupping a rapidly growing belly. Tearing her out of her skin-tight clothes, the girl lost her balance and fell to the ground, a softened rear cushioning her fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrying out, Nicole raced back to her apartment and flopped onto her sofa giddy with excitement. The guilt at having impregnated a stranger was quickly overridden by the implications of what she had discovered. The reason she was pregnant, her mother. Even Betty! Come to think of it, didn\u2019t she bring the coin with her to family dinner?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, a plan came to mind. One that would humiliate her mother just as she had done to her. But first she needed\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as Nicole wanted to initiate her scheme to expose her mother's supposed affair, as she looked down at what used to be a slim, petite figure, she knew that she needed clothes asap, since the clothes she'd bought yesterday had ripped apart due to her newfound growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, Nicole had to wonder just how many babies were growing inside her womb at this point. She had been at seven, and the growth she'd just experienced had been quite large, and at this point her size made it hard to gauge a number. That being said, she realized that the coin had a dangerous risk to it. Even though the word \"enormous\" didn't do her justice at this point, and it took her five minutes to waddle a distance of less than fifty feet, she still felt a tug in her mind that told her that she wanted to get even bigger and more swollen with children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me!</span> The voice in her head boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst part was, whether it was due to the coin's influence, or whether it was playing off of some unknown affinity for being pregnant, a large part of her mind wanted to follow its instructions, and she had to pull her gaze away from the mirror in her room and forcefully grip the coin to keep from flipping it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me Nicole!</span> It ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Nicole, snap out of it!\" She muttered to herself, trying to focus on the task at hand. \"Get some clothes that fit, then expose mom for the cheater she is.\" She repeated the mantra several times to keep from listening to the voice that was still telling her to flip it again. She was quite worried at this point, as the voice seemed to be getting louder and more forceful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">You cannot resist forever Nicole, I know you yearn to flip me once again!</span> It chuckled mirthfully, knowing that with enough prodding, the girl's resolve would crumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole only barely ignored it this time, finding her hand already poised to flip the coin again. Throwing the coin onto the counter with a growl of frustration, she waddled over to her laptop and flipped open the screen, only just able to see over the mountainous pile of flesh that made up her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding no comfortable position to used her laptop in, Nicole noted with amusement that this was the first time that she actually wished that her bust wasn't so ridiculously huge. Finding a website online that she knew sold custom order clothing, she placed an order for 5 sets of clothes that were normally for plus plus-sized people, but would suit her in this instance. As an added bonus, she also found a custom order for maternity bras on the same site, much to her relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she placed her order, and ran her father's credit card through the checkout, she closed the laptop and sighed, leaning back on the couch with a groan. Even with express shipping, it would still take a day or two to arrive, and so Nicole would have to go naked for the rest of the day, unless she felt like walking upstairs to her room in order to get a blanket or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, with her size taking up a lot of her stamina, she was in no mood to climb any stairs at this point, the testing of the coin before having taken a lot of her energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole felt herself drifting off to sleep once again, but was pulled awake one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me Nicole!</span> Nicole looked at her hand in shock, she had thrown the coin on the counter, and yet here it was in her hand. This was jarring to her. Before it had come as a mild surprise that the coin had been on her person all the time, and had come across as convenient. Now though? The entity controlling the coin seemed downright malevolent, only intent on impregnating its holder and everyone around them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole felt a tug on her mind, her hand shaking as she tried to resist flipping the coin again, knowing that if she grew any bigger, she would surely be all but immobile, her plans to thwart her mother dashed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after an eternity of struggling, Nicole...</span></div></div>",

Nicole\u2019s hand trembled, the coin resting on a cocked thumb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!\u201d Nicole burst out, throwing the coin across the room. Despite her huge weight she was up in a flash, working her way up the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClothes. Need to find clothes.\u201d She repeated, attempting to drown out the coin\u2019s influence. Impressed with her resolve, the coin was content to lay in wait for another victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole lumbered into her room, aching back and legs momentarily forgotten. She needed to get away from her apartment, away from the coin. But that didn\u2019t mean she was going to go out naked. Nicole hastily threw on a flimsy top and a tighter, but form-fitting pair of yoga pants. Neither garment did anything to hide the contours of her massive endowments, but would probably prevent her from being arrested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably. Nicole glanced at her clearly defined nipples. As she went through her apartment, she saw the coin resting near the wall. Resiting the urge to grab it on her way out, she barged outside into her newly expectant neighbor, eyes wide as saucers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry!\u201d Nicole called back. Broken from her trance, it seemed like something had clicked in the girl\u2019s brain. She turned but found an empty hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Or is it sweated?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pondered as she wiped her brow. Regardless, she was sweating. A lot. Her tight shirt had become her tight damp shirt. Probably not getting arrested for indecent exposure was abruptly downgraded to hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the visible outline of her boobs, she plunged her hand into her cleavage. Like a scuba diver plunging into the deep sea, her hand traveled deeper and deeper into her crevasse, finally emerging triumphant phone in her grasp. The Luber driver would be arriving any minute. She brought her phone up but found that she couldn't quite make her hands reach over her massive breasts. Frowning, she made due with one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still had her eyes glued to the screen as she squeezed into the sedan that had pulled to the curb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026Nicole?\u201d The driver\u2019s eyes flitted from screen to the belly and breasts that had just pushed their way into his back seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Nicole\u2019s face followed as she heaved her stomach further into the car. Leaning forward, she pulled the door closed behind her. The driver stared open-mouthed, phone still dangling from his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026let\u2019s go!\u201d Shifting his gaze slightly he saw Nicole had finally looked up from her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Oh right, sorry!\u201d Nicole rolled her eyes. In a past life, she would\u2019ve berated the poor man. But this was a changed Nicole, a better Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStep on it, pervert!\u201d She barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes ma\u2019am!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, so she hadn\u2019t changed that much. Mentally. She still liked to think that the driver was staring at her chin-level boobs rather than her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Bigger...bigger is good.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~*~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetty! Over here!\u201d Nicole tipped her head backwards out of the window blindly waving her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNicole? What\u2019s going on, who\u2019s this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever mind, just get in. We have to go. <b>Now</b>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm. Okay.\u201d Betty lowered herself into the front seat grinning nervously at the driver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi.\u201d An uneasy hand pulled a strand of hair behind her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, guy?\u201d Nicole called from the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh, Guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour name is Guy.\u201d A few moments of silence filled whatever space Nicole hadn\u2019t. She quickly shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. GUY. Let\u2019s go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m actually supposed to pick up my next fare\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere!\u201d Nicole dug in her cleavage again, pulling out a mashed wad of bills. \u201cNow let\u2019s go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Guy alternated between paying attention to the road and the enormous pregnant women filling his car, Nicole explained what had transpired on the phone that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really think Lucile\u2019s cheating on your dad?\u201d Betty twisted around, trying to get a good look at Nicole through the rest of Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know what I heard, Betty! But I need proof. That\u2019s where you come in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe? Why me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really think I can be stealthy?\u201d Nicole gestured towards her enormous torso, \u201cNo, it\u2019s gotta be you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019m not exactly small myself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re practically thin compared to me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you seen how big my-\u201c The two girls continued to argue how the other should be the one to go, their metaphors for their body parts growing larger and larger. After a few minutes, the car slowed to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, I could do it.\u201d Guy spoke up. The two girls whipped around, looking at their driver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou?\u201d Nicole said, incredulously. \u201cHow could you do it? You don\u2019t even know what she looks like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, um, you said your dad\u2019s not home, right? And it\u2019s only supposed to be your mom and another guy?\u201d Nicole tried to cross her arms and harrumph, but couldn\u2019t quite manage. Her scowl deepened to compensate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI <i>guess </i>that would work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah Nicole,\u201d Betty bounced back into her seat a carefully placed hand landing on his thigh, \u201clet\u2019s give Guy a chance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019ll be right back!\u201d Guy practically jumped out of the car and crashed through the bushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuiet! And don\u2019t let her see you!\u201d Nicole hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm, he\u2019s cute! Don\u2019t you think Nicole?\u201d Betty purred after the door had shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEw. No. He\u2019s like a 4/10. Maybe 5. Not like Marcus\u2026\u201d Nicole sighed as she remembered his taught muscles, strong hands and huge\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got it!\u201d Guy had burst back into the car, already backing the car out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? There\u2019s no way you got the pictures that quickly!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere!\u201d Guy tossed his phone to the back seat, bouncing off of Nicole\u2019s stomach. Scowling, she reached over her breasts and leafed through the pictures. A second was all she needed to confirm his story was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh God, I\u2019m going to be sick\u2026\u201d Nicole dramatically cast the phone back to the front, landing in Betty\u2019s lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, even in the foyer? Your mom\u2019s kind of a slut, Nicole.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me something I don\u2019t know.\u201d Nicole mimed a dry heave. The thought of her mother cheating was one thing, actually seeing proof of it was enough to make her physically ill. But now she had the proof. She could expose her lying whore of a mother. But that could really wait until tomorrow...</span></div></div>",

Bobbing back up she rapped the back of the driver\u2019s headrest,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuy, take me home.\u201d She declared, slurring her words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re, uh, actually here already.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride to her parents\u2019 home was neither far or long, but Nicole stole the opportunity to ensconce herself in the backseat. She found that there was no easy way to push herself backwards. Once Betty had exhausted herself trying to pull Nicole from her leather prison, Guy found himself enlisted. After a few minutes of pulling and repositioning Nicole popped out. She swore that she felt herself bounce on the pavement, especially after the shock-waves persisted for minutes afterwards. Nicole found herself yawning while Guy and Betty gritted their teeth heaving Nicole to her feet. Finally getting the enormous girl upright Guy made a hasty retreat to his car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Guy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spun around. Betty faced his car, hip cocked. Mouthing \u2018I\u2019ll call you,\u2019 she winked and turned back. He stared open-mouthed as the girls slowly went out of sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls waddled in tandem taking up most of the hallway. Only six days earlier Betty would be whining and complaining about her feet, her back, her shoes, her classes, etc. Basically anything that came to mind. But those would be empty words to Nicole now. Betty couldn\u2019t help but stare at her friend with a little envy. Her breasts, threatening to bounce out of her flimsy shirt at any moment. Or her butt, so huge that it was close to ripping her yoga pants down the seam. Or her belly\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Nicole are you bigger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm, wha?\u201d Nicole had entered hibernation mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re definitely bigger.\u201d Bettie stopped and pivoted around Nicole\u2019s stomach, sizing her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike, a lot. What the hell happened?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA magic coin. Made us pregnant.\u201d Nicole plowed through Betty to reach her apartment door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMagic coin? What are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere.\u201d Nicole pointed to the wall where the coin laid undisturbed. She flopped onto the couch, her eyes immediately closing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, Nicole, don\u2019t go to sleep. What are you talking about?\u201d Betty thought about shaking her by the shoulders but reconsidered when she imagined trying to lean over Nicole\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCoin. Pregnancy.\u201d Nicole murmured. Betty continued to try to rouse her, but it was no use. Nicole.exe had crashed and it would take a while for her to reboot. With nothing else to do, Betty waddled over to the coin. One not so graceful stoop later, Betty had her prize. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you\u2026\u201d Betty muttered, looking the coin over. The longer she examined the coin, the more she wanted to pore over it. The pregnant man and woman called to her flushing her mind of anything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn command, she positioned the coin on her thumb. She looked up settling on the slumbering form of Nicole. All at once Betty felt her stomach drop, as if something terrible was going to happen. Turning slightly, she found her own reflection looking off of a piece of art Nicole had on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she felt her thumb ready to release...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Betty flipped the coin and caught it with a grace she'd never had before, Nicole had been the more coordinated one of the duo after all, she found herself staring at her reflection in a glass-work that Nicole had gotten in order to look more \"intellectual,\" as the blond had put it. Though both of the girls had known in actuality that Nicole knew next to nothing about art, it had been somewhat successful as a conversation piece to get the ball rolling more than once during one of Nicole's many trysts with the opposite sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Though at this point I'm not sure if she's actually too BIG.</i> Betty sighed. Even though she'd complained at first about becoming a single mother of unborn twins so suddenly, after witnessing her friends more than substantial growth in all areas she couldn't help but feel a little...jealous of her best friend. She kept telling herself it was probably the fact that Nicole now vastly out scaled her in the T&amp;A charts, when before she'd only lagged behind her friend a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she HAD occasionally wondered over the past couple of days what it felt like to be as huge as Nicole was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spirit of the coin, already priming its magic, caught the line of thought, and knew that this host was much easier to manipulate than the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hadn't realized just how stubborn a Winters woman could be until it was too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeizing the opportunity, it worked more quickly this time, and while it had already landed on tails once, it held back the growth for now, so as not to raised suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty snapped back to reality, feeling woozy, but otherwise okay. Looking down at the coin, she recalled hazily that Nicole had mumbled something about a coin making them pregnant. Remembering that seemed to break her out of the trance she was in, as she suddenly felt her thoughts clear up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, no way am I flipping this coin,\" she muttered, not realizing that she'd already flipped it once, \"this must've been the coin Nicole mentioned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me!</span> It commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>N-No!</i> Betty winced, feeling the pressure on her mind, <i>gotta focus! Don't flip the coin.</i> The coin noticed the resistance, and realized that maybe force wasn't the best way to go about things. After all, even though Betty's mind was weaker than Nicole's, it didn't want to risk pressing too much and shattering her mind, which would end disastrously for all parties involved with its magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, it would try a different tactic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Do you not desire the same gifts I bestowed upon your friend?</span> The coin coaxed gently. The release of pressure and the voice's change in tone caught Betty's attention, and she glanced over at Nicole and bit her lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I mean...maybe it would be nice...\" she trailed off, her mind slowly beginning to let up some of its defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Yes!</span> The coin spurred her on, <span class=\"clred\">you desire at least SOME of the gifts your friend has partaken of do you not?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes...I do!\" Betty felt the words fall out of her tongue on their own, while staring back at her own reflection once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Then flip me!</span> The coin crowed triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty flipped the coin almost immediately, any resistance to the coin's influence now non-existant. She flipped not once, not twice, but three <b>times</b> in a row, making the number of times she'd flipped it four in total.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coin didn't waste time deliberating whether Betty's growth would be slower or instantaneous this time around, as it had decided that Betty had a bit of \"catching-up\" to do in comparison to the other women it had impregnated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that the coin would take revenge on Nicole's resistance by manipulating her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn comparison to Betty's previous twin-filled growth all those days ago, this one nearly <b>exploded</b> in terms of speed, due in no small part due to the fact that the poor girl had been tricked into stacking four growths at once, and so our pregnant heroine found in the span of two seconds that her clothing stood no chance of survival. Her bra had already snapped off in about three seconds as her breasts began to rapidly spill forth, and her panties hadn't fared much better, barely holding together, but ripping all the way down the middle except for a few centimeters of fabric still left at the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shirt had been one she'd usually used for working out, and was flexible, but soon got pushed past its limits as Betty's belly and breasts soon outgrew it not halfway through the growth, and it soon perished as it gave way to the girl's growing assets. Betty also managed to prove that hips do indeed tend not to lie as they flared out drastically, preparing to hold up the immensity of her growth that was still progressing while also taking away her track pants' claim of 'one size fits all.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong after the girl had fallen back into the nearby recliner to watch her steadily growing body, and after her clothes had long since given up most of her modesty, her panties were still miraculously intact. though that wasn't saying much as the massive tear in them had exposed almost all of her now much larger butt-crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the growth had ceased, and the haze in her mind had lifted, Betty paled as she looked over her much larger body. Feeling the kicks within her, she tried to pinpoint a number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>One...Two...Four...Seven?!?</i> She counted in shock, causing her to hyperventilate. She had already been worried about supporting two children, but seven? All of Betty's previous plans now reflected the state of her clothes, tattered and in complete shambles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay Betty... breathe</i> she told herself, closing her eyes to focus on slowing her breathing down to a more stable level. Once she calmed down enough to think clearly again, she opened her eyes and looked around once more. Unsurprisingly, Nicole was still fast asleep, snoring loudly enough for Betty to have mistaken the sound for a car's engine having some problems starting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph,\" she rolled her eyes, \"figures that she'd <b>still</b> be asleep through all of that.\" Figuring that walking around a little more wouldn't hurt, Betty tried to get up in order to at least find herself some clothes to cover herself in, but found that heaving herself out of a recliner with seven children inside of her was a lot harder than it was with two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't been much better in Math than Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after rocking herself forward, she managed to stumble forward out of the chair and nearly ended up landing on her now immense belly, and she noted with a tiny bit of glee that while she was still nowhere near Nicole's immensity, her own swollen abdomen had done its best to catch up, and was probably only a foot or two smaller at this point. After plodding up the stairs, taking more than a few breaks to catch her breath, she entered Nicole's room and began to rummage through her closet to see what she could find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Betty found that all the clothes had been picked out for a Nicole that had been half of the size she was now, and so the redhead found herself in the same predicament that Nicole had been in two days ago, meaning that none of Nicole's bras were going to fit her at this point. This she actually took pride in. This meant that the blue v-neck she'd found was now under employment as her new still mildly tight bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a much easier time with her pants, as all of them were able to at least stretch to her hips and butt in a manner where they wouldn't rip. She figured her panties could stay for now, since they'd held up well enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at herself in the mirror, she couldn't help but admire her new septuplet-laden form, which oddly enough seemed very close to term, much like her twin pregnancy had been. She had to guess that by the size of her belly, she had passed the eight month mark and had advanced into the ninth month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for her breasts, well, she knew Nicole's bras had been a size 32-I, but if she had to compare, Betty would have said that her previous amount of cleavage shown compared to Nicole's had been like comparing a puddle to the Atlantic ocean. Now? She knew she had at least grown enough to be categorized as one of the Five Great Lakes to Nicole's Atlantic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same could be said of her now quite curvaceous posterior, which posed a much more imminent threat to Nicole's than her breasts had. Luckily, the new yoga pants were doing much better at containing her bottom than her previous ones had, which wasn't saying much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter donning her new outfit, she waddled over to Nicole's bed and carefully heaved herself onto it, figuring that she would get better use out of it than its usual occupant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter laying in bed for a while and feeling the kicks of her expanded litter, she felt conflicted. She didn't know what the hell she was gonna do to support seven kids, and felt that she needed solace from somebody, anybody at all! On the other hand, she knew that with Nicole bigger than a house, it was now up to her to investigate the coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe the library knows something?</i> She thought, shrugging to herself and noting to herself that it would be a good idea to call the library about the coin tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, now she deliberated on the fact of who she would confide in about her current situation, and ruled out most of the people on her list since it was almost midnight at this point. She had almost given up on the idea when she remembered someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about that driver from earlier? Guy?\" she mused, \"I did say I'd call him after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally...<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She hadn\u2019t had a fuck since she had gotten pregnant a week ago; almost a record for her. As thoughts of one Guy in particular danced in her head she drifted off to sleep. As the girls settled in for their mid-day nap, the Winters across town were in for a change of scenery.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n~*~<br>\r\n <br>\r\nRachel was not happy. Sleeping on Nicole\u2019s couch, while great for their burgeoning relationship, had done no favors for her burgeoning body. Her co-workers almost dove for cover when they saw her coming. No one even mentioned her exposed belly. After one too many grumps, she was sent home for a long lunch. Perfectly fine for her, she could rest her sore back. She couldn\u2019t remember the last time she felt this poorly. Worse than when she had passed out on Sigma Nu\u2019s deck after a particularly excessive night.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe worked her aching muscles as she waddled back to her apartment, thoughts focused solely on collapsing on her bed. So wrapped up in her thoughts, she failed to notice her sister balled up on her doorstep.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOw! Watch it, bigfoot!\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cJenny, what the hell?\u201d The normally confident, even arrogant, sister was balled up at the foot of her door. Makeup smeared across her face, normally coiffed hair in complete disarray. A picture of her like this might even be enough to sink her career in media.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJenny bit her lip, \u201cThis.\u201d She swept back the blanket covering her. Rachel meant to gasp, really she did. But spending time with Nicole had perverted her sense of reality. Hidden below the warm folds was a belly. One that would have been the largest she had ever seen, again, if not for Nicole. So rather than babble incoherently about how this happened, it was impossible, all that jazz, Rachel simply smirked and offered a hand up.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nOnce upright, Rachel was enjoying a little more schadenfreude than she should have. Jenny\u2019s clothes fit even worse than hers. The model-thin queen of Channel 5 had been reduced to the door-wide visitor of apt. 29. She listened to her sister\u2019s tale of woe, how she started blowing up only a few days ago. The doctor confirmed that she was pregnant, exceedingly so. She couldn\u2019t help but giggle when she described the horror of exploding out of her top on camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she patted her sister on the back while she cried into her new blouse she realized how...annoyed Nicole must\u2019ve felt.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<i>Good thing I bought that bitch dinner.</i><br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWe might as well start a support group.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWh-what?\u201d Jenny blubbered. Rachel grabbed her shoulders and pushed back. She rolled her eyes at Jenny\u2019s gasp. Somehow she had managed to feel past the large belly pushing into her own. Just like she had done with Nicole.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cRachel,\u201d Jenny sniffled, \u201cwhy is this happening to me?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cProbably because you\u2019re such a huge slut.\u201d Rachel beamed at her sobbing sister. After a moment of looking like a kicked puppy, Jenny\u2019s frown turned into a smile. Through the tears she started laughing. Rachel couldn\u2019t help but chuckle a bit herself. Jenny wiped a tear from her eye, though this time it wasn\u2019t from sadness.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a bitch.\u201d She finally got out.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI learned from the best. Now come on.\u201d Back pain forgotten, Rachel led her swollen sister out the door.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWhere are we going? I can\u2019t go out like this.\u201d She gestured to her naked belly and clearly braless chest.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI told you, our support group. I promise you\u2019ll feel better.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n~*~<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit!\u201d Jenny mouthed.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI told you.\u201d The two sister stood in awe of the slumbering form of Nicole.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHow is this possible? She wasn\u2019t even showing at dinner!\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t either.\u201d They stood in silence, disregarding the uproarious snores from Nicole. Rachel couldn\u2019t help but stare. Only a couple days prior she was still somewhat normally sized. Now her boobs blotted out her head. Rachel couldn\u2019t fathom being that size, it would be so hard to move; it was already hard to get around.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJenny grew bored and waddled away, tutting at the apartment\u2019s decoration. But Rachel couldn\u2019t tear her eyes away from the unconscious Nicole. Every breath forced her chest higher, rippling with every movement. Warmth rushed into her cheeks. Large as she felt, she was nothing compared to Nicole. She slowly reached a hand out, gently stroking her belly. Her pale skin was almost hot to the touch. After a moment the snoring sputtered, a groan cutting through the noise.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs Rachel stared deep into her cleavage she imagined what it must feel like to be that size. How every touch must feel like a spark. Despite being exhausted from her pregnancy, Rachel had never slept worse. Each night she tossed and turned unable to scratch the itch. She almost called Peter, begging him to come home despite her swelling waist. Just to feel his rough hands on her. If she was Nicole\u2019s size she wouldn\u2019t be able to resist.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe saw herself so huge and full. Breasts bigger than her head, ass bigger than any pair of pants. Nothing would fit her. She would be forced to have help just to waddle around. She would be at the mercy of her husband. So swollen and huge that she wouldn\u2019t be able to resist. She could feel his strong hands forcibly turning her on her stomach, totally powerless as he forced himself ins-<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cRachel!\u201d She jumped, face burning. She turned to face her sister.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d She asked, holding up the coin.</span></div></div>",

Reality change!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel looked up at Jenny and stared as Jenny folded over. Time seemed to slow as Jenny's belly gurgled and then began to grow. The buttons on Jenny's blouse began to triangle as her already prodigous bosom swelled through her shirt and displayed her bra-less tits in all their glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny's already enormous belly pushed through her blouse like an elephant through tissue paper. Buttons flew off and pinged off glass all over the room as Jenny's belly flew through months of growth in only seconds. As her girth settled in the approximate range of a quadruplet pregnancy time seemed to return to its natural state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear what, Rachel?\" Jenny repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm... nothing,' Rachel replied. Did she just see what she thought she saw? In mere moments Jenny had gained another baby's worth of growth and remained oblivious to the matter. Rachel suspiciously looked at the coin, wondering if it truly was the cause of this whole debacle. Rachel looked at Jenny, then the coin, then at Jenny, then rested on the coin. The possibilities could be endless if this coin were actually the cause of all this pregnancy thing. After all, there really seemed to be a coincidence between the times that Rachel had seen Nicole with the coin and the times Rachel remembered the pregnancy issue coming into effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel squinted at Jenny at flipped the coin.

She rubbed her enlarged sides, an occasional bump could be seen in her nude belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis coin\u201d Nicole held it between her fingers, \u201cmade us pregnant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s-that\u2019s ridiculous, how could a coin make us pregnant?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole shrugged, \u201cI don\u2019t know. But how else do you explain this.\u201d She thrust her massive belly forward. \u201cWeren\u2019t you just screaming about getting bigger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah, but-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s all the yelling about?\u201d Betty waddled out, rubbing her eyes. Nicole outstretched her arms as if presenting her pregnant BFF. Realizing the room staring at her, Betty\u2019s face grew redder than her hair. She tried to cross her arms only to mash into the new bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd where did this come from?\u201d Nicole lightly tapped Betty\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026the coin.\u201d Betty grumbled. She felt her cheeks burn as the cousins stared at her new girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe coin! And if you still don\u2019t believe me, we can have a live demonstration.\u201d She whirled around so she faced her cousins, coin at the ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Jenny cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yes!</i> Betty and Rachel thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought so. Now come on, if you\u2019re here you might as well be useful.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoing what?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole\u2019s smile stretched her cheeks further than they thought possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re setting a trap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~*~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026and that\u2019s the plan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy am I going to help you again? I\u2019m pregnant too and I don\u2019t-Hey!\u201d Jenny shielded her face a second after a flash of light momentarily blinded her. Blinking, she saw Nicole dropping her phone into her cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can help me and in return I won\u2019t send that picture to your boss, coworkers or any of the other surrounding news stations.\u201d Nicole said-matter of-factly. Jenny\u2019s mouth opened, closed, opened, and then closed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t care.\u201d Nicole raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright fine, I\u2019ll help. God you\u2019re such a brat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLoooove you. Now get calling.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh.\u201d Jenny rolled her eyes and then rolled to her feet. Nicole squealed with glee seeing her cousin\u2019s pants splitting from her weighty backside. Jenny retrieved her own phone and dialed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Uncle Roger? It\u2019s Jenny\u2026It\u2019s good to talk to you too\u2026Auntie Lucille wanted me to call you and ask if you could come back for a dinner tomorrow instead of Friday\u2026Why can\u2019t she call me herself?\u201d Jenny looked towards the girls with her hand outstretched. Nicole grabbed some of her blonde locks and brought two of her fingers together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s uh getting her hair done\u2026You know how vain pregnant women are, ha.\u201d Jenny\u2019s free hand tugged on her undersized top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, we\u2019ll see you then! Bye uncle. UGH.\u201d She flopped on the couch, scowling at the bodily quakes she felt. \u201cI\u2019ve never lied to Uncle Roger before. I feel awful.\u201d She laid her forearm over her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey hey hey now,\u201d Nicole waddled over to her cousin, placing a hand on her knee, \u201cjust remember. If you fuck this up I will ruin your life.\u201d Jenny attempted to sit up to look properly outraged, but only managed pop of one of the last buttons off her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that that\u2019s settled...\u201d</span></div></div>",

Chewing on her bottom lip she hovered over the dial pad before hitting call. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho is this?\u201d Lucille demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAuntie Lucille? Hi, it\u2019s Rachel how\u2019s it going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Rachel.\u201d She shivered, \u201cCan I help you with something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell uncle Roger called me to let you know he\u2019s gonna be delayed a day or two. Something important came up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally. Now why didn\u2019t he call me?\u201d Rachel turned to find Nicole writhing on the couch, face contorted into faux-ecstasy. Rachel almost choked on a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe said he tried to call you this morning but couldn\u2019t get through. And Nicole didn\u2019t pick up either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTypical. Probably out trying to add even more to her litter. You heard that she\u2019s pregnant, I\u2019m assuming?\u201d Rachel glanced at the stomach doing its best to overwhelm her cousin. She swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI may have heard something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf she thinks her brood is getting on this gravy train she\u2019s ridden for so long she\u2019s got another thing coming. Thank you for the update. Goodbye.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If this works\u2026</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like anything is going to fit your fat ass anymore, why do you even care?\u201d Jenny\u2019s hands desperately worked to keep herself decent as her clothes continued to unravel around her. Nicole had somehow gotten to her feet, dress somehow in even worse state than her cousin. Her flimsy top only kept her within the definition of \u201cdecent\u201d through the most liberal interpretation. Pants were once again waging war against her lower half and losing soundly. Her cotton yoga pants more resembled lycra stretched over a barrel. If Rachel tugged on her collar she halfway expected a plume of steam to burst out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou never let me borrow any of your clothes, even stuff from last season, you deserve to be walking around nude!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike I would let your skanky ass wear anything designer? You should stick to off the rack, it suits you.\u201d Betty gasped, her hand slapping over her mouth. Rachel rolled her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake that back.\u201d Nicole bumped bellies, coin appearing clenched in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls, no fighting.\u201d Rachel sidled up to the girls and gave them a quick shove on the shoulder. Both girls mimed as if an earthquake had struck the apartment. As their built-in seismographs registered bigger and bigger quakes the two jiggled back into seated positions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d They both exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNicole, you\u2019re turning over a new leaf, right? So give your old clothes to Jenny. You\u2019re too fat for them anyway.\u201d Jenny sneered and stuck out her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJenny, without Nicole you\u2019d be famous and not for reasons you\u2019d like. Now play nice.\u201d Both girls grumbled before muttering some form of thanks and apologies.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOkay good, that\u2019s settled. Now we can\u2019t sit around here all day getting fat. ter.\u201d The woman gestating her own quartet grinned at the bulging women. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a few hours before it gets dark, what should we do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have to go shopping.\u201d Jenny piped up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t speak for preg-zilla over there but I can\u2019t go around in public like this. I have a reputation to uphold.\u201d Nicole opened her mouth to protest but thought again after looking out over her acres of naked bronzed skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe might be right.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I can\u2019t go shopping for all of you by myself.\u201d Scanning the room she settled on Betty. \u201cYou\u2019re the next most decent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not saying much.\u201d Betty blushed, rubbing her pale stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s either that or we all wait until we have to go shopping looking like Nicole.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Nicole was immediately inundated by a trio of side-eyes the women had been practicing their entire life. \u201cWell you could have been a little more sensitive.\u201d She pouted, sinking her arms into her chest as she attempted to cross them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I\u2019m sorry princess. Unless you don\u2019t want your ass hanging out like <i>someone</i> who will remain nameless we need to go today.\u201d Nicole pouted but was in agreement. The clothes she ordered wouldn\u2019t arrive for a couple days and she wasn\u2019t sure they would fit when they did get here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s settled then. We\u2019ll go shopping while you two...don\u2019t get any more pregnant.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It\u2019ll be good to get away from the coin anyway.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh. I think I can manage that.\u201d Jenny was still fidgeting with her ill-fitting top. Does the coin cooperate?</span></div></div>",

Can you call us a lift, Betty?\u201d Betty was starting to see why Nicole, up until recently, hated her cousins. Her thumb hovered over the Luber app before rethinking and hitting the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Guy? This is Betty, do you remember me? You gave me and my friend the whale a ride earlier?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-oh yeah, hi, how\u2019s it go-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen Guy, we need to get to a mall but we\u2019re a bit too big to drive. Do you think you could pick us up? I\u2019d owe you one.\u201d Betty purred into the receiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-sure! I\u2019ll leave right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thanks Guy. You\u2019re the best.\u201d Hanging up she found Rachel staring at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was just trying to remember the last time I flirted with a guy like that and I wasn\u2019t just trying to get him to do something for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s this,\u201d Betty swept a hand over her enormous womb, \u201cbut I would normally never go after a guy like this. He\u2019s so...plain. And he drives a cab. But I just can\u2019t get him off of my mind.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel bit her lip, her skin on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo about...that. How did that happen, exactly?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI saw that Nicole was even bigger than this morning and she mentioned something about a coin. I don\u2019t know what came over me but the next thing I remember is blowing up.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow-how did it feel?\u201d Rachel panted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmazing,\u201d Betty\u2019s eyed rolled in her head. \u201cIt was like, the best sex I\u2019ve ever had times a million. Even Gary couldn\u2019t come close. I think I even had an orgasm. I never thought I\u2019d love being a fat cow but I think it looks good on me, don\u2019t you?\u201d Betty wiggled her hips ever so slightly setting her rear in motion. Rachel almost fanned herself as she watched the sea of flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRachel? Rachel?\u201d Rachel jerked out of her reverie, hands clasping behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuy\u2019s here.\u201d Betty said, clamboring in the back seat.

Wincing, she did her best to annoy the schockwave it sent rippling through her breasts and the way it spurred her brood to start kicking up a storm. \"A-after all, I didn't any of this stupid trap business after discovering I was <i>pregnant</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? You want a medal?\" Nicole dryly snarked, pointing to her own monstrously swollen womb \"because unless you've got the seven or eight or so I'm cramming in here I don't think you get to complain.\" Sighing, Nicole shook her head as she took a deep breath to try and calm down. \"Look, I get it Jenny, you were dragged into this, but fighting like this only makes thing suck even worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Astute observation there oh wise one.\" Jenny snickered, while trying to cross her arms in a haughty display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU- ok look...\" Nicole flared her nostrils, catching herself as she nearly flew off the handle, \"I'm just...I'm just trying to call a truce okay? At least give me something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what?\" Jenny reeled back, stunned that Nicole actually chose to try and end the argument rather than continue it like she usually would. \"When did <i>you</i> of all girls suddenly become Ms. Mature?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I got this.\" Nicole answered with a light tap of her belly. \"I dunno...I guess...I guess now that this whole being a mom thing is finally clicking  in my brain I feel like I have to get my sh*t together or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...why?\" Jenny gave the blonde a puzzled look. \"It's not like you're gonna keep the kids or anything.\" Jenny tapped a finger to her chin in thought as she continued, \"I mean, I figured you would just give them all up for adoption or something.\" Looking up, she saw Nicole sporting a frown that suddenly made Jenny grow wary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you can't possibly be <i>serious?</i>\" Jenny balked at the notion of <i>Nicole</i> giving birth to and then raising even <i>one</i> child, let alone the army she had sitting in her gut currently. \"You've never shown enough responsibility to even get a <i>job!</i> Much less raise a kid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...have a job now...\" Nicole lamely threw out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well congratulations <i>Nicky.</i>\" Jenny snarled, the other girl's nickname drenched in sarcasm. \"Now how do you expect to do that and raise seven or eight kids huh? I bet you didn't even plan for this pregnancy in the first place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole felt her rage building and her eyes welling with tears as her cousin piled on more insults and accusations. She clenched her fists so hard she was sure the skin on her knuckles were back to her original pale hue before all the tanning salon visits, and she had to lock her jaw in place to keep herself from biting into her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to hiss, spit, throw back everything Jenny said to her and more. However, there was one big factor keeping her from doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She's right.</i> Nicole realized. <i>Every word is true, I didn't plan for this at all...I'm not responsible, I only got the job because of that stupid coin...</i> Nicole felt tears start to stream down her face, and yet despite the fact that she knew her makeup was probably ruined, she felt a spark of resolve begin to light within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me Nicole?\" Jenny said, having ranted for minutes on end before starting to finally wrap it up, \"just <i>why</i> would you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>I don't know!</b></i>\" Nicole shouted, immediately shutting down the other girl with her vehment interjection. \"I...I don't know.\" She repeated shakily, looking up from her vast valley of cleavage to meet her cousin's eyes. \"I...I guess I just want them to have a mom who gives a d*mn about them. Since I never had that chance...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny was floored. For one thing, she'd never in her life ever witnessed Nicole crying around her. The furthest the two's fights had ever taken them was a slap fight when they were kids that lasted all of two seconds before their dad's broke it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecondly, as Jenny placed a hand on her own gravid orb of life, feeling her children move within her, she couldn't help but feel like she'd been stuck in her own headspace for too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...uh...\" Jenny paused as she collected herself, \"that's surprisingly deep Nicole...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it?\" Nicole chuckled weakly, before flashing a sad smile at her cousin, \"doesn't change the fact that you're right though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah...\" Jenny admitted, \"you are still pretty irresponsible, and a total b*tch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Real</i> ball of sunshine you are,\" Nicole huffed, sniffling as she rubbed her eyes with the back of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>But</i>,\" Jenny added hastily, not used to complimenting the girl in front of her, \"I can see that you're serious about this, so maybe...maybe I was wrong? Just a bit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say that one more time? I need that as your caller ID.\" Nicole smirked as she pulled her phone out from the depths of her cleavage and wiggled it in her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not <i>even</i> in your dreams octomom.\" Jenny retorted snootily, though she couldn't help the smile working it's way onto her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Booooo!\" Nicole said, dropping her phone back into the ocean of flesh a light bounce of her boobs signifying the phone had landed, \"at least I heard it, though I doubt you'll ever admit to saying it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it!\" Jenny giggled, before her look softened. \"Look Nicole...sorry for that whole rant earlier. To be honest I can respect your choice in a way and I guess....I want to keep these brats in me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So truce?\" Nicole offered her hand hopefully, looking up at her cousin once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Guess I can't really say no after that little moment.\" Jenny sighed as they firmly shook hands. After that however, a silence drifted upon them once more, and they looked up at the clock to find that only twenty minutes had passed, though it felt like hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Back to square one I guess,</i> Nicole thought, before coming up with a plan as she turned to Jenny, \"so cousin...since I revealed <i>that</i> hefty tidbit about myself...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...do I have to?\" Jenny moaned, trying to sink back into the couch as much as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you did make me cry and ruin my makeup so yes.\" Nicole declared with a giggle. \"Now get up and get my makeup, you can at least return the favor and tell me one of your deep dark pregnancy secrets while you fix the mess you caused.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fiiiiiine...\" Jenny groaned as she miraculously hefted herself off the couch and lumbered towards the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And bring me some snacks too! I've got nine mouths to feed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate you!\" Was the shout that was returned, though it was devoid of any actual malice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looooove youuuuu~\" Nicole sang back as a genuine smile worked its way onto her face. <i>Huh, I guess hanging out with Jenny might not be so bad after all...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this was going on however...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finally, after an eternity of struggling, Nicole listened to the voice. It calmed her, soothed her. Nicole looked at herself before she found the coin. She saw a skinny little girl, selfish, uncaring. She saw how the coin had given her purpose in her life. Every day her belly had grown and every day her reality had become more stable. To say she was in ecstasy was an understatement. The influence of the coin rolled over every thought in Nicole's brain and all she could feel was the complete bliss of carrying life. Nicole's free hand caressed her enormous belly. Somewhere in the depths of her consciousness a skinny little girl screamed at her, shouting back at the sheer size of her pregnancy. That tiny girl led to reason, saying that seven babies was plenty, eight or more was crazy, and flipping the coin for even more was pure insanity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">Flip me Nicole!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made sense. Pregnancy was beauty. Bigger was better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole didn't even sense the movement in her fingers that caused the flip, only the gentle movement of air caused by the rotation of the golden disc. A subtle, evil chuckle resonated through her, and though Nicole knew that she had given in to the coin's desire, the sheer pleasure she experienced ruled out all doubt.<br>\r\nA gentle thought informed her that she had previously been the carrier of nine fetuses, but when Nicole caught the coin she knew that was soon to be left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">Tails! No reality change!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole first felt the change in her breasts. Though enormous before, now they surpassed the imagination. Roughly the size of beachballs, Nicole felt a warm pulse over their expanse as they swelled. Her nipples erupted from her smooth skin as they engorged larger than any she had ever known, leaking small drops of milk from the huge reservoirs behind them. The rest of her bosom immediately followed suit, her boobs pushing up closer to her chin, inflating beyond any measurement that she could comprehend as they became as large as a normal pregnant belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the warmth in her breasts dissipate, Nicole rested her hands on her belly. A gurgle passed through her gravidity and she felt the expansion start. She could swear she actually felt babies implant in her womb and then proceed to age to a nine month maturity. Her shirt flew off her body, no longer able to cover any square inch of her gravid womb. Eventually her underwear joined the useless shirt as her waist increased to sizes never before seen by man. Nicole slowly sunk to the floor as her belly became too heavy to carry for the time she remained standing. She could feel her thighs spread wider as her belly occupied the only space it could. Her arousal heightened with every millimeter of growth she experienced. The feel of the carpet on her belly, her nipple between her fingers, and the warmth of bloating with an unnatural number of children came crashing down on her as she came as she never had before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA creak from the front door announced the arrival of both Betty and Rachel with shopping bags in hand.<br>\r\n\"Nicole, we found some clothes for you!\" came the sound of Betty's voice. The girls heard a loud moan from the bedroom. Curious, they approached the door and were greeted by a titanic wall of flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! Nicole!\" exclaimed Rachel. <br>\r\nNicole looked up at them, lost in a haze of insurmountable pleasure, and grinned. \"Oh,hey girls.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was another day down and another day arriving for our pregnant heroines as they felt the kicks of their children let them know that it was both time to wake up and time to eat once again, despite the Chinese binge that the three young mothers had shared last night amongst gossiping.<br>\r\n\tRachel was the first to wake up of the three as she tried to ignore the ruckus her brood was making inside of her womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUgh fine...\u201d she groaned quietly as her eyes fluttered open. Looking around she spotted Betty, who despite her initial expectations showed no signs of growing any larger, the redhead having stayed exactly the same size all around. She counted her cousin's best friend lucky that she didn't have to deal with getting progressively larger so quickly, but at the same time she found it odd. I wonder why me and Nicole have been growing larger and she hasn't...though from what she told me last night she had started out bigger than the rest of us at first. The brunette sighed and rubbed her forehead in frustration. There was so much that they didn't know about, and it was driving her crazy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWell I'm sure the doctors will at least clear a few things up when we go visit them today, the brunette reassured herself. Looking down at herself she found that she wasn't surprised in the least to see that she had grown once again. Her white and green-sleeved t-shirt that she'd put on for dinner had fit her well enough last night; covering all except a tiny portion of her belly. Now though it seemed that the shirt couldn't be bothered to cover much except for her her breasts, leaving her belly bared for all of the world, or more accurately all of her cousin's condo to see. Speaking of the two aforementioned residents, she found that her maternity bra had gone from slightly loose-fitting to uncomfortably tight in the span of about six hours, which if the insane growth of her cousin's monstrous breasts was anything to go by it would only increase as time went on. After seeing this she was at least relieved to find that her butt hadn't grown all that much, as she still felt comfortable in her own pair of sweatpants, though she could definitely feel that her hips had widened a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cChecking yourself out cousin? Geez and you said I was the one too into themselves!\u201d Rachel's eyes snapped up in surprise as she heard her cousin giggling at her. Once her eyes landed on the girl in question however the brunette made no effort to hold her shock in as her jaw dropped at the sight of her cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTo say Nicole's belly was merely huge at this point was like saying that her parents were only kinda rich. What word could accurately describe Nicole's colossal tan dome Rachel didn't know, but it probably only existed in some obscure dictionary that only scientists used, considering that it was jutting out of her cousin's body by about four to four and a half feet, the outie on its crest sticking out like a cute little nub. Much to Rachel's surprise it seemed that Nicole's body hadn't decided to pour any more milk into her breasts today, which was fine by her because as far as Rachel was concerned those didn't need to be growing any larger lest they burst out of Nicole's shirt, which was already turned into nothing but a glorified sports bra at this point. Considering that the belly took up most of her view of Nicole the brunette couldn't tell whether or not her butt had grown any, but if her view of it yesterday was anything to go by it was probably just as ridiculous as the blonde's breasts judging by how much her sweatpants were stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUh N-Nicole...\u201d Rachel breathed, unsure of what to say next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah I know,\u201d Nicole sighed, saving her cousin from trying to dance around the issue, \u201cI'm absolutely massive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell you seem to be taking it pretty well,\u201d Rachel snarked, \u201cwhat do you like getting this huge or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cW-What?!? No way!\u201d Nicole yelped, \u201cwho the hell would ever want to be this big?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOkay okay geez! Calm down!\u201d Rachel snickered at her cousin, \u201cI was only joking with you.\u201d This seemed to appease Nicole, who began to lay back into the couch she was on. However, Rachel knew better than to point out that despite her cousin's denial, she'd turned a shade of red too suspicious for someone who hated getting that huge from being pregnant. She didn't really know why her cousin would bother to hide something like that though, because if she was totally honest with herself Rachel had to admit there was something a bit exciting about being a mother. Also, she had to admit there was a certain air of...wonder she got whenever she saw how huge her cousin was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe might have even been a little jealous that her belly was so small in comparison. But that couldn't be true...right? She asked herself, biting her lip as she placed both hands on her gravid form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUgh geez guys quiet down...\u201d the two cousins turned to Betty after hearing her annoyed groans from underneath the couch pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMorning sleeping beauty.\u201d Nicole teased as she threw another pillow at her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh shut up you bi- holy...\u201d Betty stopped herself as she took in her bestie's new size, \u201cNicky...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah yeah we get it I grew again!\u201d Nicole cut her off with an annoyed huff, \u201cgeez you all act like I'm some kind of undiscovered animal or something!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell to be fair I don't think anyone has ever carried seven kids as far as you have before.\u201d Rachel pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah well...shut up.\u201d Nicole finished lamely, causing the other two to laugh. A comfortable silence descended upon the three as they each tended to the kicks of their children, and all was well.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tThen there was a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUh Nicole?\u201d Rachel inquired, though the shrug that her cousin gave her told her that she hadn't been expecting anyone either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Betty can you get that?\u201d Nicole pleaded with her best friend,\u201cI would but I'm not sure if I'm able to even walk right now...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSure Nicky,\u201d Betty said with a warm smile, \u201curgh just gimme a sec.\u201d After heaving herself up the redhead waddled over to the door and peeked through the peephole. The two cousins noticed immediately that something was up when they saw their friend's face pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell Betty,\u201d Nicole prompted anxiously, \u201cwho is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt's...\u201d</span></div></div>",

She isn't!\u201d Betty hastily replied, obviously not wanting to continue the conversation, \u201cshe actually had to go...out of town...with her family for a couple of days since her cousins were visiting.\u201d Nicole silently cheered as she heard Betty come up with a reasonably legitimate excuse on the spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh.\u201d Chris said, dejected, \u201cwait then why are you here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTo watch her stuff while she's away! Duh!\u201d Betty replied as if she was talking to an idiot, and in Nicole's mind she was indeed talking to quite a big idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh well uh when she gets back can you tell he-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell nice talking to ya but I gotta go.\u201d Betty said, rolling her eyes in annoyance as she slammed the door shut on him before he could finish his reply. All three girls then waited with baited breath, none of them daring to move until they finally heard footsteps walk away after what seemed like hours. After that the girls all sighed in relief now that the proverbial pest had finally left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat a nuisance,\u201d Betty muttered as she waddled back to the couch and sat down with a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI think nuisance might be too good for that guy,\u201d Nicole said, shaking her head in frustration, \u201cI can't believe he still hasn't picked up that we're never going to be a thing again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell sometimes guys are persistent. So I wouldn't worry about it too much Nicole.\u201d Rachel said, trying to bring the tension in the room down. \u201cAnyways, we should probably head out here in a bit, we need to get to the doctor's office as early as we can so that not too many people see us.\u201d Rachel suggested as she looked at her watch, which currently read 6:15.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood idea!\u201d Betty chirped, \u201cwe can probably get it over with and then eat breakfast once we get back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSounds good to me, I just woke up and I'm already starving.\u201d Nicole agreed, her stomach  loudly voicing its agreement at the mention of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I'm not surprised Nicky,\u201d Betty winked slyly at her best friend, \u201cnow come on, let's get you up off the couch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was a tedious task, with Betty first heaving herself up off her side of the couch, while Rachel slowly got herself standing as well. After they both waddled slowly over to Nicole, who was impatiently wriggling her fingers for them to grab, they took hold and grunted. The mother of seven's weight gain was definitely showing as it took them a few tries to even move her from off the couch, but finally, after ten minutes they managed to balance the hugely pregnant Nicole on her feet. Betty and Rachel had already waddled out the front door, but Nicole hadn't even made it to the doorway before her legs were begging for rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCrap,\u201d she panted tiredly, \u201call that walking yesterday wore me out, I can barely move...\u201d a few more steps towards the front door was all she could manage before she bent over, one hand steadying herself on the wall, the other rubbing her belly to sooth her children, who were obviously not happy at being woken up so early in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNicole!\u201d She heard Rachel and Betty heading back towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSorry guys,\u201d she wheezed, \u201cjust taking a little breather...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCome on.\u201d Betty said gently, \u201cwe'll help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCome on guys,\u201d Nicole protested weakly as they linked her arms around their shoulders, \u201cI can...make it...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNonsense Nicole,\u201d Rachel said sternly, \u201cwe're all pregnant without explanation, so we're in this together!\u201d The soon to be birthday girl felt tears welling up in her eyes. A few days she didn't even want to think about what it was like being pregnant, and she'd been so full of hate towards her cousins. Now here she was, pregnant with not one, but seven children, arm in arm with her best friend and her new friend and cousin, Rachel, supporting each other as if they'd known each other for years!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFor the first time in her life Nicole wasn't taking these relationships for granted, and strangely enough, she actually felt like getting pregnant had ended up being a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNow Rachel and Betty had been used to going slow, being pregnant and all, but with the weight of Nicole and how huge she was they were practically going at a snail's pace! Luckily, they managed to snag an empty elevator close by, which was miraculously wide enough for all three of them to fit into. Then, they carefully made their way to Rachel's van, and hoisted Nicole's gravid form into the backseat. Rachel hopped into the passenger's seat as they all agreed that Betty should drive since she was currently the smallest in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOf course, even though the redhead was indeed the smallest of the group, driving with a full-term twin-sized belly was no easy feat. However, the challenge was at least mitigated by the fact that not too many people were out at this hour. Finally, after a somewhat rough ride they had finally arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRachel had gone off to go check them in while Betty went off to go find an easier way to get Nicole in, leaving the lattermost girl alone with her thoughts. As she sat in silence, gently caressing her belly, the past couple of days weighed heavily on her mind. Getting pregnant, growing so fast, the ultrasound, her mom's visiting, everything. What if I can't do it? She wondered, what if I don't make a good mom? Maybe Lucille was right... Nicole felt moisture beginning to form in her eyes I just barely got a job, don't have any baby supplies or anything! She shouted angrily at herself, and by now the tears were flowing freely down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBy this time Rachel had returned to see her cousin's tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNicole?\u201d She inquired softly, \u201csweetie are you alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo...\u201d came the shaky reply. Rachel frowned and hoisted herself up next to her distraught cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey now, what's wrong girl?\u201d She asked, gently trying to coax an answer out of the blonde mother of septuplets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh Rachel!\u201d Nicole sobbed as she buried her face into her cousin's shoulder, \u201cI'm gonna be a horrible mother!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRachel was taken aback for a few seconds, all this time she'd thought Nicole had been handling this the best out of all of them, when in reality she'd been bottling up her emotions inside, which hadn't been a smart thing to do, especially when they were all hormonally driven emotional wrecks that were pregnant women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey now, what makes you say that Nicky?\u201d Rachel cooed, rubbing her cousin's back reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLook at me Rachel!\u201d Nicole cried, \u201cI'm as big as a house, I can't walk three steps without running out of breath, I haven't even started my job, and I haven't even bought any baby supplies!\u201d Rachel was heartbroken as she heard her cousin whimper, \u201cI'm beginning to think Lucille was right...maybe I am just doomed to fail...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNicole stop it!\u201d Rachel shushed Nicole before she descended any further in the abyss of self pity, \u201cnow stop beating yourself up and look at me!\u201d Much to her relief, Nicole stopped sniffling for a few seconds and looked up at her. \u201cGood, and now listen to me,\u201d she chided, \u201cyou are not a failure Nicole! If anything the fact that you've been holding up this long being pregnant with seven is proof of that! Screw Lucille! She still thinks you're just a stuck up brat who isn't worth her time, but if she'd been here with you for the past couple of days, she'd have seen that you've definitely matured into a woman who's more ready for motherhood than she'll ever be! Understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNicole was shocked, she didn't think that Rachel would defend her so strongly, but now that she thought about it, she had definitely changed over the past couple of days, and not just physically. She had gone from thinking about herself and the next booze driven party or the next new fling with some stranger she knew nothing about to being more compassionate and kind towards her cousin and Betty. She even realized that she was excited about being a mom, considering how much love was in her heart for her unborn children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHeh, you're right Rachel,\u201d she sniffed, \u201cthanks for that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey, what are cousins for?\u201d Rachel winked.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, our heroine had heard the creak loud and clear which dampened her mood once again, making her sigh sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this, Rachel clasped a reassuring hand on her cousins shoulder and gave it a light squeeze.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nicole awoke to the sound of a dull, but quite loud roar that startled her into an almost perfectly awake state. Looking outside she noticed that it had gotten dark outside and took a look at the that was across the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Only 9:00 eh? Felt like longer...\" She observed in a neutral tone. \"Wonder why I woke up so soo-\" her question was immediately cut off as Nicole clutched her stomach, feeling a sharp pang of hunger come from within, emphasized by a rather loud growl that probably could be heard throughout her entire condo. She laughed nervously and gave her belly a pat before addressing the seven passengers inside her womb, \"guess you all are pretty hungry as well huh? Well let's see what we can't do about that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a minute for the heavily pregnant girl to get up and waddle over to the kitchen. She deliberated for a second on what she wanted to eat before deciding that she'd just take an assortment of items out and see how they fared. In a rush of hunger-fueled impulses she grabbed a loaf of bread, two bags of potato chips, some leftover pizza that she'd taken home from Betty's, and an entire cream pie. She ended up making around eight sandwiches before stopping to look at everything she'd taken out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Am I even going to be able to eat all of this?</i> She thought skeptically as she felt intimidated by the amount of food she had brought out. Of course, another pang of hunger made her groan while picking up one of the peanut butter and jelly sandwich she'd made, before ceremoniously taking a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat first bite was all her body needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Nicole felt all of her pent up hunger hit her at once as she dove into her meal without a second thought about pacing or slowing down even to chew properly. She went through all of her sandwiches like they were nothing while simultaneously stuffing entire handfuls of chips into her mouth. One would've thought that she would have choked on her food at this rate, but apparently this was not so as she devoured an entire bag of chips in the span of a minute and a half. She didn't bother to heat up the pizza she'd brought back at this point since she was too hungry to care, and ended up finishing off the entire box before deciding that she was thirsty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning at the slight fullness she was experiencing she heaved herself up and made her way over to the refrigerator. Upon opening it she immediately found a 2-liter bottle of lemon lime soda and didn't waste a second before ripping the cap off and clumsily guzzling it down like there was no tomorrow, not even hesitating as she felt some of the contents of the bottle spill out onto her new shirt. She actually managed to chug about three fourths of the entire bottle before stopping to take a breath as she felt a large amount of gas building up inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*BURP*</b> The resulting belch was something that could only be described as having come from some sort of primordial monster from ages gone by. Sighing in relief at the gas having been let out she slowly waddled back to her chair at the kitchen table, feeling the contents of her current meal slosh around inside her as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter arriving at the table with a now empty soda bottle, Nicole let out another belch before tiredly eyeing her last objective: the cream pie. However, upon seeing this last culinary delight her stomach announced that it really didn't have much room to spare, and the rational part of her brain told her that she'd eaten plenty already, but once she smelled the delicious aroma of the dessert adorned with whipped cream there was no stopping her. Slice by slice she ate,   never yielding even when her stomach groaned in disapproval as she began to stuff it past its max capacity. Eventually though, after a couple minutes, she had finished her feast, and sat back in her chair, which creaked all the more as she had only added to her pregnant weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best...meal...ever...\" She breathed out before starting to get up out of her chair. The meal had taken its toll on her however, and she found herself in a sleepy , full state which made her bend over forward and would have made her fall had she not steadied herself on the counter top while she walked. Walking over to the bathroom to wash her hands, she took a look up at her reflection and blanched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I guess really overdid it...\" She muttered, taking in the resulting aftermath of her feeding frenzy. Her poor stomach, which had been filled past its brim, had bloated out even larger, and looked like she had added another child into her womb while no one was looking, leaving the bottom of her belly to peek out from underneath her shirt. \"Aw hell! My new shirt!\" She cried out in horror as she eyed the now ruined garment. From taking even a glance at this piece of clothing, her astounding meal had been made obvious to anyone that noticed the many crumbs, jelly stains, trails of soda, and specks of cream that now adorned her shirt. Groaning in frustration, Nicole figured it would be best to take it off and just throw it away since it was most likely too late to get the stains out anyways. <i>Besides, its not like another shirt is gonna kill my parent's bank account,</i> she thought dismissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter stripping her torso down to naught but the black, somewhat see through maternity bra, she shrugged and decided to go the whole nine yards before freeing her lower half of the sweatpants that she currently had on. <i>Well, it's more comfortable to sleep in just a bra and panties like this anyhow.</i> She thought with a nod of approval before she started off towards her room. She cursed the fact that she had to walk up stairs to get to her room, since each and every step up was a journey in itself made harder by the fact that her full tummy had left her feeling even slower and more lethargic. She felt a bit self conscious as she felt her breasts and butt jiggle with every stair she ascended, feeling as if her weight was due to bad eating habits rather than being pregnant with seven children. (Not to mention the implants she'd gotten before this.) Finally, after a long and arduous journey, she'd made her way to the top of the stairs, out of breath and huffing and puffing as if she'd run an entire marathon instead of just walking up 32 steps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of rest she waddled into her room and didn't even have time to pull her bed's blanket over herself before she fell into a deep sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"There they are, two perfectly developed fetuses,\" the doctor, Kristin Harper, said, pointing to the screen. Lucille Winters smiled, looking over at the display. Dr. Harper smiled back. \"I just love when older moms-to-be come in and I get to give them the good news of a healthy pregnancy.\" She chuckled. \"Although, you look like you could be in your 20s, Mrs. Winters.\"<br>\r\nLucille gave her a little smile that said \"I know\" and looked back at the screen. Twins in her 40s. She could still hardly believe it. But so far, everything was going well. No abnormal symptoms. No excess fat where it wasn't wanted. Nothing but a textbook twin pregnancy. Although, she doubted most women would look as good as she did at this stage in her pregnancy, even if they were twenty years younger than her.<br>\r\n\"Wow, aunt Lucille, that's so amazing!\" Jenny gelled, looking at the sonogram images. Lucille nodded and looked on. \"And you said it's a boy and a girl?\"<br>\r\n\"That's what this doctor tells me,\" Lucille said dryly. Dr. Harper forced a little grin. Lucille might have been one of her most fascinating patients so far (no one carried a pregnancy <u>this</u> well, especially in the 40s!) but she was also her rudest. She had a very smug attitude, like all of these medical procedures were just a formality and she could do all of this on her own. Lucille actually did say at one appointment: \"My body works fine. I know what will happen. I'm here at my husband's insistence.\" Dr. Harper remembered it with a grimace. <i>Well won't you just make a lovely mother</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the check-up was done, Lucille wiped her gel off of her belly with a towel - a proper towel, one she brought herself. Not that paper garbage the doctor had. Jenny waited patiently with a smile for her aunt to slowly get down from the inspection table. Jenny thanked Dr. Harper for her aunt and the two walked back down the hall, just missing Nicole and Rachel. \"That was great! I've seen an ultrasound up close before!\"<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I suppose it was interesting the first time I had one,\" Lucille said, pursing her lips in thought. \"Oh well. It's nice to hear more confirmation that everything's healthy.\" Lucille started rubbing the front of her belly. \"And thank you again for driving me. Uncle Roger was in meetings all day and frankly he's seen enough of these to last him a lifetime.\"<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Jenny said, wondering if her uncle was really aware that his wife was having ultrasounds without him. \"Well, I was happy to take you! You're my favorite aunt after all.\"<br>\r\n\"Because I'm your only aunt. Funny as always,\" Lucille mused, pressing the down button on the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, Jenny was trying to get money out of her aunt. She had an easier time bonding with her aunt than her uncle and a few mentions of how much better she was doing than Nicole always buttered Lucille up. While Jenny was doing quite well at her job, her own parents had rewarded this hard work by cutting their daughter off. Unfortunately, Jenny had become accustomed to a certain quality of life she wanted to maintain. \"So, Aunt Lucille, did you watch my reporting on the local news last night?\"<br>\r\n\"Mmm?\" Lucille said, looking up from her phone at her niece.<br>\r\n\"I-I said did you get to see my reporting on TV last night? For the governor's speech?\"<br>\r\n\"Ah, no. This makes me a little tired, dear,\" Lucille said, rubbing her wide belly. \"But I have it on DVR. Uncle Roger and I will watch it later. His company donated a bit when the governor was first running.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was her in. \"Really? Do you both donate a lot to campaigns?\"<br>\r\nLucille put her phone back in her purse. \"Hmm, every now and then. Uncle Roger likes to keep his name out there, support what he likes in people.\"<br>\r\n\"So, would you consider investing a little in me?\" Jenny said with a small grin. \"I'm working on getting some bigger interviews for the station, but it'll require some more upscale outfits.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, your parents-\"<br>\r\n\"My parents are very supportive, but not with money. They don't understand that good clothes are the way the game is played now, Aunt Lucille.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, that's the truth. Looks can get you so far,\" Lucille said, getting her phone back out and taping it a few times. \"I just sent myself a reminder. I'll get something deposited directly into your back account.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Aunt Lucille! You made a great investment in my future,\" Jenny smiled. \"My cousins are going to have such a great mother.\" Lucille flashed her an annoyed look. Jenny clammed up. <i>Too far on that one</i>, Jenny thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of the importance of looks...Jenny dear, you really need to go on a diet or get some sort of exercise,\" Lucille said, looking down at Jenny's pot belly. Jenny tried to conceal it with two layers of sweaters, but it didn't do a great deal of good.<br>\r\n\"I-I know. I've been exercising more but it might be a symptom of the nausea,\" Jenny said to try and explain it.<br>\r\n\"Well, keep up the good work,\" Lucille smiled. \"You've always been a beautiful girl. You remind me a lot of myself.\" They shared a tight hug, with Lucille's belly and breasts pressed tightly against her niece. \"Now, just take me home, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucille continued to fiddle with her phone as Jenny drove, a worried look on her face. She knew, of course, that she'd put on weight yesterday, but to have gained this much the next day? That was really odd. She didn't have to be on camera today, but tomorrow she would and it would be obvious. And Jenny's breasts were getting larger too. Her creepy director would definitely point that out and start drawing attention to her. <i>They might stick me in weather</i>, Jenny shuddered. <i>But no! I'm going to be a real star! The front desk is for me!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny dropped her aunt off and waved, driving back to her own apartment. She wanted to go to the gym again, but she had to at least rehearse for the next broadcast. If she came in looking like she did AND was unprepared, she would get skewered. After going over papers and papers and eating a very...strange dinner (<i>where was that craving coming from</i>? Jenny wondered to herself), Jenny put on some skimpier clothes and headed out the door. \"The best exercise is partying, isn't it?\" She mused to herself. \"Let's see what I can do tonight.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jenny headed out the door and into her glitzy car, speeding off to the downtown area. She strutted toward her favorite club, the Four-Sevens, and waited in line with the other club-goers. Even just in line, Jenny got plenty of interested looks, which she responded to with pearly grins. In truth, Jenny wasn't all that different from Nicole. She was just as vain and attention-obsessed. But Jenny prided herself in better, natural looks, skills and an attitude that made her more successful, and a more mature personality. After all, while Nicole might go to the nearest fraternity party, Jenny was getting into one of the city's hottest clubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bouncer let her in without a moment's hesitation and Jenny preened into the club. The music was blaring what sounded like an original remix of Swedish House Mafia and the strobes were pulsing at just the right brightness and frequency. Jenny surveyed the room and gracefully danced into the center. It didn't take long to find a handsome guy that she made enough eye contact with and the two were back-to-front, Jenny rubbing her ass against his hardening lap. She didn't quite notice it, but her hips had gotten wider and her rear had gotten plumper over the past few days. Of course, even if she noticed it, Jenny would never have guessed why it was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she found a guy who she had suitable chemistry with, the two made their way to one of the couches on the peripherals of the dance floor and started to kiss sloppily. The guy moved one hand to Jenny's buxom chest, which made her chuckle in between kisses and hold his wrist, pushing his hand down her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh, not yet, buddy,\" Jenny smiled, looking into his eyes. \"I don't even know your name yet.\"<br>\r\n\"It's Ro...wait,\" the guy said, looking down at his hand, his thumb resting on Jenny's slightly swollen middle. \"Are you trying to find a new baby daddy?\"<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Jenny said.<br>\r\n\"What do I mean? You're pregnant, aren't you? I know the signs. Look, I've already got one kid. I don't need-\" It was too late. Jenny gave the guy a strong slap to the face and was back in the center of the club, gyrating in an even more sultry manner on another guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pattern continued the same as before: Jenny moved from guy to guy, rubbing and dancing until she found someone she had a good vibe with. They moved to the couches and made out, but this time the guy waited to move ahead a few bases. After a while, the two looked in each other's eyes lustily, each waiting for the other to make a move.<br>\r\n\"Can I buy you a drink?\" the new guy asked.<br>\r\nJenny thought about it. She had one of her longer work days tomorrow and she started early. If she started drinking now, she'd definitely be a wreck in the morning. \"No thanks, cutie. I'd better not.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, what was I thinking?\" the guy said, shaking his head.<br>\r\nJenny thought this was a strange reaction. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"Well...you're pregnant. You can't have alcohol.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm <b>what?</b>\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's no problem. I'm actually into that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't get a chance to finish. This guy got an even stronger slap than the first guy and Jenny walked quickly to another side of the club, shaking angrily. What was happening? She put on a little bit of weight and suddenly everyone thought she was pregnant? Jenny looked down at her own bulge. Sure, it was a smaller, tighter outfit, so the little bit she'd put on was maybe more accentuated, but still: pregnant? Hardly!...well, it was pretty rounded and well-centered. In fact, Jenny was glad the fat didn't spread anywhere other than this pot belly. Her thighs were still toned and smooth, her waist was still pretty trim and curvy. The only things that had gotten bigger were her chest and ass and there were no complaints from her there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, the guy she'd just slapped was now a few feet away from her and still walking up. \"Hey, I'm sorry if I offended you. I get that being pregnant and in the club can be intimidating, but trust me, it's sexy and I think we could have a lot of fun together.\" <br>\r\nJenny took a few steps back. \"Look pal, I don't want to, okay?\"<br>\r\n\"That bitch is doing it again!\" Nearly everyone in the club turned their head to the owner of the slur. It was the first guy Jenny had slapped and it was clear that he'd gone through quite a few drinks since then. He stumbled over to where Jenny was and pointed a finger at her. \"Get outta here, you knocked up slut!\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not pregnant!\" Jenny barked at both the guys. \"And don't talk to me like that. Do you even know who I am?\" She swatted his finger away which really set him off. He looked ready to charge when a third man walked over and stopped him.<br>\r\n\"Why don't you cool off, pal,\" he said. \"Getting drunk with alcohol at these club prices? You must have burned through a lot of money. Go sit down.\" The guy stopped slightly and club security escorted him and the second guy away moments after. Jenny looked at the guy who'd come between her and the drunken suitors with a raised eyebrow. <br>\r\n\"Thanks for that,\" Jenny said. \"But I think I could have handled myself...name's Jenny.\"<br>\r\n\"Chris,\" the guy responded, flashing a grin. \"And I'm sure you could have. The guy just seemed like a jerk. And besides...you kind of look like an ex-girlfriend of mine.<br>\r\n<i>Oh great</i>, Jenny thought. <i>This guy might be a nut too</i>. \"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Chris replied. \"Actually...a lot like her. Do you know Nicole Winters?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny chuckled. \"She's my cousin.\"<br>\r\nChris covered his mouth as he laughed. \"Really? Wow, small world. Hey, can we sit down? The speaker's right here and the couches are way better.\"<br>\r\nJenny shrugged in her mind and agreed. On the couch, Chris continued his conversation. \"But yeah, I heard what those guys were saying. Sorry about that.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I have put on some weight,\" Jenny said with an eyeroll.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, same with Nicole, actually. But she <u>really</u> looked pregnant.\" Jenny tried to remember what Nicole looked like when she saw her yesterday. Chris kept going. \"And a friend of mine who lives near her told me she definitely looked pregnant today. Like unmistakably. I just hope it's not mine...or maybe it would be better if it <u>was</u> mine. Then we could get back together.\"<br>\r\nJenny looked at Chris like he was crazy as he began to talk to himself and slowly slinked away.<br>\r\n\"Nicole I miss you so much!\" Chris began to bellow to himself as Jenny walked to another part of the club near the entrance. Maybe today was just not a lucky day for her. At least she'd gotten some fun fondling and dancing out of the night. As she left, she accidentally bumped her hip against another woman's. <br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry,\" Jenny said.<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" the other woman said, looking over at Jenny and grinning slowly. \"Hey...aren't you from WBEL's newscast?\"<br>\r\nJenny smiled. \"Yes, I am. Thanks for watching.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm a real fan. You make the news on there so fashionable and give it real energy. You're a cool chick,\" the woman said, her grin expanding. \"I'm Claire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of the club, Claire and Jenny were talking and laughing as Claire looked for a cab. \"So this going to be a good party? Even for a college campus?\" Jenny asked again.<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I <u>only</u> go to parties worth going to,\" Claire scoffed as she finally hailed a cab. \"And you'll fit right in. You look great and I already know that you're a killer personality too.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, thanks. I need a good party tonight. I'm bored, I've got work in the morning, and I might have just learned that my cousin's pregnant,\" Jenny beamed, excited to move onto a scene that sounded better than the bum night at the Four-Sevens. \"And you look cool too.\"<br>\r\n\"Mmm, thanks,\" Claire smiled as the cab got closer. She wrapped one arm over Jenny's back and moved in for a kiss, managing to get her lips on the corner of Jenny's.<br>\r\nJenny jerked away and took a short step away. \"Whoa, what was that?\"<br>\r\nClaire continued to laugh. \"Sorry, I'm a little drunk. It won't happen again, promise.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Jenny said hesitantly, getting into the cab with Claire, wondering where the night would take her now, not noticing that the slight fluttering in her stomach was not butterflies, but kicks. Five, to be exact.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A relatively short drive later, the cab pulled into the college neighborhood, right in front of a fairly large house with kids in the lawn and pumping music barely audible from the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire,\" Jenny said, turning to her new friend. Claire was asleep against Jenny, specifically her chest. \"Claire.\" Jenny jostled her shoulder a bit, trying to wake Claire up. Jenny hadn't seen her at the club, but Claire had been drinking pretty heavily. As her eyes opened from Jenny's nudging, Claire suddenly shot up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woo!\" Claire said, looking between Jenny and the house. \"We're here! C'mon!\" As Claire tried to pull Jenny out of the car, Jenny paid the driver and the two hustled toward the house. Inside, it was really just like the club they'd both just left, but about five times as cramped. Girls and guys were grinding and bumping against Jenny and Claire as they walked through the crowd, making their way to a series of couches in the back. It was filled with other attractive girls and a few guys, most of them waving to Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's this?\" one girl, a tall redhead, asked. Claire held Jenny's arm and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Jenny. She's awesome,\" Claire said, still laughing. Jenny smiled and didn't say anything. She figured out by now that Claire was a little gone. \"She slapped two guys who tried to hit on her and she-she does the TV!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny's smile perked up a little more. She loved attention and telling people she was on TV was always a great way to get that. And if someone else said it, she could also come off as modest. The college students on the couch chirped with interest and the guys there looked her over with an interested smile. Claire was right: Jenny was liking this party quite a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire took Jenny by the arm and walked her around more of the party. \"Want something to drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks,\" Jenny said. \"I've got work in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, TV!\" Claire said excitedly, laughing again. \"God, you're so cool. You're like a big sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny just smiled and went along. Besides, she was getting plenty of easy compliments out of it. \"I've actually got two other older sisters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire squealed. \"Are they as good looking as you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny chuckled and didn't say anything, looking around the room again. It was too late to go home with anyone and still get enough sleep in the morning. As she prowled the room, Claire put her hand back on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, are they hot like you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire, I think you might need to slow it down,\" Jenny said, taking Claire's hand away. \"This was fun, but I should probably leave soon. Let's exchange numbers, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooo! Let's just dance!\" Claire said, swinging her arms around. \"I-I'll find some hot guys, okay? It'll be fun, then you can go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Jenny nodded. She'd left her car back at the parking lot by the club anyway, so it would take her a while to really get home anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-- Hours Earlier ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole drove with Betty, neither of them saying anything. Betty had her hands wrapped around her big belly, now knowing that there were definitely twins growing inside there. Although, it seemed like they wouldn't be growing too much longer. Dr. Anderson said that Betty looked like she was maybe a week away from delivering, adding that this was a rough estimate, as she wasn't exactly in chartered medical territory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole,\" Betty finally said softly as they pulled into a nearby parking lot. Nicole was shaking, gripping the steering wheel. \"Hey...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no use. Nicole started to bawl, her head falling against the wheel. \"How? How did this happen? I'm on birth control, guys use condoms, I...four babies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty scooted over a few inches and wrapped one arm around Jenny's waist. \"It's okay, Nicole. You can cry it out.\" Tears started to well up in Betty's eyes. \"Believe me, I know how scary this can be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole wrapped her arms around Betty's shoulders and the two cried into each other, although Nicole did most of the sobbing. Finally, Nicole sat up and sniffled loudly, wiping her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how I'll tell my parents,\" Nicole said. \"My mom'll kill me...especially when she's already got two on the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe that will help her sympathize,\" Betty laughed, wiping her own eyes. \"C'mon, let's do something to cheer up...let's go shopping!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole scoffed and nodded. \"Yeah, with four, I'll need some new clothes eventually...\" She rolled up her shirt and looked at her own rounded, bulging middle. \"God, I'm so big already...what'll it look like at nine months?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I've been looking into pregnancy stuff ever since...\" Betty rubbed her belly gently, \"A-and anyway, apparently it's more like 10 months. 40 weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole shook her head. \"Well, that'll give me more time to figure out what I'm going to do, at least.\" She turned the car back on and headed for the mall. She and Betty cheered up a little and were back to gossiping and laughing about other guys and girls in the area, but it wasn't quite the same. At the mall, the two walked toward Baby Universe, the well-advertised maternity clothing store in the area. On the way over, Betty got plenty of looks, some shocked, some curious, some a little more...interested. Betty blushed and tried to cover her belly with her arms somewhat. It wasn't surprising. She was big, plain and simple. And she wasn't wearing clothes that covered her belly much at all. As bad as she felt about it, Nicole was glad her friend's belly was so big because it distracted from her own developing middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole and Betty shopped around the maternity store, getting pleasant smiles from the young clerk with short, brown hair. \"Happy with the selection?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty nodded. \"Yeah, the clothes here are a lot more stylish than I'd always heard maternity clothes were.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk smiled back and raised her eyebrow. \"You haven't shopped for maternity clothes until now?\" It was obvious from Betty's attempt to use a baggy coat to make up for her lack of shirt covering the front slope of her belly. Betty blushed and nodded. \"Well, that's okay. It's important to look good and feel good in the last trimester.\" The clerk came from behind the counter and pulled one, bright red outfit off of a nearby rack. \"And if you'd like, we have a nice selection of maternity lingerie. I've heard some <u>very</u> good reviews.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty bit her lip and imagined what she must look like in a skimpy red satin and a big belly. \"Nicole, what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was looking through her own selection of clothes, trying to secretly find the largest outfits they had. Not knowing much about pregnancy herself, Nicole just let her imagination run wild with how big her quadruplet belly would look. \"Uh, yeah, looks good. You should get a couple,\" she said, not paying attention to Betty's conversation. \"I'll get one too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty giggled. \"Well...okay!\" She waddled to the front and rung up all the clothes with her parent's credit card, wondering what their reaction would be when they saw the charges. Nicole found her own collection of clothes and bought it as well, not knowing that the clerk included some lingerie at Nicole's own absent-minded request. The two left the mall a little bit happier, Betty especially. \"I can't believe how these outfits for pregnant women looked!\" Betty buzzed. \"People will lose their shit when they see us rocking these!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for sure,\" Nicole sighed, imagining her nine...no, ten month belly scaring some guy to death, worried she'd crush him in bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, let's try it out tonight!\" Betty said. \"There's a cool party tonight. It's in one of the smaller college houses, but it should be good. Plenty of guys. Besides I might as well lean into this.\" Betty jiggled her belly to emphasize \"this.\" Nicole giggled and nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Nicole said. \"That might cheer me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- Hours Later ---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair showed up at the party, Betty in one of her new maternity dresses. It accentuated all of her new curves and showed off plenty of her new, clump cleavage. The pair turned heads immediately, pushing their way forcefully into the center of the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who wants to dance?\" Betty beamed, doing her best to accept her situation. To both of their surprise, a few chuckling guys agreed, grinding and shaking their hips toward the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. My God,\" a familiar voice said, walking into the middle of the party, facing Nicole and Betty. \"What is happening here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Claire,\" Nicole said coldly, looking at the woman joining Claire. \"...Jenny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole?\" Jenny said, her eyes darting between her cousin and her friend('s belly). \"Wow...your ex was right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? Why were you talking to Chris?\" Nicole said, raising her voice. Someone turned down the music so the four could argue and entertain everyone there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean about the pregnancy?\" Claire giggled, pointing to Nicole's belly, even bigger since she'd last spread the rumor. \"Looks like your friend confirms it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they right?\" Jenny said, her lips curling into a grin that she was trying to suppress. \"Are you pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole wanted so badly to scream the same line out that she'd done the past four days. That she wasn't pregnant. Then she could tear Jenny apart and storm out. But...now it was true and there was no way out. Jenny was family and could tell anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole?\" Another voice said. All four turned as Marcus walked toward them. \"You're pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not...I mean, I am, but...but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if you'd like, you can try and get my friend and me pregnant,\" Claire drunkely giggled, reaching out to Marcus. Nicole's whole body clenched with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Good emotions...flip me!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole reached into her pocket and grabbed the coin, flipping it and looking right at Claire.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Claire continued laughing before stopping abruptly and letting out a sound like a burp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh...I feel...\" Claire said, putting her hands on her stomach, which began to swell immensely. In no time, Claire's revealing outfit revealed a whole lot more as her belly pushed past the fabric, round and glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemed to stop around her as Claire noticed the new addition to her womb and touched it gingerly. The party was too dark and the music was too loud so not many people noticed. But Claire certainly did and so did Nicole. She gripped the coin eagerly, her look of anger turning to a furious glee as she watched her nemesis become pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not enough</i> Nicole said, preparing to flip the coin again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Yes! Good! Flip me!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole didn't need the coin to tell her so. Nicole flipped and got tails again. Claire let out another groan and her belly continued to swell, growing far beyond any pregnant belly Nicole had ever seen. Jenny and Betty began noticing, their eyes growing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole, oh my god! It's happening to her too!\" Betty tried to tell her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More!\" Nicole breathed excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Betty asked, shaking Nicole's arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nicole was shaken out of her angry daze, Claire pushed past both of them in a blur of impressive speed, given her new size. She had Jenny by the arm and the two were out the door quickly, running down the street. They didn't get too far and Claire stopped to catch her breath and cradle her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire, what is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what the fuck is happening but I need to get home,\" Claire gasped, looking at Jenny intensely. \"Before anyone sees me like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny nodded and walked Claire quickly down the street, relying on her new companion for directions to Claire's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the party, Betty was guiding Nicole outside, with Marcus close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You saw that, didn't you? It was just...just like what happened to me,\" Betty said, with fear in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh,\" Nicole mumbled, unsure of what just happened or what came over her. For a moment, it felt like someone else, or something else, was inside her head, telling her what to do. Did that have something to do with Claire's sudden pregnancy? Maybe it had something to do with Betty and her own mother and...maybe Nicole herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Give in to your anger more. Now you have the power to spread chaos Nicole!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Nicole gasped, looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole? Are you okay?\" Marcus said, standing beside the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh, yeah,\" Nicole said, rubbing one of her temples, her face immediately turning red when she turned back to Marcus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it true what that girl said in there? You're pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's face turned a few shades redder as she stammered. \"Uh...uh...I've...I've got to go!\" Nicole grabbed Betty's wrist and ran to her car. \"Sorry!\" She shouted as she opened the door, jumping in as Betty panted and climbed inside. In no time, they sped off, back toward Nicole's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole?\" Betty said softly, looking over at her friend. Nicole didn't say anything. \"Nicole?\" Nicole bit her lip and focused on the road. \"That was Marcus that you told me about, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm,\" Nicole said, nodding her head, feeling tears well up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...sorry, Nicole. I really am,\" Betty said, wrapping her hands around her own belly. Nicole stopped at a stop light and started cursing and hitting her steering wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That goddamn whore! Saying that about me! Who the fuck does she think she is?\" Nicole screamed. \"Now she's the one who's a fucking fat preggo, not me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole, hey, chill out some,\" Betty said. \"You make it sound like you caused her to be pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole paused at these words and put her hands back on the steering wheel, just as the light turned green. \"R-right...right, sorry. It's just been a stressful day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't worry about what Claire Reynolds says or does. You're the hottest and baddest chick I know and she's got nothing on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole chuckled a little. \"Thanks, Betty. You're pretty cool yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty laughed too and looked down at her belly. \"Thanks...well, I guess I'm not the biggest one at school now, if Claire sticks around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole grinned evily and didn't say anything as her home came up on the next turn. \"Want to stay for a bit before I take you back home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" Betty said slowly, \"I was thinking I could...stay over tonight? It's been a crazy day for both of us and maybe it would be better if we had some company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww,\" Nicole smiled, reaching over and hugging Betty. \"You're a good friend. Sure, you can spend the night here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Claire and Jenny---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny helped Claire up the steps of her swanky home and into her bedroom, Claire grumbling and rubbing her new belly the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's moving inside here,\" she said. \"I'm really pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come on now. You aren't pregnant. That's impossible,\" Jenny said, trying to comfort her new friend and ignore the obvious reality. One second, Claire had a trim, model's figure and now she had a pregnant belly the size of a beach ball. And helping her up the steps, Jenny had felt it. It was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's impossible but...but look!\" Claire said, rolling up what little bit of her shirt was left and pointing at her swollen middle. \"What else could it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know but I'd call a doctor in the morning,\" Jenny said, yawning as she let Claire go so she could wander around her enormous bedroom. \"Speaking of morning, I've got to go. I have work in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For TV! Right!\" Claire said. The coin's magic cleared the alcohol out of her system to prevent any harm to the babies it had created, but there was still a drunken residual effect, it seemed. \"Oh, you're so cool, Jenny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Jenny smiled, unable to take her eyes off of Claire's new body as she walked around the room, slowly getting out of her shoes and taking off her jewelry. \"Well...I've got to go. I'm parked back at the club, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no no! Stay here tonight!\" Claire said frantically, grabbing Jenny's arm, pressing Claire's belly and equally-swollen breasts against her. \"Please! I've never been pregnant before I need you here! What if something happens?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't make a terrible argument. Jenny thought it over. \"Well...I really do have to get to work and get my car...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can use my car! And I'll pay any tickets your car gets! I'm rich, I can get you anything, baby!\" Claire reached over and kissed Jenny on the shoulder. Jenny blushed nervously, not sure what to make of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...okay. Your water might break in the middle of the night and it would be better to have someone over,\" she said slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Claire said excitedly, unzipping her outfit and crawling into bed in her underwear. \"Now get in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...there's no other beds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get in here!\" Claire yelled again, her eyes already closed as her head hit the pillow. Jenny scratched her head slowly. Claire had a bizarre persuasive energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm here,\" Jenny said, slipping under the covers, her body immediately held in a tight, warm embrace by Claire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G'night, Janey,\" Claire slurred as she fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight, Claire,\" Jenny said quietly, trying to sleep as she felt Claire's belly pressed against her own. She could feel movements inside Claire's belly and briefly thought back to the own jeers and confusions about pregnancy she'd gotten hours earlier. \"Glad I'm not pregnant,\" she breathed before closing her eyes. \"Not like Nicole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Nicole and Betty---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole had on a large white t-shirt, probably a leftover from an ex-boyfriend she'd forgotten about, and pulled back the covers for Betty, who also picked out an oversized shirt Nicole had lying around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, sleep well,\" Nicole said, heading for the bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute,\" Betty said with a confused smirk. \"I thought you don't have any guest beds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't, I'll just take a couch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty put her hands on her hips. \"Nicole Winters, like it or not, you're pregnant too and I can't let you sleep on that couch. C'mon, we can share the bed. It's big enough for...\" Betty started rubbing her belly self-consciously. \"Well, it'll still be big enough for both of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?\" Nicole asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely, now come on,\" Betty said, getting into one side of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole shrugged and got in the other side, turning off the lamp as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn so your belly doesn't knock me off the side,\" Nicole snickered, getting a pat on the arm from Betty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up,\" Betty grinned, settling into bed. The two smiled and curled up in Nicole's queen-sized mattress. \"Good night, Nicole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Betty,\" Nicole said, one hand going to her own belly. <i>And good night to...however you four are</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The automatic alarm on Nicole's phone started buzzing and Nicole stirred awake, her hands scrambling around lazily. Slowly, her hands traced a wide, round, firm surface. It was warm and soft to the touch like skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Mmm...that must be Betty</i>, Nicole thought, gradually remembering that they'd shared the bed that night. Then, horrifyingly, Nicole came to a realization. She could feel hands on her own stomach...which could only mean...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" Nicole said frantically, sitting up in bed. It was her own belly! She looked like she was pregnant full term. The t-shirt she'd put on before was now totally unsuited to conceal her baby-filled womb, still smooth and blemish-free. As Nicole traced her curves with her hands, she started to feel movement inside her, like tickles moving across the wideness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" Betty said lazily, lifting her head and looking around. As her eyes adjusted, she saw Nicole's belly and her jaw dropped. Betty was speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole started rubbing her belly more, feeling her now-popped out belly button and the new weight of her body. \"How the hell...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty shook her head. \"Something weird is happening. Me, your mom, now you...and the party...what the hell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole nodded and tried to pull the shirt down over her belly. \"This can't be happening...the doctor got something wrong or...it's some kind of disease or...aliens...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole, calm down. This is...just a different version of what happened to me. We'll be okay, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole honestly didn't know. She continued to caress her belly, its size and shape totally foreign to her, as were the movements inside her. She might as well have been impregnated by some kind of alien. This was a different sensation than anything she'd ever felt, so who's to say?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were interrupted by Nicole's phone buzzing again. She frantically picked it up and saw the text message from her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Don't forget: interview today @ 11&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Nicole screamed, heaving herself out of bed and immediately stopping to grab her big belly. \"I've got my job interview today! I've got to get there. If I tell my parents I missed my interview <b>and</b> tell them I'm pregnant with four grandkids on the same day, they'll write me out of the damn will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, how much time to we have?\" Betty asked, slowly rolling (literally) herself out of bed. Betty's belly was still a bit bigger than Nicole's, but neither was in the mood to compare waist sizes now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like an hour!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, let's get you looking good,\" Betty said. \"First thing, hop in the shower. I'll pick out some cute clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole waddled to her bathroom and stripped down, stepping into the shower and letting the warm water come down, giving a little yelp as the water touched her belly - now extremely sensitive. Showering with a big belly proved to be a challenge, as she couldn't see a lot of where she had to wash and turning was a complicated, tiring effort. She was just glad she didn't drop the soap bar. Bending or crouching down to get it was impossible. During her quick shower session, Nicole saw that her breasts had upped a few more sizes again. <i>Another plus of this whole thing, I guess</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the shower in much longer than expected, Nicole was presented with a few clothing options by Betty. \"I...tried to combine our maternity clothing outfits to give you more variety,\" Betty apologized. \"There's not a lot since I wasn't expecting you to get so...big so soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole shook her head and picked up various parings. \"Whatever, it doesn't matter. I've got to deal with what's here now.\" She found a nice black skirt and a polka dot blouse that managed to cover all of her belly. Unfortunately, it wasn't a baggy fit so it was still clear that Nicole was pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty brushed and styled Nicole's hair and she grunted and squeezed into her outfit, checking herself in a nearby mirror. \"Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I can't drive with this thing,\" Nicole said, holding her belly. \"And I figure you can't either.\" Betty shook her head. \"Damn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, who do we know who could drive us?\" Betty asked. Nicole shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want anyone to see me...like this. But who's number do I have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about that guy you liked at the party? Marcus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole got out her phone and cursed again. \"I don't have his number yet...well, there's only two people who could maybe get me. Chris or my cousin Rachel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty grimaced. \"Two bad options.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telling me...well, only one way to choose,\" Nicole said, getting out her coin. \"Heads Chris, Tails Rachel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip me</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, doesn't Chris live a block away? We don't have much time left. Just call him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">No, flip me!</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole let out a little groan and rubbed her temple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, sorry...it's nothing, I'm fine,\" Nicole said, pocketing the coin and getting out her phone. The babies inside her started kicking frantically as she dialed. <i>Ugh, what a weird sensation</i>, she thought as she called her up ex-boyfriend. \"Hey, it's...yeah it's me. Look, I need a ride...it's important...no. No! No! Fuck you! See you then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Jenny---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny heard the chimes of her cell phone and rolled her shoulders a bit, feeling Claire's arms around her. \"Nooo,\" Claire complained quietly as Jenny got up. She turned off her alarm and looked back at Claire, her new, heavily pregnant friend who insisted they share the bed for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this was fun,\" Jenny laughed. \"I'm sure I'll run into you again soon. But seriously, go to a doctor. That sudden pregnancy is...weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about yours?\" Claire grumbled, rolling over. Jenny rolled her eyes and straightened her clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She's fun, but she's so spoiled</i>, Jenny thought, noticing the bulge from her own belly. She rubbed carefully and felt how firm it was. This was more than just fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, you're knocked up too, just like that cousin of yours,\" Claire laughed. \"I'm not the only one! I'm not the only one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Jenny yelled, running out of the room. \"You'd better pay me back for the cab and my parking tickets. It wasn't my idea to sleep over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire giggled. \"Oh-kay, preggo. Have fun on the big, fancy local news.\" Claire's laughs turned to cackles as Jenny slammed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a...ugh, nightmare of a girl,\" Jenny complained, walking (or slightly waddling) until she found a bus stop. She could at least take that near the club so she could get her car back. She started work soon! Jenny's phone buzzed again and she looked down. Two texts. One from Stacy, which was just a picture of her belly in her bathroom mirror with the caption &lt;22 weeks!&gt; Jenny smiled and laughed. It might have only been 22 weeks, but with triplets, Stacy looked plenty big. The second text was from Rachel. &lt;We need to talk soon. Stacy too&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny didn't know what to make of that but shrugged it off for the moment. Now, she was thinking about her new idea for a story. \"Sudden pregnancies.\" Were they real? Were they happening here in town? And what people needed to know about it. Her grin spread. This would put her on the map and give her plenty of screen time.</span></div></div>",

She entered her bathroom, removing her clothes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the shower, she noticed that her belly was much larger than it was yesterday, maybe close to eight months.  When she ran her hands over her belly, she was surprised at how sensitive it was.  Jenny began to feel a light fluttering in her belly.  \"What the-\" she let out, feeling all around her rounding middle.  But, as soon as the movement began, it had ceased.  <i>Weird</i> she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting dressed took some effort.  She tried to put on a blouse, but her stomach had gotten too large.  Instead, she put on a black shirt and an orange blazer.  The black shirt did a good job of concealing her belly, and she hoped that none of the viewers would notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHungrier than usual, Jenny cooked a large breakfast of eggs, bacon, and pancakes.  While she ate, she felt the fluttering from before, and had to rub her large belly in order to calm the movement down.  \"Hmm, maybe I should give Dr. Anderson a call.  This is kinda weird,\" she said out loud.  She decided to call the doctor's office, labeling the appointment as a \"check-up\", in case any creep was listening in.    The appointment was scheduled at 7:30 that night, and she would have to hurry to it after finishing the 6:00 news.  After finishing her meal, she drove off to the news station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the station, called PRGNT, Jenny was the lone woman anchor, while there were a few female weathermen.  The other co-anchor, John Maroon, was a slightly sexist, dumb man.  In fact, Jenny believed that the only reason he still had a job was because of his luscious mustache and hair, combined with his suave way of talking.  Their boss, Frank Terry, was a man in his early 60s who considered Jenny to be her apprentice.  Jenny was sure that she would be able to get the \"sudden pregnancy\" off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny entered his office, as Frank was talking to John.  \"-you can't just read every thing you see off the teleprompter!  Does \"Neighborhood <i>Black</i> Party\" really make sense, John?  Does it?  I don't think it does.\"  John sat there, twiddling his fingers.  \"Mr. Terry, can I have a word?  Alone?\"  Jenny asked.  \"Sure you can.  John, may we?\" Frank gestured.  \"What, are you guys gonna do it in the office?\" he asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we're not, that's disgusting.  I was going to talk about a possible news report.  I believe that there's a sudden pregnancy epidemic going around this town.  I mean, it's effected my cousin...her friend-\"  \"You?\" John interrupted.  \"<b>I'M NOT PREGNANT</b>!\" she shouted, while it seemed she was avoiding the inevitable.  \"John, get out of here!\" Frank shouted.  John obliged this time, leaving the office.  \"Sorry about that, Jenny.  He's an asshole.  I like the idea.  If you can, get it done by 5:30 so it can make your shift, but it's okay if you can't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Jenny left Frank's office, walking--or waddling--to her desk, trying to get to the bottom of these \"sudden pregnancies.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jenny made it to her desk, letting out a small sigh of exhaustion and put her hands on her hips. She really needed to go to the gym more often and get in some exercise. Looking down, Jenny tried to pull down her clothes to further conceal her belly. \"It's just fat,\" Jenny said to herself quietly, over and over again, like a spell that could make everything turn out alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she heaved herself into her seat, Jenny prepared for her report and started to get worried again. How could she be so blind? Her story was on sudden pregnancies! So if it could happen to Claire, why couldn't it happen to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Jenny shook her head at that. She took her birth control pills regularly, she had her partners wear protection, and she'd been to the doctor in the last month and there was nothing there. Jenny gulped. \"The same's probably true for Claire too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she opened a file on her office computer, Jenny realized that her journey to find a story on sudden pregnancies was no longer just about getting a good scoop for work. It might be a lead in getting information about her own medical condition too! Jenny checked to see what information Claire had left her. Luckily, in her drunkenness, Claire had given Jenny her phone number and had even written it coherently. Jenny dialed the number and cupped the phone close to her so no one else could hear the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, who is this?\" A very prim and proper voice said on the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Jenny Winters. Is this Cla-\" Jenny started to say, before an excited voice interrupted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny! Oh my gawwwwd! I was not expecting to hear from you so soon,\" Claire said, her tone changing from proper to sultry. \"Sooooo, what's up? Bored at that flashy job already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Claire,\" Jenny laughed, Claire's charm and charisma still working even through the phone. \"Actually, I was hoping to talk to you for a story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire paused. \"Oh. Okay, what do you need to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny cleared her throat. \"It's about your...pregnancy. How it came out of the blue and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! No no no!\" Claire said excitedly. \"I don't even want to think about it and I'm the one who's pregnant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claire, I know this is uncomfortable for you, but if there's some kind of...sudden pregnancy going around, people need to know about it,\" Jenny said. \"And if it gets on the air, some doctors might see and be able to...do something about it. It's worth a shot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People would see me on TV with a big pregnant belly,\" Claire groaned. On the other end, she was already standing up and examining herself in the mirror. \"Although I do make it look good, don't I Jenny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm,\" Jenny said, not really paying attention as she sorted papers around on her desk, trying to see what cameraman she could get a hold of for some footage now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny,\" Claire said in an intense tone. \"Tell me I look good pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh,\" Jenny said, stopping momentarily. \"You looked very good pregnant. I'll...um...bet you don't look pregnant from behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire's face beamed. \"Oh Jenny, thank you so much! I'll do your news show, sure. But I'll expect something from you in return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny grinned. Everyone always told her at the station to be careful about bribes and mixing friends and acquaintances with stories, but she did it all the time and look how far it had gotten her! And now it was going to get her another slam dunk story...if it all turned out to be true, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" Jenny said. \"I'll come over in about an hour. Are you in classes or still at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At home, of course,\" Claire said, nearly shocked. \"I can't let anyone see me like this. Not yet, at least.\" She brushed a lock of hair out of her eyes neatly. \"I need the appropriate wardrobe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what will you wear on camera?\" Jenny asked, thinking about the hoops she had to jump through to not appear so pregnant at work today with her own outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'll just wear a tank top or something to show off plenty of belly. You want people to see that I'm really pregnant, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny's jaw almost dropped at this incredible film opportunity. \"Yes, of course. G-good thinking. See you in about an hour,\" Jenny said. After hanging up, Jenny's grin kept growing. This story was turning out pretty well and it would definitely show up that idiot John. Jenny envied the people at the competing news station who had that smart, gorgeous Mia Vasquez. She'd rather share a desk with her instead of John... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still needed to talk to a doctor for the story, but it wouldn't be too hard to snag one. But if she had another woman with a spontaneous pregnancy, that would really clinch things. Jenny accidentally brushed one hand against her belly and stood up straight. Not her. She was not part of this story. She was not pregnant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny headed for the news van, writing her notes as she did so. On the way over, she got out her cell phone and made a call to the hospital. And just her luck: she got Dr. Anderson's office again. \"Hello, this is Jenny Winters with PRGNT. I'm trying to get an interview with someone in the OB/GYN department about...what appear to be sudden pregnancies. Is anyone available to talk on camera?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist paused. \"I'm not even going to ask what that's about. But I've seen you on the TV a few times, you seem like a professional. Sure, Dr. Georgia Myers will talk to you at 1:30. Just be here, and maybe bring one of these magically pregnant women with you for an examination.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Jenny said sweetly. \"And I appreciate your watching!\" The receptionist hung up before Jenny finished, but it didn't matter. She didn't mean it anyway. Jenny loved the fame but didn't care too much about the fans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, where could Jenny find another suddenly pregnant woman? She did know a few other pregnant women. Her sister, her aunt. And, according to Claire, her cousin. Jenny sighed and decided to check in with Nicole. She doubted it was a \"sudden\" pregnancy for her spoiled cousin. Nicole always chased guys and she didn't seem practical enough to always use protection. Still, a lead's a lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny's cameraman, a tough-looking woman in her 40s named Barbara, joined her and the two got into the news van. \"Now then,\" Jenny said, checking her make-up in the mirror. \"Let's go get that story!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jenny cleared her throat as Barbara set up the lighting for the interview, neither of them addressing the obvious, awkward element to the interview. Not that it was about a woman suddenly becoming heavily pregnant, but she'd never had anyone...exactly like Claire on the news. They were sitting in Dr. Myers' office, after convincing Claire to join them there so they could confirm her pregnancy as well. While Dr. Myers was in typical doctor attire - a white coat with a light blue shirt underneath, Claire opted for a button-up half shirt that was only half buttoned up, so her cleavage and belly were on total display. She also had on a short, lacy black skirt and elegant white pumps on her feet.<br>\r\n\"Ready yet?\" Claire mused, checking her lipstick in her makeup mirror, applying and reapplying it.<br>\r\n\"Not quite yet,\" Jenny said, looking over at Barbara. \"You seem to be feeling a lot better about this than I expected.\"<br>\r\nClaire closed the mirror and purred a little laugh. \"Well, I figure it's not the worst thing that can happen. I'll just give them up for adoption or whatever. I don't like kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Myers, Barbara, and even Jenny reeled a bit at that. \"W-well, you're also much...more free with your pregnant body too.\"<br>\r\nClaire laughed again, adjusting her top and accentuating her breasts once again. \"I look pretty good pregnant though, don't I? You said so. I might as well show off how good I look pregnant.\"<br>\r\n\"Ready to go,\" Barbara said, putting the camera on all three of them.<br>\r\n\"So, Claire, tell me in your own words, what happened with this pregnancy,\" Jenny said, immediately shifting into her shmoozy, anchor persona.<br>\r\n\"I was at a party, it was crowded and dark, but I felt this strange warmth inside me,\" Claire said, rubbing one hand on her belly carefully. \"And then I felt myself swelling and my skin getting tighter. In no time, I had this round mound right here and I could feel kicking inside.\"<br>\r\n\"And when was this?\"<br>\r\n\"Last night, around 10 or 11 PM.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny turned to Dr. Myers. \"Doctor, have you ever heard of something like this happening?\"<br>\r\nDr. Myers adjusted her glasses. \"Not exactly. There are a few different explanations. She could have already been pregnant but the fetus was not 'in' the proper place and it later got into position.\"<br>\r\n\"Is it possible that you were already pregnant?\" Jenny asked Claire.<br>\r\nClaire rolled her eyes. \"No, I use birth control and I've been to the doctor in the past nine months.\"<br>\r\n\"Were you sexually active eight or nine months ago?\" Dr. Myers asked.<br>\r\nA smile crept across Claire's face. \"Well, of course. Look at me. I get many interested men after me.\" Claire turned her gaze a little, now toward Jenny. \"Of course, I'm always open to more.\"<br>\r\nJenny and Claire met eyes and both stayed there for a few moments. Just as Jenny thought she saw Claire wink at her, she shook her head and turned back toward Dr. Myers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-and doctor, what else could be the cause?\"<br>\r\n\"Without much other information, it is possible that Ms. Reynolds is...lying, but you both seem quite adamant that that is not the case.\"<br>\r\n\"No, it is not,\" Claire scoffed. Jenny decided not to chime in, lest her \"impartiality\" be questioned.<br>\r\n\"Well then, doctor, Claire, would you mind proceeding to the ultrasound?\" Jenny asked. Both nodded and Claire laid down on the doctor's bed as Dr. Myers ran her wand over Claire's big belly.<br>\r\n\"Barbara, make sure you get the screen,\" Jenny said, standing up for a better view. \"And my face. Get plenty of b-roll of me nodding and looking interested,\" Claire whispered to Barbara.<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I don't see anything that might indicate an atypical pregnancy,\" Dr. Myers said. \"If there are other cases of this 'sudden pregnancy,' like you said, then this could be a new medical phenomena. And it...yes, it looks like twins. If you had an atypical pregnancy with twins that just got corrected, you wouldn't be as healthy as you look now.\"<br>\r\n\"Twins?\" Claire asked, raising an eyebrow. \"Great, birthing two crying kids is definitely going to mess me up down there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---Nicole---<br>\r\nIn another part of town, Nicole was sitting in front of three employees at the company her father recommended her too, each taking notes and looking at her occasionally. Nicole was sitting down, thanking the fact that she had a desk to cover up her pregnancy during the interview.<br>\r\n\"So you...do not have any college experience, is that correct?\" one of the interviewers, the head of administrations, said. He and the manager were both typical, stuffy, old men.<br>\r\n\"That's correct,\" Nicole said, acting catty and casual. She figured it helped her get what she wants from her father, it should help her here. And it also helped that Nicole's maternity outfit had a fairly low collar that gave a good glimpse of her cleavage when she bent forward. Which she made a point to do. \"I feel that going to college would just have diverted me from looking at the world and picking out what I want to do.\"<br>\r\n\"Good business mindset,\" the manager said quietly, the head of administrations nodding along.<br>\r\nThe head of HR, a woman in her 50s, sighed and looked down the sheet. She was already planning on quitting the job and working somewhere else. This company had more sexual harassment complains made than anywhere she'd ever worked and none of them went anywhere. She almost felt bad for Nicole for potentially entering such an environment, if Nicole wasn't such a blatantly repulsive, spoiled, and unqualified woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of extracurricular work did you do in high school, then?\" the head of HR asked.<br>\r\n\"Cheerleading. Well, cheerleading for two years. It was already so much work and the other girls treated me like bitches. It's because all cheerleaders have flat chests and I was naturally gifted with full breasts.\"<br>\r\n\"Faced discrimination and still came out proud,\" the head of administration said again, getting a nod from the manager. The head of HR just rolled her eyes, overhearing everything they were saying.<br>\r\n\"And what would you say is your work ethic?\" the head of administration asked.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I can do all kids of work. I do whatever it takes to please,\" Nicole purred. The head of HR buried her head in her hands.<br>\r\n\"Thank you, we'll let you know later today about our decision,\" the manager said. Nicole thanked them and walked out. \"I feel good about her,\" the manager said.<br>\r\n\"I agree,\" the head of administratons said. \"A little pudgy, but nothing wrong with that.\"<br>\r\n\"You are horrible men,\" the head of HR said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she left the office, Nicole felt her phone buzz. And she was not happy about the caller I.D. \"Jenny?\"<br>\r\n\"Hey Nikki!\" Jenny said, sitting back in the news van. \"I'll be quick, uncle Roger told me you've got that big, important interview today for a secretary job.\" Jenny, of course, said \"big, important interview\" in the most sarcastic tone she could. \"You know your friend who came with you to that party? Betty?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what about her?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, she looked like she had a bun in the oven!\" Jenny chuckled. As long as Nicole and Jenny had lived near each other, Jenny had known Betty as well. She never liked Betty. \"But I hadn't heard anything about it before. It wasn't, oh I dunno, sudden, was it? Like with that other girl at the party?\"<br>\r\nNicole hesitated. \"What do you know about that?\"<br>\r\n\"Nothing, nothing. It's for the news. I think this is something people need to know about,\" Jenny smiled. She felt her stomach gurgle strangely and shifted in her seat. Maybe teasing was bad for her digestion. \"Anyway, do you think you could give me Betty's contact info?\"<br>\r\nNicole sighed. \"I guess. It's up to her if she'll talk to you or not.\" <br>\r\n\"Great,\" Jenny said. \"Great. And speaking of being pregnant, do you have something to tell me? And did you tell aunt Lucille and uncle Roger yet?\"<br>\r\nNicole scowled. She wished she hadn't just texted Jenny Betty's number. \"I'm not the family member you need to be asking about a hidden pregnancy,\" Nicole said with a furious smile. <br>\r\n\"Who, Stacy?\" Jenny said, rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" Nicole said, hanging up. She continued to smile while panting with fury. Rachel always treated her like garbage, just like Stacy and Jenny. What did she owe her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd later that evening...<br>\r\n<br>\r\ndunn-dun-da-da! Evening News on PRGNT, with your hosts John Maroon and Jenny Winters.<br>\r\n\"Good evening, I'm John Maroon. We start tonight with a story about a possible health emergency in the city. Our own Jenny Winters reports.\"<br>\r\n\"That's right, John,\" Jenny said, turning to the camera. \"I spoke with two different women in the city who said they had pregnancies appear out of nowhere and their claims were confirmed by doctors.\"<br>\r\nJenny turned as the camera switched the package she put together earlier in the day. Snippets of Claire and Dr. Myers' interview played, with Jenny's own narration. Then it cut to Betty, or at least, the neck-down of Betty. She gave her name but didn't want her face to show. That was fine with Jenny: she got to focus the camera right on that huge belly.<br>\r\nThe clip ended and Jenny turned back to the camera. \"If you have similar reports of sudden or unexplainable pregnancy, please contact a doctor,\" Jenny said. <br>\r\n\"And after the break, what the mayor isn't telling you about that stain on his pants,\" John said, as the director called out the break.<br>\r\n\"Jenny, that was great!\" Frank said with a big smile. The phones are lighting up.<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should have talked about your own babies,\" John grumbled, nodding at Jenny's belly.<br>\r\n\"I'm not preg-\"<br>\r\n\"John, shut up. I've already seen your mayor story. It's lousy but we've got nothing else,\" Frank said. \"Back on in one minute.\"<br>\r\nJenny turned back to the camera, smiling brightly. Fame, fame, fame, here she comes. Again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Squeezing into the driver's seat, she noticed that she had 30 minutes to spare.  Her round belly gave a loud grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>God, I'm hungry.  Do I have time to get something to eat?</i> she thought to herself.  The fluttering in her belly returned, and she could swear that it completely shifted.  \"Yup, I definitely have time.\" she said, rubbing her belly in an attempt to calm it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny drove to the town's diner, where she got a discount due to being a local celebrity, and made her way to a booth.  Jenny's regular waitress, Kate, was an attractive woman in her early 40s, but due to her inability to have children, she never married.  \"The usual, Ms Winters?\" she asked.  \"Actually, could you double it?\" Jenny asked, \"I'm just <b>REALLY</b> hungry.\"  \"Sure thing!\" Kate replied, walking back to the kitchen.  <i>Should I congratulate her on the pregnancy?  Probably not...</i>she thought as she gave the cook the order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, the food arrived, and Jenny ate ravenously.  As she ate, the movement increased.  She finished within minutes.  Suddenly, she felt a sharp jab from inside her belly.  She looked down, and was shocked to see that her shirt had begun to ride up, exposing a sizable sliver of rounding flesh.  Jenny heaved herself out of the booth and booked it, forgetting to pay.  She figured she'd come back another time, so she could pay then.  Still in shock, she drove as fast as she could to the doctor's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Christ, Jenny!  You too?\"  Dr. Anderson said, exasperated.  \"Let's just get this over with,\" Jenny pouted, rolling her shirt up.  Dr. Anderson applied the cool gel to Jenny's large stomach, which was shaking with movement.  He moved the wand around her belly for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this seems to be the most so far...\" he said, staring at the monitor.  \"What?  What do you see?!?\" she asked, her eyes widening.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see five babies.  You're having quintuplets, Jenny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny buried her face in her palms and began to sob.  She was perhaps less prepared to be a mother than Nicole.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd five babies?  Jenny definitely wasn't prepared for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Stacy was driving her, her face smiling and giddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't care what Uncle and Aunty say, I think it's great having a cousin go through pregnancy with me!\" Stacy beamed. Nicole looked out the window and rolled her eyes. Of course she did. Stacy was the oldest of the three horror cousins and rarely thought about anyone but herself. Nicole could only imagine what it would be like at Stacy's job when she got really pregnant. She would waddle around giggling, bumping her belly against people, taking company time for maternity clothes shopping. It would be a nightmare for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Nicole grumbled, still rubbing her belly, feeling it with her palms. Every now and then, she thought she could feel some movement inside her now-occupied womb, but was never sure what it actually was. Nicole didn't exact have someone to talk about the experiences of pregnancy with. Except for Betty, of course, but Betty didn't know what it was like to have the babies actually...grow inside her. One second, Betty just went BLAM - pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can't believe you kept it secret for so long,\" Stacy snickered. \"I mean, I don't have to tell you this, but you're big! I can't believe it's only been a few months. You look like you've got two more, tops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Nicole said, still miserable. She wished she could say something catty back to Stacy but she looked...fit. Sure, she might be a little wider around the waist, but it still looked tight and fit. You couldn't have told she was pregnant. But Stacy brought up a concern that Nicole had. Just how pregnant was she? Having four babies definitely fiddled with her size, but she shouldn't be this big so soon! How far along did the doctor say she looked? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's head started spinning as she felt her phone buzz in her pocket. \"Hello?\" Nicole mumbled, not checking to see who called. \"Yes...yes...oh my god! Thank you. Yes, I can be there tomorrow, thank you.\" Nicole hung up, a big smile now on her face. \"Well, at least I'll have some good news to soften the blow now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Stacy said with patently fake excitement. She didn't even glance over. And it wasn't out of concern for safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got hired. I got the job,\" Nicole smiled. <i>I guess I'll need it if I'm going to take care of four little bastards</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neat,\" Stacy said, not even trying this time as she pulled into the Winters household. \"Jenny isn't coming to dinner tonight and Rachel's car is already in the driveway. Maybe she brought Chris too.\" Nicole noticed that Stacy's smile grew a little when she mentioned Chris' name but didn't think much about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two cousins knocked on the door, with Lucille Winters' huge twin-filled belly greeting them. \"Hello Stacy! And Nicole, glad you made it on time today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello mother,\" Nicole spat, walking in, trying to conceal as much of her belly with her jacket as she could. It was embarrassing, but Nicole felt like she had to tell her parents now. If the past nights were any clue, her belly was going to keep getting bigger each day and it didn't seem like it would just keep going forever. One day, she'd wake up and have four screaming babies to take care of. And if she wanted her parents' help at all, she needed to get in front of this thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello girls,\" Roger said, smiling politely as he walked to the door. \"Stacy, how are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" Stacy beamed. \"I have some news when we get to the dinner table.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You and me both</i>, Nicole scoffed in her head. <i>And if we want to make dinner any more of a circus, Rachel too</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel and her fianc\u00e9 Chris were already seated at the main dinner table. \"You sure you don't want any wine?\" Chris asked. Rachel just shook her head bashfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's all sit down and eat,\" Roger smiled. \"Stacy, we can't wait to hear your news.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy nodded and smiled. \"Yes, we'll all tell our new stories!\" Nicole turned to her furiously, her face turning red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of us?\" Lucille said, raising an eyebrow and she rubbed her belly. As everyone else joined Rachel and Chris at the table, Lucille waddled over, slowly lowering herself into her seat. \"What do you mean by that, dear? Nicole, do you have something to share?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you first sis,\" Rachel said, bringing her traditional bullshit Winters smile back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStacy stood up at the table, taking in a big breath with an even bigger smile. \"So, I was at the doctor today and...it's triplets!\" Stacy started cupping and rubbing her still relatively flat belly. \"I'm going to have triplets!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucille and Roger both gasped with big smiles, while Rachel and Nicole both looked away awkwardly. <i>I guess it's genetic</i>, they both thought. Chris just turned pale, his eyes bugging out. Stacy giggled as she surveyed the rooms faces and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Lucille said, turning to Nicole. \"Did you have something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole sighed and stood up, shaking some. Stacy looked at her, still with a huge smile. \"Um, y-yeah. I just got a call and I got the job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucille took a long sip of water while Roger smiled proudly. \"Oh, baby, that's fantastic! Really fantastic. You'll love it, I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, you told me that too,\" Stacy said casually, drinking her water. Nicole gripped her fists tightly, unable to believe the shade her cousin - her dumb preggo cousin - just threw at her. Roger and Lucille both turned back to Nicole, looking inquisitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's more?\" Lucille said shocked. If Nicole announced that she had gotten some kind of accommodation at her interview, the surprise might have caused Lucille to go into labor right there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole bit her lip and opened her jacket slowly. \"Mom, Daddy...I'm pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room went silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You what?\" Lucille almost screamed. \"Nicole Winters, of all the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger rubbed his napkin on his forehead, looking at Nicole's now-clearly pregnant belly. \"When did this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know when or...how it happened,\" Nicole said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you don't,\" Lucille scoffed, resting back in her chair, arms crossed and resting on her own pregnancy. \"How far along are you? You look pretty big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. The doctor didn't give me a really precise estimate,\" Nicole said, now turning bright red. \"And that's not all. It's...it's quadruplets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Rachel's turn to have her eyes bug out. \"R-really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris crossed his arms and looked around the room. <i>I guess it's genetic</i>, he thought worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoger held his head in his hands. \"We...we will have to talk about this later. What are you planning to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Nicole said meekly. Worriedly, she turned to Rachel, giving her impassioned eyes, asking for help. If Rachel announced her pregnancy too, that would at least take the pressure off of Nicole. Rachel met Nicole's eyes for a few seconds, then looked away. Nicole gripped her fists so tightly, her knuckles cracked. <i>You bitch...I'll get you for this</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's...let's just finish our dinner for now,\" Lucille said, dabbing her lips with her napkin. \"At least I'll have another child before I have a grandmother.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Betty sat on her couch, arms around her bulge, watching Jenny sign off the news before switching the TV off. There it was: her pregnancy was on the nightly news for anyone to see. She didn't show her face, but she felt deep down that someone would recognize her. They'd see her familiar lower body, her familiar voice, see that the reporter referred to her as \"Betty\" and put the pieces together. Besides, it wouldn't be much longer until Betty would have to go back to class and the belly would give itself away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People will come up to me and ask what it's like to have a 'spontaneous pregnancy,'\" Betty groaned, rubbing her belly up and down. \"I shouldn't have done this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty's other fear was plenty strong: would her parents see? Parents always seem to be able to tell their child, even without their face showing. Any second now, Betty expected her phone to start ringing and hear her mother crying, her father screaming. Probably a nasty comment or two from her bratty little brother too. She moaned and rolled up her shirt, filling her hands with her roundness, feeling the warmth and tightness of her skin. It felt as real as ever and Betty knew there was no undoing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Betty looked at her belly (which she'd grown more...accustomed to over the past few days. Originally, she thought it made her look fat and ugly but she saw its charm at times, even if she didn't like to admit it), she was reminded of the other startling part of the report. It seems like this instant pregnancy was affecting people other than her. Claire Reynolds from the same school was on the news too, showing off her belly instead of hiding it. That almost made Betty want to go back to campus: seeing all the attention she would get over her pregnancy. A little grin went across Betty's face. She'd probably be tormented even more than Betty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, that wasn't nearly enough of a concession. Claire being made fun of wouldn't make the babies in Betty's belly any less real. Or make them take any longer to be born. And by the looks of Betty, her twins would be coming into the world any day now. Betty sighed and heaved herself up, hands on her belly, groaning as her little ones shifted to the front of her belly along with her, increasing her discomfort. And moving around seemed to upset them as well, as shortly after, her womb was filled with a row of kicking and squirming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey, calm down,\" Betty said, one hand on the small of her back and the other on the front of her belly, belly button between her fingers, \"I ordered some food so you're going to be fed soon, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty paced around the room, rubbing her belly and moaning softly. Pregnant. She couldn't think about anything else. She was pregnant. And she didn't even get there the fun way. Come to think of it, Betty hadn't had sex in a while. It was definitely a longer dry spell than Betty was comfortable with. As she thought about it, the twins shifted into her pelvis again and she let out a little moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does this keep happening?\" she whined. Ever since becoming pregnant (so for the past few days), Betty couldn't stop thinking about sex and now she was heating up even more. Her hands across her swollen skin, the weight in her lap, the sultry news report that Claire gave. But Betty knew she wouldn't be getting any action looking like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell rang and Betty waddled over quickly, the pizza delivery guy standing there in his blue work shirt and baseball cap, holding her pizza out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...delivery for Oak Lane, 111,\" the delivery guy said. Betty could see his eyes obviously not meeting hers. Looking down, she traced his gaze to her belly, exposed thanks to her shirt that she forgot to roll back down. Betty looked up at him, her face burning and bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know I'm pregnant and huge, but I need to get laid,\" Betty sputtered out. \"You up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was the delivery guy's turn to blush. \"Uh...sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, leave the pizza on the table and follow me,\" Betty said, her voice taking on a bizarre sudden confidence even as the rest of her shuddered. She marched to her bedroom, taking off her new maternity clothes as she did, sitting on the bed in just her underwear. The delivery guy followed, clumsily taking off his own clothes, but deciding to go full-nude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do we do this?\" he asked, motioning to Betty's belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know, don't care,\" Betty said, removing her bra, sweat sticking to her cleavage. \"Get over here and do whatever you can.\"</span></div></div>",

Odd enough, Alison's clothing didn't change at all from her new size. Instead, her shirt did stretch out a bit, enough to cover a small portion of Alison's new belly, but it was no match. Her belly was massive; she had to be the size of an overdue pregnant woman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut most surprisingly of all was Alison didn't even notice the changes. She nonchalantly stood, staring at her stomach with a smile, as if nothing had happened at all. The blonde rubbed her huge belly and grinned, \"Hey Audrey, look! The babies are kicking again!\" She exclaimed in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-babies? I...Wha?\" Audrey sputtered, trying to find her tongue. She couldn't quite articulate what had just happened; her mind was doing somersaults and she couldn't think right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlison chuckled; even through she was the size of a heavily expecting woman she still had her saucy, sexy figure. \"Oh Audrey, I already told you months ago! You do realize that I'm having triplets, right?\" She beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat beaded down the sides of Audrey's face. Alison was definitely not pregnant just a few minutes ago, she was sure of that. And now she was? And she didn't even notice the change? She was acting like this was a normal thing. Audrey looked at the coin in her hands, squeezing it instinctively. Could this odd coin have caused this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, I'm hungry.\" Alison said, patting her large stomach. \"What do you say we get outta here and get something to eat? I'm starved!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...yeah...sure,\" Audrey mumbled, following her waddling friend towards the exit.

It was a generic family-friendly restaurant, although the menu did have a variety of beers and alcoholic drinks for the adult audiences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey and Alison walked into the main entryway; well, Alison mostly waddled, her curved hips swinging from side to side as she strutted around, donning her maternal figure. Audrey blinked, trying to clear her mind as it was still flooded with questions. How could her friend suddenly...grow pregnant?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA waitress in her early twenties, perhaps twenty-three or so, approached the two women, sporting a rather jaded smile on her face, as if she was forcing herself to grin in front of the customers. She sighed, \u201cHello, and welcome to the Colorful Mug. My name is Connie and I\u2019ll be your server today. Would you like a table or a booth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A booth, please. I want my babies and my best friend to be as comfortable as possible.\" Alison proclaimed, proudly jutting out her belly as she rubbed its gravid surface in a way to calm the kicking babies within. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnie nodded and made a gesture with her hand, \"Follow me then.\" They obliged and were soon seated at a small booth, enough to fit three to four occupants. Connie handed them both their own menus and smiled again, this time much more genuinely as she eyed Alison's belly. \"Can I get you both something to drink?\" She smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have a small water, simple as that.\" Alison said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'll just have a diet Coke, please.\" Audrey stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. I'll be back in a while with your drinks. Until then, take your time with ordering. There's no rush.\" Connie said quietly. Audrey couldn't help but notice that she was staring intently at her friend's pregnant belly, even as she walked away. She snickered, wondering what the girl was actually thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you getting?\" Alison spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Um...I haven't looked yet.\" Audrey replied, quickly peeking into the menu. While Alison was focused on her menu, Audrey peered over the edge and took a glance at Alison's belly. Underneath the fabric of her sweatshirt she could faintly see tiny bumps and prods visible through the fabric. She couldn't imagine what it felt like to be pregnant, especially with triplets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later their meals were decided and so the waitress returned. Audrey had decided on a simple salad and a side dish of chicken ravioli along with a small diet Coke, while Alison ordered a fried chicken basket complete with fries, a Cesar salad, and her water. Connie nodded and walked away to prepare their orders. Suddenly Audrey felt a rustling in her pocket, as if something inside was moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dug the coin out of her pocket, her eyes knitting into a frown. \"That was weird,\" She commented to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlip me. The same voice from earlier boomed in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flip you? Again?\" Audrey retorted internally. \"No. I don't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlip me, now. The voice demanded, sounding much more intimidating than before. Audrey sighed and decided to give in. Her eyes locked on Connie as she promptly flicked the coin into the air, swiftly and deftly catching it as gravity got to it. When she looked down to see the results she saw...</span></div></div>",

Advancing against her simple black blouse, her belly seemed to repel any and all clothing. The slack provided by her growing stomach was immediately filled by her breasts, and then some. Buttons rocketed off the shirt, revealing a bra overflowing with their owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SNAP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe defeated garment fell to the floor, breasts continuing their advance. Her lower half was not to be ignored. Widening hips and fattening bottom proved too much for her skin-tight skirt, rips forming up her thigh revealing panties ready to burst from her body. The pale dome of her belly, while challenged by her breasts, dominated her figure a gargantuan sphere of maternity even bigger than Alison. Just when it seemed she would burst; the growth stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe normally bustling restaurant was silent. The only sound was the frantic breathing of Connie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...My...GOD\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey felt her eyes well up, <i>This...it's all my fau-</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YESSSSSSSSSSSS\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreviously motionless, Connie's hands began shameless exploring her new body. Breasts bigger than her head were fondled, nipples tweaked. Great sweeping arcs made over her belly. She even spared a shake or two for her behind. Completely entranced by the spectacle, no one moved. At once the staff of the Colorful Mug sprang into action. A waiter grabbed a tablecloth off of an unoccupied table. The sound of glass shattering was ignored. The manager could be heard frantically apologizing to other patrons. A frantic phone call to 911 could be heard on the opposite side of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before Connie was ushered away, she backed her way to Audrey and Alison's table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween pants, Connie managed to utter a husky \"Sorry...about your...lunch.\" Tearing her eyes away from Connie's frontage, Audrey noticed the billion-watt grin plastered on her reddened face. There was not an ounce of regret. A flash of white, and Connie was again decent. The wait staff formed a circle around her and disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What. the hell. just happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey got to her feet and offered a hand, \"Come on, we need to get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey quickly left her waddling friend behind as she found their car. Ripping the door open, she slammed it into the car beside her. She didn't care. A thousand thoughts ran through her mind, but one was front and center. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What are you?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey caught her eye in the rear-view mirror and quickly looked away. A second later she twisted it toward herself. Her skin was pale, sweat beading on her forehead, pupils large and shifty. She looked terrible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey!\" She could barely hear her name being called. She scanned the row of cars before she found Audrey squeezing through a couple of sedans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audrey, what the hell? You just leave your hugely pregnant bff so she can get caught by the pregnancy ghost and blown up even bigger?\" Audrey gave a half-hearted wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">Flip Me</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh god, no, please. She's big enough.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">FLIP ME</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her thumb flick the coin into the air, Alison coming closer into view. Her eyes darted back to the rear-view. She looked back at Alison, almost in front of the car now. As she caught the coin, her eyes locked on...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had started off as a really good day for Collin. The young man had finished all of his classes of the day, and while most college kids usually spent Fridays celebrating the end of the week by partying with their friends, Collin refused to share in such celebrations. After all, one had to first acquire friends in order to party, and Collin had neither the time nor the willingness to be social more than he was already required.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, on most days, he curled up in his room, locked away reading some lesser-known novel or perhaps some dark poetry. Well, either that or studying; but even he, the walking definition of a bookworm, grew weary of such a solitary life every once and a while. So today, he went on a rare adventure into town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been raining all day, but he seemed to be the only one walking the streets who appeared not to mind the dreary weather. <i>It reminds me of home,</i> the brunette thought as he splashed his way through the puddles everyone else save for some adventurous schoolboys up ahead seemed so eager to avoid. He hated to admit it, but he really was feeling homesick; after all, a handful of months away from home would do that to anyone with a heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he meandered through the surprisingly quiet streets with no real destination, he wondered what Mummy was up to and if anyone was missing him too terribly back home. Probably not. After all, being one of thirteen children in a household and having no accomplishments to speak of, he didn't figure he was particularly high up on the list of favorites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnapping out of his melancholic state before he grew too upset, he stopped in his tracks as her surveyed his unfamiliar surroundings. Where in the world was he? He began to formulate a plan to find his way back to his apartment when his chocolate eyes landed on something glimmering on the ground a little ways ahead of him. His eyes normally would have overlooked it if it had not been for the color of the coin: bright yellow, a color that caught the few rays of sunshine that fought through the rain clouds. He moved closer, entranced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i>Pick me up, Collin</i></span> a strange albeit soothing voice echoed in his mind as he drew near to the object, and he did not need to be told twice. Collecting coins was one of the few pastimes that still brought him joy, and this would be just perfect to add to his collection! He wiped the coin off carefully and studied it. The images depicted on the front and backside of the coin were strange to say the least, a pregnant woman... and a pregnant man? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was quite puzzled but didn't really have time to give it thought as a loud roll of thunder boomed all around him. Getting his priorities straight, he pocketed the coin without hesitation and hailed a taxi. He could research the strange object later, but for now, he simply wanted to get back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long to get back to his apartment building, surprisingly. He eagerly clambered up the stairs of his nearly empty building, excited to simply rest and do some research on the oddest contribution to his coin collection yet. He fingered the thing anxiously in his pocket as he unlocked the door and hurried inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"clred\">Flip me, Collin</span></i> the coin seemed to call to him, and for some reason or other, Collin isn't perplexed by this at all. Shrugging off his coat and kicking off his shoes, he collapsed into his chair that faced one of the few windows in the apartment. While he was normally content to watch the rain drizzle down outside, a phantom voice was calling him and he was eager to obey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling what he now coined (pun intended) the Pregnancy Coin out of his jeans pocket, he unconsciously flipped it into the air. Little did he know that this little coin flip would flip his entire life. The coin landed, and he closed his palm around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i>Look at someone, Collin</i></span> the voice commands, and Collin sees none other than...</span></div></div>",

He turned around in his chair and was greeted by the eager grin of his roommate, Lune Dubois. The Englishman sighed and wondered for the umpteenth time how he got stuck with such a perky roomie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were extreme opposites of one another: Lune was always optimistic, charismatic, easy going, and so social that he was rarely ever in the apartment. The only thing the two had in common was that they were both exchange students (Lune being from France, though, and not Great Britain) which was the only reason why they had become roommates to begin with. Collin thought that perhaps living with someone in the same boat as him would ease the pressure of moving to a new country, but it really had only succeeded in him being stuck with a too-energetic roomie who Collin couldn't muster the heart to leave behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe French man tossed down his shopping bags and hung up his coat, whistling a little tune to himself as though he had not noticed Collin sitting in the living room. While pulling his messy blonde hair into a small bun, Lune turned and finally caught sight of his roommate. He was surprised for a moment to see Collin out of his room for once, but his look of surprise almost immediately snapped back into a pleasant grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, <i>bonjour,</i> Collin! Although, this late in the day, I suppose <i>bonsoir</i> would be a bit more appropriate,\" Lune beamed, accent flaring, talking a mile a minute while searching the cabinets in the conjoined kitchen. Collin's eyes never left the tanned man, and while normally he was polite enough to at least greet his somewhat estranged roommate, he had other things on his mind currently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i>Reveal it: heads or tails?</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand curled tighter around the coin for a moment before he unclenched it entirely. Lune, now realizing how quiet his roommate was being, turned and gave a puzzled look. \"Are you all right?\" he asked as Collin looked down at the coin which had landed on...</span></div></div>",

Instead, he simply stared down at the coin in his hand blankly, wondering what this all meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you with me,<i> mon ami</i>?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The pressure in the room seemed to grow more and more intense, and when Collin thought he could bear it no longer, it vanished entirely. No longer feeling compelled by some outside force to hold the coin, it disappeared back into his pants pocket. He wondered for a moment why he felt so anxious, but something simply seemed... off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did not have to wonder about what was bothering him for very long as the question was immediately answered when he turned his attention back over to his roommate who had been staring at him with a genuinely worried gaze for some time now. Collin's jaw fell to the floor as he took in the unexpected sight, trying and failing over and over to say something. Lune stared at him in confusion until the Englishman finally managed to get some utterance out of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did you get so bloody huge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe those weren't the right words to use, although they were fair. Lune's previously only somewhat pudgy stomach had transformed into a heavily rounded belly that threatened to peak out from underneath his huge sweater. His hands rested on the globe, stroking it as if attempting to calm something or someone within. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Collin's comment registered, Lune's face fell, and he appeared to be offended. \"Oh!\" he huffed indignantly as he rubbed his belly, \"You are so cruel to me, <i>mon ami</i>!\" When this response only succeeded to confuse Collin more, Lune lost his agitation and grew worried again. \"Have you hit your head since last we met? I am six months pregnant with twins; I am <b>supposed</b> to be huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lune laughed at his roommate, Collin's eyes widened and seemed to bulge out of his skull. \"Pregnant?\" he cried, \"What sort of joke are you playing on me here?\" He didn't mean to sound so accusing, but he wanted to get to the bottom of this. With hesitant steps, he approached the blonde, chocolate eyes never once leaving the mammoth belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLune, upon realizing that his stomach was being stared at, blushed at the newfound attention. He grew shyer as Collin drew closer and was too confused by the situation to formulate a response. Thankfully, he didn't have to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lift up your shirt,\" Collin commanded without considering decency, and Lune's blush only darkened a shade. To think that his secret crush was suddenly paying so much attention to him and his children; why, it was enough to make him swoon! He did as instructed, head turning away so he did not have to stare at Collin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollin, in turn, was shocked at what he saw. The French man's stomach was inflated, looking like he had swallowed a basketball. His belly button was popped out and his skin, despite being pulled over the large space, showed no stretch marks of any sort. Wildly intrigued and no longer thinking clearly, Collin put his hand on the belly without permission. A moan rose in Lune's throat which he bit back into a whimper at the touch. It did not take long for the baby closest to Collin's hand to kick out, surprising the brunette in the process. He moved his hand away as Lune hissed in discomfort, and they both watched as the children grew noticeably restless, both fighting for space in the cramped confines of their mother's womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had just gotten them to sleep, too,\" Lune grumbled as he attempted to soothe his children to no avail. \"At least they know who their <i>papa</i> is, <i>non</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollin's eyes widened even more (if that was possible) at Lune's suggestive comment. \"I-I'm not...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe French man laughed without cruelty, eyes gleaming and blush finally starting to fade. \"<i>Non</i>, you are not, you know that.\" <i>But life would be so much simpler if you were,</i> Lune wanted to add, but he kept that to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe father of the babies in Lune's belly, if Collin was to be completely honest, was the least of his worries at the moment. What he really wanted to know was how the kiddos got there in the first place. It was then that unfamiliar memories came flooding back to him: he remembered comforting Lune after his nasty breakup with that asshole-who-shall-not-be-named, growing a closer friendship with his roommate, being there when his friend was told he was up the duff, comforting Lune through all the morning sickness and mood swings...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n These memories came to him in an instant, and as foreign as they were, they felt real all the same. Should he believe these new memories? or should he get to the bottom of all of this?</span></div></div>",

The mysterious coin was slipped back into his pocket as he jumped up from his chair and rushed over to the only person he could call a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLune had dropped a bag of groceries, its contents spilling out all over the floor, but Collin ignored this completely as he trampled over everything to get to his roomie's side. It was plain to see that the French man was in pain, his petite hands clutching his stomach through his oversized sweater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you all right?\" Collin questioned, echoing the other's question from earlier, hand drifting to rest on the small of the taller man's back where he had begun rubbing gentle circles, something his Mummy always did when his stomach was aching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Je vais bien,</i>\" Lune panted in response, and thankfully, Collin had taken enough basic French courses online to understand. It was plain to see, though, that Lune was far from fine and instead looked to be in a great deal of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go to the couch,\" Collin instructed, his posh accent flaring as he grew more nervous, \"and I'll find you something that might help.\" Lune didn't object and walked the short distance to said couch, collapsing on it as Collin rummaged the medicine cabinet for something that might help. Lune gave a louder yelp, and Collin gave up on the medicine idea. \"If-if you're in that much pain, maybe we better take you to the hospital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment of silence, and then, \"I... I think I am okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to this statement, Lune was no longer making sounds of pain or discomfort. Collin closed the medicine cabinet, puzzled beyond belief. \"I... think I have a bigger problem, though...\" Lune spoke again, sounding himself quite confused and panicked as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a sense of dread wash over him, Collin slowly walked back into the living room and circled around the couch. Lune sat up carefully with his slender arms wrapped around his midsection. That was where Collin's eyes were immediately drawn, and the sight that awaited him was the strangest he had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLune was already a somewhat pudgy man, but his belly was hugely swollen, filling up the entirety of his lap. His sweater had risen up, exposed skin proving that this was not some sort of peculiar prank. Lune ran his fingers across his globe-like middle, laughing more out of shock than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I might be <i>enceinte,</i>\" Lune murmured, and it didn't take much time for Collin to realize what that word meant. The blonde laughed once again with his blue eyes flicking between Collin's blank face and his own pregnant dome. \"I never paid much attention in sex ed, but I really do not think this is how babies are made.\" This little joke sent the shocked and now heavily pregnant man into a fit of hysterical laughter, and Collin...</span></div></div>",

After a moment, Collin suddenly snapped his fingers and grinned, surprising the knocked up man on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it,\" he beamed with a grand gusto; Lune eyed him carefully, desperate for some explanation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must be dreaming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLune groaned at this and hid his face in his hands. If only it were that simple! Though he was still very much shaken and almost nearly lacking a sense of reality, he still had enough sense to know that this was indeed real, as odd as it was. As Collin went about trying to get himself to wake up from a nonexistent dream, Lune carefully stood up, wobbling as he adjusted to having such a large weight in his middle. He walked (well, it was more of a waddle, really) the short distance to Collin and placed a shaking albeit soothing hand upon the shorter man's shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really do not think this is a dream, <i>mon ami</i>,\" he spoke gently, and Collin attempted to consider this possibility, eyes flicking down once more to gaze at the other's bulging belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suppose,\" he swallowed nervously, \"Suppose that this is real. How do you know for sure that you're... you're, um...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, Lune grabbed Collin's warm hand and placed it upon his stomach. Immediately, they both felt a sharp kick causing Lune to whimper in discomfort and Collin's breath to hitch in his throat. There really was no denying it, then: it couldn't get much more real than that. Collin knew he should be mortified at the idea of his roommate genuinely being heavily pregnant, but, if he were to be honest, he was very much intrigued by the idea. He brought his other hand to Lune's large abdomen and was greeted by two more swift jabs. Lune frowned and blushed deeply but didn't otherwise complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose he knows who his <i>papa</i> is, <i>non</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollin's head snapped up to meet Lune's suggestive gaze. \"I-I'm not...!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe French man laughed in return. \"I know. I am only teasing you.\" Collin wondered how someone could be so calm in a situation like this, but then he noticed the glazed panic in his roommate's eyes: Lune was only trying to stay calm for Collin's sake. Now calm, intrigued, and confused, Collin moved his hands away and began pacing again, this time in a more thinking manner rather than panicky. Lune took this opportunity to sit back down on the couch as his ankles were already starting to ache from the pain of supporting the weight of another human being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any idea what could have caused this? I mean, obviously we aren't dealing with the natural laws of nature as men can't even get pregnant, let alone so quickly,\" Collin rambled thoughtfully, \"so maybe we're dealing with supernatural forces?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Super... natural?\" Lune echoed in confusion whilst simultaneously wincing from a new onset of kicks and jabs from his surprisingly energetic child, \"as in ghosts and goblins?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's more to it than that,\" Collin replied. He began to think harder. Was this a result of some sort of potion? or a spell? He was well-versed in the ways of ancient magic, even though he didn't really believe in any of the nonsense. Now, he wasn't so sure what to believe anymore. \"Was there anything you did today that was abnormal in any way? Anything you ate or drank, perhaps? Anything you did that seemed odd in any way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were the one acting <i>\u00e9trange</i> today. When I walked in, you were being so <i>silencieux</i> and would not stop staring <i>\u00e0 moi</i>,\" Lune pointed an accusing finger at Collin, and it was then that everything became clear. The brunette knew now that this all had something to do with the coin sitting idly in his pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was prepared to spill the beans on the strange object, but he stopped himself. If he told Lune about the coin, Lune would surely blame him for knocking him up, and Collin would get in all kinds of trouble. Did he really want his roommate to resent him for this? What should he do?</span></div></div>",

She was the oldest nun through was about in her early 60's.  Her body was tall and looked with her age, her hair having mostly faded into whiteness, yet overall, she looked composed and mature.  Her face had little to no wrinkles.  <br>\r\n\"I'll have to inquire to the others about this...\" Mary pocketed the coin, \" ...Honestly, what kind of currency has this?\" Mary put aside these thoughts as she left her room and headed to Sunday sermon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe halls bellowed with sounds of the nuns singing.  Humming of the sermon  countiued on, going on with a somber melody.  A row of three nuns opposote to each other were holding the Holy Bible.  Then, in tune, the song stopped.  Each of the nuns clised their books.  Slowly, the nuns began to  leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sister Mary Ruth!\"  Mary turned around to see another sister approaching.  \"Why, hello Sister Ann.\" said Mary.

My responsibility for the abby now is a role<br>\r\n.  A role that should be fulfilled as much as possiable.\"  Sister Ann sighed, \"I guess making candles does make us alot of money. \"  The two parted ways after awhile as the two walked to where Mary was going.  It was just a simple, wooden door.  Mary went inside;  It was an even simpler work space, with a table and candles stacked on the side.

The nun felt the need to lay back on her bed.  When she did, she felt a heavy gravity on top of her, like a prescience near her stomach.

Mary Ruth once again observed her body.<br>\r\n<i>I just need to sit down</i><br>\r\nThe sister moved her feet towards her bed, waddling at a slow pace.  Sitting down, the thoughts inevitably began flooding into her mind.  <br>\r\n<i>This has to be some kind of dream.</i><br>\r\nMary Ruth's old hands glided over her stretched robe, feeling the mass below.  There was a slight bump that Mary felt however, a little, immeasurable kick. A kick felt for a fraction of a second, only for the movement to sporadically stop and then start on its own.  <br>\r\nThe nun was trying to calm her belly.  <br>\r\n\"I wonder if this is how the Virgin Mary felt.\" whispered Mary Ruth.<br>\r\nThe restlessness in her tummy reminded Sister Mary Ruth on a memory.  The memory, in particular, was when she was a little girl many years ago, in Catholic school.  She remembered going to class, studying the Bible she held dear.  The many stories within the book most fascinated her.   <br>\r\nIn a lesson one day, young Mary once read about the birth of Jesus.  The Immaculate Conception or the story of the Virgin Mary stuck out to her.  In it, a woman named Mary was once visited by an angel of God, Gabriel, who told her of becoming pregnant with the son of God without having, well, \"intimate relations\" with a lover, therefore convincing while a virgin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Mary Ruth shook her head.  No angel came to her to bless her with a child, nor did she recall the Virgin Mary ballooning up with child as soon as she knew of it (and looking a few months overdue as well.).  <br>\r\nThen Mary Ruth's attention turned to the coin she left.  Her eyes honed in on the object, lying on a dresser next to the mirror.<br>\r\n\"This little thing..., there has to be a way to reverse...\" <br>\r\nMary Ruth was just in reach of the coin when something hit her.  It was the kicking, but there was something different about it. It felt much more aggressive.  The nun grunted.  She squatted to the ground before catching herself.  Her belly had become more active.<br>\r\n<i>\"Thisss, is nnot a dream.\"</i><br>\r\n Mary Ruth realized, she was having contractions. A fear swept her mind, here was a older woman, all alone to suddenly become swollen with apparently a baby and could possibly be having it in the same night.</span></div></div>",

She plopped onto the furniture, and sprawling across.  Her head on a pillow and on her back, the bed creaked underneath her, the weight of the baby bump pressuring it.  Layering on her bed, the nun looked especially big, her large pregnant belly distending above.<br>\r\n<i>Let me try and wait this out</i> thought the nun<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the worst happened.<br>\r\nMary Ruth's water broke, spilling out on the bed.  The nun was initially surprised.<br>\r\n\"N...n.no\" stuttered Mary Ruth<br>\r\n\" I'm..m going to have ... a baby.\"<br>\r\n\"A..AAhhhh\" shouted the nun.<br>\r\nAnother contraction hit her.  The nun pulled back her black gown,  exposed her skin and started skimming over the taunt steretch.  The action was somewhat calming to the storm of action her bump was making, yet it still kicked on.  <br>\r\nMary Ruth's forehead was sweating, coming down in drops.  The nun was breathing in and out, her big belly moving in time with it.  She was trying to hold her belly which was dropping. She pressed her head against the pillow and screamed \"AAAhhhhhhh...\".<br>\r\n  Sister Mary Ruth bent forward, pushing with all her might.  Falling back, the nun kept in tune, trying to relieve in this pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later....<br>\r\nThe night hours were silent.  A quiet ambiance developed, no stirrings or noise. The moon had emerged, brightening the dark sky.<br>\r\n Inside Mary Ruth's room, the nun laid on her bed.  Tired, the woman was still in bed;  her stomach had resided.  In her arms was what was in her stomach, a child.  The baby was human, alive with vigor, crying.  <br>\r\nMary Ruth looked toward her window and smilied.<br>\r\n\"Perhaps the Lord does work in mysterious ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A coin, that when flipped, caused a pregnancy in whomever was unlucky enough to be looked at by the person flipping the coin? What if this coin, this bizarre practical joke by some twisted mind, was lost among time, after leaving a wake of expanded bellies in it's path?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what if this coin was accidentally found? And what if it landed in the hands of an everyday person? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeads or Tails?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">OCTOBER 2020 UPDATE:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, it's been a while hasn't it? Welcome to Versions 2.0 of Heads or Tails! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what's new? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've cut-down on some of the plots that were dead-ends or went nowhere. I've reduced some of the characters, updated the thanks, and....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdded a new Holiday path! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is something that I've always wanted to do since the inception of 1.0, but didn't have the time or desire. With everything going on right now, this seemed like the time to do something about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what happens now? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've added a branch that allows you access to new characters, new locations based around holidays! So far we've got Halloween, Christmas, Valentine's Day and USA 4th of July. There will be plenty of time to add more holidays as this work of fiction matures.  </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>OVER 80,000 VIEWS! WOW! THANKS EVERYONE! Over 720 Chapters!

Four new character await you on \"More Characters\". So get adding! </b></u></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGET ADDING CHAPTERS. I KNOW PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT THIS STORY, SO GET ADDING! <br>\r\nGP per good add! PUT SOME EFFORT INTO IT! GOOD WORK IS REWARDED, BAD WORK WILL BE DELETED OR EDITED! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's come to my attention that there may be people out there with great ideas for the story, who may not want to write chapters. So, send me your ideas and I'll do my best to translate them into chapters for you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>GP given for reviews and decent added chapters! Feel free to add!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWelcome to my interactive story! Let's put do some ground rules: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI. Pregnancy/MPREG.<br>\r\nII. No Characters Under The Age Of 18. <br>\r\nIII. Keep It PG-13. You can get a little crazy with this, but come on, use some common sense. <br>\r\nIV: Always keep two story paths open. Can't think of another option? Just write \"Something Else\" <br>\r\nV: No one-line adds. Add at least a paragraph, even if it isn't a great paragraph.<br>\r\nVI: Any chapter can be edited by story creator if fails to meet any of the story guidelines, (I will contact you first) <br>\r\nVII: Don't worry about spelling and grammar. We all make mistakes, just try your best!<br>\r\nVIII: Multiple POV's allowed AND ENCOURAGED. Let's see other people's thought on the goings-on from their frame of mind.  <br>\r\nIX: The ability to rewrite reality affects the person affected, and the people around them, not the coin holder.<br>\r\nX: Pregnancies are caused by flipping a coin (on purpose or inadvertently) and looking at a person (male or female) when the coin lands. <br>\r\nNOTE: If a character catches sight of themselves in a mirror or reflection and flip the coin, they WILL become pregnant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules Of The Coin:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coin works two ways: (Your choice)<br>\r\nIt can either create a brand-new FAST PREGNANCY:<br>\r\n - A FAST PREGNANCY lasts 9 days, each day being a month of pregnancy. (Be sure to include symptoms! Morning sickness, cravings, weight gain)<br>\r\nOR<br>\r\nIt can expand a person to a certain month of pregnancy, bypassing the other months and getting right to a specific month of pregnancy, and having the pregnancy continue on as normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdditionally, and the reason why it's called HEADS or TAILS;<br>\r\nHEADS; (as depicted on the coin a pregnant man and woman with a smile on their face) REWRITES reality, so that the person affected by the pregnancy either accepts the pregnancy, always thinks they were pregnant, etc. <br>\r\nTAILS: (as depicted on the coin a pregnant man and woman with a panic look on their face) does NOT REWRITE reality, meaning that the person affected by the pregnancy, will truly be surprised, and probably a little panicked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Oh yeah, did I mention the fact that I'm giving out a lot of GP for new chapters! Get writing!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, pull a chair, have a seat, and get reading (and adding)! </td>",
