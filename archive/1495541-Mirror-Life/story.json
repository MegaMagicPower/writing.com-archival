That's simply part of how we operate. Now, your current gender is, male right? After all, our products have been tested, and so far have only worked on the male gender, including the disability of putting the phone down.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Uh, yeah, I guess. But what exactly is this?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is Mirror Life.You will be transported to a parallel universe to ours, and meet yourself in that world. Then it's up to you to decide-'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait? How is that even possible?' you cry out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't think that matters now, does it? You'll just have to go through with this. Now pick a gender for yourself, and a gender for the you that you'll meet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Uh, right.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh and one more thing. If you chose both yourself and the other being of yourself to be the same gender, you'll look exactly alike. And you'll both look similar if you chose opposite genders as well. Try not to freak out yourselves, okay?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(First gender is for the main character, second is for the alternate being of himself in the parallel universe, in case that wasn't clear enough.)</span></div></div>",

Though I'll settle for being able to make this joke once again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could almost hear the alternate you blink. \"Well,\" she said, \"if you aren't me, you're doing a really good impression. Pretty sure I'm the only one who ever makes that joke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I bet you do it all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least once a week,\" she laughed. \"Alright, for the time being, let's say I believe you. First, let's go inside, then you can tell me what's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou appreciate that she didn't feel the need to offer any threats, since that's what you'd have done in her situation. Although, maybe she wouldn't have in the first place? Would being born and raised female as opposed to male have really made that much difference to how you turned out? <i>\"Well, guess there's only one way to find out,\"</i> you think as you follow female-you inside your not-house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour alternate world parents certainly had the same decorating sense, at least. Beige walls were nearly invisible under the fight for space being carried out by family photos and wildlife art. China cabinets stood full of antiques, and the World's Ugliest Plaid Couch dominated the wall by your not-Mom's piano. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, constantly needing to remind yourself that this wasn't your universe was going to be irritating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed female-you into the kitchen. Knowing without even asking, she grabbed two cans of Mountain Dew from the fridge and chucked one at you. She took a sip from her drink as she looked you up and down. \"Alright, let's hear your spiel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a moment to collect your thoughts. \"Well, to start with, my name is Charles James. You'd be Charlotte, I'm guessing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Esther Meredith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Esther!?\" You were slightly shocked at that realization. \"Why would... wait... oh my God, Mom named us after Great-Grandma Baker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo,\" Esther responded as you rubbed the bridge of your nose in irritation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did she ever get Dad to agree to that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damned if I know. I'm sure there's lots of lovely women named Esther. Unfortunately, they're dead,\" Esther quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, moving on.\" Anymore thought on this subject would beyond doubt prove fruitless. \"Back in my world, I have a younger sister, Melody, two years my junior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had a cat named Smokie, and a dog-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what about Evan?\" Esther interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our younger brother, Evan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have a younger brother back in my world.\" Well, this was a bit of a mystery. Why had your alternate parents had another kid? Unless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour female counterpart beat you to the punch. \"It'll have been Dad. He wanted a son to carry on the family name. Because you- well, I guess, we- were born male in your world, in his mind, he'd already achieved what he needed to. He always thought three or more kids was too many. Mom would have been the one pushing for a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you sigh, \"that sounds like Dad's logic alright.\" You loved your old man dearly, but he could be very old fashioned sometimes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But yeah,\" Esther continued as she finished off her drink. \"Cat, Smokie, asshole. Dog, Georgie, psycho. Love'em both to death. Now, how did you get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou proceeded to walk your female self through your journey- the weird phone call, the questions, getting pulled into this world, your own mother forgetting your very existence. Esther listened attentively in silence, waiting until you finished before asking further questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand why you chose to remain male. Why'd you choose the other-you to be a woman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was kind of curious what I'd look like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I turned out to be some kind of murderous psycho, you figured your odds would be better if you had fifty pounds on me.\" You involuntarily flinched when she pointed that out. \"Don't be that shocked; we're roughly the same person. I'd have tried something similar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsther crumpled the empty soda can in her hand before tossing it in the recycle bin. She leaned back against the counter as she looked you up and down. \"Well, I'm virtually convinced you're being honest. I'll need a DNA test before I can say a hundred percent, but I am inclined to think you're telling the truth. Or we're both f@#$ing nuts, either or. Now, the next question is: what happens now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat... was actually a very good question. You technically didn't exist in this world. In all likelihood, all the id's in your wallet were worthless. You'd need a job, but could you even get one? Did you even count as being educated in this world? Where would you live? Christ, what would you do next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsther, seeing the signs of panic setting in (you really needed to work on your poker face), interjected before your emotions could spiral out of control. \"Okay, calm down, boy. Jesus, nice to know male-me never got out of nervous teenager mode. First off, do you have any money on you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've got a few hundred bucks on me,\" you answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Then for now, you'll live with me. I'm not sure what your plans were, but I'm going back to college starting next week. My room mate Daniella bailed on me yesterday; you moving in saves me hunting for a new one. You'll need a job to pay for your half of the rent, but we'll worry about that later. I just came to town to grab the last of my stuff. We'll hit up a Wally World before we hit the road so you can grab some extra clothes and toothbrush and the like. Sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds amazing. Thank you!\" You had to restrain yourself from hugging... yourself. This was going to get terribly confusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsther laughed. \"Don't thank me yet. My couch is harder then a concrete floor. Now c'mon. You can help me carry some boxes down to my car. And let's hurry up; I'd really rather not have to explain you to Mom and Dad right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStreet lights passed over the small car in streaks as the pair of you made your way down the interstate. You'd managed to pack up and do your shopping without incident, and Esther turned her car towards her college home about quarter to six.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, she had failed to mention it was a six hour drive beforehand, but you were hardly in a position to complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you had talked for a fair bit of the drive. While most of your lives were the same, certain details were off. For example, while both you were skilled academically, Esther was considerably more physically active, having played basketball in high school and regularly hitting the gym. By contrast, you hadn't played a single sport in school, being far too worried about looking like an idiot in front of others, and generally only went to the gym by accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour paths in college were drastically different as well. While you were both drop outs, Esther had told her (your?) parents considerably sooner then you did. Rather then rack up failed courses and debt like you had, Esther had gone home and worked for a couple years to get her head on straight, and now was ready to give it another go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wouldn't say it out loud, but you were a little annoyed that your female-self seemed a lot more mature then you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, it was fairly close to midnight, and the well of conversation had dried up as fatigue set in. As you traveled in silence, you looked over the female version of yourself. You hadn't been lying when you said you were curious about what you'd look like as a woman, and if you were stuck here, you might as well take a gander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, and at the risk of sounding narcissistic, you were a pretty good looking woman. Esther had an elfin face with a delicate, symmetrical structure. She kept her wavy blond hair cut to chin length, and her blue eyes seemed to sparkle. While you had matching features, though with a considerably more masculine overtone, you'd always felt they were somewhat out of place on you. On her, they just seemed to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one particular area where Esther really stood out, however.</span></div></div>",

Esther, the female You, was unquestionably one of bustiest women you'd ever seen. She'd set her seat a good ways back to avoid hitting her tits with the steering wheel. The seat belt had been fed between them of necessity, pulling her blouse tight over her bounteous bosom, her bra visible through the strained material and dreadfully little left to the imagination. She'd undone the top couple of buttons on her blouse to keep it from digging into her throat, leaving precious inches of creamy white skin on display. The sheer size of her breasts meant her upper arms were constantly jostling and pressing into the copious amounts of silky flesh. Combining that with the gelatinous jiggle that passed through them with every bump in the road resulted in a ripple effect that was almost hypnotic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took far more effort then you cared to admit to look away from that sight. <i>\"Seriously, man, get it together! She is literally you! That is a special kind of wrong!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't doubt for a second which side of the family she/you had gotten it from. Your Mom's side had generally been well endowed, usually C's and D's, though a few woman had reached larger sizes. Esther, though, had breached a whole 'nother category. You couldn't even fathom a guess as to what her cup size actually was, though if her bras had been labelled \"Unbelievably Huge,\" you wouldn't have been terribly surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wonder how Melody took this?\"</i> you thought. Where you/Esther took after your Mom, Melody had taken after your Dad's side. She had grown into a rather petite girl with bright red hair, perpetually stuck at a B. It had always irked her that her maternal cousins were bustier then she was, especially given the age gap between them, so her reaction to her older sister's giga-bust must have been spectacular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made it a particular point not to look at Esther's body the rest of the trip. Seriously, this was getting uncomfortable, and Heaven forbid you get caught staring at... well, yourself.</span></div></div>",

The hand on your shoulder succeeded where the voice had failed, and you opened your eyes. Staring back at you was a pretty blonde face that looked rather familiar...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I wasn't dreaming all this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsther snorted. \"Nope, you definitely weren't. We're here. Grab a box and let's get in. I could sleep for a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere, in this case, was a townhouse in a small suburb. Honestly, there wasn't that much to differentiate this place from all the others around it, although maybe it was more recognizable in daylight. The front lawn was nearly microscopic, and the front of the house was nearly all gone to the driveway and garage. As you exited the car, a light turned on as you activated its motion sensor, helping with the darkness somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeeting Esther around the back of the car, you shifted awkwardly as she thrust a box stuffed full of kitchen utensils into your arms. Smiling an apology at you, she stacked the last couple of boxes up and heaved them towards the door. You took a moment to shoulder the duffel bag you'd purchased and filled with your newfound stuff, then hurried forward to help Esther with her boxes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment fumbling with her keys, she opened the door to the beeping of the alarm. She quickly keyed in the code, which you promptly noticed was your birth year (<i>\"I'll have to convince her that's a bad idea.\"</i>), and the alarm fell silent. \"Just stack the boxes in the kitchen for now. I'll get the last ones from the car and lock it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short order, everything of importance was inside and you collapsed on the couch. \"God, I'm tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flinched as a pillow and blanket landed on your face. \"Thanks,\" you muttered as you arranged your impromptu bed. You learned much to your chagrin that Esther wasn't kidding about the couch. You were pretty sure there were wooden boards with more give then these cushions, but beggars can't be choosers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you arranged your bunk, Esther gave you the quick rundown of the place. \"There's a two piece bath on this floor, and a full sized one upstairs. Both bedrooms are on the second floor. Once you have the money for it, we'll set you up in the other bedroom. There's also the suite downstairs, if that's more to your liking, though I was planning to rent that out. Washer and dryer are also in the basement. There's a deep freeze in the garage. It's kind of used for storage; not sure there's enough space to squeeze my car in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good. Thanks for all this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I really mean it.\" You stopped making your bed to look her in the eyes. \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled broadly, with a slight blush upon her cheeks, humbled by your heartfelt thanks. \"It has been an odd day, hasn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was your turn to snort. \"Odd doesn't begin to describe this day.\" You laid back on the couch before continuing, \"And all I was trying to do was fix a printer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't I tell you that? I only called that number because I couldn't get my old printer to connect with my laptop. There was a card with that number on it, no other info, in the printer box. Thought it might be the company's help line, so I called them and got the people who sent me here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean to tell me you got sent to a parallel universe because of a misdial?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief pause, you both succumb to a giggle fit. Once you caught your breath, you said, \"I must be tired if I find that this funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, you don't get to say you're tired. You slept the whole way here while I drove.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I only dozed for the last half hour, at most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sure. Keep telling yourself that. Anyway, I'm hitting the hay.\" Esther turned and locked the dead bolt for the front door, then pressed the alarm button on the security system. She turned to walk up the stairs, shouting over her shoulder, \"Don't open that without disabling the alarm first. Night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Esther!\" You shout after her. She stopped halfway up the stairs and turned around, midway through opening some more buttons on her blouse. \"Thanks again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop that! You're going to give me a complex. Now go to sleep, dumb ass! We got a lot to do in a week. Now, good night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Esther went upstairs and closed her bedroom door. Left alone in the living room, you doffed your shirt, pants and socks, and laid down under your blanket. Despite your stiff, lumpy bedding, you soon found yourself drifting off to sleep...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were quietly sipping your coffee when you heard Esther coming down the stairs. She stepped into the kitchen, bleary eyed and half awake, dressed in a pink tank top and a pair of black sweats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she opened the cupboard over the sink, you said, \"Coffee's on the table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped a little, and spying the source of all happiness already poured for her, came and joined you at the table. She took an appreciative sip of her morning caffeine fix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm! How'd you know how I like my coffee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at her in silence. A moment later, she closed her eyes as realization came to her. \"It's not my fault. I'm not yet awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell,\" you said, taking a swallow from your mug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsther looked over at the newspaper article you were reading. \"The Classifieds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"I didn't have your wifi password, so I walked to the gas station and bought a paper. Figured I could at least see what jobs were available. Course, I still need to figure out if I can even get legal work without a valid social insurance number. Or how hard it would be to apply for one, or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsther rubbed her head. You could almost hear her thinking, <i>\"it's way too early in the morning for such heavy thoughts.\"</i> \"Where's your wallet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsther was already in motion by the time you answered, \"Over there.\" Bringing it over to the kitchen table, she started pulling out and arranging your id's. You noticed her frown as she was looking at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on a sec,\" she answered as she grabbed her purse off the floor. Taking her own wallet out, she laid out her own cards alongside yours. As expected, your plastic was nearly identical, minus the being-a-woman part. As you looked closer, you started to see what Female-You had already noticed. \"Are these all off by a number?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she nodded, \"yes they are.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, every single card both of you shared was off by a single digit. License, debit card, social insurance card, everyone. Struck with the same thought, you both pulled out your cellphones and confirmed that even your phone numbers were off by one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that is just f@#$ing weird.\" You weren't sure which one of you said it first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still,\" you pondered aloud. \"This could work. I mean, this means my id's might actually be valid in this world. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea, but there seems to be more hope for that then I thought there was.\" Esther freshened up your cup before claiming the last of the coffee for herself. \"Whose your cellphone provider?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run-Fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll probably be your first step, then. Call them, tell them you moved, get your bill coming here.\" Esther leaned over and grabbed one of her bills off the counter. \"Here's the address.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if they ask for my old address? If my phone number is off yours, my old address may not have been our parents' house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsther looked over your id's, and seeing what she expected, smiled. \"Check your license,\" she said, stabbing a finger at the card before getting up and grabbing a yogurt from the fridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou read the address on the card. \"Florida!? I've never even been to Florida!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently, you have. You should really get that memory loss checked out. There's no way that's healthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked over the various cards in front of you. You pointed at your SIN card. \"Then there's the second step. What are the odds that works?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As good as they were the first time you asked me. Seriously, I don't know. Government offices aren't open on the weekend anyway. You won't be able to call them until Monday.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Esther took a bite of her yogurt, you said, \"You know, you could have grabbed me an orange or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured if you really wanted one, you'd grab it yourself.\" Grumbling a little, you got up to grab something from the fridge. You could almost hear the cute smirk on her face as she said, \"And as long as you're up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, bite me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wish. You could never afford my rates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foul Temptress,\" you said, sitting down as she stifled a laugh. Her mood sobered a little. \"Seriously, though, I'm more then 62% sure that your SIN will be good. There's just one final piece of the \"Won't Die Homeless\" puzzle to work out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Education,\" you answered. \"Do I have my high school certification in this world, or am I going to need to get my GED? Christ, I don't even know where to start with that one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Florida, obviously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rubbed your nose in irritation. \"Seriously, why Florida?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe someone at that office has a wicked sense of humor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're evil, I'll give them that.\" You leaned back in your chair. \"It's seriously the only way to explain what you look like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Wait, was that out loud, or in my head?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, shit.\"</i></span></div></div>",

We've only gone six blocks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just leave me where I drop.\" With those words, you laid down on the ground, gasping for air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the one who said you wanted to get in better shape. Well, guess what? This is how you do it.\" Esther, quite infuriatingly, hadn't even broken a sweat. She was standing over top of your prostrate form, arms akimbo, dressed in a tight pair of leggings that did wonders for her figure and what had to be the biggest sports bra you'd ever seen, barely covered by a white spaghetti-strap tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Still technically you, dude. Quit checking her out.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't *gasp* recall *pant, gasp* saying that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you did,\" Esther said as your mind wandered back to about an hour ago...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** *** ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about lying to her, or back tracking what you said, but quickly realized that telling her the truth was the best recourse. Even in the off chance your lie would work, she deserved better then that. I mean, she is you, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, it's just... I mean... okay, look, you are gorgeous, alright? A total babe. You are probably the hottest, sexiest, most beautiful woman I've ever seen. If I'd met you in my world, I'd have pined for you forever, so the fact that you're just super-hot woman-me with gloriously massive, gigantic tits is just, you know, totally evil of them. You're magnificent, a literal Aphrodite, and I look in the mirror and think: derp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsther stared at you in silence for awhile, and almost immediately you began to regret laying it on so thick. Just as you were starting to worry, she at last spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't derpy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snorted a little. \"Oh yes, I am. My hair's unruly, my face in plain, I'm totally out of shape and I've got no post-secondary. Or maybe not even that, in this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, give yourself some credit. You're cute.\" You went to deny it, but Esther held up her hand, forestalling anything you wished to say. \"No, I mean it. You're seriously a cute dude. Stop using your hair to hide your face and grow it out a bit more. Trust me, you'll look good with long hair. Buy a brush, cut any split ends, and starting shampooing twice when you shower. Since you're me, I can tell you that you're hair is pretty oily. It'll need it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan't help with the education thing, but I can certainly whip you into shape. Trust me, you're already cute. If you start taking better care of your hair, get some muscles on ya, and work on your self-esteem, you'll go from cute to hot, then you'll be beating women off with a stick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsther had gotten up from her seat while talking and now stood before you. She slapped a hand down on your shoulder and leaned forward, forcing you to crane your neck to look her in the face, or stare down a literal canyon of cleavage. With her pretty face only a few inches from yours, she said, \"Now, get dressed. Me and my gloriously massive, gigantic tits are taking you for a run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** *** ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh c'mon! That's not what I meant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was strongly implied. Exercise is good for you anyway, so stop being lazy and let's keep going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you not dying right now?\" you said, gasping as you slowly sat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unlike you, I've done something other then sit on my butt in front of the TV for the last several years. You'll get used to it pretty quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, this isn't a one time thing!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" Esther said, holding out a hand to help you up. \"If you actually want to BE in some kind of shape, you have to work at it. And before you try to come up with some other way to weasel out of it, you can't job hunt until you get your SIN squared away on Monday. Same goes for finding out if you're educated or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you just ignored the proffered hand and remained sitting, Esther leaned forward. \"And getting in shape will help a bit with your rather defeatist attitude. Before you've even spoke to a girl, you've already figured she'll reject you. You've lost the battle before it was even fought. Same with college, I'll bet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think you know about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot, given I. Am. You. Your speech also gave a bit of it away. \"Pined forever\"? Seriously? You out and out stated that you'd never even have attempted to speak to me if we'd met under other circumstances, and that is just wrong. You're never going to knock one out of the park if you don't take a swing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, some women would have been weirded out by that speech, though being called Aphrodite sure did wonders for my ego.\" At that point, Esther pulled down the front of her shirt with a pair of fingers, once more exposing a whopping amount of cleavage scant inches from your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving you stunned on the ground, Esther turned and started to run away. She called over her shoulder, \"Now come on! Only four more blocks to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word of complaint, you got to your feet and followed after your female counterpart. </span></div></div>",

Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure there is a nice padded cell for you!\u201d she yelled, quickly turning back toward the house and rushing in toward her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh crap!

As you rushed into the house, your mind went through a loop, looking identical to the one you left just moments ago. However, the girl\u2019s rushed running up the stairs quickly snapped you out of it, your pace increasing as you launched yourself up the stairs. Just as your were about to grab ahold of her,, your chase came to a sudden stop as your face met the hard wood of her bedroom door, the sound of a lock sealing her inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it, you had no way of stopping her, the sound of frantic phone dialing sounding off. There was only one thing you could do. As loudly as possible, you call to her, \u201cPlease, just listen to me! I know this all sounds crazy, but I\u2019m telling you the truth. Just let me prove it to you. If you were in my situation, I would at least give you a chance.\u201d Just as you heard the last number pushed on the phone, your heart sank as you waited for the inevitable sound of the call tone. However, it didn\u2019t go off. Through the door, you could hear a deep breath and cautious movement as she moved near the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, let\u2019s say I do believe you, that you were right just now. What could you possibly tell me to prove you really are an alternate me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sit just on the other side of her door, you have to rack your brain now.

You couldn\u2019t help but chuckle as you saw it had the same image of a play station controller on it. Then, sudden realization sparked inside your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, so since we are the same person, that means we have the same floor mat in front of our room. And under said floor mat, we keep a certain thing in case our little sister locks herself in our room.\u201d  You reach under the floor mat and find the little cut out in the floor, flipping it up and finding your key buried inside. With a familiar cling and turn, the lock of the door opened, your twin sitting just on the other side. Her face looked in shock as you sat just outside, key in hand. \u201cOur room key, hidden under the trap door we made after she kept locking us out. Enough evidence for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill in shock, she let out a stream of gasps and stutters, shaking her head as she tried to to wrap her head around all of this. Slowly, you began inching closer to her, placing a hand on her shoulder. \u201cAnd let me guess, when you were younger your dad sat here just like this out on the playground after you had ran into a pole running away from some bullies, right? He said that you\u2019d never have to feel in threat of those troublemakers anymore, getting them expelled the very next day.\u201d Her eyes pierced through you as she looked in disbelief. She stared to tear up at the corners of her eyes, falling into your arms and slumping over your shoulder. She let out a few chuckles, wiping her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou...you either really are me or you have a sick skill of mind reading.\u201d She fell back onto her knees, smiling ever so lightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d say probably the first of the two, although I definitely wouldn\u2019t mind having mind reading powers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe burst out laughing and fell onto her back, wiping away tears that formed uncontrollably. Giggling, you joined her, laying next to her and looking up at the ceiling. \u201cHahaha, that\u2019s something only I would say. You definitely are me\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell no duh Sherlock, it\u2019s not like I have been saying it since I got here only five minutes ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to you and gave your arm a sharp punch, laughing all the while. \u201cHey, how was I supposed to know? Being another me, would you really trust someone who said they were from another reality?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha, I guess not.

No-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was cut off as you are suddenly thrown into a wormhole, destroying any sense of... anything that you were just feeling. You realise now that your parents would definitely be wondering where there son went. Especially if one of them saw you holding a phone one minute, and flying through reality the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you couldn't really dwell on this for much longer, as your body (which, you just realised, was naked. <i>Who designed this?</i> you wonder, as you try to cover up your penis.) was changing. You could feel it becoming curvier, smoother and lighter. Well, as much as you could measure lightness while you were flying through a rip in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your penis start to shrink. Not just going limp, but actually shrinking, going back into your body. You felt this area being completely changed into a completely female vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimultaneously, you were feeling breasts grow on your chest, probably around a C cup size. You had your arms still covering your (now female) private parts, so the sudden feeling of flesh on your arms caused you to gasp slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realised that your voice had been changed as well. Whereas before, it was deep (many of your friends wondered how your voice could <i>go</i> that low), now it was fairly high. You decided to test it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven knowing your voice was a woman's, it was still startling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, I'm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising that a male name wouldn't really suit you, you decided to take a female one. Since none were going through your head at the moment, the decision was left for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realised that while you were playing with your voice, your arms and legs had been altered. They were completely smooth, not a trace of hair anywhere. Your feet looked incredibly cute to you (<i>Cute? Where did that come from?</i> you wonder) and currently had red nail polish, which, you realised, was on your hands as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only noticed that you head was changed when a mirror suddenly started flying alongside you (your immediate thought was, <i>WTF?</i>) and showed you. It looked younger than your head, but definitely suited your body. Your long hair, currently tying itself into a ponytail, was shining black and, when it finished tying itself and you brought it down to feel it, smelt strangely like apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad you been paying any attention to your surroundings, you would have noticed a projection of what happened after your call. Somehow, an exact copy of you was standing at the phone, sighing and putting it back.It then walked off into another part of the house. You caught this last part, though, and that was enough to convince you of what was going on back in your world. <i>To them, it probably never happened,</i> you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mirror next to you disappeared as you suddenly stood in the backyard of your house. However, the sudden shift from flying and not really feeling anything caused you to immediately lose balance, and fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile on the soft grass, you looked down to see if you were still naked. You weren't luckily, and slowly stood up. But you fell back down again when a loud voice rang through your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Transportation complete.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still lying on the ground, now quite nervous, when someone opened the back door.

I'm curious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...well then, as long as you know, sir... or should I say, madam. The transportation shall begin in 3... 2... 1... No-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was cut off as you are suddenly thrown into a wormhole, destroying any sense of... anything that you were just feeling. You realise now that your parents would definitely be wondering where there son went. Especially if one of them saw you holding a phone one minute, and flying through reality the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you couldn't really dwell on this for much longer, as your body (which, you just realised, was naked. Who designed this? you wonder, as you try to cover up your penis.) was changing. You could feel it becoming curvier, smoother and lighter. Well, as much as you could measure lightness while you were flying through a rip in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your penis start to shrink. Not just going limp, but actually shrinking, going back into your body. You felt this area being completely changed into a completely female vagina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimultaneously, you were feeling breasts grow on your chest, probably around a C cup size. You had your arms still covering your (now female) private parts, so the sudden feeling of flesh on your arms caused you to gasp slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realised that your voice had been changed as well. Whereas before, it was deep (many of your friends wondered how your voice could go that low), now it was fairly high. You decided to test it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven knowing your voice was a woman's, it was still startling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, I'm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising that a male name wouldn't really suit you, you decided to take a female one. Since none were going through your head at the moment, the decision was left for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realised that while you were playing with your voice, your arms and legs had been altered. They were completely smooth, not a trace of hair anywhere. Your feet looked incredibly cute to you (Cute? Where did that come from? you wonder) and currently had red nail polish, which, you realised, was on your hands as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou only noticed that you head was changed when a mirror suddenly started flying alongside you (your immediate thought was, WTF?) and showed you. It looked younger than your head, but definitely suited your body. Your long hair, currently tying itself into a ponytail, was shining black and, when it finished tying itself and you brought it down to feel it, smelt strangely like apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad you been paying any attention to your surroundings, you would have noticed a projection of what happened after your call. Somehow, an exact copy of you was standing at the phone, sighing and putting it back.It then walked off into another part of the house. You caught this last part, though, and that was enough to convince you of what was going on back in your world. To them, it probably never happened, you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mirror next to you disappeared as you suddenly stood in the backyard of your house. However, the sudden shift from flying and not really feeling anything caused you to immediately lose balance, and fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile on the soft grass, you looked down to see if you were still naked. You weren't luckily, and slowly stood up. But you fell back down again when a loud voice rang through your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTransportation complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still lying on the ground, now quite nervous, when someone opened the back door. It was...</span></div></div>",
