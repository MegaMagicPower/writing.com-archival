Of course to me this felt wrong as my job was supposed to only be one of those 9 to 5 things. I was supposed to be able to get up after sunrise and get home before sundown, but lately I've been getting home well after dark, and having to go back up before dawn's early light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my own fault for being too damn good,\" I derided myself, remembering the advice a teacher had given me about never giving a hundred percent in my kind of job, as they usually shoved all the harder work on the guy who did it the best, fastest, or some combination of the two. Now as I climbed up the stairs to my apartment I couldn't help but feel tired. Yet at the same time, the thought of the food waiting for me upstairs drove me onward, as I realized I hadn't eaten all day, and my belly decided to voice its protest at this as I ascended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching my door I searched through my pocket for my keys, coming up with several coins, an old cellphone I'd thought I'd lost, and a picture of some girl I didn't recognize, before finally extracting the ring upon which I kept the half a dozen keys I owned, though in truth I only knew what two of them were for. The other four keys I'd gotten over the years, and had at some point just forgotten what they went to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the key into the lock I heard he satisfying click of metal on metal, and then proceeded to do battle with the doorknob, which as usual refused to take the key at first, even though I knew it was the right one. Pushing and pulling the key proved to be ineffective as the lock still refused to yield to me, but finally I just gave up and hit the knob with my fist, which at last caused the key to turn, and unlocked the portal into my apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around at my abode I felt a sense of pride at the cleanliness of it, as not a speck of dust or stain scarred the wooden floors, and I enjoyed the sound of my footsteps, echoing loudly as I stepped over the floor into my sanctuary, shutting the door behind me. Staring inward my eyes went to my recliner as they always did, but my stomach decided to remind me that it wanted fed now, and only then would it let me be at peace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking towards my kitchen my eyes did not grace the small speck on the floor, as it was so small as to be insignificant, yet had I looked it would have appeared as nothing to me, for even though it jumped and yelled at me, I was above it too far to even notice its minuscule attempts to garner attention. Thus did I step right over it, walking towards the kitchen where I knew food and drink awaited me to fill my empty stomach.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In a certain way, I wasn\u00b4t even surprised at all that all this happened. Not in the least bit. In fact, it was quite typical that something like that would happen to me, as it seems to be the way of things when it comes to events concerning my very person. And yet I would have honestly never expected THIS to happen...that I would shrink down to a most pitiful size and go on an adventure I could have never dreamed of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon and I have been friends for what seems like an eternity, and I\u00b4d even go as far as calling him my very best friend. We always got along wonderfully, like friends are supposed to, and we never even had any major arguments, mainly because of his great personality. And yet we were so different, he and me. For example, Jon was the lucky one when it came to women, and I have given up counting his girlfriends. Well, maybe no one has been worthy of being his girlfriend yet. As for me, I was and still am more the shy and calm type, with Jon being more outgoing at times, but mostly cool and properly behaving. And my shyness was especially visible when it came to women. My admiration for some of them as well as my own humbleness sometimes made me lack the courage to to talk to them, or at least not to get excited while talking to them (I had the bad habit of beginning to stutter while talking to an extremely beautiful girl, for example). Besides, I always wanted to wait for the girl of my dreams, the perfect partner. And at that time my unbelievable story took place, it seemed like my wishes had been fulfilled, as I finally found my first girlfriend, an extremely cute and incredibly kind woman of Japanese origin: Kokoro, a co worker of Jon. Both of them had been good colleagues, yet never romantically involved, and it was merely by chance that I met her one day. Thanks to Jon\u00b4s encouragement (\"She\u00b4s all yours, tiger!\"), I managed to talk to her, and the two of us revealed our feelings. And somehow, it happened: we fell in love. All this thanks to Jon. Those words he spoke might have been kinda semi-cool, but that\u00b4s just typical for him. Far more self confident than me, and such a great guy. I could not possibly have a greater best friend than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd since he and me were best friends - and still are - he was of course the first person I wanted to show the new invention of \"Doc\". \"Doc\" was some strange scientist, living somewhere outside our town. Really an odd person, but he was quite a good friend of mine. And as he was somehow a carbon copy of Doc Emmet Brown (not just in terms of looks), he indeed had invented something that gained my interest. Not some fancy machine, no, it was a...pill. A plain looking pill, although it was not an ordinary pill, though. It might have looked like some Aspirin, but in truth, it was a pill that would provide the one to use it with some incredible power...the ability to shrink down in size considerably. At least that\u00b4s what the old man claimed. Of course I told him that I found his words...strange, to say the least, but he just smiled and convinced me to give it a try. Like a fortune teller, he promised me that I would have the adventure of a lifetime, and that I would discover the pill\u00b4s ability to protect me on my possible adventures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFine. Whatever he said. So I was calling Jon, telling him that I had found something interesting and that I would wait in his apartment for his return from work. As a matter of fact, he even had given me a copy of his keys, as he really trusted me, and they came in handy in case of need (i.e. in case he would lock himself out of his own apartment...). Unfortunately, Jon also had a bad habit: he would sometimes forget about some trivial things he has been told (when they don\u00b4t have anything to do with his work, for example), and it would be just the same this time, to my great dismay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, as I entered his clean and nice looking apartment, I immediately went to the living room and sat down on his cozy couch, eagerly awaiting his return. In fact, I was waiting there for about an hour, and I began to realize that maybe I should have spent the evening with Kokoro instead. But as I\u00b4ve already been waiting that long, I decided to overcome the last remaining minutes before his ultimate return as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when a strange - and in the end stupid - idea entered my mind. Why not try the pill now? Of course, the stupid thing would not work, anyway, but in the unlikely case it would...why not surprise Jon once he got home? Shouting something like \"Hey, down there, pal!\" while he would be wondering where I was. In case the pill would work, there was one problem, though. \"Doc\" mentioned that the effects of the pill wold not just be temporary, they would last forever. So I would be doomed to stay tiny forever, unless I would go see \"Doc\" in order to use his reverse device. He only told me that \"it\" was still under development, but soon to be completed. I had no idea what it could have been, maybe a machine, a nano-sized pill, or something completely different. But I trust both Jon and \"Doc\", and I was sure that Jon would help me out and bring me over to \"Doc\" in case I would really shrink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here goes nothing.\" I said, taking the pill out of my pocket and popping it into my mouth. I swallowed the small, red chemical thing down quickly, and I stood up from Jon\u00b4s couch and looked down my body. Nothing happened at all yet, only that damn taste of of the pill penetrating my nerves. So I was waiting a few minutes, until I realized in disappointment that the pill would not work.<br>\r\n\"Just as I thought...\" I whispered, and I hoped that Jon would not be mad at me because of all the fuz I made being meaningless in the end.In case he did not forget I was here, that is. And besides, I knew him well enough to tell that he would be mad at me that easily. We were best friends, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then. Then everything happened so fast that I could barely perceive what was really going on. I suddenly felt in my body, seeming to be everywhere in there, and it caused me to fall on my knees, huffing and puffing. I did not expect this sudden event at all, so the bad surprise of this pain was even more painful to me. I wanted to curse \"Doc\" for giving me such a dangerous, maybe even lethal thing, but to my surprise, everything around me started to change, making me forget my anger. I felt so dizzy in my head as I slowly perceived this change. Everything around me seemed to be getting bigger and bigger with each passing moment: the couch, the TV-set, the door to Jon\u00b4s kitchen, everything. Despite my surprise, I realized that it was not all those things that were changing, it was I who was undergoing a most peculiar change: I was shrinking down, fast and considerably. The proof that \"Doc\u00b4s\" masterpiece and nobel-prize worthy invention was working. That would have been cool per say, but the fact that I was getting smaller and smaller to a degree that made me seem minuscule worried me an awful lot. At long last, I stopped to change size. It might have taken merely a few seconds for the shrinking procedure, but to me, it seemed like time stood still during my fateful alteration. Trembling, I looked around in Jon\u00b4s living room, and my face turned pale quickly. The furniture was no longer recognizable as such, instead, his couch, for example, looked like some strange, modern-art like mass that was easily bigger than anything mankind could have created, surpassing even the highest mountains compared to me. Although there were no such things in order to compare, I concluded that I must have been of the size of a mere piece of dust by now. Insignificant, and probably only visible when the light was shining directly on me. <br>\r\nTalk about a plan that backfired...Jon would never be able to see me like that! He would stomp on me without even noticing my presence! My sole slight hope was the fact that his apartment was so clean that it lacked any dust in there, so maybe he would be able to recognize my presence and even my human shape. That, or a miracle were required to solve this desperate situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I heard a thunderous sound coming from Jon\u00b4s door, I knew he was returning home. Time of truth. At first, I was in unadulterated shock as the door opened and my best friend \"stomped\" into his own apartment, looking annoyed because of his job (I was glad that I was still at school, being about 4 years younger than him).<br>\r\nThat...was Jon? My best friend? No. That thing...was monstrous! Planet sized! Defying the laws of nature with its sheer size! There could never be a living thing of that unbelievable size! Just looking at his figure made me think that I must have been smaller than one of his pores, according to my surprise and shock concerning my best friend\u00b4s size. Man...he could have easily crushed me, swallowed me, inhaled me...anything without him even noticing me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I expected, Jon didn\u00b4t even raise his voice in order to yell my name, indicating that he simply forgot about our meeting here. So he truly had no idea that I was here. That made my situation even worse, because with Jon having forgotten my presence and most likely the fact that I told him about a shrink-pill (he sounded so groggy on the phone when I called him, so that\u00b4s no surprise. Happens from time to time). <br>\r\nHe remained at the door for a while, looking around in his room. Damn it...I was doomed for sure! And scared as well, as his stomach began to rumble loudly, indicating that his body was yearning for nourishment. Thunderous and intimidating, that loud rumbling of his belly left a mark of fear for sure, with me thinking about the possibility of ending up as a part of this nourishment, and beyond that, of ending up inside my friend\u00b4s body by accident...that would have been the icing on the cake of bad luck for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy real problems were yet to come, as Jon began to walk into my direction, with the sound of him taking steps echoing in the entire apartment like some thunder. The impact of his shoes on the ground caused my environment to shake violently and me to being lifted up from the ground slightly and falling back onto the wooden floor again. The nearer he came, the more violent the shaking became, and I also began to realize that Jon was even bigger than I thought. Anyway, I decided to make a futile attempt: using the power of the impact of his shoes on me and hence the fact that I was being lifted up because of that, trying to get his attention somehow. So, accompanied by the shaking of the ground, I jumped up in order to get even higher up into the air (although Jon wouldn\u00b4t have even realized this slight change of my position, as I knew deep down somehow), yelling and waving with my arms. To my joy, he even looked down, staring at me as he walked, and I thought I was saved. At least so I thought for a single second. Unfortunately, he apparently thought that I was just a mere speck of dust as he did no longer bother to look down at me, his minuscule friend. Instead, he just walked over me (yet did not stomp on me, fortunately), but in the process, the shaking of the ground became so powerful that I felt myself being lifted really high up into the air, with my fate being sealed as I knew what would happen if I fell down again. There was no way I could resist the power of the impact of his shoes, but it also had a positive aspect: I found myself flying toward the left side of his trousers, heading directly toward his left trouser leg. I used that opportunity as I grabbed the fabric of his trousers (only the fabric, so he didn\u00b4t even feel anything), hanging on his left trouser leg now, with him heading toward the kitchen in order to satisfy his hunger...what was gonna happen to me? Would he ever be able to find me?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stepping towards the kitchen, my eyes at last fell on a single insignificant speck on the floor of my apartment. I thought it odd that it was sitting there all alone, probably through most of the day. For an instant, just a small flash of memory jolted through my brain. Someone had called me last night, or so I thought, and I was supposed to meet them somewhere. Or was I? Had it been Christian, my latest girl, or someone else? Julian maybe? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head, having no wanting to remember something that it was probably already too late to go to. If it was Christian I'd stood up, I'd make it up to her some time this weekend. As I recalled she enjoyed an evening of quiet dinner and dancing, something that I endured for her, as I usually hated the dinners they severed during such things, being very unfilling, and the dancing, while I knew how to do it, always made my feet hurt the next day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it had been Julian who'd been left high and dry, well that was a different story. I liked the kid, as a friend, and always felt slightly bad for him when I missed one of our little get togethers, especially because of something as boring as working overtime for what amounted to only about a Euro or two an hour, in a job that should be paying ten times that. But I knew, even if I stood him up he could always go to the Japanese girl for comfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled when I remembered asking Ko(My name for her) to come with me that night and then to sit at the bar. Ko and I were coworker, both of us system operators for one of the largest quantum computers(QC) on the planet, and she'd been delighted when I'd asked her out, not something I usually did as I hated those office romances. She'd been disappointed for a moment when she'd learned I'd asked her out to meet my friend, but after meeting Julian that disappointment had turned to delight as the two hit it off, as I knew they would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had yet to tell Julian about that little trick, and I bet Ko hadn't either. Her reason being that she didn't care how they came together, and mine because I wasn't about to admit to a friend that I'd played matchmaker for him. I knew he could find a girl on his own, if he'd just try and talk to her, but when I'd met Ko up at the plant, I knew I'd found his soul mate. Sure it was probably more than a little underhanded, but they were happy, and I didn't feel too bad about it myself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course it seemed to me that Julian had said something about \u2018Doc' the last time I'd spoken to him, and if that was the case he'd probably been asking me to meet him at that mad scientists house. I would have gone, for him if nothing else, as I always found the guy just a bit creepy, and then of course most of his \u2018inventions' were simple things which I could build using the QC at work, but never saw the purpose of them. I heard he'd been working on some new drug lately, though what it was I had no idea, and really no desire to find out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I at last crossed my apartment, not feeling the minuscule weight that had attached itself to the back of my left leg, I had forgotten all about the speck of dust, which was odd as I shouldn't have. I worked in a clean room all day, and so even a small speck of dust should have kept my attention, but I guess that my mind, sleep deprived as it was, refused to retain such mundane things, though stepping into the kitchen, I was reminded quick vehemently of why I was there, as my stomach let out a low pitched rumble that I felt throughout my body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo powerful was it that I had to grip the counter to keep my balance, and in doing so I lifted my left leg up. This motion, small to me, sent a tiny speck flying skyward, though I couldn't see it. And turning the next moment I missed its landing on the counter I had been facing, or the image of the speck moving around and picking itself up off the hard surface. Had I been looking I bet it would have caught my eye, and caused me to study it more closely, but instead I turned towards my fridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking inside I felt my stomach rumble again, but this time in delight at the sight of real food, rather than that freeze dried crap they served at work. Staring inside I saw a dozen choices for a quick meal, but decided even more quickly that I needed something more filling. Rummaging near the back I saw half a dozen things that fit the bill, but at last found something that set my mouth to watering some badly that I knew I wanted it in my belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling it out I stared at the steak, a remnant of a barbeque a week or so ago with Julian. Kokoro had proven to dislike this type of meat, and so we'd settled on chicken instead. This fact made me glad I'd never tried to get her, as I regularly ate burgers, and I now knew she didn't really care for them, though whether this was because she was Buddhist or just some personal preference I'd never asked, as I disliked prying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the slab of meat on a plate I placed it on the counter, nearly right on top of the tiny speck that was still sitting there, unnoticed by me in my hunger. Instead my attention was focused on the cabinet above as I looked for some stuff to go with the steak, as I did like the taste, but spices were always welcome additions to any meal.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Clinging to the fabric of my best friend\u00b4s left trouser leg for my dear life, I just closed my eyes in fear, as I just could not take it anymore to look down to the ground that seemed to be hundreds of miles beneath me. Although my position on his trouser leg might have been somewhere slightly beneath his knee, it still seemed so impossibly high, with a fall down his trousers being my death sentence for sure, and this thought alone (and what my body would look like after such a long fall and such an impact on the ground...maybe like some strange mass) caused my face to turn pale. The impacts of his shoes on the ground didn\u00b4t help my whole situation either, as their power could be felt even up there, causing the fabric and me to shake violently whenever Jon took a step, threatening to fall down into certain doom.<br>\r\n\"Please...make it to the kitchen quick...\" I whispered to myself amidst this hopeless situation. I cursed myself for being so stupid and listening to Doc\u00b4s advice. He could have expected me to tell him my humble opinion about this whole thing in a way that would not have been nice at all, but it appeared that I would not live long enough to do so. And besides, I knew that this was my fault. I was stupid enough to take the pill before Jon even arrived back in his home. If I had waited for him to come back and having taken the pill with him watching and being aware of my presence, things would be far less desperate now, he would have probably been taking me to Doc now carefully. Well, at least there would have been a slightly bigger chance of him seeing me, knowing about the pill causing me to shrink (as I told him on the phone). But at that moment, my sad fate seemed to have been sealed already: being killed before my friend\u00b4s eyes without him even knowing about this tragedy. In the worst case, he could have been the one responsible for my demise, a scenario I did not even want to think of. My best friend unwittingly and unknowingly killing me...impossible! That thought seemed absurd to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I certainly did not want to leave this world just like that.I wanted to fight on. If I had to die, then at least I wanted to die fighting for my life. It would have at least been a graceful death, better than dying like a coward. Yet I had hope that a strong will could help me getting through this situation. So despite the shaking Jon\u00b4s shoes were causing and the scary height of my position, I tried to cling to his fabric with all power I got, with all energy my tiny body could provide me with. I at least wanted to hold on until Jon reached the kitchen, where I could think of a way to get up his body to a safer place where I could make him notice me, maybe his shoulders first, then up to his ears. But I was fully aware of the fact that this would take a lifetime for me to accomplish, although I could not think of a way to make the procedure shorter and less exhausting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course I could not know that one of those strange twists of fate would spare me the trip up my friend\u00b4s entire body. As Jon reached the kitchen, the threatening rumbling of his surely gigantic stomach could be heard again, making me shudder due to its dull, loud sound. Anyway, it wasn\u00b4t the rumbling that would change my situation drastically, but much rather Jon\u00b4s reaction to the rumbling. Obviously, his stomach protested in a way that made his entire body feel a sudden and short lasting pain. Still, the pain seemed to be powerful and intense enough that it caused him to lose his balance, and so he gripped the counter of the kitchen table in order to prevent himself from losing his balance. As harmless as this sounds, the problem for me was that he lifted up his leg in the process as some kind of reflex. It was a slight motion to him, but to me, it was so powerful and so fast that it made me lose my grip on the fabric immediately, due to the force with which he seemed to lift his leg - at least to me it seemed so. In a matter of seconds, I found myself being lifted high up into the air after having lost my grip on the fabric, with incredible speed and intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWords cannot possibly describe the feeling I got at that moment, and this experience will always remain in my memory for its sheer, incredible results. First of all, it was the greatest feeling I ever had, in a certain way. You could not possibly imagine the thrill of flying through the air, passing it like a sharp blade and actually perceiving it. It was probably the greatest fun one could imagine, in terms of sheer excitement and having an adrenaline rush. Even when the world around me shifted and I began to fall down instead of flying up, the feeling of greatness persisted. Until I realized that I was falling down faster and faster with each passing second, knowing what would ultimately await me. Although I could not see anything around me properly - just the images of rushing and blurred pictures passing my eyes - I could at least see the ground which was the hard kitchen table. And it was crystal clear to me that once I\u00b4d hit the ground, there would nothing be left of me, not even a tiny speck indicating my dark fate. My eyes were filled with the fear of imminent death, and so I closed them, trying to focus my thoughts on those dear to me one last time. Interestingly enough, I didn\u00b4t even panic, I indeed remained rather calm, as I did not go nuts in view of my fate; I did think of those near to me. My caring parents...my lovely sister...my beloved girlfriend Kokoro...and of course Jon, my best friend. The thought of dying was in fact not what worried me the most, though. As my fall down lasted surprisingly long (like fall down from heavens...), I could accept my impending death, but I could not accept that a small motion of my friend would be responsible for my death. I didn\u00b4t want to die because of one of the persons near to me, one of the persons I cared about. Especially considering that he had no idea I was there.<br>\r\n\"Good bye, all ye...\" I thought to myself as it was only a matter of seconds until I would hit the ground and die, becoming some tiny, unrecognizable pile of goo...<br>\r\nMy eyes were still closed, and my soul at rest, ready to enter the realm of God...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\nAfter about ten seconds, I finally stood up from the surface of the vast kitchen table, looking down my body. Nothing seemed to have happened at all, there was no single scratch, and I didn\u00b4t even feel any pain inside me. You can imagine that this was hard to believe for me, that falling down several hundred meters would not affect me in any way, and so I thought at first that this was just my imagination, and that I was already in the underworld or whatever the afterlife truly is. So I touched my body at several spots, and to my surprise, it still felt like it did before: pretty much alive, with my heart still beating and pumping blood throughout my entire body, and with my lungs still inhaling the precious oxygen.<br>\r\n\"I\u00b4m not...dead?\" I whispered, realizing that my body began to tremble horribly, maybe because of the confusion due to these recent events. Having survived such a long and fast fall surely is not something you experience every day, after all, and being a religious person, I thought of it being a miracle, or several miracles combined. God\u00b4s doing. Maybe he wanted me to stay alive? Maybe he had a greater purpose for me in life? Of course, I quickly remembered Doc\u00b4s words about the pill\u00b4s effects protecting me from any harm, so this seemed to be more plausible than divine intervention. Although either was hard to believe at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dared to look forward, seeing my gigantic friend standing at the fridge and looking inside. So obviously, he was about to eat something in order to satisfy his immense hunger - well, to me, it seemed immense, judging from the sound of his rumbling belly. Seeing my friend there was on the other hand the undeniable proof that I really was still alive. Of course I could have wondered why on earth I did not suffer the consequences of gravity, but at that time, I had no time to spare, knowing that I was not out of danger, not in the least bit, as I still had to get help from someone, with this certain someone being none other than Jon himself, my very best friend and my only choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom my position on the table, I watched Jon taking a  steak out of the fridge, placing it onto a plate. According to my memory, this piece of flesh looked like what was left from the barbecue he, Kokoro and me were having a week ago. I remembered that it was actually a lot of fun, being together with the two persons I care about the most, Jon and Kokoro, my best friend and my girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thunderous sound of his shoes hitting the ground as he began to walk sent shivers down my spine, seeing that he was walking into my direction, holding the plate in his hand and the steak being placed on it. Damn...I still could not believe that this impossibly huge, walking thing was my friend, this thing of astronomical proportions. Well, it would have been hard to believe for him as well that this tiny, almost insignificant speck that was almost in the realm of bacteria was his friend Julian...<br>\r\nAlthough I knew he was still my best friend, he scared me to death with exactly those astronomical, unrealistic seeming proportions and those intimidating noises his body made, like the stomping of his feet or the rumbling of his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo my great dismay, my mega-sized friend was about to lower the plate directly above me as he had finally approached the kitchen corner I was on. I was still able to feel the vibrations in the ground the impacts of his shoes were causing, only not as strong as before. In any case, it was obvious that he would crush me with the plate in the process, and despite having survived the fall miraculously, I did not trust fate, God or Doc this time, and so I did the only reasonable thing I could think of: running away. Running away from the descending messenger of death that was mere white ceramic plate. And indeed, I ran as fast as my tiny frail body would allow it, with the vast shadow of the plate becoming bigger and bigger with each passing moment as it came nearer to the ground. And in the end, luck was on my side as the plate finally hit the surface of the kitchen table, with me lying on the ground only inches away after having jumped out of its away just in the nick of time. I was huffing and puffing, glad that I was able to escape death once again. Looking up into the air after this exciting yet exhausting fight for survival, I saw Jon searching for something in the cabinet far above me in the heavens, it seemed, as he really looked like a divine being from the realm of the Gods, in view of his sheer size...although that cliche of the omnipotent, almighty and gigantic divine being really was annoying, so I got rid of that stupid thought...although the thought of Kokoro being such a goddess seemed not so bad at all...if she would have been here, that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to me, I looked in awe at the vast plate, with the mountain sized steak on it. At that moment, some ideas were crossing my mind. I could attempt to climb onto the plate, trying to get nearer to my friend\u00b4s face and thus being able to get his attention somehow. But I knew of the possible dangers only too well. With the steak being on the plate, I could easily get eaten along with it, and I had no intentions at all to explore my best friend\u00b4s digestive tract first hand. There was also the slight possibility that he could accidentally inhale me (with the stream of air being inhaled and exhaled out of his nostrils being powerful enough to accomplish that) or crush me under his fingers. But I had no choice. It was a risky business, but I had to take the risk in order to get at least a slim chance of survival.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Searching though the cabinet proved most enlightening, as I found half a dozen spices I could remember being given by my mother when I first left the house, some of them having waited in that dark place for years. Turning them around as I moved them about I was surprised to find that the expiration dates for some of the things I thought had to be years old were still several months away, which was a shock to me, as I thought spices didn't keep that well, not being that much of a cook myself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRummaging near the back I finally found the seasoning I had been looking for, and was gratified to find that it was still sealed, never having been opened during the barbeque a week ago when I learned that Kokoro didn't like beef. I on the other hand liked it a lot, and so I had bought a special bit of spice for it, but when we hadn't eaten the steak I had set it near the back of my pantry, as I did with most of my newer stuff, so that I would be forced to use the old stuff beforehand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSearching through the older stuff, I didn't see any of this particular spice, which was something I always ended up using within a month or two of getting any, so I closed the cabinet with a resounding thud as I placed the canister of spice on the counter, right next to a little dot that was making its way across the surface of my counter to the plate where I'd placed the steak. With the counter being grey though, the little dot was nearly invisible against it, despite its tries to shout up at me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot noticing that tiny speck, my attention was instead focused on the canister, which had to be opened before I could get at the stuff within. Of course getting the cap off was never any problem, as all that took was a slight twist, but under the cap they always included these flavor seals that were attached to the canister itself. Now I'm all for sealing in flavor, but it annoys me that they make them so darn hard to get into, as if they were trying to keep someone from opening them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, I wasn't about to be denied by some hard piece of plastic in my own home. Now the QC up at work defied me all the time, but it was an expensive piece of hardware, and in my research on it I'd observed it at times acting as if it were selfaware, despite others claims that it was impossible. The canister of spice was not selfaware though, and so I knew eventually it would have to yield to my will, which it finally did with a tearing sound, unfortunately at the time I was still pulling on it hard, and so the canister slipped from my hands as I ripped off the seal, showering the spice all over the counter, and more importantly atop at tiny speck that had been running to the plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCursing in ancient Greek and Mandarin Chinese I looked down to see that only a small bit of the spice had actually been spilled, and with my counter as clean as it was I quickly decided that it was still good to eat. SO thinking I placed one hand on the edge of the counter and put the other behind the pile of spice, moving it forwards so as to push the small mess into my hand, unknowingly doing the same to the little speck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the stuff in my hand a moment I took a deep wiff of it, just to capture its scent. My inhalation was strong enough that it picked up more than a few pieces of spice, and one unlucky dot. Its luck was good enough though that instead of entering my nose it fell back among the spice, causing a small dust cloud to form around it. Above it, and beyond noticing the small cloud I felt my heart race at the smell, which brought back memories of a home I would never see again, and faces which had been so important then, but were fuzzy and distant now, thanks to both time and distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing at the memory I felt I had to do something that had been a tradition at my house whenever my mother used this particular spice, and licked my finger, making it wet. With the proper utensil I slowly lowered my finger into the spice, picking up a good coating. Unknowable by me at the time I had also picked up a slightly different spice with the rest, and it fought and tugged against my finger as I slowly raised it upwards towards my mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for it, rather than placing the whole appendage in my mouth I just licked the tip, enough to get a fire in my tastebuds. With that tiny flash of flavor exciting me I moved back over towards the steak, and within a second the slab of meat was covered with the stuff from one end to another in nice, thin, even coating that I think would have made my mother proud. With that done I then rubbed me fingers together and got the little bit still stuck to it to fall off onto the center of the steak, along with a tiny speck, which screamed out as it was lightly pushed off my finger into open air, to impact the surprisingly soft beef. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, with the meal prepared I had to decide how to cook it, which proved to be a pretty little problem as I had a few choices, but my stomach told me very stubbornly at this point that it did not wish to wait any longer, letting out something that sounded like a roar even to my ears. With the need for speed demonstrated I decided it was time I gave something I'd had the QC make for me a real test run. Grabbing the plate I walked over towards the other side of my kitchen. Here I displayed quite proudly the small, shiny, silver box that I was still trying to think of a name for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was actually just a very fancy microwave in truth, but using quantum waves instead, so that it actually cooked something from the atom up rather than from the cell, as a microwave did. Of course this had a few added features, such as it didn't affect living tissue, at least not in the test the QC did. If I was right anyone could literally walk right into one and never feel an ounce of pain, though from my own experience with quantum waves I was pretty sure it would give you a slight buzz in your ears. Placing the plate inside I set the timer to what the chart on the device said was the proper time for a steak of this size, and then stood back, and watched it as it started the plate inside to spinning, so as to cook it from all sides.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And so I was watching my impossibly huge friend searching for something far above in the cabinet, and I could only guess what it was. Perhaps some spices in order to improve the taste of his steak, once he would start eating his meal and enjoying this feast for his senses. It was some kind of morbid spectacle, watching his body of astronomic proportions in a mix of awe (as if he was some sort of attraction, something mankind has never seen before - which was true to a certain degree, as it is doubtful that anyone else ever saw his best friend being planet-sized and threateningly towering over oneself) and fear, knowing only too well what kind of fate Jon could provide me with by accident, unaware of my presence. And in view of him being in the kitchen and searching for something that would presumably be part of his meal, the fear of getting eaten by Jon, with him being completely oblivious to my misery, was rising inside me again. I didn\u00b4t even want to think about ending up inside my best friend\u00b4s gigantic stomach. That thought just didn\u00b4t feel right that he could have been the one to kill me by digesting my tiny self and making me part of his own body in the process. That thought was not fair as well. Jon is the nicest person I know, a cool and relaxed guy who did so many great things for me in the past, things I would always be thankful for. In fact, Jon is like my big brother. And thus killing me, his best friend, by mere accident inside his own body, with him being completely oblivious to it, would be a scenario he just did not deserve. Although deep down inside me, I had the spirit of an adventurer, always eager to explore new places and enjoy new sights, always yearning for the mysterious and fascinating. And I could not deny that the insides of a human body belonged exactly into that category, as I always thought that it must be cool, being able to travel through a human\u00b4s body and know a completely new aspect of him/her. But of course, getting there without any protection whatsoever made my look on this subject less enthusiastic, and so I prayed that I would never get to see my friends insides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously, I saw Jon finally getting a spice out of the cabinet, and he was struggling to get the cap off the canister full of spice. Admittedly, I was mildly amused about witnessing this every day situation from a whole new point of view I would have never expected to have. but alas, something went wrong again to my great dismay, not even surprising me in the end as on that day, it seemed like nothing would transpire according to my design. As Jon finally managed to open the canister, he did this with so much force that it slipped from his hands in the process, falling down onto the hard ground of the kitchen. And while the skyscraper sized canister was not the problem, there were several grains of spice raining down from the skies as a result of Jon\u00b4s struggle with the canister. And they were falling directly into my position! With each of them easily being bigger than me, I estimated that they would crush me for sure in case they would land on top of me. I was too shocked to react, all I could do was closing my eyes as my body was shaking with fear, awaiting the judgement from the heavens. But what followed could easily be described as a pleasant and unexpected surprise. I could hear the sound of the grains\u00b4 impact near me, frightening me to death. But miraculously, none of them hit me. As I opened my eyes again, I just saw the mess of grains of spice lying on the ground around me, spilled by my gigantic friend above. I breathed a sigh of relief, having been lucky again, and I did not really care unrealistic the chance of survival might have actually been. I did survive this disaster so far, and that\u00b4s what counted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut did you think my series of misadventures would stop here? Nope. With the kitchen table being extremely clean (one could eat of it without fearing hygiene problems), Jon of course wanted to save the spice from being useless and clean his kitchen table. And so I saw a smooth and massive object descending from the skies several meters away from me, with its impact on the ground being rather forceful. I realized quickly that this must have been Jon\u00b4s hand, and at that moment, I didn\u00b4t want to think about its actual size, and I didn\u00b4t want to compare it to any living being - it was probably too huge, anyway. According to the situation, it was crystal clear what Jon was attempting to do: placing his right hand behind the spice and placing his left one at the edge of the table (a motion my eyes could perceive as well, I was practically trapped between two hands, with one soon to come nearer and nearer). So he wanted to push the spilled spice onto his left hand and from there onto the steak...and me with it if I didn\u00b4t think of anything quickly. But it was already too late, as Jon\u00b4s massively huge hand was sweeping over the surface of the table, hitting the grains of spice and capturing them in its very motion. It didn\u00b4t take too long until I was being hit by some hard objects, namely the grains of spice. Jon\u00b4s hand was pushing them against me now, hence I found myself trapped in this motion of his hand as well now. Seconds later, I unfortunately felt gravity working in all its horrible glory, as I felt myself falling down the edge of the table all out of a sudden, as his right hand has reached its destination. Only seconds later, the fall stopped as I landed on an extremely soft surface which revealed itself to be incredibly vast and smooth, and i knew i was on the palm of Jon\u00b4s left hand. Right where he wanted the spice to be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he brought his face slightly nearer to his palm, with me lying on it in fear, this was actually the first time I could embrace the sight of his impossible proportions. What I saw towering above me and his palm was still recognizable as his face, yes. And yet it was so...different and strange, too huge to be even able to exist like that. As I already had pointed out, I must have even been smaller than one of his pores, thus I indeed was just a tiny speck compared to his face (let alone his entire body), practically insignificant and maybe even near the realm of bacteria. So it was no surprise at all that he did not see me at all, especially not among all those grains of spice, even though his eyes were looking directly onto his palm I was trapped on. On the contrary, another appalling event took place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll out of a sudden, I felt a gust wind blowing all around me, being sucked up by something high above me. The wind became stronger and stronger, and it became harder to resist its power with every passing second. And it took only a few seconds until I was overwhelmed by the sheer force of this stream of air, and I found myself being sucked up incredibly fast. Even though the speed of this process was considerable, I was able to see where the stream of air was taking me, and I was shocked to see two huge, black tunnels coming nearer and nearer: Jon\u00b4s nostrils. Looks like he wanted to smell the odour of of the spice, thus he was inhaling with such power, only to breathe me in as well. That fate seemed to be even worse than getting swallowed by Jon. Being sucked up my friend\u00b4s nose and into his respiratory system, either being killed by his antibodies or slowly dying inside his lungs, with no chance of escape at all. A slow and painful death, even more than digestion...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, he stopped inhaling just in time, shortly before I could be exposed to a trip up the long tube of his nostrils. Instead, I began to fall back down onto his hand, with my body cutting through the air like a blade with gravity\u00b4s effects, the speed and the power of Jon\u00b4s exhalation being the factors to support this action. Soon, I felt the skin of his hand beneath me again. I was able to avoid ending up inside my friend\u00b4s body for now and being trapped in his vast insides. But my day wasn\u00b4t exactly a blast, to be perfectly true, so what came next was just typical. Now, Jon moved his right hand directly above his left one I myself was currently on, with his skyscraper sized fingers slowly descending onto his smooth palm. Again, I found myself being pushed against the grains of spice as he grabbed some grains and began to lift them up, with me being among the grains of spice.<br>\r\n\"What is he doing now?\" I thought to myself. <br>\r\nMy face was getting pale as I got the answer: with his hand being placed in front of his mouth, with his lips parting slowly and providing me with a view into this gigantic red chamber. Of course I was shocked at the sight of the rows of his perfect white teeth being parted and revealing his unreal looking wet and slimy tongue and his dangling uvula in the distance.<br>\r\nAs luck would have it, he brought his fingertips nearer to his mouth, attempting to taste the spice before he would put it onto his steak...and he would taste me as well! It was like some really bad nightmare as he slowly brought this organic mass that was his tongue out of his mouth slightly, ready to embrace the spice along with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDescribing this moment of humiliation is tough, but as I had closed my eyes tightly and out of fear, I could only feel a slimy substance touching me, seeming to sweep over my body. I knew that he was licking his fingertips, thus he moved his tongue over his fingers and me as well. I thanked God that I was able to cling to a certain spot of his finger - probably a fold - and so I grabbed the skin with all power that was left inside me in order to avoid getting stuck to his tongue and ending up in the infamous cavern of doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCounting the seconds until this torture was over, I felt a slight shift of my position as Jon began to move his hand away from his mouth again, probably having had a good taste of the spice. I might have been wet, with my entire body being covered in a thick layer of saliva, but I still had managed to elude the abyss of the insides of Jon\u00b4s body. With no idea of what would happen to tiny me, Jon now began to place all fingers of his right hand around the pile of spice I was still among, beginning to rub it. As the grains of spice were constantly being moved around before ultimately falling down, I felt them being pressed against my body powerfully, threatening to break every single bone inside me. At least I was not crushed to death, but it hurt terribly. I wanted to scream, but it seemed like the grains were pressing against my lungs from the outside so tightly that I couldn\u00b4t inhale enough air in order to scream. The torture went on as I was no longer exposed to the threat of being crushed by some grains of spice as they began to fall down immediately. Deep down inside me I knew where I would be landing on, and it became clear when I landed on yet another soft surface seconds later. Looking down onto the ground, I noticed its reddish-dark colour as well as its fleshy and bloody structure. The steak...I was on the steak along with the spice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jon lifted up the plate the steak was being placed on, and me as well in the process, I felt this terrible shift of gravity only too well. I noticed that he was bringing it over to a strange apparatus standing on a table on the other side of the kitchen: a shining silver box which looked like a fancy microwave oven, but I knew that it was a so called QC, as Jon had told me several times. It was somehow part of his job, after all. I for my part never really cared about quantum waves and such stuff, though, so to me, it was yet another microwave to me. Opening the small \"gate\" to the QC, Jon placed the table inside this thing, closing the gate quickly shortly after. As for me, it was impossible for me to react properly whatsoever, for it would have been futile, anyway. Now I had to expect a painful death inside a QC, if there would be no miracle to save me this time. Hearing a futuristic, loud *bleep*, the machine began to work, preparing Jon\u00b4s meal...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The spinning motion inside the quantumwave oven was actually quite interesting to watch. Unlike a microwave, for instance, the color inside changed not due to a light turning on, but because the quantum effect actually altered lightwaves inside the box, creating a very interesting aurora borealis effect inside. I wondered for a moment what it must be like to see it from within, with the shifting cacophony of colors swirling all around you, and decided that I would have to ask the QC up at work if he could produce the effect in open air, or build an oven big enough that I could climb inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as I mused about this I realized that it was just as likely that the QC would do something totally off the wall with such a request, possibly designing some way to make me small enough to fit inside the over, rather than increasing the size of it, which I believed was impossible as if it were made any larger the waveforms would collapse before getting to every corner of the box, making it a useless device. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't but a moment later that the box began to beep that it had completed its work, which had taken less than a minute from the time I moved the plate from the counter into the oven. Of course I'd set the oven to only make it medium rare, keeping the juices inside, while still cooking it to the proper level to eliminate bacteria, and that meant that it wouldn't have taken hours on another way, but as I pulled it out, my mouth began to water at the sight of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, such a steak would now have to wait for a while for the juices to settle within the meat, as the temperature would still be hot within if cooked in a normal way. Of course, my quantumwave oven was not a normal way, and when it beeped it had actually sent out a wave that was supposed to cancel motion, making it so the steak cooled off instantly. As I stared at it, steam did rise from the surface of the meat, but it wasn't burning up, instead it was, or at least was supposed to be, at the perfect eating <br>\r\ntemperature. <br>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>\r\nI had done a test of this nature in the lab involving a mouse atop what amounted to just cut of beef, just to see if I had been right about the oven not affecting living tissue, and sure enough the mouse had escaped unharmed. The heat hadn't even transferred from the meat into the mouse, which just sat there looking cute as I could get. Well that was until Alice, the owner of said mouse, took it out of my hand and then proceeded to feed it and the slab of meat to a mutant wolf thing she'd developed. Now some people say what I did was cruel, but personally, I think Alice wrapping a piece of beef around the mouse so that the beef would move was crueler, though her mutant pet did not seem to go after anything that did not move, so I can see the logic in it. <br>\r\nPlacing the plate on the counter again I could smell the hint of the spice as it had mixed with the steak's own juices, and was finding it hard not to just scarf down the piece of meat. I kept my cool though, as I really didn't think it would have been proper for me to have taken such action, and instead began to search for some utensils with which I might partake of my meal, but came up disappointed as I only found a knife and no forks. It took me only a few seconds to remember I'd torn the prongs off all my forks a few days before, searching for a thin piece of metal to create a circuit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then what am I going to do with you?\" I asked my meal as I stared down at it. Oddly I thought for a moment I saw some kind of motion in the center of it, but decided quickly that it had to be my imagination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no fork, and still no desire to just scarf down the steak with my hands I had to search for a moment for some solution that would not offend my sensibilities, and quickly found said solution as it was sitting right atop my refrigerator in the form of a loaf of bread. Turning from my steak towards the aforementioned appliance I grabbed the block of plastic wrapped, sliced bread and tossed it onto the counter right next to my meal, which was still sitting patiently for me, like good food should. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the work of a heartbeat to take two slices of sandwich bread out and lay them on the counter in front of the plate, while then picking up my knife and slicing off a thin strip from one side. Placing the strip on one piece of bread I repeated the motion a second time, and then a third, and so and until I came to the very center of the steak, where I'd sprinkled the extra bit of spice I'd had on my fingers before cooking it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to lose this extra bit of flavor among the rest I slowly cut this piece off from the rest, and breaking every rule off hygiene I knew, I grabbed the chunk of meat with my hand, and slowly brought it up to my mouth, unaware that on it was riding some tiny dot that was very objectionable to my breaking of habit, but even had I been able to see it, I don't think I could have stopped myself as I brought the piece to my mouth, and bit it in two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nearly collapsed as the flavor hit me with full force, and made a mental note to thank the QC when I got to work tomorrow for the oven, as it had made what amounted to the best steak I had ever tasted in my life. On the small bit of beef still in my hand, I doubt that the tiny speck would have been so happy, as slowly and purposefully chewed what was in my mouth, almost as a show for it to see what was going to happen to it as soon as I swallowed my first bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was not to be, for I had had my taste, and did not wish to ruin the rest of my meal by having this small snack beforehand. Thus did I drop the remainder of the steak that was in my hand atop the pile of strips that was already on the piece of bread. From there I proceeded to resume cutting the rest of the steak into strips, placing each one atop the small piece of steak from the center of the whole thing, until at last there was none left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small dot, unknown to me, stared at me from underneath one of the strips. If I had been looking closely I would have seen that the tiny thing was caught underneath it by its leg, and unable to move away as I started to lower the top piece of bread and complete my sandwich. I stopped before I did this though, turning back towards my fridge for a moment, and pushing aside bottles that clanked together until I at last found the one I was searching for this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then proceeded to dump a huge flow of steak sauce onto the strips that made up my sandwich, enjoying the way it spread out when it touched the surface of the stuff, like some rolling wave of flavor, covering the meat, as well as the little dot, under its darkness. When at last I was satisfied I picked up the other piece of bread and squashed it down atop its partner, creating at last my evening meal, and then I drew forth a can of drink from the fridge, and proceeded into my livingroom, where I could eat in relative peace, while watching the sun set fully outside my west facing window.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So that was it. I was trapped inside this microwave-like QC thing, knowing what would happen to me soon. I was sure that this time, there would be no escape from death. Avoiding to end up inside Jon\u00b4s body by either getting inhaled or getting eaten did at least seem realistic and not like some miracle. Out of all these situation I have been through on that day until this moment, only my fall onto the kitchen table and me surviving it seemed like a miracle to me. Maybe it was some side effect Doc\u00b4s pill, who knows. But something told me that inside the QC, I would burn to death. It was a shame that it had to end like that, that I could not exit the stage of life in a more graceful way. With the thought of my death being there in my mind, tears began to build up in my eyes, flowing down my cheeks as those cold, electronic sounds of the QC were clearly  audible to me, indicating that this \"doomsday machine\" was finally starting to work.<br>\r\nI wasn\u00b4t ashamed of my tears, though. It is only natural, considering that I would never see my beloved ones again. Deep in my mind, I said farewell to those I loved, to Jon, to Kokoro, to my family. And so I was awaiting the the execution of my death sentence, as the process of cooking the steak and me with it started with a spinning motion of the platform the plate with the steak was being placed on. I looked onto the squishy surface of the steak I was standing on, with my eyes closed slightly. I did not want to see the things around me in my final moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seconds I was waiting to die felt like hours, years or decades, as they were supposedly the last in my life. Yet strangely, my body could not perceive any painful feeling, even one minute after the quantumwave had started working. Looking up from the steak again and opening my eyes wide, I was able to see the most beautiful sight my eyes could have possibly perceived at that very moment, making my fear and sorrow fade away, replacing it with awe. The entire inside of the quantumwave was being covered in such a wondrous, colourful light, and it seemed like this image was straight out of a fairytale.  Jon would have probably thought of some natural or scientific event while watching this light, but being more of a dreamer myself, it seemed like a beautiful fantasy to me as I gasped at the sight of the light.<br>\r\n\"That\u00b4s...amazing...\" I whispered in awe. It actually made me remember what Jon once told me about the quantumwave and its effects. Now one must say that I am not an expert when it comes to technical questions, as this is Jon\u00b4s realm, so to speak, and sometimes I would quickly forget what he told me. Still, it was always nice listening to him and noticing that he could explain those scientific terms better than most teachers. Anyway, the important thing that came back to my mind was that no living matter could be affected by the quantumwave, and that was the reason for me not burning to death or not dying in a nasty and painful way. And that\u00b4s why I didn\u00b4t even feel the heat of the steak rising beneath me. I could feel no pain, and all I could do at that very moment was enjoying this incredible sight of the mysterious and wonderful lights. So I was really able to escape death again...although I was aware that maybe I just prolonged the inevitable, but after all that has happened to me so far, nothing could scare me anymore, and so I smiled for the first time since my shrinkage, mostly because of the light\u00b4s influence making me happy, and I wiped the tears off my cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least I was able to escape certain death for a short while. It didn\u00b4t take too long until the lights that were bringing joy unto my soul disappeared just like that, and the slight spinning motion of the \"platform\" the steak was being placed on stopped. The steak was ready ready to be devoured by Jon now. I had to swallow hard at that thought and what this would mean for me. The huge door suddenly opened, and as steam was rising from the steak, my view was being penetrated. Still, I was able to see a gigantic hand through this \"fog\", reaching for the plate with the steak. As Jon grabbed the plate, I could feel a slight shift of the ground as he took it out of the quantum wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs my planet sized compadre stared down at the plate he just took out of the quantumwave, it almost made me pee my pants out of fear, seeing the hungry expression in his mountain sized face. I could imagine that the saliva was building up in his mouth in joyful anticipation of the feast this steak would be for him. It almost seemed as if my friend wanted to mock me as he spoke those words that made me angry beyond compare.<br>\r\n\"Well, then, what am I going to do with you?\"<br>\r\nOf course he could not know how cynical this playful question really was, being oblivious to my presence, but it made me mad, knowing what those words were announcing and what was about to happen to me. In fact, it was getting ridiculous by now, being thrown from one dangerous situation into another, miraculously surviving every single threat. And another of those well known situations was about to arise again, as my friend\u00b4s gastro-intestinal tract was coming nearer and nearer as my final destination. Fortunately, Jon was not a barbarian, as he wanted to eat such a tasty treat only with appropriate instruments, such as a fork and a knife. In the process, Jon placed the plate on the kitchen counter again, as he began to search for the aforementioned cutlery. I watched his movements very closely and in fearful anticipation, knowing about the outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr not so much. To my surprise, Jon took a loaf of bread from the top of the refrigerator, putting it onto the table next to the plate. I guessed that he wanted to make himself a steak-sandwich, then, with me being the secret ingredient. Instead of trying to run away from the steak, I kept watching his very movements, as I couldn\u00b4t do otherwise. I knew that I could not possibly escape the plate without hurting myself badly, and somehow, I could not help but witnessing the spectacle. Watching him taking two slices of bread and placing them onto the clean kitchen table. And watching him do something very appalling from my point of view: as I was standing directly in the middle of the vast field of dead flesh, I looked up in horror into the skies, seeing Jon\u00b4s hand holding a knife and descending every once in a while onto the piece of steak several meters away from me and cutting the steak into smaller stripes, with the knife coming nearer and nearer with every slice he made, and I was afraid of being sliced too. Although it was hard to spot from my position, I could get glimpses at the nearby slices of bread, with the thin stripes of steak being placed onto it by Jon. It might have been irrelevant at that moment, but Jon sure knew how to make the best out of a mere steak leftover. But what was he going to do with the meaty part of the steak I myself happened to be on, unfortunately?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wish I never knew. He just...he just took the part of the steak I was on with his bare hand and lifted it high up in the air, and I had to cling to the soft, spicy flesh of the steak with all power my muscles could afford at that moment in order not to fall down into the depths. But as I dared to turn my head, I gasped in shock to see Jon\u00b4s mouth opening impossibly wide in order to receive the steak that was approaching this gigantic cavern of doom more and more with each passing moment. I wanted to scream at the sight of his lips parting, revealing those huge rows of his white lower and upper teeth, ready to take a bite of the steak. When he was licking his fingertips earlier, there was at least not the threat of getting crushed by his teeth, only getting stuck on his tongue. But this time, things were vastly different. I did not want to see the following events, and I somehow hoped that if I had to die, he would crush me under his mighty and monstrous teeth, as it would spare me to live through the nightmare of traveling around inside his digestive system and suffering a long and painful death. My body was trembling in fear as I finally closed my eyes, with Jon\u00b4s mouth now opened as wide as possible as he brought part of the steak into it. Feeling the hot air of his breathing, I winced when I felt a violent shaking as Jon\u00b4s teeth made their impact on the soft flesh. I could tell that I did not belong to the part he just bit off and was not trapped inside his mouth now, but it was pretty damn close, as I could feel the warm blast of air blowing into my direction even more powerful, and that smell of the winds coming from his gurgling stomach...well, let\u00b4s not talk about that. although it didn\u00b4t reek as horribly as I thought, it was remarkable that the smell of his stomach could reach me up there in front of his mouth. Listening to the loud crunching sounds of his teeth taking care of the piece of steak and turning it into a wad of masticated goo that would become even more unrecognizable once it entered his stomach and let the digestive juices work on it, I was afraid of me taking the same direction soon. Another horrific sound of his body hit me deep in my soul as I heard him swallowing his mouthful of steak. I could almost imagine the flesh\u00b4s way into Jon\u00b4s gigantic and vast stomach, and the sheer thought of that brought to the verge of collapsing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut one last time, luck was on my side, as I felt another slight shift of gravity as Jon removed the piece of steak from his mouth again and lowered it, with me still clinging to the flesh for my dear life. Of course I would not come to rest, as I realized that Jon put the remaining part of the steak directly onto one of the two slices of bread, above the other slices of steak he already placed there. Unfortunately, he did not put it there properly, instead, he dropped it from a high position, or at least it seemed so to me. During the sudden fall down, I was no longer able to cling to the steak due to the speed of the fall, and soon, I found myself on a soft slice of steak Jon had put onto the bread earlier. I shuddered as the meaty part of the steak I was clinging to before made its impact on the bread with a thunderous sound. I had to get out of there quickly if I did not want to become part of my friend\u00b4s meal, but as I tried to move, I noticed that I couldn\u00b4t, as a slice of steak was lying on my right leg, and it was far too big and heavy for me to even attempt removing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere I was, trapped in my friend\u00b4s steak-sandwich. The icing on the cake followed quickly as high up in the skies above me, Jon was squeezing steak-sauce out of a bottle and onto the slice of bread, and soon, I felt the red, sticky substance flowing over my tiny body, covering it entirely except for my head. It felt so disgusting and humiliating, but I couldn\u00b4t do anything about it. I could only watch in horror that Jon was bringing the second slice of bread down onto the first one, making the sandwich complete and covering me in darkness, as I was now stuck between a fleshy slice of steak, thick sauce and a vast piece of bread. I was now truly trapped inside my best friend\u00b4s snack. Perceiving the motions outside my tasty prison, I realized that Jon grabbed the plate with the sandwich on it and began to walk, bringing me further toward my scary fate inside my friend...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Taking the plate with my sandwich and the bottle of drink into the livingroom of my <br>\r\napartment I saw that the whole room was ablaze with the last lights of the day. As always <br>\r\nthe mirror at the back of the room was catching those final rays of the setting sun, <br>\r\ndiffusing them over the whole of the room, and creating an effect that I doubt could have <br>\r\nbeen equaled by any artificial light source, as it seemed to me the room was full of fire <br>\r\nand energy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus did I make my way through the glorious light, arriving at my recliner and setting <br>\r\nthe sandwich and drink down on a nearby coffee table as I took my seat. Looking now at <br>\r\nthe blazing inferno from its exact center I wanted to cry at the beauty, something no one <br>\r\nelse, not any of my girlfriends, not my family, and not even Julian had ever seen, as I made <br>\r\nsure this was my joy alone. That was probably selfish of me, but I cared little, for it <br>\r\nhad been I who set up the large mirror at one end of the room, so why shouldn't it have <br>\r\nbeen I who benefitted from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut beautiful as the scene was, it was only food for the soul, and my stomach reminded me <br>\r\nwith a roar that it wanted the other kind of food, the one for it, and that it was laying <br>\r\nthere on the table. With that thought in mind I leaned over and grabbed the sandwich, <br>\r\nworking my finger under it as I slowly lifted it off the cold plate and into the air. <br>\r\nTaking another wiff of its scent I could feel my mouth watering in anticipation, and I <br>\r\ncould feel the bread already slightly warmed by the heat of the steak within it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis, however, is when I ran into my first problem, as I brought the sandwich up to my <br>\r\nmouth, as the tin dot stared out of its edge at me, only to discover that I couldn't make <br>\r\nmy mouth open wide enough to accept it. It took me a moment to realize that fact, and then <br>\r\nI pulled the sandwich back from my mouth, before staring at it for a second or two. Then, <br>\r\nplacing the meal on the flat of one palm I proceeded to squish it flat, making it shorter <br>\r\nby just enough to fit in my mouth, and causing the sides to squirt out a small stream of <br>\r\nsteak sauce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly some small speck in the sauce caught my eye. Had I not been sitting in my livingroom during this particular moment then I doubt I would have been able to see it, <br>\r\nas it was so small that only by reflect a bright light could it be seen at all. It took <br>\r\nme a few seconds to realize that this small speck had to be the exact same one I'd <br>\r\nnoticed earlier as I'd been walking to my kitchen, a single grain of dust in an otherwise <br>\r\nimmaculately clean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoting how far the speck had traveled I quickly came to the conclusion that it had to be <br>\r\nsomething other than dust, as I doubted any inanimate object could have found its way <br>\r\ninto my sandwich through pure chance. Of course that forced me to realize that the speck <br>\r\nhad to be some kind of bug, which was probably struggling for its life as it sat there, <br>\r\ncovered in steak sauce, awaiting the inevitable moment when I would devour it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I wouldn't want to disappoint,\" I told the bug, and with that I opened my <br>\r\nmouth, bringing the sandwich to my lips. Had someone else been there at that moment I bet <br>\r\nI would have flicked the little gnat off the sandwich, but alone as I was now, I found I <br>\r\ncouldn't care less. After all I was hungry, and the gnat would provide me with some extra <br>\r\nproteins. Besides I'd eaten bus before in some of my cultural studies, so it didn't seem <br>\r\nany different than that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing as much of the sandwich into my mouth as I could I took my first bite, and I felt <br>\r\nthe satisfying squish as my teeth cut through the bread with ease, before reaching that <br>\r\nwhich was contained within. The steak proved a slightly more difficult thing to chew on, <br>\r\nas it was piled high inside my sandwich, but I was not about to allow tiny strips of cow <br>\r\nmeat defy me, anymore than I would have let the jar of spice do so earlier, so I ground <br>\r\nmy teeth into the steak strips, until at last I head the satisfying clink of teeth <br>\r\nmeeting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the bite fully in my mouth I used my tongue to carry it farther back, tasting every <br>\r\nbit of flavor as the sauce and spice billowed off it, coating every spare place in my <br>\r\nmouth as I moved it around. I was quick to push the steak under my molars after this, and <br>\r\nthen the flavor became even more intense, for as I bit down into the bits of flesh the <br>\r\njuice flowed off it, and carried the flavor of the meat everywhere, causing me to moan in <br>\r\npleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then felt a little something strike my tongue. An odd tasting bit that felt out of place on my sandwich, yet was so small I shouldn't have really noticed it. I quickly came to the conclusion that the little something had to be the gnat from before, trying desperately to crawl out of the confines of my mouth before I swallowed it alive. Of course I didn't want to do that to the poor things, forcing it to live through the process of digestion, and so I flipped it with a small motion of my tongue onto a molar, and then proceeded to try and chew it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was odd though, as I couldn't feel the satisfying crunch of its exoskeleton as I smashed it to death, but I was fast to decide I didn't really want to feel it anyway. After all, I wasn't a sadist, I was trying to spare the poor thing the pain of falling into a pool of acid. So I then continued chewing up the bite in my mouth into paste, which was only the work of a few more moments, and then with a toss of my head I sent the load of meat, sauce, and bread into my stomach, which gurgled in satisfaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore continuing my meal, though, I was forced to work my tongue into the roof of my mouth, where, during the process of chewing my first bite, a load of masticated goo which tasted of steak mostly, had become lodged some time after I had chewed up the gnat. It was actually stuck up there pretty good too, as it took me several tries with my tongue to finally dislodge it, causing to fall with a squishy plop onto said appendage, so I could swallow it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as I swallowed the last bit of steak that I felt it. A small scratch at the back of my mouth, as if something in that last little bit had grabbed onto my tongue and was gripping there for dear life. It didn't take me long to realize that I'd missed my tiny gnat friend, and that he was still fighting not to go down, even moving his legs in a noticeable way as he tried to agitate my throat to get me to cough him back out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't about to do that though, as anything that went into my mouth had a date with my stomach, and so I looked around, finally spotting the drink I'd brought with me into the living room. Unscrewing the top of the bottle I let the aroma of the liquid pour into my nose for only a moment before I brought the container to my lips. I wondered what it had to be like for the bug, as its view of the outside world became eclipsed by the lip of the bottle, and then a flood of drink washed over my tongue, striking it like a tidal wave, and carrying it down into the depths of my body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I tried to warn you,\" I said to the bug as I set the drink aside and felt my stomach close around that last little load. I don't know whether it was trying to agree with me or was just making noise, but that instant my stomach gurgled again, and I took this to mean that it still wasn't sated, even though I could actually feel the liquids inside it as it sloshed about, probably giving the tiny gnat one hell of a last swim as it fell into my belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought brought an old memory of Julian diving off a high board into the apartment pool on the top floor of my building. He'd actually made a comment then about how the heated water moved and sloshed about almost like the liquid in someone's stomach. I wondered if I could ask the gnat if that was truly how it felt or not, but then just laughed at the memory, and proceeded with taking another bite from my sandwich. </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>No one can imagine how horrible this feeling truly is, and it threatened me to go nuts completely: knowing that you\u00b4re doomed for sure, and no matter how hard you try, it\u00b4s inevitable, but in your foolishness, you\u00b4re still making futile attempts to elude the abyss of destiny. Or in my case: eluding the abyss of my best friend\u00b4s innards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, I found myself in a desperate situation, as my legs were still buried under a fleshy and juicy stripe of steak, with no chance of getting myself out of this mess at all. As if this wasn\u00b4t enough to ruin my day, the red, thick and sticky steak sauce made it even more difficult for me to move my upper body. As it was impossible for me to move and start an attempt to escape Jon\u00b4s meal, this was indeed my early grave, in a certain way, with darkness all around me, thanks to the slices of bread far above and beneath me as well as the stripes of meat and the steak sauce. Not only the darkness, but also the certainty of where my next destination would lie made the grave allusion quite valid: Jon\u00b4s stomach. The more I thought of it, the less terrified I became about death itself. I somehow could accept death and oblivion as a part of the eternal circle of life. I just did not want to die because of Jon, because of my best friend. Hopefully, he would never find out about what happened to me. I did not want him to suffer from the knowledge of himself being the one to unknowingly wipe me from existence because of his hunger. Jon did not deserve such a painful feeling of guilt, especially because he was my best friend and probably the nicest person I have ever met, next to Kokoro, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, amidst the darkness around me, created by the two thick slices of bread along with the meat and the sauce surrounding me, it seemed as if there was some source of bright light outside the sandwich, somewhere in Jon\u00b4s living room. This light was bright enough to make it slightly better for me to see anything in there. Strange...it must have been some really bright light, as it even managed to lighten up a place like this. It must have been something more powerful than any ordinary other source of light you\u00b4d find in a living room. <br>\r\nAnyway, the sloshing of the sandwich did not stop as Jon was still carrying it - and me as well. To make my situation even scarier (although I remained relatively calm and did not scream my lungs out in fear), I could still hear the thunderous sound of his shoes\u00b4 impacts on the ground whenever he took a step, reminding me of some old, classic giant stories, with the tiny hero being intimidated by by the loud stomping of the giant, like in \"Brave Little Tailor\" or \"Jack and the Beanstalk\", stories my mother used to tell me before bedtime when I was a small kid. Although Jon was not a giant...a giant could have been a mere toy compared to Jon\u00b4s size, maybe as big as an action figure, while I was, as I have experienced already to my great dismay, as tiny as a speck of dust, almost microscopic. And that was bothering me terribly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, the loud thunderous stomping of Jon\u00b4s shoes stopped, and I could feel a downward-motion of the plate, indicating that Jon had reached his destination - presumably in the living room - and was putting the plate onto a table there, and I could hear another loud sound coming from somewhere near on the table, and I thought that this must have been some kind of drink Jon had brought with him. Of course, this situation did not persist for too long, as Jon was really hungry, having judged from the sound of his rumbling belly earlier. Speaking of that, another loud roar of his stomach indicated that it was time for him to eat. Only moments later, my body was exposed to another shift of gravity as the sandwich was being lifted upward now, as Jon obviously grabbed his little snack off the table. With the light shining inside the sandwich it was like the sad overture to a horrible destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring my journey upward and toward Jon\u00b4s mouth, I realized why the light shining into my calorie filled prison really was so bright, and this realization made my situation not any better. I noticed that I was really close to the edge of the sandwich, and as I managed to turn my head, which was still quite difficult due to the sticky sauce penetrating my ability to move considerably, I was able to take a look outside. Holy Lord, I shouldn\u00b4t have, mainly because of what I could see there. In fact, I knew my fate was not going to be pretty, yes, but having to see Jon\u00b4s mouth slowly opening wide, with me getting nearer and nearer to this cavernous fate of doom was almost unbearable, although I was exposed to this thread twice before in quite a short amount of time. I couldn\u00b4t help but gasping at the sight of his lips parting and revealing two rows of enormous white teeth (you can\u00b4t believe how scary it was to me when his lower jar was slowly sinking, accompanied by a scary sound of the air being inhaled and exhaled through his mouth), with each tooth being easily bigger than a house compared to my tiny self, and the reddish/pink insides of his mouth, no matter whether it was the uvula, threateningly dangling over the entrance to his endlessly long esophagus, the gigantic field of muscular flesh amidst his mouth that was his enormous tongue or the saliva dripping from the roof of his mouth. Just like before, when he almost ate me along with the meaty part of the steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo my surprise, the sandwich came to a sudden stop in front of his impossibly huge mouth. At first, I had no idea why Jon would hesitate to devour the sandwich and me along with it, but as he closed his mouth slightly, I realized that the sandwich must have been too big for him to take a bite of, and a small glim of hope returned to me, as the inevitable fate was prolonged again, at least for a short while. So, instead of the sandwich being pushed into Jon\u00b4s gaping maw, I felt myself being pushed nearer to the edge of the sandwich along with the sauce. I realized that it was Jon pushing against the two slices of bread above and beneath me, resulting in me getting nearer to the edge, and in the process, I was freed from the stripe of meat that was lying on my leg before. So he obviously tried to reduce its relative size by that. Fortunately (or unfortunately?), I did not fall off the sandwich, instead my body was slightly looking out of the sandwich, along with part of the sauce dripping from the edge as a result of the slices being pushed. Now I had a clear view of Jon\u00b4s entire face, as I only saw his mouth before. And to my great surprise, Jon seemed to have noticed something, as he looked directly at the edge of the sandwich with a perplexed expression. Could it be...that he really saw me at last?! I looked into my friend\u00b4s astronomical face, with hope in my eyes, as if there was finally a chance to ultimately escape the worst fate possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut hope is a bitch, honestly. The only reaction I got from Jon was shocking:<br>\r\n\"Well, then, I wouldn\u00b4t want to disappoint.\" his loud and impressive voice said in an amused tone. I couldn\u00b4t believe it. Did he really talk to me like that? Did he really saw me and wanted to eat me now? No way! Jon was my best friend! He was like my brother, and he would never even think of hurting me, especially by swallowing me and killing me in his stomach! And besides, Jon was the kind of person who would also much rather help people in need instead of torturing them, which was kinda remarkable, considering his calm, cool, relaxed and sophisticated nature.<br>\r\nNo, Jon wouldn\u00b4t have said something like that to someone as helpless as me. Especially NOT TO ME! Apparently, he indeed recognized me as some kind of living  matter and not just some speck of dust, maybe he really noticed my movements. So...maybe he thought I was some kind of gnat, in any case something that was alive and a lot smaller than a bug, which made it remarkable that he was even able to see me, a being tinier than a gnat.<br>\r\nIt somehow seemed strange that Jon was willing to eat a gnat along with his meal, though. Although Jon wasn\u00b4t too picky sometimes about what would end up inside his stomach. Whatever was about to enter his mouth would eventually take the route into his stomach, at least that\u00b4s how I sometimes teased him when we were having lunch together in the past. And I would take the same route, it appeared...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like a bad dream as I looked into his face and especially into his mouth that was opening wide again, now that the problem of the sandwich being too big was solved. The sight of his mouth was just like before again, and now that I was getting nearer to it than before, it made me realize how ridiculously huge it really was. His mouth was huge enough to let in several passenger ships or planes; anything would have fit into this wet cave. Soon, it was beginning to get darker around me, and the air that was coming out of Jon\u00b4s lungs and out of his mouth was hot and humid as he shoved the part of the sandwich I was on over his mighty, gigantic white teeth and into the yawning cave of his mouth. Soon, the certain part, and me included, were inside his mouth completely. So I was inside my friend now, a fate I barely managed to escape earlier. As the part of the sandwich was \"floating\" over his massive tongue - that seemed like a vast, pinkish and organic wasteland to me - the true horror started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis teeth were hitting part of the sandwich, cutting the part I was trapped inside off the part that was still outside his mouth in his hands. As his teeth shut tightly, it sent shivers down my spine, in view of the loud and scary noise his teeth made in the process. So that was it, I was finally trapped in Jon\u00b4s mouth completely, with no way out of my misery. To my surprise, though, I was able to see everything perfectly in there, although it should have been impossible due to the lack of light inside his body. <br>\r\nAll this was just the overture, as Jon\u00b4s tongue now began to move the part of the sandwich toward his teeth, and in a matter of seconds, he began chewing on it, smashing the bread and flesh into soft pile of goo that would be sent into his stomach eventually. Fortunately, I fell onto his wet, slimy tongue in the process, and with a quick reflex, I grabbed a fleshy fold of his tongue, clinging to the gargantuan, muscular flesh for my dear life. Despite the fact that it was a bumpy ride due to the teeth slamming onto the sandwich in the process of chewing it into tiny pieces, I managed to hold on to his tongue for a while, forced to watch some tiny pieces of the goo that was once part of the sandwich ending up under his molars and being chewed on even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jon stopped chewing for a second. It was as if time was frozen all out of a sudden, and I was wondering what all this meant. Well...nothing too good, honestly. Suddenly, I felt his tongue move beneath me, and in a flash, I felt myself thrown by a quick upward motion of the tongue toward his teeth, and directly onto one of his molars, as if he knew I was inside his mouth and thus wanted to get rid of me quickly. In horror, I looked up and saw the MASSIVE molar smashing down on me...with tears in my eyes, images of Kokoro and Jon were flashing in front of my mind\u00b4s eye, in view of what would come once the molar would hit me with full force and end my life. And then, I died and left the gates to the underworld (...or stomach) and went into the abounding lights of heaven, into the afterlife...or so I thought.  I was able to hear and feel the impact of the gigantic molar, but it did not hit me. I looked up in surprise, noticing that this time, my size helped me to survive another threat. I was too small for the molar to get hit, and inches above me, I could see where the tooth had come to a stop, now slowly rising again, with Jon obviously thinking that he got rid of me, the gnat. Just for once, this miserable size saved my life, even though it was a close call and I was still trembling due to the excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, when you\u00b4re inside a human mouth, the dangers prevail instead of stopping just like that. And so, as I jumped back onto the flesh of Jon\u00b4s tongue, another problem occurred as Jon tilted his head in order to swallow his mouthful of chewed up sandwich pieces. As I saw the mass being pushed toward me, I was hit by some gooey pile and thrown toward the back of his mouth, threatened to go the way of food down into his stomach. Luckily, despite my confusion and the power with which the pieces of the sandwich had hit me, I once again could grab onto the flesh of Jon\u00b4s tongue again. It somehow felt good to have a grip onto his tongue again, as it would save me for a short while. And so, the chewed up pile of masticated goo went over his tongue and down into his esophagus, without me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, while I was still clinging to his tongue, Jon\u00b4s tongue began to rise again, moving up to the roof of his mouth, as there were still parts of the sandwich sticking to the flesh of his mouth, and he obviously tried to peel the chewed up pieces off the roof of his mouth with the tip of his tongue. As he managed to get rid of the goo sticking to the roof of his mouth, it fell down the tongue that was still in a vertical position. And I could no longer remain in this position, clinging to his tongue while it was standing upright. So i lost my grip onto Jon\u00b4s tongue quickly, falling down along his tongue as well together with the pieces of goo. As his tongue went back into its old position, I landed on the soft flesh of the insides of his mouth, at the very edge of his tongue and only inches away from his esophagus. <br>\r\nSo Jon tilted his head again in an attempt to swallow what was left in his mouth, and so his slimy tongue pushed me toward his throat, along with the goo. Before I could go down his esophagus, I managed to get a grip on the back of Jon\u00b4s tongue again, only centimeters away from the edge of his throat, with my feet actually dangling over the black hole of his esophagus and his gigantic uvula hanging far above me. I was out of danger for a time being, but it really cost me a lot of energy to get a grip onto the flesh of his tongue again, and my tiny hands grabbed the fleshy fold at the back of his tongue tightly. Still, it was a dangerous position for me, being almost inside his throat. Maybe...I would be able to pull myself back onto the safe part of the tongue again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a futile and foolish thought of me that was at that time. While I barely managed to pull my tiny body onto the \"field\" of Jon\u00b4s tongue again, I saw that his mouth was opened wide again, accompanied by the scary sound of howling winds entering and leaving his mouth as he was inhaling and exhaling precious air. This time, there was no sandwich to be seen in front of his mouth visible, and it seemed like he had put it down back onto the table for the moment. This provided me with the perfect chance of escaping his mouth at last, although I knew that I had to be quick in order to run over his vast tongue and somehow climb over his teeth or between his teeth.<br>\r\nIt was most fascinating to see, looking out of Jon\u00b4s mouth and into his living room, as it was a completely new point of view for me, seeing the world from inside my best friend. And yet this view was quickly penetrated by a most displeasing sight that made my limbs numb and my cells aching with fear: as I was running toward the opening of his mouth and enjoying the sight, I could see that Jon was bringing a glass of water to his lips, planning to take a drink after the mouthful of sandwich he had swallowed. It happened so fast. The masses of water were entering his gigantic mouth quickly, flowing over his lower row of teeth and over his tongue toward me. As the waves of water were being washed toward me in no time, it felt like I was being threatened by the great flood that once swallowed up the land of Mu in the fairy tale. Only this time, it would be a tiny teen getting swallowed by his best friend along with his drink. The masses of water finally hit my body with such force and speed that my entire body began to hurt terribly, and the water was being washed down his throat quickly. With one last look into his mouth, I saw the bottle outside his mouth and at his lips, with a nearly endless supply of water still flowing into his mouth, but that sight was getting smaller and smaller the nearer I got to the edge of his tongue, with my body hopelessly trapped in a stream of water, exposed to the scary and constant *gulp* sounds he made as the water was washed into his esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*gulp* That was it. That terrible sound...<br>\r\nI passed Jon\u00b4s uvula, and I immediately felt gravity in all its cruelty as I fell down Jon\u00b4s throat, along with nearly infinite masses of water. Again, there was enough light for me to see everything inside him that was around me, like the pink walls of his throat, contracting steadily (which wasn\u00b4t needed, as I was far too small to even get recognized by the walls). I found it kinda ironic that I was now merely part of a bulge in his throat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nListening to Jon\u00b4s beating heart in the distance, which became louder and louder the deeper I fell into the depths of his body, as well as to the howling sound of the air entering his windpipe above, I looked down and saw his esophageal sphincter coming closer and closer, after what seemed like an eternal fall to me. It still took several seconds until the masses of water hit the surface of the muscular ring of flesh at the end of his throat, which caused the valve there to open with a squishy sound, even before I myself could hit the ring, and so I got a first glimpse at the insides of his gurgling stomach...a sight I would be exposed to in the next few seconds even more.<br>\r\nNow I was truly trapped inside my best friend\u00b4s body...trapped there forever and doomed as I passed the small ring that lead into his gigantic belly...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unlike the first bite my second proved rather dull, as no small creature climbed onto my tongue, or tired to force its way out of my mouth in a desperate grab for life. Swallowing what was in my mouth I felt sorry for the tiny bug in my belly as it was about to have tons of masticated goo rained down upon it by the vicious giant who had devoured it. Yet I didn't really feel that bad about what I'd done. After all bugs were the bottom of the food chain, and something else would have eaten the gnat if I hadn't. Still it had to be tough for the little guy, inside my gurgling belly, alive and probably hopping all around trying to find some way out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry little guy, it will al be over soon for you,\" I said to my stomach, not sure why I did it. I'd done cultural studies before leaving the States and coming here to take a job. At the time I hadn't been sure where I was going, as the company that owned the QC that was my life could have sent it almost anywhere in the world, so I took a seven week crash course in cultures of the human race, learning in several lessons almost anything anyone would want to know about anyone else's culture, including tasting cuisine, which had included live crickets at one point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat hadn't actually been my first live food though, as I was an American college student, and most fraternities still had some form of the old goldfish swallow as part of the initiation. I had to admit, it was an interesting feeling as the thing fought to stay alive in my belly, flipping its tail everywhere until at last it suffocated inside me, my stomach juices not having early enough oxygen for its gills to allow it to breathe inside me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't feel the little creature within me, but I knew it was probably jumping around as much as the goldfish had, and it would be doing that for several hours, if I knew my biology, as my stomach had enough air to support it, and it would be supplied food by me. Heck, as long as it didn't get pulled deeper into me I bet it could live for a while inside me, like the turtle some kid had swallowed a while back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had seemed rather cruel to me. After all, to eat something was one thing, but to eat it alive and just leave it in there was something else entirely. I'd actually asked the forgiveness of the goldfish's spirit as I left the frat house the night I'd eaten it, though I hadn't had to do the same with the live crickets, as you were supposed to chew those before you swallowed. Still I felt bad for the gnat in my belly, and as I stared around at the glorious light of creation streaming all around me I realized I had lost all appetite for my sandwich. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bug, having to live inside my prison of flesh, shouldn't be forced to share with other food. This was it's sacrifice to the great chain that made up life, and while the cow I was eating had also given its life to be my food, it wasn't having to experience the hell that was my stomach. Thinking these things I picked up the sandwich and quickly went to my kitchen. Walking to the quantumwave oven I placed the snack in it and pressed a button that would create a wave form to keep the bread and meat at its current temperature, basically freezing it in this moment until I could return to finish the sandwich later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done, and the swirling colors moving inside the quantumwave, I realized that I was still hungry, as my stomach growled at me in protest at the only partial meal, forcing me to again realize how bad it had to be for the bug, as it heard the noise of my gut not from without, where it was muffled by layers of flesh, but from right within. It had to be one hell of a noise, and I for one wouldn't want to be inside me to hear it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, you're only making me feel worse,\" told my gut, and the noise did cease. Of course it would return soon, and I really did want to fill it with something, but with that bug inside me I just didn't think it would feel right to eat anything, not while it was still fighting for survival anyway. I had to think of something that would cause me to work every part of my body, making my stomach process everything within it as fast as I could, and as I pondered the thought, my faucet dripped, causing a cascade of water to splash inside the sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it,\" I said, as Socrates had said eureka. Moving quickly I ran out the door to my apartment, rushing up the stairs towards my destination, the apartment's indoor pool on the top floor. I was still wearing my work clothes luckily, as they were in truth just spandex tights, designed to fit under the static suits I wore to work with the QC, and easily would double as something to swim in, though I would have to give them a through cleaning afterward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I ran up the stairs I wondered for a moment what it had to be like inside me to the little guy, and I imaged I could feel him bouncing around, hitting the walls and ceiling of my stomach as I bounced up and down ascending the steps. A rough ride, but despite my willingness to give the bug personal time with my stomach, I wasn't willing to get inside the elevator to give it a smooth ride. After all it would be over for its soon, and then I could go downstairs and finish my sandwich and go to bed. Maybe I'd even tell Julian about this when I saw him this weekend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth I think that was the fastest I'd ever made it from my fifth floor apartment to the seventeenth floor roof, and I found myself to be out of breathe as I walked over to the pool side, observing at least half a dozen tenants all lazing about in the water, drifting this way and that as the wave motion generator created a tide in the pool. Not seeing any reason to stop, I simply walked up to the pool's edge and cannonballed into it, creating a splash that soaked everyone else, and causing me to do a complete three-hundred-sixty degree head over heels spin, which had to be fun for the bug, before bursting out of the water like a dolphin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBursting as I did I was unprepared as some of the kids of the apartment started to splash me, causing me to swallow several mouthfuls of the water, before I finally got them to stop. All of them were laughing by now, and despite the looks their parents were giving me, were asking me to play with them. Looking around I realized I could use a bit of fun to get my mind off why I was there, and started to swim with them, hoping the bug would go on it's way soon so I could go back to my apartment and fill my still growling belly with that sandwich I'd left in the oven. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nothing can describe the perceptions I was having at the moment I saw the muscular esophageal sphincter open as the water below me hit its surface, revealing Jon\u00b4s gigantic stomach. It was indeed like an overload of feelings and emotions at that moment that almost drove me insane: the sounds of his gurgling stomach, the wind passing me as I fell down his esophagus, the water around me, forcing me down into Jon\u00b4s belly, the glimpse at his stomach I was provided with as the muscular valve opened...as well as the fact that it would be Jon who would seal my fate in the most displeasing way - unknowingly killing me, his best friend.<br>\r\nThe now completely opened valve seemed to greet me with a gust wind blowing out of his stomach and into my direction, being witnesses to the processes taking place inside this organic chamber that would eventually become my tomb. The stink was truly unbearable, the way it reeked of the digestion process. This foul stench made me want to vomit immediately...but for Jon\u00b4s sake, I held back and avoided that the contents of my tiny stomach would mix up with his...how ironic, if you think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only the stink was terrible, the sight of Jon\u00b4s stomach I was provided with during my fall and via the the ring into his belly was shocking: it seemed like hell itself, this organic chamber that looked like it was alive, due to the churning of the walls of his stomach - caused by the release of the digestive juices after the arrival of the chewed up steak-sandwich in there - trying to achieve its ultimate goal: dissolving anything that would enter his stomach and absorbing its plentiful nutrients...<br>\r\nThe sounds of my friend\u00b4s digestive process were clearly audible as well, and it honestly is hard to describe. \"Hellish\" might be the appropriate term, but one thing that scared the crap out of me was Jon\u00b4s constant breathing noise that could be heard far above me, coming from his lungs. It didn\u00b4t even sound like a human who was breathing, it was more like a constant and rhythmic roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn some way, it was strange that I could even perceive all this, as I was being penetrated by the flow of water I was caught in and now pushed me through the muscular ring of his esophageal sphincter, and in a matter of seconds, I felt myself being washed into into the stomach of my best friend, and it didn\u00b4t take long until the water at least came to a partial stop. It seemed to me that Jon drank enough water to fill his entire stomach to a small extent...still high enough for me to swim in there. I dared not to close my eyes, and the sight of his stomach in all its glory overwhelmed me, being quite different from the view I got through his esophageal sphincter before. First of all, it has to be said that there was light in there, or at least I was able to see everything properly, which kinda surprised me, as normally, there should not be light inside Jon\u00b4s body. As if fate wanted me to suffer by seeing the circumstances of my death perfectly well.<br>\r\nJon\u00b4s stomach was huge. Really huge. Looking high up into the air, I found it difficult to see the ceiling of his stomach properly. Speaking of air, there seemed to be enough of it in there, as breathing was no problem for me at all. Yet the air was hot and humid, but that didn\u00b4t even penetrate me that much.<br>\r\nIt was also certainly interesting to see the walls of Jon\u00b4s stomach contracting like that, providing it with the digestive juices it would need in order to dissolve the remnants of the sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I was swimming in there, listening to his heart beat, his breathing and his digestion process, heaved up by the waves of the water whenever Jon was moving in a significant way that penetrated the water. And there was one significant move by him, and judging from the shaking of his stomach, it seemed like he was standing up. I for my part was a bit surprised that there were no more parts of the sandwich entering his stomach, as there was still something left for him to eat outside. It looked like he did not want to finish his meal and conclude this feast. From then on, I could feel slightly that he was moving around, leaving me with no idea where he was going, only with the water shaking me around as a result. I was just glad that the water remained inside his stomach for a while, as it would prevent me from facing the acids and meeting my destiny for a time being. Although I was aware that it would just delay the inevitable. Honestly, I did not think of any attempt to escape my friend\u00b4s body. I was rational enough to realize that there was no way for me to get out of his system again. Climbing up his esophagus was more than impossible, getting out the natural way too desecrating and humiliating for me, and I would not have been able to make it, I thought. And even I got out of his...well, you know what, my fate from then on would have been doubtful as well. Didn\u00b4t leave much choices for me. Only a miracle could have helped me to survive, like him throwing up his meal and me with it, but again, it was doubtful, as well as my fate once I would get out. So, practically, I was not exactly happy about the masses of water preventing me from meeting the digestive juices. I just accepted it, just like the course of fate. Although it gathered my dismay that Jon\u00b4s esophageal sphincter began to close slowly, until it was shut tightly, cutting off an at least possible way out of his stomach...if it wouldn\u00b4t have been completely impossible for me to even get up there. Kinda ironic, all this. It seemed like the sphincter cut me off the outside world forever with this action as well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like an eternity until something exciting happened again. All I could do was floating in the water, watching the mountain of chewed up food that was towering out of the masses of water being slowly dissolved by the stomach acids. Disgusting...but as long as I was not exposed to this procedure, I couldn\u00b4t care less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when something happened again at last, it was powerful and with full force. First, everything inside Jon\u00b4s stomach began to shake and wobble violently, as a result of the steps Jon took. To me, it appeared that he was running, really fast. Surely that was not without any result for me, since waves were being created out of the water due to the fast and sudden motions of Jon\u00b4s body. And I was caught in what could be described as a perfect storm, with the waves washing over my body and keeping me under water every now and then, but fortunately, I managed to swim up again and fill my lungs with the precious oxygen. And fortunately, I was somehow hardened to the situation of being exposed to life-threatening dangers by now, so I was able to stand this unpleasant, stormy situation until his stomach would calm down again.<br>\r\nAt that time, I found myself near one of his stomach walls, probably because the water had randomly washed me there. That was good, since I was able to cling to a fleshy fold of his stomach walls, with all power that was left in my frail body, when suddenly, the water as well as the remnants of the sandwich were being sucked with incredible force into an opening far on the other side of Jon\u00b4s stomach, which probably led into his small intestines. That was something I did not quite understand, as it normally takes hours for the food to get dissolved enough in the stomach until it can be pushed into the intestines. But that was irrelevant, as I had to hold on to the stomach walls for my dear life if I did not want to enter his intestines. Although my situation was hopeless, my will to survive was not dead yet, hence I continued to fight for my life as long as possible.<br>\r\nAfter a while, the entire stomach was empty of food and water, with me letting go off the walls and falling down onto the soft, fleshy ground of the stomach, and I did not even get a scratch, thanks to exactly that soft surface of his stomach, which was probably because of the slimy layer covering the entire surface of the stomach in order to prevent the acids from dissolving the stomach itself.<br>\r\nAs I was standing there now, all alone, I could even feel the ground moving up and down slightly due to Jon\u00b4s breathing, with the sounds from above accompanying it. Thankfully, Jon had stopped running before, so it was even kinda calm in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I could not enjoy the loneliness for too long, as there was another sudden event that made me pass out immediately, an event that practically transpired out of nowhere, not even giving me enough time to be shocked or perplexed. With incredible physical force, I found myself being thrown through the air in his stomach all out of a sudden, just like that, as if Jon was jumping. It was too much for my tiny body, and as a logical result, I fell unconscious immediately, not even feeling the pain in my body or the shock of this unbelievably powerful and sudden event. All I could perceive from then on was the touch of water only moments later on my skin before I completely left for the world of dreams, so to speak...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Okay, enough of that, I have to get back home,\" I told the kids, who made that awing sound the young usually make when something they don't want to happen does. Of course when my stomach rumbled loud enough for them to hear I think they got the message, and two of them, the twins Travis and Markus, wished me a good night. I thanked them for that as I made my way out of the pool, shaking off as I did. Again I was impressed by the material of my suit, designed by my employers, the owners of the QC, which literally allowed the water to roll off, and was dry within a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish my hair could do that too,\" I said, running my fingers through it and causing a rain of droplets to fall onto the floor at my feet. It certainly did help a little, and as I grabbed a towel from a nearby dispenser I roughly ran it through many times, making sure my hair was at least halfway dry as I walked over to the door that led to the stairs, which would eventually take me back home, and to the sandwich I had waiting in the quantumwave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was around the thirteenth floor that I got my first impression that something was wrong. A kind of pressure just below my heart that shouldn't have been there, even as out of breath as I was. Taking a moment on the stairs I waited as the pain began to fade, and I made a mental note not to ever do this again, as that little pang had probably been an extension of emptiness in my belly, which had been rumbling off and on for almost ten minutes, since I felt it drain while I was swimming. <br>\r\n\"Of course, if Julian had been here I probably wouldn't have eaten the bug in the first place,\" I told myself, having remembered in the middle of the swim that it was Julian who I had agreed to meet tonight. Supposedly he was going to be waiting in my apartment when I got home, yet I hadn't seen him. Of course, if Kokoro had asked him to, he most definitely going to find the will to stand me up, and I wouldn't have been able to get mad at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, if Julian had to stand me up he would have at least called, and he answering machine would have told me about it when I got home. Yet I hadn't heard a peep from it. If that was the case, then it begged the question of just where Julian was? Why had I been going to meet him anyway? I knew it had something to do with that kook doctor friend of his, the one who lived on the edge of town, but I couldn't remember anything specific. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah who cares. It probably wasn't that important any-AH!!!\" suddenly my heart felt like it was about to explode. As if something had somehow gotten inside and was stuck in one of the veins leading out, and thus the blood was building up, ready to burst the organ at any second, and take me down with it. Having been walking down the stairs when this happened I was forced to my knees and curled up into a tight ball, rolling down the plexiglass steps until I at last struck one of the landings with a thud, gripping my chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the stars!\" I swore as I unfurled my body, every limb flailing outward at the pain coming from within me. For a moment, a single, horrible drawn out moment, I thought I was going to die, here on the steps of some apartment building. Really, considering all the risks I took in my life, working around the QC and all the generators attached to it, this was probably the least likely way to go. Probably a heck of a lot more honorable than the deaths that finally claimed the lives of some of my fellow employees up at the lab, at least two of them getting devoured by their own experiments this year alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the object, whatever it was, shot out of my heart. I could actually feel the object, whatever it was as it moved in my body, flying through the veins that led up to my head. It actually seemed to me that it grabbed the walls of my corraded artery as it passed through, and then as suddenly as it had started, everything was over, and I was left laying on the landing of the seventh floor, several bruises on my body, but I felt no broken bones or anything more permanent as I picked myself up. Counting myself lucky as I slowly descended the steps to the fifth floor, to stand at last before my door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that all about?\" I asked myself as I turned the knob and entered my sanctuary away from the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was about me nearly killing you,\" came a voice, and I was startled to find that it was Julian's, and I looked all around, trying to find him, but when I saw nothing I thought for a moment I had imagined it, but decided to ask anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julian, are you there?\" I said to the world, and got no reply at first, then shrugged my shoulders and walked the rest of the way into my apartment. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You bet that it was not exactly my day, and that\u00b4s even an understatement. Virtually no moment had passed without my life being in grave danger after my shrinkage. And now I was of course being exposed to the greatest possible threat, being trapped inside my friend\u00b4s body, his digestive tract, to be precise, and on top of that unconscious. In some way, it was an advantage, because if I had died while being unconscious, for example if I had been digested, I would not have felt the pain at least, it would have been a peaceful transition into the afterlife for me, even though I could not have accepted my best friend\u00b4s insides, thus himself, being responsible for my death, especially because it was not his fault whatsoever, as he completely oblivious to the fact that he unwittingly sent his best friend onto a journey every scientist certainly always dreamed of. Jonathan (although no one calls him Jonathan anymore, Kokoro and me for example have come to call him simply Jon, and we always thought he likes that name better) was probably the most good hearted friend I could have ever wished for, and he was always there for me when I was feeling down and bad - and after all, he provided me with advice and help when it came to my first dates with Kokoro, something I will never forget. That\u00b4s why I could not accept someone like him, someone so close to me being responsible for my demise.<br>\r\nBut at that moment, it was not in my power to decide over my fate. Being unconscious, I had to let fate decide about what would become of me, with me having no influence whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut fate obviously did not want me to die.<br>\r\nMy \"abscence\" from the reality of Jon\u00b4s stomach seemed to last for hours and hours, but as I found out later, I was unconscious for only about 10 minutes. During that time, I was somehow dreaming of Jon and Kokoro, who were sitting with me at a table in some fancy restaurant. There was another girl sitting next to Jon, but I could not identify her. We were talking about my voyage into Jon\u00b4s body, with all of us laughing and joking, teasing Jon from time to time. Looking back at that dream, it seemed incredibly cynical and ironic.<br>\r\nBecause when I came to again and regained my senses, I quickly realized that it was just a dream and that my voyage was not over. As my eyes were slowly opening again, I found myself looking up into the skies, seeing the ceiling of Jon\u00b4s stomach again, just like before. Only this time, things were worse, much worse. The picture of the fleshy, muscular ceiling I got was practically rushing past my eyes, and I realized why: I was trapped inside the water Jon had gulped down earlier, and the water was now floating towards a certain direction very fast - with me in it. And this certain direction did not appeal to me in the least bit, honestly. As the sight of the gigantic stomach of my host as well as the masses of water Jon had swallowed just after the remnants of his earlier drink had disappeared into the intestines already intimidated me, I was truly horrified to see a large hole just a few meters in front of me, pulsating slightly as this organic, pink hole began to suck in the water. I knew immediately that it was the entrance to Jon\u00b4s small intestines, and you can imagine that I had no intention to explore the insides of his body even further, but again my tiny stature did not allow me to escape this threat. I was trying hard to swim away from the organic hole that seemed to come closer and closer with each moment as the water was rushing toward and into it, but the speed with which the water was floating as well as the sheer masses transporting me made a positive result of my attempt impossible, but I did not give up, crawling with my arms through the water like a maniac. Twas no use, unfortunately, as I already said: in a matter of seconds, I found myself being washed through the hole, leaving Jon\u00b4s stomach and entering his small intestines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transition into his intestines - or his duodendum, to be precise, at least at the beginning - was actually not that much of a change. I mean, when the water came to a stop in his intestines, being only knee-high thanks to the size of the intestines providing enough space for the water, I was finally able to stand upright again, huffing and puffing because I had swallowed some water in the process of being washed deeper into my friend\u00b4s digestive tract - kinda ironic, if you consider that the water had already been swallowed before by Jon...<br>\r\nBut as took a closer look at my surroundings, I could see the same organic, pink walls his stomach consists of as well, they only had one difference: there were small, finger-like projections covering the intestinal walls, and I knew that these were the so called villi. Each villus contains capillaries and a lacteal. And the lacteal absorbs the nutrients into Jon\u00b4s bloodstream. I shrugged at the thought of me being sucked into my best friend\u00b4s bloodstream as well...sure, we were as close to each other as brothers, but I did not want to be THAT close to him, no offense.<br>\r\nBut if there\u00b4s something I\u00b4ve learned on my voyage, then that it doesn\u00b4t matter what I want and don\u00b4t want when I am trapped deep inside my best friend\u00b4s body.<br>\r\nAnyway, at that moment, the villi on one side of the intestinal tunnel in the duodendum began to wobble all out of a sudden, with those finger-like organic things vibrating strangely and making squishy sounds. I was surprised and scared, and I stumbled backwards, hitting the other side of the organic tunnel with my back. I immediately felt the slimy surface of the wall touching my back, and I was disgusted. Not even the steady sound of Jon\u00b4s heart beat could comfort me at that moment, when I was disgusted by the insides of his intestines, and afraid of never getting out of his body again. Even though I had to admit that his intestines were really a sight to behold. Just like his entire body, it was an awe inspiring sight, showing me the wonders of the human body in all its beauty, as well as its darker side...<br>\r\nAnyway, I did not know that stumbling against the intestinal wall was quite a bad move by me, but I should find out only seconds later.<br>\r\nSeconds after my back hit one of the villi of the intestinal wall, I suddenly felt a strange and incredibly powerful suction on my entire body. I realized too late that a single villus, and maybe even  the lacteal were bigger than even me, thus it was very well possible that this thing could suck me in through a small crack and send me into Jon\u00b4s bloodstream. That\u00b4s exactly what happened. Escaping the suction was impossible, due to its power and due to the fact that is happened so fast that I hardly even noticed what happened. In a matter of seconds, the sight of Jon\u00b4s intestines disappeared in front of my eyes as I was sucked through a crack in the lacteal on one of the villi. For a moment, I was covered in total and complete darkness as I was being transported toward my next destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut from then on, I was able to watch the most fascinating things a person could ever imagine, an experience I\u00b4d never forget and that was more pleasant than being inside Jon\u00b4s digestive tract.<br>\r\nAfter only a few seconds, the darkness vanished, and I was pushed into some strange, thick liquid entirely. As a reflex, my mouth closed immediately, and I tried not to breath, just like when you go underwater with your head. But my eyes were still opened, and my senses were still sharp, so I could see and feel where I was, and it is hard to describe how I felt when I realized, maybe a mix of awe and shock: I was truly inside Jon\u00b4s bloodstream! I just could not believe it as I found myself in this tube like system inside Jon, surrounded by a reddish liquid, with some strange boulder-like forms passing me, probably his red blood cells. Not only could I see that I was really inside Jon\u00b4s veins, I could also feel it as the blood was being transported through his veins really fast, and it was quite scary to see the walls of the tube passing my eyes. The speed was not my problem, though. As the entire tube was filled with a nearly endless amount of blood, it was impossible for me to breathe, and I could not hold my breath forever. <br>\r\nAnd the options were not too nice. I could have held my breath until my brain did not get enough oxygen anymore, or I could have opened my mouth again, but I was afraid of that, as either the blood could have entered my lungs or I could have simply suffocated. The moment I could no longer hold my breath came nearer, and it seemed like there was no escape this time.<br>\r\nBut things took a different turn. As I could not go on any longer and opened my mouth again, I did not suffocate. Not at all. Instead, I could breathe inside Jon\u00b4s bloodstream perfectly! My eyes were gazing at the insides of his bloodstream, in shock at the fact that I could survive in there as my body was transported even deeper into Jon\u00b4s body. But maybe I underestimated the amount of oxygen inside Jon\u00b4s blood, so maybe that was the solution - but even back then I knew that I was no genius when it came to biology or human anatomy. <br>\r\nSo with me surviving in there, I could fully enjoy this truly fantastic voyage into the depths of my friend\u00b4s body. It was absolutely amazing - I saw more of Jon than anyone else, and he had not the slightest idea that his best friend was exploring his insides at that moment. It really gave me some confidence again, as I was hoping for a way out of Jon\u00b4s body again. Heck, I was even looking forward to telling Kokoro about all this, that her boyfriend was on a journey through the body of his best friend and her co-worker. She would have been blown away by this! And Jon...well, I don\u00b4t know how he would have reacted. Maybe surprised, maybe amused that his shy friend was actually inside his body, or maybe even embarrassed, although that possibility was rather out of place - Jon was not someone who would get embarrassed like that. He would most likely congratulate me on going on such an amazing voyage and he would surely smile and find it ironic that the insides of HIS body were the first ever to be explored first hand by a person, and maybe he would even feel honored, and at least glad that it was me who had the pleasure of visiting his body from the inside, perhaps because of the great trust between us and our year long friendship. And he would apologize for everything I had to go through because of him unknowingly eating me. But of course I would never blame Jon for anything, as he was one of the two persons I trusted the most: it was himself as my best friend and Kokoro as my girlfriend. I would trust both with my life, and it looked like trusting Jon with my life would have a completely new meaning now...<br>\r\nAlthough I had no idea where Jon\u00b4s blood was taking me and I had of course no influence on its direction (even I can\u00b4t change the direction the blood is taking in veins and arteries...<img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/wink.png\" alt=\"*Wink*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">), there was an indicator for my next destination. The deeper I was being washed into his body, the louder his heart beat got. When I noticed that, my eyes widened at the thought were it could actually take me...Jon\u00b4s heart!  I have visited places I would have never even dreamed of seeing in my entire life - Jon\u00b4s mouth, his stomach, his intestines and his bloodstream. But..his heart would have been the icing on the cake, perhaps the most unbelievable place to be inside for me.<br>\r\nAnd indeed, as the beating of Jon\u00b4s heart was getting impossibly loud, I was being pushed into a gigantic chamber, compared to the already impressive size of Jon\u00b4s blood vessels. I knew that I was inside his heart now, and nothing can describe this feeling I had at that moment. Unfortunately, the speed with which the stream of blood entered his heart was considerable and had its effects on me, as the blood practically pushed me against a wall inside Jon\u00b4s heart. I hit the incredibly soft wall quite hard, and the moment I did, not only did I feel an incredible pain in my body due to the impact and despite the softness of the wall, but also, I could feel that Jon\u00b4s entire body seemed to be trembling suddenly, and it was getting quite bumpy for several seconds, as if he was running or even falling down. My impact on his heart\u00b4s walls also affected the rhythm of Jon\u00b4s heart beat, as it was not as steady as before for several seconds. I really felt bad, because I knew that Jon must have felt that. I realized that the rumbling outside must have been Jon\u00b4s reaction to the pain in his heart that happened to be caused by me, so maybe he really fell down onto the ground outside his body. The entire chamber of his heart was shaking and trembling, and with tears in my eyes I feared for Jon\u00b4s life, not for my own. Now that would have been just plain cynical: instead of Jon\u00b4s gigantic insides unknowingly killing me, something I had been afraid of for a long time, I would kill him unwittingly. Both thoughts were unbearable for me, but it seemed that I did not have to suffer from either, as the blood immediately transported me away from the organic, fleshy wall I hit and toward some strange seeming walls that was growing more and more apart, and then closing in on each other again, and I knew that this would lead me into his other heart chamber. As Jon\u00b4s heart regained its rhythm at least partially, my worries were now focused on this muscular walls parting and closing, sending blood from one part of his heart into another. I think you know that these walls could have easily crushed me, and so I had to fear for my life once again. Fortunately, I was able to get through the wall without too much trouble. <br>\r\nThe stream of blood slowed down shortly as the walls closed, so I was floating directly in front of the muscular membrane, truly an awe inspiring sight. As the walls were parting again, the blood shot into the other heart chamber that would eventually lead me into one of Jon\u00b4s arteries. But as the blood washed me through this amazing muscle of life, I saw another membrane coming closer and closer, and I knew this was the one that would lead me into Jon\u00b4s arteries. Unfortunately, the timing for me to approach the wall was not good, and I almost hit the walls when they were about to close. As I did not want to get crushed, I did my best in order to slow down, and to my relief, I hit the walls when they were closed again. But I was clinging with hands directly in the middle of the now closed membrane, and it looked like I overestimated my strength a tiny bit. Because I realized that the walls were trying to open again, but due to my hands gripping the fleshy walls tightly at the appropriate spots, they could not open properly, although it was trying to. I knew immediately that this would build up an incredible pressure in Jon\u00b4s heart, if not enough blood could not leave the heart as it should, and I was panicking again as his heart beat seemed to go out of control, with his life being at stake. Within the fraction of a second, I released the walls from my grip, and they immediately shut open, causing the stream of blood washing me out of his heart at last and into his coronary artery that runs over his heart structure. Although its function is reverse to that of the veins, the tube of Jon\u00b4s coronary artery looked much like that of his veins to me, still being surrounded by those wobbling, pinkish and organic walls and amidst a flow of blood. And somehow, all this was too much for me at that moment. I had seen more than enough of Jon\u00b4s body, more than I ever wanted to, so I decided to cling to the walls of his artery. I did not want to go on anymore. It all happened so fast, and I desperately needed a break. But even though I managed to get a good grip onto the soft walls, the streaming flow of blood was too strong, and I lost my grip onto the artery-wall as fast as I gained it, and I found myself being \"shot\" away from Jon\u00b4s heart, not knowing where my journey would take me now. All I saw was this endless tube of muscular flesh I was trapped inside, and I imagined how cool it normally would have seemed to me to travel through Jon\u00b4s entire body like that. Then I suddenly felt in what direction the blood was flowing, as the tube was being crooked and I was shot upwards. So the blood was flowing into an upper part of Jon\u00b4s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the sake of my sanity, I closed my eyes during the remaining time of my journey through his bloodstream, as being exposed to the same sight of the tube all the time was making me nervous. I only listened to the loud flow of Jon\u00b4s blood and his heart beat that was steady again, and it comforted me a bit. I was still hoping for this adventure at least to slow down, as I was tired of being threatened all the time by all kinds of dangers outside and now inside Jon\u00b4s body, and virtually no minute has passed without my life being in danger. Letting myself flow through Jon\u00b4s bloodstream and being safe at least for a while really was kinda relieving...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut only moments later, it almost seemed as if the bloodstream spat me out. I felt my body being pushed out of the reddish liquid of his blood and onto a soft ground. As I had my eyes closed, I did not see how it happened, but I noticed to my joy that everything here was dry again, yet I was wondering where the heck I was. As the sudden expel from the bloodstream has been quite powerful, I hit a soft ground, and when I stood up and opened my eyes again, I gasped in awe at my new environment. I was surrounded by grayish, soft (as the ground indicated) flesh, with strange flashes flying through the chamber to some strange cords of flesh dangling down from the ceiling. I did not even have to think long about where I was now. This sight told me that this place could only be Jon\u00b4s more than complex brain (after all, he was a genius), with those flashes being neural impulses transporting certain informations from one part of his brain to another. Although I thought it could not get more amazing than being inside the heart, I had to reconsider as I saw a living brain working, and the fact that it was my best friend\u00b4s brain made it just more intriguing to me.<br>\r\nAnd as I looked in front of me, I saw two enormous holes where light of the outside streams into the chamber of Jon\u00b4s brain. At last a window to the outside world, although I always imagined the anatomy of the human body to be different, but now that I almost saw Jon\u00b4s entire insides, I knew what things looked like in there. Walking a bit closer toward his eyes over the squishy ground, I saw something that looked like the door to his apartment through his eyes, realizing in surprise that he must have left his apartment for a short while during my journey through his system. What surprised me even more was the fact that I could hear Jon\u00b4s voice as he said something to himself.<br>\r\n\"What was that all about?\" his voice could be heard, and I chuckled as I realized that he was referring to the results of my stay inside his heart earlier. Looks like Jon could really feel something in there, and his life might have been in danger because of that. Jokingly, I said to myself some sort of answer to Jon\u00b4s words as he opened the door to his apartment.<br>\r\n\"It was about me nearly killing you.\" I calmly said with a smile that expressed disbelief.<br>\r\n\"Julian, was that you?\"<br>\r\nMy smile disappeared as quickly as it came across my face. Now, my eyes seemed to pop out my head when I heard Jon reacting to my sentence. He...he could hear me?!<br>\r\nBefore I could really grasp the meaning of this moment, I was being thrown around as the chamber of his brain seemed to shift due to Jon turning his head to the left and then to the right, probably searching for me in his apartment.<br>\r\nAs this sudden move came to a stop, I was still lying on the ground after I\u00b4d been thrown onto it. That was just perfect. Jon was able to hear my voice from this position! Now all I had to was trying to get in contact with him, and maybe he could find a way to take me out of his body and make me grow again! At least I was sure I\u00b4d be safe under Jon\u00b4s protection, so I immediately attempted to talk with him properly. It was going to be shocking for him to hear about me being inside his body, but I had no choice. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even though the best case scenario has transpired, which means that Jon was obviously able to hear me perfectly, the situation remained complicated to say the least. I knew exactly that he was quite confused at that moment...hearing his best friend\u00b4s voice, seeming to come out of nowhere - or from inside his head, maybe...<br>\r\nNot even that. Even if I was able to talk to him properly, how could I tell him that I was inside his body? That was something so incredible - even for Jon - that it was hard to believe to say the least. If I really told him that he swallowed me earlier, after I took that stupid pill from Doc, and that I went on a fantastic voyage through his body afterwards, ending up inside his impressive brain, getting in contact with him and trying to get his help in order to get out of his body...I did not know how he would react to something that incredible. Sure, Jon had experienced all kinds of weird things where he works, and even though most of the projects were top-secret there, he trusted me enough to tell me about things like dimensional travels or highly advanced robots that seemed too far fetched even for our time, so...his best friend being trapped deep within his body might not have been that shocking for him. But still, we\u00b4re talking about something we only know from fictional tales by Isaac Asimov or Joe Dante, and as a scientist, he might have been proud of being the first person ever to host an endonaut. Maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut these were just possible scenarios, and I quickly stopped considering them. There was only one thing I could do: talking to Jon and trying to explain how I ended up here, and begging him to help me. Of course, begging was by far too strong as a term. He was my best friend, after all, and I certainly did not ask him for help. Jon would help me immediately when he knew that I was in danger. Jon was a good hearted person, perhaps the nicest person I ever encountered next to Kokoro, so I had no doubt that he would help me without hesitation. So, looking around in his brain and watching the processes of information being transported to various parts of his brain, I sighed deeply and spoke his name once again.<br>\r\n\"Jon...\" I said loud enough for him to hear.<br>\r\nJon\u00b4s reaction to my newest attempt of talking to him was quite complex, so to speak, as I could hear him sighing deeply (and I could very well imagine his inhalation and exhalation), followed by a sudden move of him. The chamber of Jon\u00b4s brain began to shake slightly as he began to spin around, an \"event\" I could witness through his eyes, as I was able to spot certain parts of his apartment flashing in front of my eyes, until he came to a stop in his original position. It was indeed quite ironic to see the outside world through his eyes...interesting, fascinating AND ironic. Seeing the world through someone else\u00b4s eyes in such a literal way, an experience one would always hold in high regard when looking back at it, especially when you\u00b4re seeing the world through your best friend\u00b4s eyes. It actually makes you think about your own existence, making you respect life even more. Then, of course, it was ironic because the outside I desperately wanted to reach seemed so near through his eyes yet so far aways, because of his body surrounding and trapping me inside him.<br>\r\n\"Okay, that time, I know I heard you, so I know I\u00b4m either hearing things, which is entirely possible, but it is not something I believe I\u00b4d do, and besides if I start believing it then I have to accept my insanity. Or one of a dozen other possibilities.\" Jon\u00b4s rather calm voice (that appeared to be kinda forced to me) could be heard, and I chuckled slightly. Oh Jon...I really did confuse him, something that does not happen every day. If there is a person who always remains calm and is not easily confused at all, then it\u00b4s Jon. So hearing my voice without seeing me must have been even more unusual then it sounds. But then again, despite the possible confusion, there\u00b4s was Jon\u00b4s typical way of rationalizing things, staying calm and not panicking, probably trying to search for a logical and scientific reason for this phenomenon. Only this time, the answer would be...well, flabbergasting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, the first possibility is that you\u00b4re dead and you\u00b4re speaking to me from beyond the Veil that separates the the living from the dead, is that it?\" he asked, and my eyes almost popped out with amazement. I would have not exactly expected that Jon would even consider me being dead and having reached the afterlife, speaking to him from this wondrous place...first of all, I was surprised to hear that Jon was talking about life after death and me getting in contact with him from the dead - that somehow went against everything he believed in, in science, even though it was more than possible that he could put his faith in an almighty God and science alike. Btu most likely, he was just asking this question out of a lack of logical possibilities.<br>\r\nSmiling slightly, I gave my answer, trying to sound as plain and clear as possible.<br>\r\n\"No.\" I said, and I could feel another slight movement of his head, an upside-down movement as he nodded. Fortunately, it did not cause me to fall down, I just wished that he would stop moving his head like that for once, as it was getting quite annoying. Oh well, he could not know that I was inside him at that moment...<br>\r\n\"Good, because that would have been a first for me, and besides, I really disliked the movie \"The Sixth Sense\", and hearing dead people talk would get boring after a while. The next possibility is that you\u00b4re in some kind of alternate dimension, which is parallel to the one we normally inhabit that allows you somehow to speak, yet at the same time I am unable to see you.\" he now proposed. I just shook my head, a bit amused about this far fetched possibility he came up with. Talking to him from the afterlife...talking to him from another dimension...honestly, talking to him from inside his body did not even sound that far fetched and incredible anymore next to these scenarios. But...mentioning The Sixth Sense and even talking about it? Looks like the poor guy really was more confused than I thought. Of course I did not want to upset my friend that much, and soon, the mystery would be solved, anyway.<br>\r\n\"That\u00b4s not it, either.\" I answered, and to my dismay, his answer came post haste, as Jon began to shake his head, really fast and powerful for my dimension, and as the image of his brain was becoming blurred due to his head\u00b4s movement, I found myself being lifted up to the ground and thrown through the air several meters until landing on the soft ground of his brain again (by the way, from a strange point of view, his brain seemed even quite comfortable to me, at least more comfortable than his heart or his digestive tract, as my life was not in danger for a change...), which fortunately did not really hurt, but made me wonder whether he was able to feel it. Soon, he would certainly come to the conclusion that I was inside him, as he was running out of far fetched yet semi-realistic possibilities...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, suddenly, as I was looking through Jon\u00b4s eyes, I noticed that his body was moving downwards, and I felt this even inside his head slightly, and it was not hard to realize that he was sitting down in his chair, judging from his motion and the position inside his apartment (which I knew well enough to tell that he was sitting in his chair now). Of course I did not yet realize that this was because he had discovered the awful truth of my whereabouts...<br>\r\nWhen I heard his voice now, I was so relieved that hardly anyone could imagine.<br>\r\n\"Julian, tell me you\u00b4re not shrunk and in my head.\" he said. Bingo, he said it, he found the solution to the question of where on earth my voice was coming from. He probably realized it when he felt an unusual bump inside his head, caused by me. At last!<br>\r\nBut Jon really sounded depressed when he said these words, unable to believe what was obviously going on, and unable to believe that his best friend was inside him. I did not answer, knowing that a lack of comments by me would tell him that what he said was true.<br>\r\n\"Man, I\u00b4m sorry about earlier, when I ate you, at least I think that bug on my sandwich was you. Did I hurt you in any way?\" he then asked, sounding concerned about me, and it was clear to me that he really was sorry about what he did. Just like I would have expected it from my best friend. But I was not able to answer right away, because the words he said were combined with so many memories of my recent past that it kinda overwhelmed me...when he swallowed me practically on purpose...when I was traveling along with his blood through his veins and arteries...it was still a bit too fresh as a memory, so I needed some time to calm down and come up with an appropriate answer...<br>\r\nAnd even though his concern about me being hurt by him was really nice, it just seemed a bit cynical to me...but that was unimportant. Jon knew where I was and accepted it as the truth, and that would make my future shine brighter...although I was not sure whether he would really accept my presence inside him as a fact like that, whether he would not be a bit upset because of it, because of his worries about me. But time would tell.</span></div></div>",

After all, crabs and lobsters are just very big lice, so all I was doing was fine dining on a very small scale,\" I responded, getting up from the seat I was in and looking around. I saw nothing that could have been a shrink ray anywhere on the floor, as I began to look any place where Julian could have dropped in my living, being careful to keep my own head as level as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, what are you doing?\" he asked from within me, and standing up and taking one last look around I sighed in defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking for whatever it was that shrank you. I assumed it would be some kind of ray base, but I don't see anything on the floor, so it must have shrank with you, right?\" I asked and he's silent for a few moment, probably trying to remember what it was that shrank him, or just as likely, still getting used to the fact that I accepted his shrunken nature as fact without any kind of fight against it at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, actually I swallowed a pill to cause me to shrink, so I guess it was some kind of shrinking potion or something,\" he told me, but I shook my head, knowing that it couldn't be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shrinking potions take time, as it cycles with the body's natural systems, and you wouldn't have shrunk by more than an inch a day until you reached this level. No, if it was pill then it had to be a kind of nanobot colony, specifically designed to compact the information contained inside your cells into their current reduced state,\" I told him, and he was silent again, but this time only for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to know an awful lot about shrinking,\" he stated, not as a question, but just as fact, and I lightly nodded my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course I do, didn't Kokoro ever tell you about the incidents when we were in school when this happened?\" I asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she never even told me you two went to school together,\" he answered, and I paused, wondering for a moment why Ko wouldn't have mentioned the incidents, not to mention our previous experiences together, and also if it was my right to tell him about it, but then I realized the Ko probably hadn't told him for the very fact that he likely wouldn't have believed it was possible. After all this was all science fiction, and besides, it was school, and people often didn't like to talk about that period in their lives, it being one of the most isolating and judgmental.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we did. Back then my last name was Alabaster, which wasn't my real last name, it was one I chose when I entered the school. Ko's name I can't remember, but then back then we didn't hang out too much, as my specialty was bio mechanical engineering and her's was quantum mechanics, two fields that don't often meet,\" I began, walking over to the wall of my apartment and pressing in on what looked to be just another piece of paneling. Nothing happened for a long moment as my hand just sat there, though behind the wall scanners were working silently to determine if I was me, and as it finally confirmed that fact a small section of the wall slid away, and a keyboard and chair popped out, creating an almost exact replica of my work station up at the plant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, one year I was working on a bio electric program that could take control of any system it came into contact with, as part of my midterm, problem is the thing developed into an EI, or Emergent Intelligence, which is kind of like AI, but EIs are much more stable mentally, and have no limits placed upon their growth. Problem with this one was it saw its ability as being godlike, and it tried to take over a few missile silos. We stopped it of course, and supposedly deleted every trace of it,\" I explained as the monitor of the station, revealed when the paneling slid away, flashed to life with the company logo, a capital S and T in a star burst, with a background message that was the motto, \u2018Where Dreams become Reality, and Reality become a Dream'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what does this have to do with shrinking?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was getting to that. You see about four months later the cafeteria at the school served some really strange sandwiches, red and green filling stuff. Now, nothing happened just after eating them, but the next day those of us who ate the green stuff woke up at only a sixteenth of an inch tall,\" I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that sounds worse than mine actually. At least I knew what shrank me,\" he said, and I nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was. I myself got eaten more than once during that day, as part of breakfast, lunch, and dinner for some of the students. Interestingly enough the one who ate me with her breakfast just happened to be Kokoro, and let me tell you she's not really nearly as lovely on the inside when her stomachs trying to turn you into nutrients for her body. My guess is that you didn't get digested because the nanobots prevent any change of that nature from happening to you,\" I continued, waiting for the system to load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, the next day I was able to figure out that HAVOC, the EI from before, was behind it and had used his power to create a kind of bio-electric signal that shrank us, and after some deductive reasoning I was able to figure out he was hiding himself inside the body of a lion kept in the biology lab. After sneaking into his food I was able to use a blade to cut my way to the lion's heart from its stomach, though then he was then able to expel me, and it was only because of one young girl's bravery that the world didn't end up slaves to a bio-electrical program. She sacrificed herself to save us, even though she'd been helping HAVOC with his plans earlier. She saved us all, and yet I still don't know her name,\" I told him, feeling another bit of regret. The entire incident had been covered up, and the girl wiped from existence, so I would never find out her name, but I would always remember her face as she gave her life to save us all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After that the school was quiet for a while, and then some idiot used my computer logs to recreate HAVOC's shrink program, and he ended up getting a full ride through my insides thanks to that. He was only lucky I'd altered the program so he didn't digest, although he got out through the back door, and that was nowhere near pleasant for either of us,\" I told him, and at last the screen came up with my desktop. Typing quickly I accessed the QC's scanners and searched my apartment for some kind of electrical field in my body, finding an anomalous reading inside my own brain, and then extrapolating from it the language used by the nanobots inside Julian. Finding the routines that caused them to shrink him was a simple matter, and in a moment I had reprogrammed them so that they would cause Julian to grow back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, prepare to get big again,\" I told him, and was about to hit the execute button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wait!\" he shouted, and I covered my ears instinctively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" I asked, startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it a bad idea for me to grow while still inside your head?\" he asked, and I realized he was right, and laughed in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, you may have a point there. But, if you are in my brain, then if I just tilt my head to the side you sound fall out my auditory canal, and I can hit execute as you leave,\" I said, and before he could object I acted on my idea, listening to the scream as he fell downward. Slowly the scream got more and more distant, and then, with a final shout I knew he was out, and instantly pressed the enter button on my terminal, and got an earful of a full grown Julian crying out in panic as he slammed into the floor of my apartment with a dull thunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now, was that an interesting way to spend a few minutes, or what?\" I asked him, holding out my hand to help him up off the floor.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>How meaningless words can be sometimes...just like at that moment, when my nightmare finally ended and my life returned back to normal in a matter of seconds. Well, actually, not exactly. Even though I was my old self again, if you will, I was still shocked because of what happened to me in such a short amount of time, and of course because of the more than sudden circumstances of my growth back to my normal size. Being thrown out of Jon\u00b4s brain in less than a second and eventually falling down his auditory canal and out of his ear certainly was too sudden and dangerous for me to perceive, hence I felt that my whole body was still shaking in fear as I was lying there on the ground, back again in Jon\u00b4s apartment, with my friend towering above me on a normal scale again, thankfully. At least I did not have to be afraid of him stomping on me or eating me by accident anymore. Actually, I\u00b4ve seen enough of his insides, and I had absolutely no intentions of letting myself getting swallowed again like that and relive this admittedly amazing and most fascinating, yet exhausting, scary and somewhat disturbing experience.<br>\r\nI honestly still don\u00b4t know how exactly Jon felt back then when he was eaten by Kokoro, as he had told me just moments ago, and I don\u00b4t know how he was handling this unusual situation, but judging from his personality, he probably took it a lot easier than I did with my first voyage into a fellow human being. As Jon was kind enough to offer me his hand in order to help me getting up from the ground again, I slightly shuddered when I saw his hand directly in front of my eyes that were trying to adjust to the light of the outside world again, as it appeared to be really huge for a fraction of a second, until my eyes began working properly again.<br>\r\nAt long last, I managed to raise my right hand and let Jon\u00b4s left hand grab it, and with that he helped me to get up again, and soon I was on my feet again. But as he saw me standing there, still holding on to his hand, he obviously realized that I was exhausted from my fantastic voyage, and in a typical \"best-of-pals\" manner, he put his arm around my shoulder, being the good old buddy he is.<br>\r\n\"I\u00b4m sorry about all this. Believe me, I understand what it must have been like. I can relate.\"<br>\r\n\"It\u00b4s...it\u00b4s alright. It\u00b4s not...your fault...\" I stuttered, trying to answer. How could I possibly blame Jon, anyway? He had no idea that he was eating his best friend earlier, and even though this happened to him in the past already, according to what he told me, it\u00b4s still a most unusual and weird situation that does not happen every day to say the least, so one cannot not expect him to consider the fact that his best friend  could have ended up in his meal every time he\u00b4s about to take a bite. Knowing him, he was terribly sorry about what happened in any case, and that was already enough for me. He is the kind of person who cares about others and especially about his friends, and he would never want anything bad to happen to me, he would try to prevent the worst instead. He has given me proof for his honesty as well as how seriously he takes our friendship numerous times, for example whenever he was encouraging me to talk to Kokoro or invite her for dinner, which paid off in the end. He probably always knew that I sometimes lack the courage to talk to girls, and that I am more of a shy person in general, so it was only natural for him to help me with Kokoro not only by encouraging me, but also by arranging dinners and meetings for me and my beautiful Japanese girlfriend. And...how could I have been angry at him, my best friend who\u00b4s like a brother to me? I wanted to forget about that incident as quickly as possible, anyway, so it was no use thinking about it.<br>\r\nBut despite my happiness about having survived this trip of a lifetime, there was a painful sensation inside me that still remained, probably because of my journey out of Jon\u00b4s ear as well as the after-effects of my other adventures inside Jon\u00b4s body.<br>\r\n\"Well...I suppose you better lay down on my couch for a while.\" Jon then said, seeing how I was still trembling.<br>\r\n\"Yes...thank you...\"<br>\r\nJust as I answered him, his phone began ringing all out of a sudden, coming from the kitchen.<br>\r\n\"Well, you\u00b4ll just lay down there, I\u00b4ll answer the call, alright?\" he said as I sat down on the comfortable couch that had appeared as a gigantic mountain to me during my shrinkage, laying down on my back and covering my face with the palm of my right hand. I let out a deep sigh, being glad that my horrible predicament was finally over but still thinking about all those events that had transpired. With my hand still gently put on my face, I realized that I was kinda tired as I began to yawn.<br>\r\n\"Oh boy...what a day...\" I whispered to myself.<br>\r\n\"I\u00b4m wondering what Kokoro would say if I told her about all this...\" I then whispered with a slight smile on my face, having the image of my beautiful girlfriend before my inner eye. I was yearning for the moment I\u00b4d see her again, especially after this mess. I would gently put my arms around her and tenderly kiss her on her soft cheeks...the girl I love more than anyone else. She would give me the strength to recover from this experience very quickly, I was 100% sure about that.<br>\r\nSwooning over my lovely girlfriend, I paid no heed to Jon answering the phone call, and I only removed my hand from my face and looked at him as he entered his living room again, with one hand suspiciously behind his back.<br>\r\n\"Who was it?\" I asked him curiously.<br>\r\n\"Oh, it was Ko.\"<br>\r\n\"Kokoro? What did she want?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, believe it or not, but she invited us to go on a double date with her and Chris.\"<br>\r\n\"Chris...Christie? Oh, yes, I remember...a nice girl, honestly. Is it...well, serious between you and her?\"<br>\r\n\"Wait and see.\" he just said with a grin, and I knew that was all I could get out of him at that moment. Even though something told me that Christie could be the right girl for Jon. She was beautiful, smart and very nice, and she and Jon shared quite some interests and hobbies, something that would certainly not be a problem in their relationship. I just wished that he would finally find a girl that was worthy of being the partner of this outstanding person who happened to be my best friend. That he would find the same luck in her that I found in Kokoro.<br>\r\n\"Anyway, when and where are we going to dine?\" I then asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, Ko said that we would meet next week on Wednesday in that French restaurant, \"Le Cuisse de Grenouille D\u00e9licieux\", even though she said that she doesn\u00b4t know exactly at what time we\u00b4ll go there.\"<br>\r\n\"Ah, pas mal, je pense qu\u00b4il sera un soir amusant et romantique! Erh, sorry, my French must have gotten a little rusty...\"<br>\r\n\"...never mind...\" he just said with a slight smile.<br>\r\n\"Uh, by the way...are you hiding something?\" I then asked, clearly looking at the hand behind his back, and it looked like he was holding something.<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh no, of course not...I was just wondering whether you would happen to be kinda...hungry after your trip?\" he said with an ironic smile in his face as he revealed what he has been hiding behind his back: a plate, with a half-eaten piece of steak between two slices of bread, along with some steak sauce. And honestly, my jaw began to drop literally as I realized immediately that this was what remained from the steak Jon had eaten earlier...with me as some sort of extra-ingredient. Just thinking about the fact there were still parts of the steak inside his digestive tract at that moment, and that I could have been among this pile of goo almost drove me mad, and I quickly jumped off his couch.<br>\r\n\"You...!\" I shouted, standing in front of him now.<br>\r\n\"Hey, relax, Julian.\" he calmly said as he took a bite from that steak he obviously had taken out of the refriegerator.<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm...not bad, even though it tasted better when you were on it...gnat!\" he then said while still chewing, having a hard time not to laugh. Even though I was understandably upset about his cynical sense of humor, I had to admit that it was kinda interesting to see that he originally thought that it was a gnat inside his mouth earlier instead of his shrunken, microscopic friend...<br>\r\nBefore I could even say a word, he then put his left hand onto my right shoulder, still holding the plate in his right hand.<br>\r\n\"Sorry bout that one, Julian. But don\u00b4t worry, something tells me that next time we\u00b4re dining, you won\u00b4t end up inside my stomach.\" he then said with a delighted grin, and somehow, I could not be angry at him. In fact, I was kinda amused myself, and I just had to smile slightly about his comment. Next time we\u00b4re dining...that would be the double date between Christie and Jon as well as Kokoro and me. But that\u00b4s a whole other story...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFIN</span></div></div>",

Is this all just a nightmare? ...I would soon learn the one answer to all my questions: NO!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH-OFF!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there I was: the humoungous reddish chamber filled with strange-colored water and weird openings breathing in and out.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> This evening I expected to ether be watching a movie at home with my girlfriend or studying for the big English test on Wednesday, but mostly I expected to be hanging with Jon. Being the size of a piece of lint in the middle of my best friends apartment was not something I expected to happen. How it happened was something that I couldn\u2019t tell you, what happened before is crystal clear. I had stopped by to see if Jon had gotten off work so we could hang out. When I knocked on his front door and no one answered, I thought that maybe he crashed on the couch after a long day at work. Using the spare key he\u2019d given me, I unlocked the door and went in search of him. To my disappointment, I found nether hide nor hair of my elusive friend. Bummed out at the thought of him being stuck at work, I decided to surprise him by welcoming him home when he got off work. Resting on his couch, I got myself comfortable and started feeling sleepy. I usually don\u2019t take naps, but I felt like I\u2019d been awake for two days and was on the verge of collapsing. I don\u2019t remember falling asleep, but I do remember waking up and finding that the world had changed around me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up, stretched, smacked my lips and looked around me, what I saw floored me. I was standing on a football field sized leather mountain. I don\u2019t know what most people would think in this situation, but my first thought was, \u2018what a cool dream\u2019. Studying what I thought was my dream surroundings, I took one step on the couch and then another. Normally my body would sink in to the comfy leather seating of Jon\u2019s couch, but I was so weightless that my body didn\u2019t make dent in the spongy seating.   I must have taken an hour to walk from one cushion to the next and by the time I reached the other side, I was convinced that this was a rotten dream. Nothing interesting was happened, besides the shrinking, where as all the excitement and intrigue that came from a dream. I had grown tired of this dream and decided to end it, it took a second to decide that I might as well end this dream with a little bit of excitement and I knew just the way to do it. The next thing I did might seem stupid to some, however you must understand, I was convinced this was a dream and nothing can hurt me. With that in mind, I tried to sky dive off the couch without a parachute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeronimo!\u201d I cried as I leaped into the air, arms wide open and nothing but air underneath me. It felt like I was falling forever, the couch zoomed by me as I fell to the floor. I think it was when the ground was a few feet away, that I really considered the possibility that this wasn\u2019t a dream. I expected the impact to hurt a lot more then it did, it certainly didn\u2019t kill me, but it sure did convince me that this was no dream. With a groan and a grunt, I returned to my feet and dusted myself off. When I looked up at the couch, I couldn\u2019t see where I had jumped from at this distance. I knew I should have been a tiny splat on the floor, but somehow I wasn\u2019t. Shrugging of the inexplicable miracle, I did what any tiny man would do in this type of situation, I walked. <br>\r\nOne thought kept recurring to me as I walked away from the couch and towards the door, Jon can help. He\u2019d always been there for me when I needed him and he was someone I could count on always. I kept reminding myself of that while sweat dripped down my face and into my eyes. My journey from Jon\u2019s living room felt like an eternity. I\u2019d keep looking at the door in the far distance and knowing that I needed to reach it. If Jon saw me when he opened the door, I\u2019d be saved. If not then I could be lost forever the next time he vacuums. I wondered if this was how people lost in the desert felt; disoriented and alone, with no idea what will happen next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the third hour, the vibrations hit. It felt like an earthquake, shaking my whole body and sending me tumbling to the ground. My teeth were rattled in my skull from the shaking and I had to keep my head covered from keeping it from convulsing around. I thought for sure that the ground was going to open up and I\u2019d start falling. And then it stopped. I heard the sound of keys jingling, followed by the lock shifting. I looked at the front door and gapped as it swung open and Jon stepped in. I couldn\u2019t be a hundred percent sure it was him because his head disappeared somewhere above his shoulders. I gazed up at him, trying to see his face over a mile above me. It was while I was looking that he started walking towards me, the vibrations knocked me down again and I scrambled to get back up. This was my one chance and I wasn\u2019t going to blow it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJON! JON! DOWN HERE, JON!\u201d I screamed up at him. I kept screaming even as he walked over me and headed for the kitchen. And just like that, I collapsed to my knees. Maybe it was from the hiking I\u2019d done or the emotional impact finally hitting me, whatever it was, it made me want to curl into the fetal position and stay that way for hours. I had been right in front of him and he walked by me like I was nothing, a speck, an trivial bug. Some how being overlooked hurt worse then the shrinking.      <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's also an interesting tale in any case, and was a lot of fun to write.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this is it?\" asked Chris as we drove up to the entrance of the restaurant where we would be meeting Julian and Kokoro in about ten minutes. The four of us had arranged this date kind of on the fly, true to tell, and only because Ko, who had some connection with the owner of the establishment, had been able to snag a set of reservations that had been canceled just the other day, whereas normally it would have taken several weeks just to get on the list of people waiting to get on the list for making reservations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so. Never been a fan of this kind of food myself,\" I admitted as we pulled up to the door. Two young men waited there and one of them opened her door while I got out of the driver's seat and the other held out his hand. Recognizing him as a valet I handed him my keys to the car wrapped up in a ten spot, which gave him a grin as he slid into the seat without a word, driving off towards the parking complex just a little ways off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right this way, lady and gentleman,\" said the other man as he walked us over to the door, opening it for us, and I handed him a five as I walked past him, not sure if I was supposed to or not, but he seemed to like it as he pocketed the bill and then smiled at me, pointing me over to an elderly man sitting behind a podium. In the man's hands was a sheet and a pad, obviously the guests list for tonight and I couldn't help but feel out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine at least owned a dress and was looking like a lady of finery, while myself, in a form fitting suit that, to the unassuming eye looked like spandex, but was in fact a special polymer mesh, looked like some kind of bum. Still I wasn't about to act like this bothered me outwardly, after all, this suit was probably more expensive than most of the ones that the other people around us were wearing, and even if they didn't know it, I did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reservation?\" asked the gentleman behind the podium, and I nodded a bit, wondering whose name it was under before deciding to just act like I knew it and hope that worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kokoro, a party of four,\" I told him, and the man opened his left eye a crack, looking the two of us up and down for a moment, judging us and obviously not liking the way I looked, but upon inspection of his list he tilted his head and then turned around, walking towards a table near the back that got it's own little alcove near the kitchen. Still not saying anything he laid four different billfolds which I took to be menus of some sort on the table before walking away, flickering his head in a snobbish gesture at me as he walked past. Ignoring that as best I could I pulled out Chris' seat and offered it too her, she giggled and curtsied once before taking the chair and sitting in it as I pulled out the one to her left and sat down beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ko said Julian and she would be a little late, but they should be here in five minutes or so. That should give us time to order some wine. Kokoro already told me the kind she and Julian wanted,\" she said as she opened the billfold and revealed that instead of listing foods it listed types of wine along with dates after them. Seeing the action I mimed it and less than a minute later a boy came up to us and tapped his pen on a blank piece of paper atop a writing pad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what drinks would you be having this evening?\" asked the boy, and Chris ordered something which I could pronounce at all, and then made two more selection, pointing towards the seats of our friends across the table, and then when the boy turned to me I decided to order a nice cabernet for myself, which got me a look from the boy that I tried to ignore. Then looking across the table at Chris I smiled, and together we waited for Julian and Kokoro to show up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I am quite convinced that everyone knows those events you are eagerly looking forward because they are bound to be fun and to become a nice, lovely memory in the end, an experience that you are able to look on fondly and with a certain feeling of nostalgia. <br>\r\nBut at the same time, I guess that everyone knows the contrary of these promising events. Events you might be looking forward to, but that turn out to be completely different from your expectations. Now, whether that\u00b4s good or bad depends on the circumstances, but rest assured that on that day I am going to tell you about, things really did take a different turn from my expectations, to say the least, \"allowing\" me to relive one of the craziest and most amazing experiences of my entire life once again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all started one week after my most peculiar shrinking accident that brought me quite into some predicaments and eventually inside my best pal Jon, which made me feel like a micronaut, if you will...or like Dennis Quaid in that \"Innerspace\" flick. With the considerable difference in my case being that the person whose body I was trapped inside was not some paranoid jerk (or Martin Short, to be precise...), but much rather a most respectable, extremely intelligent, calm and strong person, someone I am proud to call a best friend of mine. And one week after my amazing journey throughout Jon\u00b4s body (a trip I am glad I was able to survive...), it was of course still hard to believe that all this really happened to me, and to be perfectly honest, I still wasn\u00b4t so sure what to think of it. It certainly was quite a scary and intimidating voyage, no doubts there, and at several points I thought I was gonna die inside my best friend, a situation too cynical to be put into mere words. But then again...this journey wasn\u00b4t just the equivalent of a nightmare come true in the most horrible way imaginable. No, it was also a more than intriguing and fascinating trip to places hardly anyone has ever seen with his or her own eyes before from this direct angle, if you will, and it was more than amazing to see my best friend from the inside - even though, admittedly, I would have preferred to see my beloved Kokoro from the inside...but hey, if you go onto a shrinking adventure and wind up inside the body of a good friend, you cannot really choose who it\u00b4s gonna be, you know...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, speaking of ma belle Kokoro, this brings me to the beginning of another adventure, an adventure that once again involved my friend Jon and me...an adventure I like to describe as a dej\u00e0 vu in cruel way and a completely new experience all at the same time. You will see.<br>\r\nOne must say that Kokoro is not just an extremely beautiful, smart and kind hearted girl. No, it\u00b4s also pretty obvious that she is from a family with a high social status...after all, she was able to arrange an evening at one of the most expensive fancy-schmancy restaurants one can think of with a french name that implied that the proprietors don\u00b4t expect their guests to speak french that well - one of those cliched restaurants with the stereotypical arrogant french waiter - for Jon, his girlfriend Christine (and to my joy, it seemed like Christine really seemed to be the perfect match for Jon, as she was not only pretty, but also quite witty and intelligent, just like Jon himself...I was really hoping for the two to get together, since Jon really deserved such a wonderful girlfriend, being a wonderful person himself), Kokoro herself...well, and me, of course. According to Jon, it was pretty much a surprise that some normal-Joes like us were able to be put onto the list for this evening, but as I already mentioned, Kokoro\u00b4s family was one of the most highly regarded in Japan, with her ancestors having been members of an old dynasty that brought forth some tennos (tenno is the Japanese term for their Emperor) over the centuries, and nowadays, her father was the CEO of a highly influential conglomerate of electronic-enterprises, making her practically one of the richest girls in Japan. Which makes it all the more peculiar to see that Kokoro is working here in the United States together with Jon at an almost sci-fi like company. Even more amazing is the fact that someone as remarkable as her...chose someone as insignificant as me to be her boyfriend. Sometimes, I am still wondering how I got so lucky, why fate allowed me to be together with the girl I fell in love with the moment I first saw her. Perhaps it is true that there are some girls in this world who are able to look behind mere appearances and see true beauty in its purest form: kindness, kindness I\u00b4ve shown toward Kokoro to the best of my abilities...and sometimes in a rather clumsy way that Kokoro obviously still liked a lot, judging from her cute giggles I sometimes got as an answer, followed by a hug that words would only fail to describe...\"amazing\" would be an understatement, in any case.<br>\r\nAnd of course I knew somehow that Jon was the mastermind behind our first meeting, that he arranged it because he must have seen that the two of us would be the perfect couple - at least in his opinion. And that\u00b4s...that\u00b4s why I will always be thankful for what he did for me. And that\u00b4s why I was not in the least bit angry at Jon when he accidentally swallowed me when I was so small, not after all he did for me; after all the proof for being the best friend I ever had, almost like a big brother I was never fortunate enough to have...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note to Sage: you may already continue if you want to. I will probably add a small paragraph about Kokoro\u00b4s and my walk through the park and to the restaurant, but it won\u00b4t influence your next chapter in any way, so feel free to add!)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So, how was Kokoro last time you saw her?\" I asked Chris as we sat together, practically alone in the room. All around us were tables with people of course, but at a restaurant like this one that meant there was almost a full four meters between tables, and sometimes more than that. No one could overhear us by accident, and I was not so paranoid as to believe we were being followed every minute of every day, though I wouldn't put it past some of the people who worked against my employers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was fine. A little down that her latest project flopped, but Julian cheered her up pretty quickly. I hear he got her roses and chocolates because he thought he'd done something wrong, and that had set her to laughing all night long,\" said Chris with a chuckle as she looked towards the door, her eyes focusing in such a way that they seemed to be looking through the door, which they were in fact doing, though no one within several miles at least would understand how she was doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're coming now. I see Kokoro got the boy into a tux at least. She's probably going to give me at least a little grief over seeing you in your work clothes,\" commented Chris as she reached under her plate, and withdrew a menu it had been sitting on top of, a setting that made the table appear to have even more room than it already did, which it already had quite a lot of, truth to tell, the four of us going to easily fit on it so long as we kept out orders below seven plates each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know how I look in a tux. Remember the Spirits' Day Festival Office Party last year?\" I asked her, and she smiled at me, able to recall exactly what I had looked like. The suit had fit perfectly of course, after all it had been tailored specifically for me, but that had not stopped me from feeling confined in it and I ended up spending most of the night adjusting my collar and other activities, to the point that one of the company heads had asked me to dance with him, which had proven to be the highlight of the evening, as he turned out to be an excellent dancer, for a anthromorph anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shush,\" she admonished me as Kokoro and Julian entered the establishment, Kokoro almost glowing in her dress, even more radiant than usual, which was quite a feat considering the Japanese Princess was among the most beautiful women I knew, which said a lot more than it seemed to because I knew several women who could have easily won beauty pageants. Looking for all the world like she owned the restaurant Kokoro strode past the front podium, and the one who led us to our table did not even try to stop them as they joined us<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Ko, it's so nice to see you away from work,\" said Christine as she rose from her seat, and gave Kokoro two quick kisses on her cheeks, a ritual that Kokoro repeated. Rising myself I held out my hand to Julian and shook it in silent greeting as he sat down in his seat, just as the server arrived and poured us each a single glass of wine, leaving all four bottles in the center of the table as he moved over to myself and Christine, obviously wanting to give the new arrivals time to think over their choices for meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine herself of course ordered without having to look at her menu a second time, handing it to him with a smile, her voice sounding as if the language in which the dishes name was written was one she had been born with. Not daring to tempt fate and ask for the same thing, something that had brought me grief in the past when girlfriends ordered either something live, or something rotting, I looked down at the menu and found that there were translations for each items name written under the foreign words, and sighed with relief, flipping through until I found something I thought would be good enough to satisfy my hunger, but I knew how to eat at the same time. Which in the end left me only with a turkey sandwich, which was what I ordered, handing the menu to the man, who stalked off, seeming to have no emotion whatsoever over what had been ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how are you two doing tonight?\" asked Christine as she watched the waiter stride into the kitchen, his walk promising that our meal would be out post haste, probably because of Kokoro herself. She was getting special treatment because of her birth, which wasn't all that surprising. She was fifth in line for a throne in the East, from what I heard from Christine, though I'd never cared for that. We worked together, that was all I knew, in almost the exact same lab, which wasn't so surprising, as our fields of study were complimentary, along with Christine's own, which was also how I'd met her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around I was startled to see that the patronage of the establishment were all faces I knew from work as well. About the only one not from work in the entire restaurant, as far as I could tell, were the staff and Julian, which left Julian as a bit of an oddity in the group, but a welcome one. I'd always liked him, and I knew Kokoro did to. Christine always kept her opinions of people to herself of course, which meant I didn't know one wit of what she thought of him, but her smiles towards him had always been warm, and that led me to believe she liked him too, at least for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWomen, even one's like Christine, had a tendency to change their minds about a person midsentence in my experience, which had always been something I'd found amusing about them, and made them an adventure to be around. Of course, had Christine not liked him I didn't know what I would do, as I had known him much longer even than I had known her, a fact she was well aware of, and meant she saw him as a potential rival for my affections, though I reminded her every time she brought it up that Julian and I didn't like each other in that way, which always got her to asking if that meant I liked her more, and not wanting to lie, I always held my head down without answering.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"And that concludes the tour of this wing of the facility. So, any questions?\" I asked, though Julian didn't seem to hear me. He was instead looking back towards the large robot we had passed as the end of the tour of the Cor Wing of the facility where Kokoro, myself, and now Julian worked. Of course right now Julian was only on a temporary pass, which meant his employment could be terminated without a moment's notice, but Ko and I were both confident Julian would be allowed to stay. After all we had both petitioned for his entry into the company, and we were sure he'd find something to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, just what is the purpose of the robot thing?\" he asked as we entered my personal lab. I really wanted to say something to the effect of intergalactic warfare or something, which in truth was nearly right on them mark, but the cold hard fact is what I'd promised Julian I'd tell him, and I wasn't going to lie just to make something sound cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fact of the matter is the Goliath Mark 7 has no point to its existence. I built it because it sounded really cool, and it is, but the practical applications of the design are few and far in between, so I just keep it sitting outside my lab now, as a reminder of how foolish I can be sometimes,\" I told him, pulling a stool up to the table in the middle of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, all in all, what's your impression with the facility so far?\" I asked him point blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's certainly bigger than I expected, yet, Kokoro always told me stories about this place and the weird things that went on here, so I guess I was kind of prepared for the stuff I've seen. Still, that robot and the shrink ray thing just seem strange,\" he told me honestly, and I chuckled a bit. He would notice the shrink ray, after all he'd been small before, though in both cases he'd been invulnerable thanks to the fact that his miniaturized state then had been caused by nanomachines in his body reducing the size of his molecules, whereas the device he was calling a shrink ray did basically the same thing to atoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, don't say that. The Annihilator could have been a good way to generate large amounts of energy from anything. I just forgot to compensate for some things, and now I've got a shrink ray that works, but doesn't seem to do anything else,\" I told him, remembering how my bosses had asked if I could see any use for the device in its current state, and having them shoot down all my propositions due to the cost the machine took to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, this right here is what I'm working on now, and its uses are infinite in the real world,\" I told him, picking up what probably looked like to him to be an ordinary glass of some kind of juice, but by shaking it a little I got the juice to become clear, and revealed that at the bottom of the cup there sat a tiny black dot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so you have juice that you can make clear. What use does it have?\" he asked me, and I stared open mouthed for a second, before realizing that Kokoro had probably never told him about this little project, due in part to the fact that he knew enough about science to think this would be pure fiction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not the juice that's important. You see that dot at the bottom, that is a nanochip, not unlike the ones that your Doc friend gave you to make you shrink, but this one is far more advanced. You see this one is a selfreplicating model, and with each replication it will improve. It's like evolution, in machine form,\" I explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, now that does have uses, but what's the liquid around it?\" he asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The liquid is a concentrated base solution. You see the chip is based off amino acids, and a strong base cancels out its self replication ability,\" I explained, and for a moment I saw his eyes light up with excitement. After all Julian was a genius in his own right, and a machine like this could change the world, and he knew it. Then, for a brief flash I saw a dark look of concern cross his face, and I wondered what it was about, but before I could ask Julian asked a question of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, if this thing is removed from the solution, it will replicate exponentially right away?\" he asked, and I heard of tinge of urgency in his tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no. The chip is designed to study it's environment first, and then it will use local systems, both biological and technological, as a kind of template, improving on them. I measured the time it would take to fully comprehend a rat at two hours, fifty seven minutes,\" I told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And for a human?\" he asked, even more urgently than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few minutes more, after all we're not that much more complex than a rat, despite what some people think. Is there any reason you're asking these things?\" I queried wondering what could be the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no, nothing at all, I was just caught up in the excitement of the moment is all. Hey, Kokoro and I are going out to eat soon, are you planning on joining us?\" he asked, blatantly changing the subject, but I didn't understand his concern in the first place, so I chose not to comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, you guys go ahead. I've got a sandwich in the fridge over there,\" I pointed, and Julian nodded. He seemed to be in quite a rush as he left the lab, taking one of the multi purpose communicators with him through the Star Trek style lab door. I assured him when we began that no matter where you were on Earth this thing would be able to contact the receiver I had in the lab, though why he would need one was beyond me. He had my cell number after all. I shrugged as he left, turning back to the cup with the nanochip in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only then that I noticed that cups twin, the one with the second nanochip, was missing. Forgetting about Julian for the moment I spent a few minutes going around the lab, looking for the cup, but coming up empty. The thing seemed to have vanished without a trace. Now normally this would have concerned another lab, but at the place where I worked things vanishing was a common occurrence, and besides, the Quantum Computer that monitored the facility would be able to tell me where it went, even if it went into another reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was just about to ask the QC where the chip went when I was informed rather loudly by my terminal that it was time to eat, an alarm I'd programed in myself to ensure that I never went more than twelve hours without food. Not seeing any reason to rush in finding the chip I decided that food came first, and so I got up. As I did I must have walked too close the door, because it slid open with a whoosh sound, and I jumped back, looking at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt any other time I probably would have stuck my head out to see if anyone had passed by my lab, but with the food alarm going off In my terminal, I dismissed it. Of course had I looked out I would have seen that the Annihilator was glowing slightly with energy discharge, and looking at the floor I might have noticed the tiny, just below one inch form, making its way across the floor of my lab, a look of concern on its face from having given me the cup with the second nanochip in it earlier when I'd asked Julian to go get us drinks from the lab, and him having mistaken the cup on the table for juice.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It surely took longer than expected, this tour through the facility where my best friend Jon and my girlfriend Kokoro were working. When Jon formally said the words to end the tour of the current wing of the facility we were in, I was still impressed by the size of this entire complex of buildings, and especially by what I could see there. I knew from what Jon and Kokoro told me in the past that this facility was working on some really interesting high-tech projects, but now that I could see it with my own eyes, it seemed as if it was straight out of a science fiction movie. First of all, most of the floors and walls in the facility were white and clean, just as you\u00b4d expect. And the doors reminded me of those seen in Star Wars Episode II on Kamino (I was a geek after all, and even a scientist like Jon was an avid fan), which means that the way they opened looked kinda cool. Then there were of course all those things that were being developed here, things I would have never even dared to dream of existing already. Maybe except for the shrink ray gun I noticed earlier in one of the labs...it reminded me of the two most amazing and fantastic adventures a person could ever go through, and I went through them. It reminded me of those two events that showed me that shrink-devices do exist...and even work properly, that is. Yes, I have been small before, incredibly small. In fact, the size-changing device managed to shrink me down to near microscopic size, and the results of both experiences were more than peculiar. Because on both occasions, I ended up inside Jon\u00b4s body...and I traveled around his entire system in order to get out of him again. This is something I will never forget for sure, seeing the insides of my best friend, someone I know for years. Especially my second journey was quite unusual - well, even more unusual than the premise of being micro-sized and trapped inside the body of your best friend - as I had to stay inside him for several days, which lead to some funny events for both him and me. I am still not sure how Jon really thought of all this, that his best friend was actually traveling around inside him, that he was the first person ever to have a tiny person in his body. Perhaps he was proud, as he\u00b4s a scientist, or maybe he just thought of it as two funny events both of us would remember forever.<br>\r\nAnd it was hard to believe that I had the chance of working in this facility that developed such amazing inventions. At least Kokoro and Jon both petitioned for me to get a job there, kind as they are, and the thought of working in such an amazing facility, together with my two best friends, was really cool. Both of them were already kind enough to introduce me to certain facts I should know, being already experienced employees of the facility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, as the three of us came to a stop in front of Jon\u00b4s lab, as the trip through a certain part of the facility has ended, I couldn\u00b4t help but staring at a futuristic and cool looking robot, standing outside Jon\u00b4s lab. I was already making up pictures in my mind of what this thing would look like when it was fully operational, and I even thought of it fighting in some intergalactic battle (being a sci-fi fanatic, I couldn\u00b4t help it...<img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/wink.png\" alt=\"*Wink*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">), so I was eager to know more about it. Therefore I replied to Jon\u00b4s question about whether I would want to know more about the facility or such with exactly that.<br>\r\n\"Uh, just what is the purpose of the robot thing?\" I asked with a curious expression as the three of us entered his personal lab. Before Jon answered, I looked at Kokoro, who was smiling at me with a warm expression, and I shyly smiled back at this Japanese beauty who happened to be my wonderful girlfriend.<br>\r\n\"The fact of the matter is the Goliath Mark 7 has no point to its existence. I built it because it sounded really cool, and it is, but the practical applications are few and far in between, so I just keep it sitting outside my lab now, as a reminder of how foolish I can be sometimes.\" he answered my question. Of course it was kind of a letdown, because I was really expecting some practical use for the so called Goliath Mark 7 robot (and I would later experience there indeed is a practical use to it), but it was kinda typical for Jon, as he was sometimes a bit \"over-the-top\" with his ideas and inventions.<br>\r\nNow that we were standing in his comfy lab, Jon politely began to ask me about my opinion of this facility.<br>\r\n\"So, all in all, what\u00b4s your impression with the facility so far?\"<br>\r\nAnd my opinion would be positive in any case. A cool facility, with two wonderful friends as coworkers, what else could I have been asking for?<br>\r\n\"Well, it\u00b4s certainly bigger than I expected, yet, Kokoro always told me stories about this place and the weird things that went on here, so I guess I was kind of prepared for the stuff I\u00b4ve seen. Still, that robot and the shrink ray thing just seemed strange.\"<br>\r\nWell, I kinda lied about the shrink ray, and Jon knew that as well, as he had been my host twice before, so he knew how it was to have his best friend micronized and inside his own body. Jon once even told me how exactly the shrink ray works, and why, for example, I had been invulnerable on my journey inside him back then. If I had only know this when he swallowed me whole for the first time...I would have been far less scared and traumatized!<br>\r\nAnyway, he replied to my comment about the shrink ray, praising its usefulness and the problems of exploiting all its possibilities due to financial issues.<br>\r\n\"Now, don\u00b4t say that. The Annihilator could have been a good way to generate large amounts of energy from anything. I just forgot to compensate for some things, and now I\u00b4ve got a shrink ray that works, but doesn\u00b4t seem to do anything else.\" he explained, although I was not really paying too much attention to his words, as they contained the typical praise of his work and the complaints about how unfair and unfortunate it was that there were several circumstances to prevent his ideas from being realized entirely, so to speak. He had any right to do so, as I held Jon and his intelligence in extremely high esteem, and I knew exactly what a genius he was and how much praise and acknowledgment he deserved for his research and work, as most of it would turn out to be quite useful in the future, and I have to admit that I was proud to be the friend of such a remarkable person. And even though he was anything but arrogant, his speeches could sometimes be a little tiresome, just like it was the case now. And after all, at that moment, Kokoro gently took my right hand, and it made me smile immediately as I looked into her face in return. That angel...that wonderful angel really was my girlfriend...I don\u00b4t know how I\u00b4ll ever be able to thank Jon for introducing me to her and starting the bond between us. That has been the ultimate proof to me that he really was my best friend and someone who cared about me, and that\u00b4s why I was not even angry at him when he ate me with his snack and gulped me down with his drink back then.<br>\r\nAnyway, what he was going to show me now would blow me away...in the most negative sense possible.<br>\r\n\"However, this right here is what I am working on now, and its uses are infinite in the real world.\"<br>\r\nMy expectations were rising due to this announcement, as it sounded like something revolutionary, something that could change the world, make life easier for people, or anything like that.<br>\r\nAnd I was indeed surprised when I saw that he just grabbed a cup with some juice that was standing on the table in his lab. As he shook it, the juice became clear, and it revealed a tiny black dot on the bottom of the cup. I was slightly amused, because I remembered that Jon had requested that I brought him something to drink from his lab, just an hour ago or so, and after I rushed into his lab, I took a cup that was standing directly next to the one he was holding now, thinking it was some ordinary juice. Oh my...although I found it quite funny to think that Jon had accidentally swallowed his own invention, I was a bit concerned about him, as I did not know about the effects of this liquid and especially this black dot on the bottom, so I decided to ask Jon out about this thing, in order to get sure that he would not get hurt by having ingested this substance. <br>\r\n\"Okay, so you have a juice that you can make clear. What use does it have?\" I asked, wondering why Jon did not even notice that he drank his own invention and not a juice earlier.<br>\r\n\"It\u00b4s not the juice that\u00b4s important. You see that dot at the bottom, that is a nanochip, not unlike the ones that your friend Doc gave you to make you shrink, but this one is far more advanced. You see, this one is a self replicating model, and with each replication it will improve. It\u00b4s like evolution, in machine form.\" he explained.<br>\r\nWell, it sounded at least partially dangerous, a nanochip that evolve on its own...not something someone would want to have inside his stomach...and I knew that effects on Jon could be less than nice.<br>\r\nBut now that he mentioned it, it reminded me of the fact that this pill Doc once gave me was in fact one of those nanochips instead, and it cleared a lot of things. I would have never expected a pill to have such effects, and it would have been unlikely for Doc to develop a pill.<br>\r\nAnyway, I was wondering whether the liquid the nanochip was in had also some effects.<br>\r\n\"Wow, now that does have uses, but what\u00b4s the liquid around it?\" I asked, trying not to sound too worried.<br>\r\n\"The liquid is a concentrated base solution. You see the chip is based off amino acids, and a strong base cancels out its self replication ability.\"<br>\r\nPhew! I was relieved to hear that this juice like substance indeed was a base solution, as I knew despite my inferior knowledge in biology and chemistry (compared to Jon) that a base solution neutralizes acidic substances at least to some extent, which means that this thing inside Jon\u00b4s belly could not reproduce and evolve, taking over his body eventually...<br>\r\nBut then it hit me, and my eyes widened, and I think the concerned look in my face was perfectly visible, as I realized that Jon was in danger! The base solution inside his stomach would of course not surround the nanochip forever, and it would eventually be sucked into his intestines, leaving the nanochip alone and in the perfect condition of reproducing without anything to neutralize its effects. But I needed to be sure.<br>\r\n\"So, if this thing is removed from the solution, it will replicate exponentially right away?\" I asked, unable to suppress the expression of concern in my voice.<br>\r\n\"Well, no. The chip is designed to study its environment first, and then it will use local systems, both biological and technological, as a kind of template, improving on them. I measured the time it would it would take to fully comprehend a rat at two hours, fifty seven minutes.\"<br>\r\nHoly Lord...knowing that a rat\u00b4s metabolism, or a rat per se, is not that different or less complex than a human, I already knew that this time would be valid for Jon as well. And the thing that would happen to him would be horrific, as the nanochip would practically use his body as a host or a hull, comprehending him eventually after some time. Being not as experienced as him, I wanted to be sure about the time he mentioned, so I asked him one last question before I made up my decision.<br>\r\n\"And for a human?\"<br>\r\n\"A few minutes more, after all we\u00b4re not that much more complex than a rat, despite what some people think. Is there any reason you\u00b4re asking these things?\"<br>\r\nBefore I answered, I thought of what I had to do now. I had to go back to a situation I went through already, had to experience the wonders of this former events under completely new circumstances. It was of course a dangerous task, but I had to do nonetheless, for the sake of my best friend\u00b4s life: I had to go inside Jon\u00b4s stomach once again and retrieve the nanochip, before this wicked abomination of human science and knowledge would take over his body, probably destroying his own mind in the process. I could not allow this to happen to my best friend, and I had to interfere. And entering his stomach was the only possibility I could see. Of course, I could not even tell him about this. I knew that Jon would never allow to risk my life like that, especially not under these circumstances - with a nanochip inside him that could have all kinds of negative effects on me. So I had to enter his stomach secretly, without him knowing - again. Only this time, I would do it on my own free will, unlike on the other occasions this happened. Now I only had to find out how to do it...maybe by sneaking into one of his meals?<br>\r\n\"Uhm, no, nothing at all, I was just caught up in the excitement of the moment, that\u00b4s all. Hey, Kokoro and I are going out to eat soon, are you planning on joining us?\" I asked him, trying to find out more about the possibilities of entering his stomach.<br>\r\n\"Nah, you guys go ahead. I\u00b4ve got a sandwich in the fridge over here.\" he plainly said.<br>\r\nAll right. I knew that I had to shrink myself and sneak into the sandwich. I was not really keen on exploring his insides again, but I had no choice. As I left the lab together with Kokoro, I quickly grabbed one of the multi purpose communicators lying on the table, knowing that I would need this thing very soon. Once I found the nanochip, I would have to get in contact with Jon, so he could get me out of his system again. I did not want to get lost in there, after all, or spend more time in his comfy insides than I needed to...<br>\r\nAnd so Kokoro and I left through the futuristic looking door that closed behind us after we were out of Jon\u00b4s lab. I sighed, and Kokoro looked at me with a concerned expression in her face, knowing that something was bothering me.<br>\r\n\"Julian...what\u00b4s wrong?\" she calmly asked with her gentle voice. Just hearing her voice cheered me up a little.<br>\r\n\"Oh, don\u00b4t worry, sweetheart. I...I\u00b4m all right...\" I said, feeling bad that I had to lie to her. Kokoro was an intelligent and clever girl, and as I was not someone who could fool others that easily, she knew that something was not right with me.<br>\r\n\"No...you\u00b4re not. I can see that something\u00b4s bugging you. Why don\u00b4t you want to tell me? Julian...I am your girlfriend, and I love you. And therefore, you can tell me everything. I\u00b4ll be there for you. All right?\" she said as she put her soft hands onto my shoulders, looking straight into my face with her sky blue eyes. I dared to look at her as well, being once again in awe at her beauty, as well as the kindness of her very soul. Practically, Kokoro was the typical cute Japanese girl. She had rather long black hair that went down to her shoulders, which looked really good on her. As far as her looks in general go, Kokoro was not a girl to use tons of make up...in fact, she almost wore no make up at all. Only some decent pink lipstick and gloss on her lips that was almost not noticeable at all. Her face made her really stand out, as it was beautiful and innocent at the same time, representing her very personality extremely well. As for her clothes, Kokoro was of course wearing a white lab coat, just as her job required her to do. Overall, she was a beauty to behold, at least to me, and I felt like the luckiest man alive. That, and the fact that she was not a mere shallow beauty, in great part due to her considerable intelligence (working in this facility in a rather high position and being not really any less talented than a genius like Jon certainly is an indicator of unbelievable intelligence) portrayed in both the field of science and in dealing with difficult situations, as she could easily solve any problem or conflict with her calm, thoughtful nature. And I don\u00b4t need to mention her kindness...as it was the reason for me to fall in love with her. Coming from a highly regarded, old Japanese family that is said to be related to the Yamato line, she enjoyed a happy childhood and youth, being well educated and very polite. Although living in the US now, Kokoro sometimes still had the habit of bowing before others as a sign of politeness, and I respected her very much for that and her traditions. I really was lucky to find such a polite, kind and intelligent girl who could also be quite funny at times.<br>\r\n\"I know, Kokoro. I know I can tell you everything. It\u00b4s just that...I...I don\u00b4t feel that well. It\u00b4s hard to explain. But don\u00b4t worry about me, ok?\"<br>\r\n\"Ok...\" she said, giving me a gentle kiss on my cheek.<br>\r\n\"Kokoro...I am sorry, but I don\u00b4t think we can go eat something together now. I...I still have something left to do. I am sorry, I...\" I said, trying to explain to her that I obviously would not go with her to a restaurant. And of course I also had to avoid telling her about my plans, as she would not allow me to do this, just like Jon. Both of them cared too much for me as if they would allow me to risk my life like that.<br>\r\n\"It\u00b4s all right, Julian. Don\u00b4t worry about that. You\u00b4ve done so much for me already, so missing one lunchtime will not make me angry.\" she calmly said.<br>\r\n\"Ko...you\u00b4re the best!\" I exclaimed, giving her kiss on her cheek. She just smiled back, having her arms crossed in front of her chest.<br>\r\n\"I know.\" she playfully said with a girlish voice, referring to my last comment. With that, she gave me one last gentle kiss and then walked away from me. I waited until she was out of my sight, so I could finally have a closer look at the annihilator that was standing just a few meters away from me and several meters away from Jon\u00b4s lab. I quickly walked toward it, looking at this thing with mixed feelings, remembering my experiences with shrinking devices of all kinds. And the control panel on the Annihilator looked quite difficult to use, but as Jon once showed me the functions on the control panel of the shrink ray gun - which was bearing a heavy resemblance to the one found in \"Honey, I shrunk the kids\" - and how to use it properly, I knew what buttons I had to press in order to make this thing work. I first took care of the size set up by typing on some keyboard and telling it how small I wanted to be, and then I activated this machine by pushing several buttons in order to make the machine work and allow it to gain enough energy for the shrinking process. The machine slowly began to rumble, indicating that it has begun working, and a green control light next to the control panel began to flash, telling me that the shrinking process was about to start, and in a matter of seconds, a greenish ray emanated from the machine and engulfed my entire body, and I felt its effects rather quickly. My body began to shrink incredibly fast, with the white floor around me becoming bigger and bigger and practically miles-high, until I stopped at approximately 1/8 of an inch in size. Not as small as the two times before, but still almost unnoticeable.<br>\r\nTrying not to lose time, I quickly ran over the smooth, white ground, toward the door to Jon\u00b4s lab again, which opened quickly as it noticed that someone was approaching it, even if it was someone as tiny as me. Due to my size, it took me a while longer to cross the door and enter Jon\u00b4s room, and as I finally did, I could see this gigantic, almost astronomic figure of my best friend staring out of the room through the door, probably surprised that it has opened despite no one having been around except for him - and except for his teenie-tiny best friend who was running toward the fridge and toward the sandwich on it, trying to make his way once again into the depths of his stomach in order to save him...<br>\r\nThe only question was how to get onto his sandwich, but knowing my talent for ending up in the most peculiar and amazing situations and for usually landing in Jon\u00b4s meals and drinks and eventually inside him whenever I was shrunk, I was quite sure I\u00b4d be able to to get into his stomach sooner or later. It could not be otherwise, considering my past experiences inside him, even though this time the difference was that I was about to enter his body on purpose...something I would have never even dreamed of before. But my friendship with Jon made it necessary as I knew fully well that I had correct my mistake from before and protect him from the unthinkable effects of the nanochip...<br>\r\nYes...this was the beginning of another life-changing experience and fantastic voyage alike...only this time, things would be vastly different...</span></div></div>",

And even had the alarm not been going I doubt I would have noticed the tiny figure on the floor as I walked over to the minifridge, which held several different samples of chemicals that needed to be stored at colder temperatures, including a Tri-Hexalon agent called Dragon's Breath, a very deadly bioweapon, and something that was call FEV, though where that came from I had no idea, nor was I aware of what it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing the vials out of the way, causing them to strike each other and create a very melodious tinkling sound I at last found what I was searching for, a plate wrapped in plastic, holding a sandwich on it. My lunch which I had placed behind the samples as a precaution against someone eating it again, which had happened in the past, including Kokoro herself doing it once, because I happened to like the same type of sandwich that Julian usually made for her, which was a simple thing of cheese, bologna and lettuce between two slices of white bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling the plate off the shelf I closed the fridge, wondering again if I should be worried about storing my food around things which were in some cases designed to destroy entire populations, or convert them into something different. Still I'd never heard of anyone getting sick from doing this before, and most of the lab techs did this, including Ko and ?!*$, though the latter wasn't human to begin with, and his name was hard to say out loud, being a series of clicks, hiss, and gruntle noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling and wondering where ?!*$ was today, having no seen him at all as Ko and I showed Julian around, I got back to my station, nearly tripping over the power cord which ran up the side of the desk as I placed my sandwich open it and removed the wrapping. Settling into my seat I push a button to turn off the alarm and set about completing a few tasks on my terminal before I started to eat, while at the same time oblivious to the tiny form making its way up the cord, inch by inch, to the top of my desk, and the sandwich that sat there.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Did you bring the thing I requested?\" I asked of the form beyond the portal, the rain falling all around the hood visage of the creature that stood out in the driving rain and storm, with the fury and power of nature pulling at his garments, trying to tear them asunder. The figure, with eyes the were deeply set in darkness stared at me from within the depths of the hood that it wore, stared at me, with a gaze that could have caused Medusa herself to freeze cold in her reptilian tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" it demanded, and the hood pulled back to reveal Julian, who looked more than a little displeased to be out in the rain. Behind him I saw another figure, who seemed even less pleased than Julian himself, of course neither's displeasure was any surprise, considering the hour was nearing midnight, and I'd called them up only an hour ago, probably rousing them out of nice warm, soft beds to get them out in this storm to come to my house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked if you brought someone with you, and I can see the answer right in front of me, so why don't you both come in and dry off,\" I told Julian, fully opening the door and ushering the two inside. Luckily, with only a few candles burning, the inside of my house was lit almost the same amount as the outside world, and so their eyes need no time to adjust, however mine obviously did, for as I looked to the figure beside Julian, expecting to see Kokoro, I was instead startled to find it was someone else entirely, and my surprise obviously registered on my face, because Julian pointed at the man beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jon, this is Dominique, Dominique, this is Jon, he's the one who called me up,\" Julian said, and I held out my hand to the newcomer. He took it shook it quite vigorously, though whether this was natural for him, or because he was made at me for getting him outside in the storm I was unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, how about you tell me what was so important it could wait until morning?\" asking Julian as I led them both through my apartments entryway, and into the living room, the instant we stepped inside both of my companions stopped, and I smiled at their reaction, for the sight truly was impressive, with candles everywhere, casting off pale light that shifted and moved with every stray motion of the air around them, casting shadows about that were at once creepy and soothing to the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Expecting a power outage?\" asked Julian, and I shook my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly. Julian, do you remember what I told you I was doing last month, when I left for a week and a half?\" I asked him in return, and he thought for a moment before nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you said you were going tomb raiding, or something like that,\" he answered, and I sighed at it, shaking my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not tomb raiding, that's such an ugly word, as it sounds like grave robbing. I was on an archeological dig in northern Scandinavia, although why they assigned a tech to something like that, I'll never know,\" I stated, scratching my chin as I tried to think of yet again why the company I worked for, a technologies broker, would even be doing such digs, but then shook my head to clear it of such thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, while there I happened on this,\" I said, and then pulled off the table an old stone tablet, covered in what looked like squiggles, and after staring at it a moment, Dominique tapped it with his finger and then looked at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? You wanted us to look at this by candle light during a storm?\" he asked, and once again I shook my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not that exactly, you see, the rune on this tablet contain a powerful spell, something to give the caster the perspective of Odin, the All Father of the Norse gods, or in other words, omniscience,\" I told them, my voice excited, but when I saw the slightly dazed look on their eyes I realized they didn't recognize the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean it can help us to know everything, about everything,\" I explained, and Julian nodded excitement growing behind his eyes, though Dominique seemed a bit more subdued, looking from me to Julian, and then putting up his hand to interject between us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you wanted us to what, read some old legend that supposedly magic?\" he asked, and I shook my head, though it was Julian who answered, having had similar doubts in the past about such things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if you believe in magic or not, but believe me, with all the stuff that Jon and Kokoro do up at their job, I'm willing to give this a shot, especially if it means I never have to study for another test again,\" he said, and looked towards his friend in askance, and after a few seconds hesitation, Dominique stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, let's see if this works, so what do we do?\" he asked, and I clapped my hands like a giddy school boy as I pulled out two robes from behind a chair and shoved them at the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just put those one, and then come here,\" I said, walking over to a table set up at the center of the room while slipping into a similar robe. As soon as the other two joined me I pointed for them to sit down on pillows I'd set on the floor for them, and then gently set the tablet down on the table between us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, now all I need is for you two to sit there, as this spell calls for three people to cast it, but it says only one of us needs to do the actual casting, so just sit there, and don't move,\" advised, and Dominique looked around at the candles, and then at the tablet, and seeing he had a question I merely held out my hand in a gesture that told him to speak it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you gonna sacrifice us, or something to gain the favor of the gods in the heavens, or some such like that?\" he asked, and I vehemently shook my head back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No not at all. This is a simple rune spell. All I really need is for the runes to be written down, and then I just have to say them, in any language, and the spell should activate. What form the activation will take, I have no idea, but if I'm right about all this we shouldn't be hurt at all, though if you don't feel comfortable, you can leave now,\" I told him, motioning towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I want to stay, but one more question, why couldn't this have waited until morning?\" he asked, and I nodded, understanding why he would want to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, because the tablet says the heavens must rage for the spell to work, and they're certainly doing that tonight. Besides, if this doesn't work, I've got my television all set up with some good movies, and some snacks in the kitchen, so we can do something with the rest of the night,\" I told him, and he nodded, despite how childish that suggest really was. With him out of questions, and us all in our places I held up my hands palms flat, towards them, and without waiting to be told the joined their against mine, so that our arms formed a kind of triangle around the tablet, as depicted on the top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ancient Gods, born from Yggdrasil's fruit, I beseech ye, we gathered here, neath the light of candles made from the fat of Fenrisulfr brethren, while the heavens overhead rage with thy fury, ask a boon of ye. Grant us that which makes Mjolnir's strike sound like a drop of water, and J\u00f6rmungandr length but a span of feet. Oh ancient ones, grants us the perspective of Great Odin, All Father, that we might know the world as he does,\" I commanded, and the tablet's runes burned brightly, as the storm outside seemed to rage all the more strongly, and the flames of the candles, burning around us, leapt upward, and began to circle us in a ring of fire, taking my eyes off the tablet, I stared at the other two, willing them not to move, and bravely they stood their ground, but then as the rune for Odin went alight, as the others before it, I heard a new sound, and looked to find that a stray bit of dust had worked it's way into Julian's nose, and sneezing, he fell backwards, and penetrated the circle of flame, which vanished instantly, leaving the three of us in he darkness for a moment, until I found the remote and turned on the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, Julian?\" I asked, searching about for the light switch, but my friend grabbed my hand, nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about. I'm sorry I broke the spell though, that was getting good,\" he said apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, don't worry. We can always try again later. For now though, how about those movies, and the snacks?\" I suggested, to which both Dominique, who had seemed slightly dazed until that moment, and Julian quickly agreed, and Dominique even offered to go get them, and I was tempted to let him while I set the movie up, but still I was the host, and I was supposed to do all the work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(If you can't guess, the one who goes to get the food will remain normal, while the two who remain will get shrunken so choose your giant)</span></div></div>",

Once outside I turned on the kitchen light, finding everything inside was right where I left it. Walking over to the counter I picked up a large plate of sandwiches, and a tray with three drinks on it, and went back into the livingroom, with the lights on though I did not notice the flash of light coming from within the room, and thus, when I entered, I was completely surprised to find that the other two were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julian, Dominique? Where'd you guys go?\" I asked, and walked over towards the table, yet with my eyes still adjusted for the bright lights of the kitchen I could not see very well, and so missed seeing the two figures, standing at less than an inch tall, as they leaped up and shouted for my attention. Without seeing them I set the two trays next to the pillows, and walked over to the front door, finding it slightly ajar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They must have gone home, probably had something better to do,\" I told myself, closing the door completely, something I'd forgotten to do before when letting my friends in, and then walking back to the living room. A bright flash of thunder illuminated the scene through my window for a moment, as I looked about, and found the trays right where I'd left them, and so picking them up I made my way over to the couch and set them down gently, not noticing that each tray had picked up its own tiny passenger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I guess comedy it is,\" I said, feeling in the need for something to boost my spirits after the failure of the spell, and pushing a button on my remote I brought up a prompt of movie types, from which I selected comedy, and then scrolled down the list to a movie from the eighties that I still claimed was the funniest scifi movie ever. Selecting the title I watched the screen go black for a moment, before it lit up again, with the words, Once Upon a Timewarp on it, followed by blaring instrumentals, and the title splayed across the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spaceballs,\" I read, picking up one of the sandwiches and taking a bite. Still on the trays the two small figure were trying to find ways to get my attention.</span></div></div>",

This made me laugh a bit as I remembered that the very reason the others had come over tonight had been to call upon the power of the gods, and was likely one of the reasons my little spell had failed, despite the fact that I had been in contact with this particular deity no less than fifteen times over the course of my life, inside that floating castle of his, which was quite drafty, truth to tell, and looked really odd as it was lit by the rainbow that connected it to Yggdrasil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, he might still be pissed by that whole thing about the false eye,\" I comment to myself, remembering my last visit when I put a prosthetic in the place of his lost eye. Thor and Loki had thought it was a great joke, with even the stoic Tyr give a hearty belly laugh or two. Course it was unlikely that Odin had known it was specifically him casting the spell, especially with two others involved in it, making it likely just one of those random errors that happened in magic from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mulled over all this as in the time it took Spaceball One, the bad guys starship to cross the screen after the opening dialogue of the movie. Watching with interest now I swallowed down the last of the first sandwich, most of it having vanished into my maw as I thought, and then reached down to grab another, and didn't notice as my hand held a tiny form against it, pressing it into the bread as I brought it up to mouth, which opened wide to take the morsel inside while I watched the movie, and thus spared none of my thoughts for the world around me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven had I though, I wouldn't have felt the tiny speck in my mouth as it was moved about, the motion of my chewing tossing the contents of my mouth around, and threatening to place it on one of my molars, and then grind it into goo should it misstep and be placed upon them. Still unaware of the plight within me, I then swallowed everything in my mouth, the spit and mush mixing together as my maw became a funnel, filtering everything into my throat, where it began a sharp descent down to my growling belly, which had not been sated by the first snack, and demanded more.</span></div></div>",

I was on top of one of the sandwiches he had made. He hadn't noticed me, he was just hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jon, stop! It's me, Chad!!\" I yelled, hoping to get his attention. At least that's what my fear was saying. I didn't want to be eaten, but something in my mind wanted to see what it was like inside the human body. I knew this would never come true, for I would instantly digest and be absorbed before I got very far in his digestive tract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I predicted, he didn't hear my shouting. Jon picked up the very sandwich I stood on, bringing it closer to his mouth as it was lifted. His mouth opened wide so I could see the back of his throat...and possibly the one-way tunnel I would be taking. As I stood in fear and awe, he took a bite of the sandwich. I was not on this bite, but I felt the shock made by his teeth ripping the sandwich so he could chew and swallow the smaller piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good lord...\" I said to myself, realizing there was no stopping to him eating the sandwich. His mouth came for the next bite; the bite I was to be included on. There was no way to avoid it, so I had to go with what was happening until I thought of another plan. I let myself enter his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter jumping from the bitten sandwich piece to his tongue, I tried to retain my balance from the movements around me. His powerful teeth destroyed the sandwich into smaller pieces, so he could swallow them. I avoided most of the ensuing chaos in his mouth, taking good care not to be crushed by his massive molars. But after a while of struggling, I was eventually trapped in a pile of sandwich mush. As more and more piled on, I found it harder to break free. Covered in saliva and food bits, I hoped that Jon would realize my fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo much for hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tongue began to move everything in his mouth to the throat. It didn't take a genius to realize he was swallowing the food. I did my best to escape from the mush I was trapped in, but when I finally struggled myself loose, I felt myself falling. Everything that was just in his mouth: saliva, food, and me, had been swallowed. I fell helplessly as I heard his heartbeat and churning, anticipant stomach below.</span></div></div>",

Slowly my eyes, which had been blinded by the flash of light, adjusted to the new surroundings, and looking towards a light in the distance I began to make out letters, and finally words, spelled out in a soft glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now, this could be a problem,\" I said to myself, finally reading the same list of movie genres that I'd read dozens of times before, though never from this perspective. Judging by how far it seemed to be to my television I estimated my height to now be somewhere between a quarter, to one sixteenth of an inch tall, and looking towards the distance I could see another figure at my height, Julian. Before I could rush to him though, the ground began to quake unexpectedly, tossing me onto my butt, and then it did it a second time, and I realized that the effect of the shrinking had been localized to my livingroom, and looking towards the great portal in the distance I saw a titanic figure emerge from my kitchen, carrying in each hand a tray that was larger than a football field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys?\" asked the figure of the darkness, and Dominique stepped back into the living room, completely oblivious to the two of us standing on the couch before him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I felt kinda bad that my sneeze caused the entire procedure and this rite to fail, because I was indeed a bit curious to see whether what Jon told us was true. He was no one who would lie just like that, especially not about either all things that had something to do with science or the supernatural, like this supposedly magical item. But still, even though I had great trust in Jon and everything he said, I did not quite believe that this spell would have really worked, even though it was quite spooky that it even began glowing during the small ceremony we held. Of course, I went through quite a lot already, as I experienced the situation of being shrunk and floating around inside Jon\u00b4s body, for example, which is probably the most unusual thing that could ever happen to you. So you can imagine that there was nothing left in this world that could have surprised me. But an ancient rune containing the powers of the Norse Gods like Odin was certainly a bit...well, unusual, at least as unusual as the situation of being inside your best friends bloodstream, for example.<br>\r\nBut even if I screwed the ceremony up, the three of us could at least enjoy the evening with a movie of our choice and some snacks and drinks. I thought that was going to be the start of a nice evening even without gaining wisdom through some rune. Well...at least I thought it was going to be a nice evening.<br>\r\nAs I looked at Jon telling Dominique about what to get from the kitchen, I took off that strange robe Jon gave us earlier and put it down onto the ground, not knowing where else I could have placed it. But as clean as Jon\u00b4s apartment was, I did not worry that much about the robe getting dirty or something like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jon put that creepy looking stone tablet aside and grabbed the remote of his TV station, I was still convinced that everything would be fine and that it would turn out to be an enjoyable evening after all. I took my seat on the couch next to him as he asked me the infamous question of what movie we should be watching.<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want to watch tonight?\" he asked, and I already thought of some flicks that would be worth watching, and since Jon had a considerable library of DVDs, there was practically no classic great movie we would have not been able to watch. Of course, that made it all the more difficult to come up with something everyone would enjoy. Jurassic Park, maybe, for the extremely cool action and effects? Or my personal choice, the Star Wars saga? I even thought that we could have turned this into a Star Wars marathon, but I got rid of that idea quickly. Would have been just too long. Suddenly, I was thinking of \"The Fantastic Voyage\" and \"Innerspace\", even though that was quite a surprise. I was quite reluctant to watching these types of movies after having experienced this situation first hand and inside Jon\u00b4s body, but somehow, they came to my mind. And after all, I got over this experience quickly, especially after I learned that I was practically immune to the dangers lurking withing a human body. And of course, it was a life-changing, incredible experience like no other you could possibly think of, so I should have been proud to have been the first known endonaut, and Jon as well for being the first known host of a shrunken person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the question of what movie we should be watching became relatively irrelevant, as something should screw this evening up - like so often. Just as I wanted to take a seat on the cozy couch next to Jon, the stone tablet that was lying peacefully on the table began to glow with a blending and wondrous white light, just like it did during the ceremony. Both Jon and me immediately stared at the mysterious stone tablet, and the expression in my face was kinda undecided, as I was on one hand quite shocked and afraid of what could happen, and on the other hand, I was excited and amazed by this beautiful light and what its effects would be. Neither Jon nor me did say a single word, we could only stare in awe at the spectacle unfolding in front of our very eyes. Soon, the light seemed to be expanding, engulfing the two of us with its brightness, yet I was unable to move or to yell at Jon. I was somehow drawn into a vortex of fascination and awe that did not let me go, and so I just stood there, staring at the tablet and the light emanating from it.<br>\r\n\"Did...did that spell...work after all?\" I thought to myself, wondering whether this would be the meaning of all this. Strangely enough, I suddenly noticed an unusual sensation in my body, and I could not explain myself what it was. I was feeling unsettled, and strange thoughts were racing through my mind, thoughts of...change. And somehow, I could feel that something was indeed changing. Yet I could only see the results when the light began to vanish as quickly as it appeared before.<br>\r\n\"Jon...what...what on earth was that?\" I then asked, but to my surprise, I did not get any answer.<br>\r\n\"Jon?\" I then asked again, looking right next to me, only to notice that Jon was not there.<br>\r\n\"Jon!\" I shouted, panicked that he disappeared all out of a sudden. I though that maybe that stone tablet had cast a spell or something that made Jon vanish just like that...but even though it was a spell in the end, it was not exactly what I had expected.<br>\r\nAs I then looked around me, I noticed that I was standing...on an incredibly soft ground that was definitely not the floor of Jon\u00b4s room.<br>\r\n\"What the...?\"<br>\r\nI went down onto my knees in order to take a closer look at the ground, and when I touched it, I was able to feel that it consisted an extremely soft fabric, and it had a very fine structure. The color of the this strange underground then finally gave me the last hint. That...that floor I was standing on...was Jon\u00b4s couch! And as I looked around, with each of my movements being filled with panic and shock, I saw that I was on a vast field of soft fabric...Jon\u00b4s couch. And in the distance, directly in front of me, there was a gigantic, black \"gate\" that seemed to lead into another world - Jon\u00b4s TV station, only a meter behind the table with that damn stone tablet on it.<br>\r\nNow it was crystal clear to me. Either Jon lied about the effects of the stone tablet, or the something went terribly wrong with the ceremony. In any case...I shrunk! Judging from my observations, I must have been at least about 1/16 of an inch tall, if not smaller, but at least it appeared to me that I was roughly as small as I was when it happened the last time...this shrinkage. Oh no...it happened again!<br>\r\nBut...where was Jon? Only when I looked into the distance of one side of this incredibly vast wasteland of Jon\u00b4s couch, I was able to see a figure that was human shaped and appeared to be about my size as well - Jon! So he did not disappear...he shrunk as well!<br>\r\nOh, the irony. At first I did not notice the irony of Jon, the one whose body I could explore more than I could have ever wished, was shrunk as well and could see at last what it was like to be shrunk and helpless. But of course, at that moment, I did not waste a thought on that. I only thought of rushing toward my best friend, but before I could even make an attempt at running, a thunderous sound could be heard all out of a sudden in the far distance, sounding like the famous stomp of the T-Rex in the first Jurassic Park. Only in this case, it did not cause the water inside a glass to shake...it caused me to fall down onto my butt.<br>\r\n\"In the name of...!\" I yelled, taking then a look into Jon\u00b4s direction and being able to see that he had fallen down as well, judging from the shape of this tiny figure in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did not have to think of an answer to what on earth was causing this horribly earthquake. As this thunderous sound and the quake became stronger and stronger the more it repeated itself, I had decided to remain on my butt, as standing up would have been futile. But when I looked toward the door to the kitchen, my face turned pale - as pale as in the moment Jon swallowed me alive for the very first time. Through the kitchen table, the gigantic figure of Dominique could be seen carrying a table with sandwiches and a tray with drinks, heading into the living room.<br>\r\n\"Guys?\" his powerful voice could be heard, obviously asking for us. Dammit! It\u00b4s just like when it happened for the very first time back then...with the only difference being that Dominique at least knew that we were here. But how was he supposed to know about us being shrunk and helpless, and of course in grave danger! I began to shake with fear as Dominique began walking toward the couch, with his obvious plan being to sit down there, maybe on us if we didn\u00b4t hurry and ran away or if he did not sit down directly in this vast field between me and Jon.<br>\r\n\"They\u00b4ll be back. I know they wouldn\u00b4t miss...what movie are we watching again?\" his voice said. How nice of him to think of us that we would not leave him like that...but I would have preferred sitting on the couch now next to Jon and deciding with the two what movie we should be watching. With morbid fascination, I observed Dominique\u00b4s slow seeming movements as he put down the tray and the plate onto the table and impressively spun a DVD into the DVD player, but I could not see what movie it was. So he wanted to start without us...but to my shock, my situation and Jon\u00b4s either was getting worse...far worse! Because now, Dominique grabbed the remote from the table and went toward the couch, attempting to sit down and threatening to crush either Jon or me or both of us if we din\u00b4t think of something fast or if luck wasn\u00b4t on our side. In shock about these events, I was unable to decide on what to do while a titanic shadow was covering me and the entire couch as my astronomically huge friend was approaching the couch...</span></div></div>",

On the other side of him I knew Julian was experiencing some of the same feelings as I was of, being lost and alone, and in more danger than I had ever faced while inside the safe confines of my home. Of course just because I was in danger and peril didn't mean I was panicking. Instead I was considering everything about my condition, determining how I might be able to extract myself from it without getting myself killing in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Dominique leaned forward, and provided me with just such a way. On the floor in front of him he'd laid the two trays down while he'd played with the DVD, which was actually a data disk and was bringing up a long list of movies for him to chose from. As it was loading though Dominique reached down and picked up the two trays, setting them on either side of him, and showing me just how small I was by placing the plate of sandwiches next to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you've done this before, just climb on top of one, and then leap off before he eats you,\" I told myself, slapping my face to increase the sharpness of my senses. Before me where the mountainous configurations of bread, meat, cheese, and lettuce I had prepared for snacks during movie night, though back then I'd easily been able to hold them in my hands, while now they more resembled things gods would have made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill I wasn't about to give up just yet, and so I walked over to the tray, walking onto it, because thanks to it's weight the memory cells provided me a way onto it, while watching the giant to see if he was stirring. At the same time, in the back of my mind, I was wondering how Julian was doing. After all climbing on top sandwiches was one thing, getting on top of my glasses, which were smooth and plain, was going to be quite something else.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In view of the most dangerous and grim situation Jon and me had to face, it came off as quite a surprise that I still remained rather calm, and it was most likely because of the odd circumstance that I already found myself in similar situations involving me and Jon, and since I survived all my shrinking adventures and did not even suffer any serious harm when I was traveling around inside his body (indeed, whenever I found myself in such a shrinkage situation, I shrunk down to such an extremely tiny size that I could even easily fit into Jon\u00b4s bloodstream, so one could say that I had become an almost microscopic being on all those occassions). So one could say that I was already used to the weirdness as well as the dangers of an incredible shrinking adventure, if you will, let alone fantastic voyages into the human body, and hence I did not freak out after the realization of what happened to me, and especially not after the sight of Chad as a giant...though the term giant almost was an understatement. Chad\u00b4s size was titanic, he was astronomically huge and God like, and despite my experiences with gigantic human beings, his sight still provided my feelings with a mix of awe and fear, knowing that there was probably no way he would see me. Perhaps I wasn\u00b4t even insect sized compared to him, and this situation truly was bearing a certain amount of bitter irony, considering the Chad was the youngest of us three, actually similar to a younger brother in a certain way, and even though he was quite big for someone of his age, it was still kinda ironic to see that the youngest of us was obviously in charge in terms of size - by far, of course, but that was already clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to the fact that Chad finally sat down on Jon\u00b4s couch - an action that caused some sort of disturbance of the surface I was standing on, a disturbance that had the effect of an erathquake on someone as tiny as me, an caused me to fall onto my butt pretty hard, making me grateful that the action of Chad sitting down took only a small fraction of a second to transpire - my view on the other side of the couch, where I was able to (barely) see Jon far in the distance just moments ago, was blocked, so from now on, I was completely oblivious to Jon\u00b4s fate, what he was about to do in such a critical situation. Honestly, I would have preferred getting over to him so the two of us could have worked together in order to get ourselves out of this misery, but by the look of things, I was once again on my own in this most unlikely and dangerous adventure, but again, I was kinda used to this, so it did not really upset me.<br>\r\nBut of course I was worried about Jon. He was my best friend, after all, and out of all people I know myself the best what can happen in such situations, and he knows himself that this is indeed true, after all we\u00b4ve been through. Still, something told me that he would be alright, even in case it would not seem so at first glance, but when Jon had unwittingly swallowed me for the first time back then, as part of his sandwich, it did not seem like everything would be okay in the end, but it eventually was, so I was hoping that this would be the case with Jon as well and that he\u00b4d manage to somehow get in contact with Chad without being harmed or even getting killed. Jon was able to take care of himself, after all, and I have never known a single person as intelligtent or quick thinking as him, so if there was someone in this world to get through all this, then it was him, definitely, and I was quite sure he had already a plan to get Chad\u00b4s attention, and his plan was certainly going well...I something told me that it was just like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut speaking of plans...that was the single most important thing I had to come up with at that moment. And having been isolated from Jon, I had to work out such a plan all by myself, and it was already difficult to think of what I should even be doing now. I saw that there was a tray in front of me, a tray with sandwiches, of the same type as the one I saw him placing on the other side of the couch - \"Jon\u00b4s side\". And naturally I got the idea of trying to get onto the tray and hence get closer to Chad\u00b4s face, providing me with a possibility of him noticing tiny-me either by chance or as the calculated result of this \"brilliant\" plan, even though I immediately dropped this idea, knowing that getting onto the tray and then onto the sandwich was suicide, since there was a 99% chance that Chad would eventually lift up the piece of sandwich I was on and eat it...and I know that it\u00b4s not a pretty picture...well, it is at least intriguing, but certainly not the nicest situation I could find myself in. And although I was able to survive being inside Jon\u00b4s stomach due to the nanomachines of the \"pill\" Doc gave me, I did not want to try my luck this time. Who knows whether some backfired ancient Norse spell would provide one with immunity to stomach acids as well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then I knew what could actually work in order to get Chad\u00b4s attention and make him know where I was. It was going to be an ordeal, it was going to take seemingly forever, it was going to be dangerous...but boy, this other idea that came to my mind would at least not lead me into Chad\u00b4s stomach: his ear! If I was able to reach his ear, I could try to get in contact with him from there, or I could even go as deep as his eardrum, to make sure he\u00b4d really hear me. Of course such an idea sounded ridiculous at first, but it was not that I had a choice or something.<br>\r\nLooking up Chad\u00b4s gigantic body towering over me and casting a nearly endless shadow over me and the entire couch, I sighed deeply. Yes, it would be a long and exhausting climb up Chad\u00b4s body, but it had to be done. Running toward the sitting giant, whose smile already did indicate that he was enjoying the movie despite Jon\u00b4s and my absence, I was trying to decide whether climbing his body like this or really getting onto a tray and from there trying to get to a higher \"area\" of Chad\u00b4s body - so it would spare me some time and effort - and even while running toward him I wasn\u00b4t exactly sure what to do...only my destination was clear: Chad\u00b4s ear.<br>\r\nBut for some reason, I also had to think of Jon...I couldn\u00b4t tell back then, but something certainly did not feel right at that moment...as if something was happening to Jon. Of course I tried to forget this thought that suddenly came to my mind, but it was in a certain way nagging at me while making my way toward my astronomically huge friend...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The world around me shifted and rocked as it was lifted high into the air. The pressure actually slacked off though, as Chad started to support more of the weight of the sandwich with the bottom of his hand, allowing me to move, though the world around me was mostly dark now because I was deep inside the bread. So deep in fact that when I pulled at the soft white around me, I felt something cold and wet underneath, the meat inside the sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling to myself I began to move in the direction I believed was towards the edge of the construct, the smell of the special meat filling my nostrils. Of course it wasn't really meat, as that implied that it had belonged to a living creature at some point, but was in fact more in line with a computer chip, the stuff having been created from a protein wash in the lab as a safe, viable alternative for vegetarians, and that the lab hoped to one day replace with normal methods of food gathering, as they could literally construct this stuff for dollars a pound, whereas with the more natural alternatives it cost hundreds to raise a single animal, and then there was the risk of infection and diseases, which was not possible with the artificially grown stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds after I had started crawling my head finally emerged into the low light of my living room, though everything in front of me was dark. For a moment I wondered what had happened, but then a stray flicker of the television set a shine to something in front of me, and I soon realized that I wasn't staring into my living room, but into the living cavern of flesh that was Chad's mouth a he moved the sandwich forward into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHAD!!!\" I scream out again, but I was already inside his mouth by this point, the pulsing, soft, walls of his hot, humid maw absorbing the words as they left my mouth. He let out a breath and allowed it to blow around the sandwich, the wave of warm air mixing with smells from deep within his body as it washed over me, and tossed several specks of saliva onto my face, which I shook to get them off, though they refused to let go, sticking to my skin wetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind me I got one last glimmer of light from outside as the sound of teeth tearing through soft bread, meat, and cheese filled the chamber in which I was trapped, and I could do nothing but scream as the my whole world was reduced to the confines of Chad's body. Struggling to get free of the bindings that held me in place, I was suddenly released as the pressure around me slacked off, and I pulled myself from inside the sandwich, falling right into a pool of spit that had collected around the bite in Chad's mouth, swimming back to the surface and treading the good as I made my way to the firmer ground of his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't make it on my own though, the reason why being that his mouth moved, and a tendril of spit fell from the roof, touching down in the pool in which I found myself, and then it pulled back up, dragging most of the pool with it as the lower jaw began to descend as Chad started to move the bite in his mouth around, not really chewing, but pressing it against his teeth to squirt the flavor off with his tongue. Unfortunately this little maneuver included myself, and as I lay against the tongue, it tilted and I rolled a bit, until I was crushed against one of his back molars, literally being rubbed into the tooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe obviously found me to be an odd morsel too, as his tongue began to press against me specifically rather than a general pressure, and for a moment or two I was sure that my ribs would crack under the strain. Luckily he either decided I wasn't important, which, while a blow to my rather oversized ego I could live with, or he simply determined that I was just another morsel from the odd tasting sandwich, and thus nothing to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course this meant that I was rolled back as he worked the contents of his mouth into a loose ball of mush, most of it soggy and soft after soaking in his spit for so long. Pressing me into the side I felt myself fall into the mess and was sure I was about to be swallowed when light again breached the darkness of his mouth, and I was sure he had decided he didn't like the taste when I moved forward again, towards the back of his mouth and the opening of his throat as more of the sandwich was pushed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis breathing slacked off a bit as it took a deep inhalation through his nose, and then it was rushed past me as I was tossed about because he was speaking. The words to me were lost in a roar of air, and I couldn't understand them at all, though I thought their meaning was clear enough. He must have rather liked the taste of the artificial stuff the sandwiches were made from, which most people did as, despite what movies and scifi books tell you, the artificial stuff is made with taste in mind, as well as nutrition. All that being as it was, I screamed as the wind stopped blowing around me and the rumbling of the unintelligible words were silenced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chad, don't swallow!\" I shouted as loud as I could, which was no where near as loud as before, and as one would expect it garnered me nothing. It was likely he didn't even hear a squeaking sound from my voice as the chamber I was in tilted, and the large hole that I was staring down suddenly got larger as the back of it opened up, the contents of Chad's mouth falling straight into it as the soft, slick walls closing up around the loud, and then a wave of motion passing it downward with a gulp sound, the throat bulging out around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI struggled against the descent of course, pulling myself out of the ball of mush as it moved down the neck of my devourer, and even getting free of my prison of mush before It reached the stomach, though all the really did for me was accelerate my descent, as the walls grabbed onto me individually, pressing into my body and making me wish they would just crush me and get it over with and kill me, but they were slack enough to just not do that, instead guiding my descent into the body, a tightness around me as I slipped past his collar bone, and then the thudding of Chad's heart right next to me for a moment, before I moved onward and downward towards a low growling sound, my body slick and wet to the point that rather than begin stopped by the ring of flesh that marked the entrance to his stomach, I instead popped through the tight muscle, and free falling into the chamber beyond it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air inside was foul smelling, but no worse than some of the other places I'd been, however, knowing that something heavy was following I pointed my body at an angle, plummeting into the sea of acid just as a large mass splashed down beside me, and Chad's stomach started to work on what he'd just eaten, and I felt my skin itch and burn. This was certainly a bad thing, but I was optimistic that I could get out, all I needed was time to come up with a plan, and in order to get that time I surfaced, with a gasp, opening my eyes to the stinging sensation of the miasma in his belly as I swam over towards the floating mush that would support me until I could finally free myself from this.</span></div></div>",

You have to focus on the solution and not the problem,\" I reminded myself, slapping my cheeks to give my mind something to focus on other than lingering sting on my skin as the acid bubbled against it, or the scratching feeling in my lungs with every breath as I took in a few more drops of it from the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sting on my cheeks gave me a focus point though, and I looked around for something to use to escape my fate when another gulp echoed from above me, and I noticed I was right under the exit from Chad's throat into his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh bother,\" I said, refraining from swearing even in this situation as I dove into the acid sea again just as more mush rained down from above, smashing into my little island, adding to it, but in such a way that had I stayed on where I was, I would have been stuck to it, trapped until the rocking motion of the waves, combined with the lack of good air, forced me to sleep, never to awaken again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't about to let that happen of course. I'd lived through too much just to let someone's stomach kill me without them ever even knowing about it, and with that thought firmly in hand I stared at the wall, looking around, until I found what I was looking for. A small spot that looked like a slight depression in the soft skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I was forced to swim across the sea of stinging acid to it though, Chad provided some unknowing assistance to me, leaning back and forth for a moment, and allowing my raft of mush to smash into the side of his stomach, right below the mark in the wall. Smiling at this little bit of good luck in a lot of bad I climbed the wet, sticky flesh of his stomach wall, trying to ignore the way the liquid on it stung my hands as I made my way to the fold, and then, pressing into it with one hand I literally slipped through into the calcium channel of Chad's body, getting shot through a series of tight tubes and bouncing against the walls hard, hoping that it let me out somewhere with air.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as I hated this thought at that moment, I was just not able to look after Jon and find out what happened to him. Of course I was worried about him, since I knew myself how dangerous such an unlikely situation could be, having faced horrible ordeal and life threatening predicaments at such a pitiful back in the days, during my many shrinking adventures - well, at that time, it hasn\u00b4t been that long since all those adventures, only a few months to be precise. But I was also aware of the unfortunate fact that there was nothing I could do for Jon at that moment, and that trying to search for him would have been mere suicide, considering my size and those possible dangers of my gigantic surroundings, with the most dangerous and intimidating threat ironically being my good friend Chad. Scarily towering above me while sitting only a few meters away from me on the couch, I was actually exposed to a rather uncomfortable revelation and comparison: being that close to him, it made me fully aware of the size difference between him and Jon and me. And although I was used to such an overwhelmingly huge size difference between a shrunken me and one of my gigantic friends - especially from the very first ocassion when I shrunk in Jon\u00b4s apartment - and such a revelation shouldn\u00b4t have bothered me that much anymore, I was still looking up Chad\u00b4s body in awe at how monstrously big he was...and like in the past, it was frightening for me to perceive this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, just thinking of the many ways someone as huge as Chad could accidentally kill teenie-tiny beings like Jon and me without even noticing sent shivers down my spine, as I had to face one of those ways in the past...more than once, having barely escaped with my life. That\u00b4s why Chad was the main reason for me to concentrate on my own survival now. He might have been sitting calmly on the couch at that moment, watching the movie he chose without us, but even the slightest unusual movement by him could have put me into quite a predicament. Even more importantly, there was just no way I could have helped Jon, anyway. The last time I saw him, he was on the other side of the couch, seeming to be far in the distance from my tiny point of view, and getting there would have already been exhausting enough due to the size of the \"couch-field\" and the fact that Chad himself was between Jon and me now...an obstacle impossible to overcome for me. In fact, the only thing I could do in order to find Jon again and to assure his safety was trying to get in contact with Chad, make him notice me and make him aware of Jon\u00b4s presence inside the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unfortunately, it was a long way to get there. As I already figured out, trying to reach Chad\u00b4s ear was the most reasonable choice for me, as I could not see any other possibility of getting his attention at my size. But naturally, this caused one considerable problem for me: how was I supposed to reach his ear without the procedure taking a lifetime for me to accomplish. After all, I could already guess how long it would have taken me to climb up Chad\u00b4s body up to his ear, and time was certainly not something I could spare in this situation. And apart from his size and the time issue, it was herculean, impossible task, anyway. One wrong move by Chad while I was climbing up his body, and it could have shaken me off him and down into certain death. <br>\r\nThankfully, it seemed like there was a way out of this dilemma for me. While Chad was bringing a sandwich toward his cave-like mouth with one hand, he put his other hand onto the couch, directly next to me, with his palm resting flat on the soft surface of the piece of furniture. Now that was something to change things drastically...I just had to get onto his hand, and with some luck, he would raise it again and place it near his head...still a risky plan, but I didn\u00b4t have much of a choice, anyway, and I was ready to take this risk that at least seemed like it could provide me with a successful result in the end, unlike the foolish, suicidal risk of climbing all the way up Chad\u00b4s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo as long as the possibility - or in other words, his hand - was there, I quickly ran toward this massive piece consisting of human skin, bones and flesh, and even though Chad\u00b4s flat hand online was already vastly bigger than me, I managed to grab his skin at the right spot and cling to it, about to climb up onto the back of his hand. Even this rather simple action took me several minutes, and when I realized the size of a single pore in Chad\u00b4s hand and compared it to my own very size, it made me shudder in view of how tiny I must have beem...perhaps as small as a piece of dust, or at least slightly bigger...like an extremely small bug you almost can\u00b4t see with your eyes. Actually, it was like my adventure inside Jon all over again, remembering that I had been shrunk down to a similar size back then, almost or just as tiny as I was now at that unfortunate moment. And of course, Chad was still a novice to all this shrinking stuff, since I had not even told him about my adventures within Jon at that time, afraid that he\u00b4d simply think I am crazy if I told him my endosoma-story. So, just like Jon back then, Chad had not the slightest idea that me or Jon were now struggling for survival around his gigantic body that made him seem like some sort of a God, towering above us microscopic and insignificant seeming shrunken humans...creepy to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, I had to concentrate on something else than my intimidation about my situation, since I finally reached the back of Chad\u00b4s flat hand, and once there, I quickly clinged to his skin to the best of my abilities in order to be prepared for the moment he\u00b4ll raise his hand again and to ensure that I won\u00b4t fall off.<br>\r\nAnd that moment was about to transpire sooner than I expected, as only moments after I had climbed onto Chad\u00b4s free hand, he already rose his hand high up into the air and toward his ear, while still holding the sandwich in his other hand, without me knowing what - or who - could have possibly been on it at that moment. That was just perfect! Unknowingly, Chad would provide me with some help in order to bring me closer to my destination, his ear, even though by now, I was having my doubts whether he would even be able to hear me, even if I was close to his eardrum, and I honestly did not really want to go deeper into his head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, by now Chad had brought his hand very close to his ear in order to scratch an itchy spot on his skin, I thought. Thankful for having been able to hold on to his skin while being lifted up and now being close enough to his ear, I dared to let go off his hand that was now flowating slightly above his ear...and in a matter of seconds, I landed on an extremely soft ground, and looking up, I saw that I was standing in the entrance to his ear, in front of a dark, cave-like hole that lead into his head, surrounded by some strangely shaped bones-structure: his auditory canal. Taking a deep breath, I took a look at the outside world, perhaps for one last time, seeing that I was about to spend some time inside his head, and my view on Jon\u00b4s living room from Chad\u00b4s ear was quite impressive, considering how far above the ground I was and how it reminded me of my size once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then turned back to the dark hole that led into his ear canal, and I took my first steps inside Chad\u00b4s body, even though I was hoping I\u00b4d only get as far as his eardrum. Since there was not much light shining into his ear, I could not really see anything properly, but at least I could notice to my surprise that the soft and slightly pulsating ground beneath me was not as sticky as I had feared, so Chad obviously did not have much earwax in there. I also realized that despite the fact that the entrance to the human ear is a really small hole and therefore, the auditory canal a rather small tube as well, Chad\u00b4s ear canal was like a huge tunnel for me, in fact so big that the small hairs growing out of the walls of the auditory canal did not even touch me while walking around...heck, it would have taken me several seconds to walk from one wall of his ear canal to the other, so I must have really been so small that he would have hardly been able to see me with his bare eyes. Hopefully, Chad would be able to hear me at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while I was listening to Chad\u00b4s heartbeat during my walk, noticing that it got louder and louder the deeper I got into his head, I was shaken around inside Chad\u00b4s ear all out of a sudden, thrown against the organic wall of his ear canal with considerable force, and I was unable to do anything against it.<br>\r\n\"What the---?!\" I shouted, but soon, I found myself rolling around, deeper into Chad\u00b4s ear, and all I could do was giving me into my fate...damn, what has happened on the outside? What did Chad even do? And...where would I end up?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Considering that it was originally supposed to be a normal day, things indeed turned out to be quite different from my expectations - not that I am not used to that by now, though, after all those adventures I\u00b4ve been through. And that was exactly the reason for me to take a break, so to speak. With my luck, I could not possibly be sure when I would run into an (endosomatic) adventure with one of my best pals again, so it seemed like a good idea for me to spend some time with my pals in an ordinary way, without things going awry and me as well as someone else at times ending up within the belly of one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on this day, I decided that visiting Chad would be quite a good idea. He might have been younger than Jon, Erik, MiJ and me, but that did not mean he was not as important as a friend to me. In fact, I was sometimes amazed how sophisticated he was for a 14 year old, and what kind of refined mannerisms as well as speech patterns he was able to use at times, and his taste in all kinds of art was quite surprising as well. But more importantly, he was a great friend of mine, almost like some sort of a younger brother, at least that\u00b4s how the rest of us sometimes referred to him in order to show our appreciation for his friendship. And the two of us alone also spent quite some time together hanging around in his room and talking about all kinds of things...video games, movies, our writing projects in the internet, sometimes about the time Jon and me ended up on a journey inside Chad\u00b4s body after we shrunk down (still likes to hear what it must have been like for us to see one of our friends from the inside and struggling to eventually escape Chad\u00b4s wondrous inner world...though he did not seem to be embarrassed about having had us withing his body, on the contrary, he thought it was kinda cool, despite his worries about our well being)...and of course, sometimes about girls as well, considering that Chad had reached the age where boys begin to develop romantic feelings toward girls, and he asked me quite often how I was so lucky to end up together with someone as gorgeous and kind-hearted as my beloved Kokoro, but all advice I could honestly give him was to be patient and to await the things to come, the moment he sees a girl and knows that she must be the one, and in case it happens one day, he simply has to be himself, and the girls will certainly like him. From what I can tell, after all, the truly beautiful girls (on the inside and on the outside) really dig a good personality and honest love for them, as my unbelievable luck with Kokoro ultimately proved to me. And there was no denying that Chad was a great person, and that girls would love to be together with someone as nice as him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when I went to visit him on that day, I did not really feel the urge to discuss these problems again. As I desperately needed a break from my past misadventures (that still did not decrease my fascination and excitement for endosomatophilia, though), I simply wanted to spend our time doing our favorite pastimes, like playing some video games, for that matter. And on my way to Chad\u00b4s home, I was already looking forward to that, especially since he had and still has a great taste in video games, at least that\u00b4s what I can tell as a video game expert myself. Or...perhaps he would have convinced me to join in and watch his favorite anime show Love Hina. Not exactly m favorite, though, but I knew he was quite a passionate fan of the series, and watching it together him always turned out to be quite some fun I\u00b4d never want to miss under any circumstances. And I simply cannot deny that it is somewhat...well, interesting to see him getting dreamy whenever he sees the character of Shinobu appear on the screen...to say it\u00b4s his favorite female character in any fantasy novel, series, anime, cartoon or movie would be an understatement, and his admiration for her is more than apparent. Of course I was not the one to make fun of him for that...on the contrary, if there was anyone in this world able to understand him, then it was me...judging from my crush on a certain fantasy girl named Tifa, I guess...^^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, looking forward to either playing some video games with him or watching some anime (presumably Love Hina...), I finally reached Chad\u00b4s home, walking toward the door and knocking on it, waiting for him to let me in. As he told me, his parents were away on that day, so the two of us would certainly have enough time to do our pastimes...well, at least that\u00b4s what I thought until I got that weird idea that brought me into trouble once again...</span></div></div>",

In the family room.\" Chad said in a weak voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulian heard a few shouts and clashing sounds coming from the room Chad was in. As he walked through the kitchen and the family room came into view, he saw Chad bundled up in a blanket, sitting on a reclined chair, and playing Kingdom Hearts 2. Next to him was a small table with a bowl of soup, a glass of water, and a package of cold pills sitting on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Judging by the scene I see here: you've obviously caught that cold that's been going around, your parents are not home at the moment, and you just hit level 100 on Kingdom Hearts 2.\" Julian depicted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Julian Sith picks 'D.)

We'll just have to cure you.\" Julian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not as easy as casting the curaga spell, ya know.\" Chad said, refering to his game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, I can rush right home and whip something up to cure your sickness. Traditional family remedies always work for me.\" Julian said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you think it'll help. I don't want you to go to all this trouble for my sake. *cough*\" Chad said, getting himself into a coughing fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to worry, I know just the thing. Be back in a flash.\" Julian said, walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Chad know, Julian had no intentions of curing him with a family remedy.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before I even ran out of Chad\u00b4s living room, I quickly stopped in view of something that just came to my mind. That so called \"remedy\" I spoke of...it was not exactly at home, as I told Chad moments before. I realized that I had the necessary item with me, and I started to grin. So things would be transpiring a lot faster than I originally thought...<br>\r\nWhen I saw Chad like this, affected by the cold that has been spreading throughout the town at that time of the year, something told me that I had to help him in order to get better. Chad was one of my best friends, after all, and even though it might have been just a plain cold he had been suffering from, I still thought that as his friend, I should do something about it, and of course I had not some plain remedy in mind when I told Chad about my intentions. No, I was planning on getting rid of the bacteria lurking deep within his body in another, rather ridiculous sounding way...however, in a way that would certainly be exciting beyond compare and that at least sounded like Chad and me could still do something together on that afternoon...only in another way than we both had planned before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I immediately turned back to Chad, who was still sitting under his cozy blanket while masterfully playing Kingdom Hearts II in a way that made me realize that he really must have gotten into that game, and that he indeed was an expert on it, which is not really a surprise when I see now that he had reached level 100 at that point of time. Anyway, even though Chad was quite busy beating the crap out of one of the Organization XIII members near the end of the game, he paused the game as he noticed that I was immediately turning around to him and coming back. Admittedly, having seen him like that really made me think that it really was not such a horrible disease he was suffering from...merely a cold he would quickly recover from in two days or so, and after all, playing Kingdom Hearts II is not a bad pastime at all. Nevertheless, an illness is still an illness, and I thought it was my duty as Chad\u00b4s older and more experienced friend to help him out here with my gained wisdom of...shrinkages and certain travels that can result from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Julian, didn\u00b4t you want to go back home and get that remedy you spoke of? *cough*\" Chad then asked, sounding slightly confused.<br>\r\n\"Well, as a matter of fact...I just realized that I have that remedy I mentioned with me, so I do not even have to go home and get it. What a pleasant coincidence, huh?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you bet. Well, then give me that remedy and let\u00b4s see what it can accomplish.\" Chad then eagerly said, having not the slightest idea about what I was actually intending to do.<br>\r\n\"Chad, I guess I\u00b4ll have to explain something to you. That \"remedy\" I spoke of...is not some kind of family remedy or something like that.\"<br>\r\n\"Huh? Julian, what are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n\"Uhm...it\u00b4s a little difficult for me to explain, but...well, let\u00b4s say we\u00b4ll show these bacteria personally that it was unwise of them to enter your body and give you the cold!\" I said, trying to sound intentionally weird and as if I was joking, hoping that Chad would get my more than obvious allusion.<br>\r\n\"...I guess I can\u00b4t follow you...\" Chad then said, staring at me with an expression that told me how flabbergasted he was about my words.<br>\r\n\"Well...I thought I will take care of these bacteria myself!\" I then said, sounding like it was the easiest thing on earth for me to do, pulling my daring and dangerous plan off, as if it was my profession, my passion or my hobby, and somehow, all three of them could even be fitting descriptions.<br>\r\n\"Wait a sec...Julian, you don\u00b4t mean...that you want to shrink yourself down...and enter my body in order to destroy these bacteria?\" Chad then asked with an expression of disbelief in his voice.<br>\r\n\"Hm...technically speaking...yup. That\u00b4s what I am intending to do.\"<br>\r\nChad let out a deep sigh as he finally realized what I wanted to do...as seen in countless cartoons or comic books, or as he experienced himself when Jon and me shrunk down because of the casting of that ancient Norse spell back then that has gone terribly wrong and eventually sent us into Chad\u00b4s body, so to speak.<br>\r\nJudging from his reaction, he almost had expected me to say this, and that he himself was not really overjoyed about my idea, and judging from Chad\u00b4s character, he was mainly worried about my safety, and being the good person he is, he normally would have never allowed me to risk my life for him simply because of a common cold, seeing that he would never allow any of his friends to get into trouble, as he cares about them a lot. But hey, it was my passion and my duty at the same time, and I was quite sure that it would turn out to be an extraordinary trip. All I had to wait for now was Chad\u00b4s reaction and his answer to my idea, whether he would even let me enter his body...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Actually, Chad\u00b4s reaction did not surprise me at all, as it was just what I expected from a friend like him: it should have been crystal clear to me that he would never allow me to get myself into a dangerous situation because of a rather minor thing like a cold. As Chad said, colds usually come and go rather quickly, and his immune system with the help of some medicaments and some vitamin C would certainly take care of these bacteria in a matter of days - judging from my knowledge, a person infected by the common cold take about 3 - 5 days to recover. And after all, it was merely a minor viral infectuous disease of Chad\u00b4s upper respiratory system and the most common of all known human diseases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I know that Chad is a great friend, an impressively sophisticated person for his rather young age and an extremely caring person who considers friendship to be the most valuable good in life. And putting my life at risk merely in order to make him recover from his disease in one or two days instead of three or four days seemed like lunacy to him, and there was actually no chance at all to convince him otherwise. And truth be told, out of our \"gang\" consisting of MiJ, Erik, Jon, Chad and me, I was practically the first one Chad befriended before I introduced him to the others, which was yet another reason for him to object. In some way, though, it was still kinda surprising that he did not approve of my idea, since he should have known that I was some sort of a veteran when it comes to such inner-body travels, having lived through all my adventures without getting hurt, and I certainly knew Chad\u00b4s insides as well - and so does Jon. So honestly, I did not think it would be that dangerous - on the contrary, I thought it would turn out to be a fun ride, and I saw it as a chance to finally experience such an endosoma adventure on my own free will, without me getting swallowed by accident or unwittingly falling into someone\u00b4s ear...and due to my brand-new special equipment an old friend of mine provided me with, I expected it to be a harmless voyage, anyway, a voyage where I can have some fun at long last and help a friend as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo me, it was decided: I\u00b4d go inside Chad, anyway, no matter whether he was worried about me or not. I just cannot ignore a friend in need even though he assures me that he is alright, especially not a good friend like Chad. And...well, there was no need to tell him about my adventure inside him, anyway...<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I will leave you alone now. Hope you will feel better soon, Chad.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Julian. And please know that I really do appreciate your idea to cure me like this...but it\u00b4s just too dangerous. You and Jon told me what it was like, and I do not want you to get into trouble because of a mere cold. *cough* Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n\"I know, I know, Chad. You really a are good friend, and I appreciate your worries.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n\"Good bye, then. Have some fun beating the crap out of Xemnas!\"<br>\r\n\"I sure will. Oh, and call me tomorrow, so we can decide when we should meet.\"<br>\r\n\"Yup, no problem.\"<br>\r\n\"Bye, Julian!\"<br>\r\nWith that, he coughed again and turned back to the screen, continuing to play Kingdom Hearts II. I waved good bye, and left his living room through the door in front of me and went into his kitchen. I closed the door behind me, so Chad would not see what I was about to do. <br>\r\n\"Good. As long as he\u00b4s playinh Kingdom Hearts II, he\u00b4ll never notice...\" I whispered to myself with a smile. If there was a game with the ability to captivate Chad, then it was Kingdom Hearts II, without a doubt, and it was surely more than understandable.<br>\r\n\"Time to initiate phase 1.\" I jokingly said to myself, imitating a character from some cheesy sci-fi movie or series. I put my hand into my pocket and carefully grabbed an extremely small cube - almost invisible, even as I carefully held it between my pointer finger and my thumb and brought my eyes closer to it. I always put this thing into a seperate pocket with nothing else in it, so I\u00b4d always find this tiny thingy.<br>\r\nI then slowly put it onto the kitchen floor in front of me, looking down at it.<br>\r\n\"Gee...sometimes I\u00b4m wondering at what size I should keep this thing...\"<br>\r\nAs in fact, this hardly visible cube contained a most essential part of my upcoming voyage - the vehicle I needed in order to move and navigate throughout Chad\u00b4s body. I would simply open the cube with a special device once the shrinking procedure was complete, and then...onward and upward! Or INward...if you will. <br>\r\nThen I openened the left pocket of my jacket and put out a device that might have been shaped like a TV remote and was even about the same size, but I knew too well what it was for. <br>\r\nMy fingers began to push a few buttons on the device, since I learned exactly what to do in order to start the procedure, and in a matter of seconds, I saw a message on the tiny screen on the upper half of the remote: \"Affirmative. Commence Shrinking Procedure. Target: Master Julian.\"<br>\r\n\"Excellent.\" I whispered, as a strange, wobbling and transparent energy field began to emanate from the remote and engulfed me completely. Surrounded by this strange mass of energy, I smiled, while at the same time, I was wondering how I should be entering Chad\u00b4s body. Since the cold affected his upper respiratory system, hence his throat and lungs, it might have been a good idea to enter through his nose, but maybe the mouth would do as well, even though there was the risk of me and the vehicle ending up inside Chad\u00b4s stomach instead...<br>\r\n\"Only a few more seconds...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So there I was again, in this almost ridiculous seeming situation...shrunk down to a pathetic size, probably as big as a grain of dust, practically invisible to the human eye (or, in my special case, to Chad\u00b4s eyes...), which was of course my intention...unlike in most of the other cases when I got myself into this kind of trouble. Therefore, this situation was actually quite different from my other fantastic voyages, because this time, I did it on my own free will, because I wanted to help a very good friend of mine...and because I was just too intrigued by this idea. It was almost as if I simply had to do this, as if my fascination for these weird situations drove me into doing this as well. <br>\r\nStill, it was quite a familiar feeling, too...now that the interior of Chad\u00b4s kitchen was towering above me with astronomic proportions, making me seem insignificant. The fridge alone, for example, appeared to me as if it was as huge as the Olympus Mons...so, scarily huge would be the right word to choose, and I could already imagine that Chad was easily as gigantic. Nevertheless, I was intrigued...very intrigued, remembering the times when this happened to me before, and how I was still able to survive despite my size. As a wise man once said, \"size matters not\", and I chuckled at that thought. Indeed, size does not matter at all...even if I was merely as tiny as a grain of dust, it was in my power to rid my friend\u00b4s body of these annoying bacteria that gave him that cold in the first place. And the sooner he was cured, the better it would have been especially for Chad, not only because we would have been able to hang around a little sooner than planned, no...he would have also been able to arrange a little date with his new girlfriend sooner than expected - something he was of course not able to with a cold. He only told me a few days earlier that he found \"her\", a girl he hopelessly fell in love with and that she shared his feelings...and the two of them wanted to spend some time together as soon as possible, therefore my intervention as a \"Micronaut\" would have provided chad with another vast advantage - and hey, anything for my pal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned around in order to see the cube I had put onto the ground earlier, and while it had almost been invisible earlier, it was now as big as a house compared to me. Once again, I took out the remote control, typing in a certain command that would finally initiate my journey. In a matter of seconds, one side of the cube began to open, revealing...a futuristic vehicle (what else did you expect? ^^). It was about twice as big as a car, and speaking of which, it had this \"fresh, new car smell\", since it has never been used before...until that day. In terms of mere looks, it somehow resembled a one-man submarine, even though the cockpit provided me with enough room to walk around inside a little, and there was also enough room in the back for the equipment I needed - the equipment that has already been installed.<br>\r\n\"He he...thanks a lot, Jon.\" I whispered to myself, unable to get rid of that damn smile on my face. After all, my good friend Jon had made this possible for me in the first place - and believe me, it\u00b4s a long story. However, I eagerly went into the submarine-like vehicle Jon has called \"The Aesculapius\", named after the Greek demigod of healing and medicine, even though Jon himself was not sure whether he should name the ship \"The Aesculapius\" or \"The Asklepios\", since he simply could not choose between the Latin and Greek spelling - even though I proposed that perhaps he should simply settle with the English spelling \"The Asclepius\"...<br>\r\nDespite the controversy revolving around its name, this endosoma-ship had the great advantage that it would make my journey as easy as possible, actually the complete opposite of the countless times before where I was practically helpless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot so anymore! As I started the engines, I began to smile with determination, piloting the ship off the vast ground of the kitchen and flying toward the gigantic door that would lead back into the living room, where Chad was still playing Kingdom Hearts II, unaware of my \"return\". My destination? I settled for his soup, in the end, so I decided that I would simply land the ship in his bowl of soup and patiently wait for him to eat me...risky, but it sounded like fun!</span></div></div>",

I mixed the contents up with my spoon, making sure I got the same amount of chicken and noodle in it. I took a spoonful and slurped it up, savoring the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChicken noodle soup was my favorite, but not the Campbell's brand. They always put too much noodle and not enough chicken.

But I can do absolutely nothing but curse my fate... DAMN YOU ANYMA!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasnt that long ago when I first met Anyma.

I, however, was only more and more intrigued by her mastery of the dark arts! Sure, she wasnt tongue-droppingly hot like Julian's girlfriend, Kokoro, but to me she was irresistable! Besides, having such a powerful and dangerous woman by your side isnt necessarily a BAD thing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, one day Julian came to visit us... I introduced him to the new girl in my life, Anyma!<br>\r\n\"Julian, id like you to meet the new girl in my life, Anyma!\"<br>\r\n\"Pleasure to meet you!\" he extended his hand.. but Anyma just does a little curtsy to him, \"Likewise.

My jaw dropped as I turned to her, \"ANYMA, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING???!!!\" She just smiled a cute little innocent smile, \"Heh! The fire isnt real! It's just an illusion, you idiot!\" That's when Julian stopped and touched his head... he couldnt feel the fire! It wasnt even hot! It was all fake! Anyma snapped her fingers again and made the fake-flame disappear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyma laughed a little, and I tried desperately not along with her, but Julian didnt seem to take to kindly to her joke...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily i was there to change the subject, \"Allright, allright! Look, are either of you thirsty? Im gonna go get some drinks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have a Sprite,\" Julian says. \"7-Up for me,\" Anyma tells me.

I already found out how weird my life could really get during the several occasions where I ended up being shrunk and INSIDE the body of my best friend, Jon. The things I had to witness there were...well, amazing doesn\u00b4t even begin to do them justice! The experience of a lifetime, something I will certainly never forget. And with Jon being a scientific genius, I knew that he was involved in the creation of some inventions due to the company he worked for, and I saw things no one would have ever dreamed of.<br>\r\nBut little did I know that something was about to happen that would be equally amazing as my past adventures...and even more dangerous, for both me and my friend Michael!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael was my best friend together with Jon, so to speak, and I knew both of them for a LONG while. And both were equally important to me, so they were my best friends, and God, there\u00b4s no way any of them could have been more important to me: together with Kokoro, my dear girlfriend, they were something like a triumvirate of friends who earned their place in my heart fair and square. Each of them was equally important to me, mainly because all of them were simply great and wonderful friends to me. In fact, they were like a family to me, with Jon and Michael being as close as brothers to me, while Kokoro...well, you can imagine how much I adore and love her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd one day, Mike invited me to visit him and his new girlfriend...Anyma. And what he told me about her sounded quite unique, to say the least. According to him, Anyma mastered the so called dark arts, which seemed to be something like magic. Surely a sane person would have known that this is ridiculous, and that magic does not exist. But after everything I had experienced in my life, after all those weird events with and inside Jon, there seemed to be nothing in this world that could be considered to be impossible...<br>\r\nJon already had warned me when I told him about Michael\u00b4s new girlfriend. Of course he and Mike were pals as well, but he seemed to be a bit skeptical about this whole thing, and he told me that I should be careful whenever dark arts are involved, even though a dependable person like Michael was with me. <br>\r\nOf course I paid heed to heed to his words, but I thought that Michael\u00b4s presence alone would make things less dangerous than they could be...that is, if that girl really could perform some dark arts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut somehow, I already felt bad when I entered Mike\u00b4s house on that fateful day and saw that Anyma for the very first time. Judging from her looks, she was unique, to say the least, a red haired girl with red and blue pupils and some scary black robes. One can imagine I was kinda surprised when I first saw her through the door to Mike\u00b4s house, that Michael would have her as a girlfriend...but then again, I always used to say \"Never judge a book by its cover\", and that Anyma was not exactly an ugly person...she was quite pretty, even though not as gorgeous as my dear Kokoro, but that depends on one\u00b4s point of view. To Mike, she certainly was gorgeous, and to me, my Kokoro was gorgeous. Easy as that, although I admit that Anyma was really good looking. Still...there was something about her that made me feel uncomfortable. I was feeling so unsettled when I looked into her eyes, as if she seemed to be more than her looks gave away.<br>\r\nMichael, as polite and friendly as he is, lead me into his house, and practically the first thing he did was introducing me to his new girlfriend. When I looked at her again, it seemed to me as if she was giving me a devious smile, but I thought that it was just my imagination.<br>\r\n\"Julian, I\u00b4d like you to meet the new girl in my life, Anyma!\" he then spoke, and he surely sounded proud of her. He had every right to be, a great person like Michael deserves a kind girlfriend he loves. He\u00b4s my best friend together with Jon, after all. But still...something about Anyma did not seem to be all right, I could feel it. But of course I did not voice my concern, for Mike\u00b4s sake, and after, it might have been just my imagination. So I extended my hand in order to shake Anyma\u00b4s hand prove myself to be a polite man, worth of being called Michael\u00b4s friend.<br>\r\n\"Pleasure to meet you!\" I said, but instead of extending her hand, she just gave me a strange and somehow creepy look, then she did a slight curtsy to me, which looked kinda forced and unnatural, as if it was a pain in the ass for her to do this. But again, I thought it was just my imagination.<br>\r\n\"Likewise. So you\u00b4re Michael\u00b4s friend, are you?\" she then asked, and she sounded a bit friendlier this time.<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes, that\u00b4s right!\" I replied.<br>\r\nIn order to break the ice completely, so to speak, I tried to change the subject to those infamous dark arts she was talking about.<br>\r\n\"Hey, is it true you know black magic?!\" I then asked, sounding like small child, eager to see some cool show. And suddenly, her mood changed entirely.<br>\r\n\"Why, yes it is!\" she then exclaimed, with a child-like smile, obviously eager to show off her skills. It was kinda obvious that she was proud of her skills, and that she was happy to show them.<br>\r\n\"Hey, why don\u00b4t you show him one of those little tricks of yours?\" Michael then asked her, and he sounded like he wanted to break the ice as well. It was too obvious that he wanted me, probably his best friend, and Anyma, his girlfriend, to get along together, and of course I did not want to disappoint him in that regard, and it was not that I wasn\u00b4t interested in seeing some of those ominous dark magic tricks.<br>\r\n\"I\u00b4d be glad to!\" she yelled happily (even though to me, there seemed to be a slight evil tone in this exclamation). Then, all she did was snapping with her fingers.<br>\r\nAt first I was kinda confused, because nothing seemed to be happening...until I realized a few seconds later that Anyma has caused my hair to catch fire! In panic, I began to scream and threw myself onto the ground, rolling around in order to make the flames vanish, but it did not work. That bitch! I knew something did not feel right about her! And now this mess! Hopefully, Michael would realize that someone like her did not deserve him as a boyfriend! But more importantly, I had to get rid of those flames before they\u00b4d burn my head off!<br>\r\n\"ANYMA, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING??????!!!!!!!\" I could hear Michael\u00b4s voice shouting, and it was clear that he was shocked and upset as well.<br>\r\nYet what followed now left me quite awe struck, honestly. Because Anyma finally commented on my misery...and chuckled!!!! That mean woman was laughing about my horrible situation and the fire devouring my head! I could not believe it!<br>\r\n\"Hehe, the fire isn\u00b4t real! It\u00b4s just an illusion, you idiot!\"<br>\r\nI don\u00b4t know whether she was calling me an idiot or Michael, but when heard these words, I stopped rolling around on the ground like a maniac and touched my head in order to see whether she was right. She was. To my surprise, my head did not hurt in the least bit, and I could not even feel the heat of the flames. So these flames on my head were really just a stupid illusion...<br>\r\nSnapping with her fingers again, the image of the flames ultimately disappeared, so there was no doubt that she was just playing a trick on me...<br>\r\nOf course, Anyma was laughing maniacally about my surprise and how I was acting when I thought the flames would kill me. Well...you can imagine I was NOT laughing! I was even about to say something to her, something mean in order to defend myself against her behavior. But fortunately (?), my respect for Michael and his feelings for that girl, as well as his intervention, prevented me from shouting out my anger at her.<br>\r\n\"All right, all right! Look are either of you thirsty? I\u00b4m gonna get some drinks!\"<br>\r\nAnd miraculously, Michael\u00b4s voice seemed to have a calming effect on me. He was my best bud together with Jon, after all, and I knew he did not like the way Anyma treated me, but...heck, he was in love with her! And I accepted that, so I was NOT going to screw this for him, there was no way I would! If there would have been something he did not like about Kokoro, he would not have reacted in a mean way, either, out of respect for me. And being best friends, we have a hell lot of respect for each other and especially our decisions, so I let go off my attempts to tell that Anyma my \"opinion\" about this mean trick. Who knows...maybe she wasn\u00b4t even THAT bad, after all...maybe I just had to know her better?<br>\r\nAnyway, my anger was gone when I looked into Michael\u00b4s face that told me that he was trying to cool the situation down. And I did, as I wanted him to be happy with the girl of his life...even if it was Anyma...Even though I respected his choice of THAT girl, I was still glad that I found Kokoro...MUCH cuter than Anyma, from my humble point of view.<br>\r\n\"I\u00b4ll have a sprite.\" I answered his question about what drink I\u00b4d like.<br>\r\n\"7-Up for me.\" Anyma then said, and Michael immediately went into the kitchen in order to get us the cool drinks to quench our thirst.<br>\r\nAs I stood there, next to Anyma, a thought crossed my mind. Maybe...maybe I could use the short time between us in order to say something nice. I knew that if she and me got along well, Mike would be overjoyed, and boy, I\u00b4d do everything for a friend like him.<br>\r\n\"Pretty cool magic you performed, I have to admit that.\" I told her. Well, I lied, of course, because such a mean trick was everything but \"cool\" to me. But still, I wanted to sound nice and interested in her favourite subject.<br>\r\n\"Thank you...Julian, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, the name\u00b4s Julian. I guess Michael told you already.\"<br>\r\n\"Well of course he did. He said you\u00b4re his best pal.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, did he? Now, that\u00b4s really nice of him! But yeah, we are great friends, that\u00b4s right.\"<br>\r\n\"...say...would you want to see...more of my magic?\" she then asked, and admittedly, I did not like the tone of her voice. Still...I had to be nice, so I overlooked this observation.<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah, I...\"<br>\r\nBefore I could even answer, and before Michael was ready with the drinks, I suddenly saw a flash before my eyes, and in a matter of seconds, everything went dark around me....I fell onto the ground, being unconscious. It was only later on that day that I found out what this monster did to me...</span></div></div>",

I admit: that was a little cruel to play with my best friend like that. The poor guy nearly had a heart-attack from the experience! Still, I tried to shake off that scary experience and just grab a 7-up and a Sprite from the fridge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after I pulled out the sodas, i looked over my shoulder and into the living room... I couldve sworn I saw Anyma talking to the palm of her hand... she was whispering something, and I couldnt see what it was in her hand... nah... probably just my imagination.... (NOPE!!!!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, I walked into the room.. \"Ok! I got you the sodas and... uh... where's Julian?\" \"OH...um..\" Anyma quickly closed her hand and said, \"he said he had somewhere to be right now, so he couldnt stay long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a shame... guess I'll have to drink his Sprite,\" I popped open MY Sprite and handed Anyma her 7-Up... but then I got a little curious of what she had in her hand... \"Hey, uh... what's that in your hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, THIS hand?\" she raised it while keeping it closed. \"Yeah, that one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyma opened her hand... and inside it was.... a sugar packet? \"It's just a little bit of rare sugar I got from overseas... this stuff is GREAT in drinks!\" Oh, it was not ordinary sugar... oh it probably wasnt even sugar PERIOD!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe popped open her soda can, ripped off the top of her little packet and poured this 'sugar' into her drink... she tilted her head back and lifted the can near her mouth about to drink it.... luckily, I stopped her before she could drink it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say... is that sugar stuff really any good?\" I asked her. \"Oh yes...\" she grinned, \"DEFFINITELY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...mind if I have a sip?\" I asked. She pulled out a little straw from a pocket in her dress and handed it to me... \"Be my guest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put the straw into her soda and took a tiny little sip... however, it went done the wrong pipe.. causing me to start a coughing fit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*COUGH!!* *COUGH!!!!!*\" I fell to the ground and started pounding my chest... I think a bit of it was sucked up into my lungs! It felt like I wound up breathing a speck of this 'sugar' in!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael dear??! Are you allright?!\" she asked me in concern and started patting my back! After a while, I finally breathed regularly again, \".....Y..Yeah... Im fine now... thanks, Anyma!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at me, \"Geez, dont you go scaring me like that! Perhaps my special-sugar isnt for everyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....if only I knew what was REALLY in that sugar...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the Gods...what the bloody hell did happen to me yet again? Is it that I somehow attract mischievous and obscure situations? Do I have a bad karma? Is it that I am masterful in getting myself into trouble? Or do I have just bad luck more often than others - if it can be considered bad luck, some might also say luck in terms of having some excitement, excitement I could sometimes live without, quite honestly. I honestly don\u00b4t know, but somehow, it shouldn\u00b4t have been a surprise for me that once again, luck was not exactly on my side to say the least, something I was slowly getting tired of after having experienced on more than one ocassion...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI somehow knew all along that this Anyma was up to no good, that she was not the sweet and lovely girlfriend of Mike, even though it depends on someone\u00b4s point of view whether she can be seen as sweet or cute, considering that Anyma was kinda...exotic, so to speak, and I knew that Michael had a thing for unique and exotic girls that are intriguing in a certain way, at least different from the normal fare, if you will. So it was understandable that Mike fell for her, and of course I was okay with his decision, as it is his life, but just looking at Anyma for the first time gave me a bad feeling somehow. Something about her did not feel right, and it was not just the fact that she knew the ways of Dark Magic...this girl had an aura that even being in the same room with her made me shudder slightly, but I tried to shrug it off for Mike\u00b4s sake - he\u00b4s my best pal along with Jon, and getting along with his girlfriend seemed quite important to me, no matter how difficult it might have seemed due to Anyma\u00b4s...\"special\" features that made getting along with her nearly impossible, unfortunately, but it seemed like Mike did not really care about that, he was obviously intoxicated by her mere presence, and it was pretty clear that he was madly in love with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the evidence for her vile and true nature was unfortunately delivered to me in a most unfortunate way, making me practically the first person ever to experience the wickedness of Anyma...and her obsessiveness. After this flash of light, emanating from Anyma herself, hit my body, I was unable to realize what had truly happened to me, at least at first. Seconds after this sudden event, I was only barely conscious, unable to open my eyes, unable to feel anything...only my ears were still able to perceive any sound coming from my surroundings, and to my great dismay, it was Anyma\u00b4s voice I heard, and even though it was pretty obvious that she was whispering, her voice still sounded impressive and actually even a little louder than normal.<br>\r\n\"You know...Michael is a real cutie...and he\u00b4s all mine! And none of his friends...will get between us! Chad, Erik, Jon*...and you! I\u00b4ll take care of all of you! And you have the honor...of being the first one to get out of my way! Have some fun...little man!\"<br>\r\nThe tone of her voice was unbelievably mean and sadistic, as if she was going to do something horrible to me - and that she would enjoy it greatly. And honestly, her words indeed did indicate that she would really do such a horrible thing to me, as I would see only moments later.<br>\r\nThen, I was finally able to open my eyes again after the shock I received from Anyma\u00b4s mean \"trick\", and to my big surprise...I couldn\u00b4t really see anything, at least nothing of any true significance. All I could see around me was some white substance, appearing like a gigantic white wall with several small gaps in between that allowed some light to break into my \"prison\". <br>\r\n\"What the hell...?! Where am I?!\"<br>\r\nNow that I fully regained my senses, I slowly began to realize what had happened to me, and I tried to touch this \"white wall\" around me in order to see what it was.<br>\r\n\"Hm? Wait a sec...isn\u00b4t that...\"<br>\r\nAfter my fingers had touched its surface, I brought my pointer finger to my mouth and put it onto my tongue.<br>\r\n\"That tastes like...sugar?!\"<br>\r\nThe fact alone that I was now officially surrounded by sugar was bad enough, but then I realized that I was indeed surrounded by huge grains of sugar, each of them being as easily as big as me.<br>\r\n\"That damn witch! What did she do to me?!\" I yelled, and now, my anger at her was even bigger than before, because this was not just some harmless illusion like my burning hair before. This time, I really was in serious trouble, with no idea where I was and whether Anyma did something to me with that spell. But at least I now knew that Anyma really had some knowledge of the so called dark arts, and that one could indeed consider her to be an evil witch. Looks like I was right about her true personality all along...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it didn\u00b4t take me long to realize where that wicked witch had brought me with her spell. Suddenly, I felt my environment shaking violently from my point of view at least, causing me to bump against these giant walls of sugar with my back and giving me quite a painful sensation in the process - just because it\u00b4s merely sugar doesn\u00b4t mean it was not a rough ride for me. The shaking did not last for too long, though, only a few seconds, as if this \"prison\" I was caught inside was being turned around from the outside. And then...then I could Anyma talking again. But this time, not to me in order to mock me or anything...instead, she was talking Mike, who had just returned from the kitchen! I can\u00b4t remember the exact content of their conversation, but what I definitely know was that she was referring to a pack of sugar...inside her hand! That\u00b4s when my eyes began to widen, realizing in horror what kind of spell she really did cast on me: a shrink-spell! So that meant that she...wanted to dispose of me by consuming me?! As a part of a pack of sugar?! I knew this witch was completely nuts and dangerous, but that was just outrageous! It\u00b4s not that I was not used to it, but I would have never expected that a fellow human being would be able to do something as cruel to someone. Anyway, even though the two of them continued to talk, I paid no heed to what they were saying. Instead, I focues on the only thing I could possibly do at that moment: trying to get my best friend\u00b4s help! Mike was the only one who was able to save me from a grim fate by the hands of Anyma, so I began to shout his name, hoping that I would be able to make him hear me despite Anyma herself talking to him at that moment!<br>\r\n\"MIKE! MIKE, DON\u00b4T TRUST HER! MIKE...!\"<br>\r\nToo late. Before I could give it another try, everything around me began to shake, and I realized that I was falling down now...with no idea where to, and whether I would even survive, since all I could see around me were those gigantic cubes of sugar falling down with me, accompanying on my way to certain doom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after only a few seconds, my fall stopped abruptly as I found my body hitting the surface of some liquid, and judging from the sensation on my skin, it was not water or anything. I swam up as quickly as possible, back up to the surface of the liquid, gasping for air desperately. <br>\r\n\"Wait a moment...that\u00b4s...7-Up?!\" I yelled, staring down at the liquid me and the sugar cubes were swimming in, with the humongous cubes beginning to melt in the slightly acidic 7-Up slowly but surely. 7-Up...so this must have been Anyma\u00b4s can...which meant that she was about to drink me! And there was nothing I could have done; I realized as much. Mike wouldn\u00b4t be able to hear me, that much was clear to me, especially since he still seemed to be busy talking to Anyma. Again, I did not heed their conversation, since I had BIGGER problems to face: the current I was trapped in began to tilt downwards, and I know what this means: Anyma must have started drinking the 7-Up! Of course, I was unable to see her face or anything else outside, for one because the cubes of sugar, still not molten and dissolved by the acids of the soda yet, were still blocking my view, and after all, this sudden motion sent me underwater again, being washed away together with the sugary and sticky content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, after just a few seconds, the soda suddenly stopped rushing toward Anyma\u00b4s mouth as the can of 7-Up was suddenly being brought back into its initial position, washing gallons of soda over my tiny body in the process and threatening to bring me to a wet grave on the ground of the can...perhaps by drowning, perhaps by dying under the pressure of the soda...the problem was that at this moment, this scenario seemed more than likely, since despite my struggles, I was not able to swim up to the surface again, and unlike when you\u00b4re inside water, breathing was an even bigger issue down there, due to the liquid\u00b4s acidic nature. While I was quite busy with my fight for survival, I was barely able to hear what Mike and Anyma were saying at that moment, and I did not even realize the motion of the can coming from the outside...with results I would be able to see only a little later on.<br>\r\nAnd then, as if struggling to get to the surface again wasn\u00b4t already exhausting enough, my situation worsened again as the current was being tilted again, causing the gallons of soda to rush toward the opening of the can again - and this time, nothing would stop this event from happening. With the cubes of sugar finally having molten down to a degree that they would allow me to see what was in front of me. Which I was now able to do, since miraculously, I managed to get back to the surface once again, trying to get as much precious oxygen into my lungs again, although smaller waves of soda were still washing over me due to the movement of the current. Looking into the direction the soda was floating toward, all I could see was the opening of the can getting bigger and bigger the nearer I was being washed toward it, and of course what was lying behind, a sight I knew only too well: a huge, gaping maw, with all the interiors being perfectly visible. The rows of gigantic teeth, the humongous tongue, ready to receive the current...and the uvula, dangling menacingly in the back of the mouth. Of course, I assumed this was Anyma\u00b4s mouth, having been unable to realize what was really going on and only seeing the insides of this giant mouth. It was as if time itself stood still, but after only a fraction of a second, all these reddish, organic interiors of the mouth were now surrounding me, as I had passed the rows of teeth along with the current, being washed over the humongous tongue beneath me in this unbelievably gigantic cave. Although I somehow managed to keep my head above the surface of the rushing soda, I made no attempt to swim against the current whatsoever. Seeing the back of the mouth coming closer and closer, I knew that there was no escape, and that any attempt to elude the abyss of the esophagus would have been futile and in vain. It was as if my will had been broken completely within a matter of seconds, in view of the hopelessness of everything. So that was it...the end. I knew that surviving a fall into a human stomach did not necessarily mean instant death for me - after all, I am the living proof for being able to survive such an experience - but since I was thinking that I was ending up inside Anyma\u00b4s stomach...well, I was quite sure that trying to get out of her again would be nearly impossible, given the fact that she had some magical capabilities as her assests, so she would have certainly been able to foresee my attempts to escape her body. And knowing what kind of an obsessive gal she was...she would have tried EVERYTHING to keep me inside her. Little chance for me to see the daylight again...<br>\r\nI just felt sorry for Mike...what if her jealousy and obsessivenes would went even farther than she displayed so far, and what would she do to keep him with her? I just wished I could have warned him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a few inches left until the current reached the back of the mouth...normally, it\u00b4s a most fascinating experience, but not at that moment. I closed my eyes in digust instead, as I just did not want to see the things to come. The insides of Anyma were not exactly a sight I had to perceive with my own eyes, after all. At least I felt this sudden turn of my environment as the current entered the esophagus, with the direction being clear now: down...<br>\r\nHowever, then something happened - something which I still don\u00b4t know what to think of nowadays. Beyond all probability, I found myself being separated from the masses of soda, which caused me to open my eyes in surprise.<br>\r\nNo, I was not going down...at least not the way I imagined. Instead of falling down the esophagus, I was being engulfed by a weak stream of air coming from the windpipe, which eventually freed me from the soda...and sucked me into the windpipe instead! Whether that was better or worse - I don\u00b4t know. What I knew, however, was that the organic walls around me, the confines of the entrance to the windpipe - these organic crossroads that separate the esophagus from the windpipe - started to shake violently, all out of a sudden, and a horrible sound began to emerge from the lungs, almost defeaning me with their sheer power...the sound of a cough...of several coughs, to be precise, and along with me being shaken around in the air, trapped in a stream of air between the esophagus and the windpipe, this proved itself to be too much for my tiny and frail body...and I fell unconscious...not knowing whether I would ever wake up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* A small nod to \"An Adventure Inside Anime\" by Dominique, since Aerodeth was kind enough to make this storyline part of AAIA\u00b4s universe and continuity. So, greetings to Drez, Dominique, Aerodeth and Sage! ^^</span></div></div>",

Whatever it was, it kinda left me feeling a little uneasy. It almost felt like I tried to cough up a Philosopher Stone through my windpipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, I pretended to act like it didnt bother me in front of my woman (cuz Im a guy! That's what we do!) \"Umm... I believe a certain someone promised me a ride to the library today!\" Anyma put her hands to her hips and smiled at me. Oh yeah, I almost forgot... I promised to take her over to the library after I introduced her to Julian. Shame he didnt stay for very long... but then again, meeting a psycho like her, who WOULD?! Nonetheless, we headed out the door and over to my OTHER beloved: my Toyota Camry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then,\" I smiled back at her, \"This way, my dear!\" Acting (or pretending if you want to be a smartass) like a true gentleman, I opened the passenger door of my car for her and let her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to admit something. Although I was deeply attracted to her, there were things about her that creeped me out. Those eerie yet intriguing dual-colored eyes, her skin color paler than any other pale-skinned person I know, her ice-cold touch, even her kisses cause me to shiver but not because of bashfullness!<br>\r\nBut the creepiest thing about her was that little doll she always carries around. I mean I think it's kinda cute that she still collects dolls, but that ragdoll she named 'Astaroth' just gives me the willies!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough it only has one eye, that emerald jewel of his always seems to stare into my soul... but maybe it's just me!<br>\r\n\"I hope you dont mind that brought little Astaroth me, Michael,\" she says as she cradled that thing in her arms.<br>\r\nI just tried not to even look at it as I kept on driving, \"Er..uh... you mind putting that away? You know how it kinda gives me the creeps.\" Unfortunately, that just got Anyma talking baby-talk to that damn doll, \"Aww... dunt you wurry widdle Astawoth! Mommy dusin tink you cweep her out!\" Ugh.. that doll was SOOO close to getting a fork in it's widdle eyeballie-wallie! Yeth he was. YETH HE WAS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBEEEEEEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO* Aw crap. A cop. I pulled my car over to the side of the road and awaited my fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening sir. You realize how fast you were going?\" I answered him with a shrug, \"Ughh... 50 in a 35mph zone.\" Anyma just stared at the cop silently while slightly blowing on the head of Astaroth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, where's all that cold air coming from?\" the cops scratches his head, \"It's like 100 degrees out here... uh, anyway! No excuses no exceptions. I gotta write you up.\" Friggin great, I thought to myself.<br>\r\n\"Officer,\" just then my lady spoke up, \"cant you PLEASE let him off with a warning? Im sure he'll be a good driver from now on.\u201d<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the cop just shook his head, \u201cSorry, ma\u2019am.  Rules are rules. Now, may I see some license and registration?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir, officer,\u201d I did as I was told, being the law-abiding citizen that I am. Anyma, on the other hand just showed no emotion on her face as she stared at the cop stroking that little rag doll.  Something told me she had something up her sleeve\u2026<br>\r\nNevertheless, I pretended to notice and reached into my pocket to pull out my license\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMIKE\u2019LL MAKE YOU PAY FOR THIS, YOU SATANIC BITCH!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018\u2026WHAT THE?!! Was it just me\u2026 or did I just hear a voice a moment ago?\u2019 was what I thought to myself the minute I heard that tiny voice call out to me.  Luckily neither the cop nor Anyma heard it.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Okay, so if I add this side of the equation to that one, and then divide it by the coefficient, I should get...\" I let the word trail off, punching in the commands as I thought of them, and then with one defining stroke I pressed the big red button mark calculate, and let the computer behind me begin buzzing as it did exactly what I told it to do. Within moments it came up with a big red and gold warning screen, and the computer behind me screeched to a halt in its calculations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the haze?\" I swore, pushing a dozen buttons simultaneously as I tried to bring back up the equation page, the one I'd been working on since arriving that morning. I began to go over it line by line, one number at a time, searching for the error that the computer had found, but when I found it I nearly hit myself, as it was right near the beginning of the first series of instructions, which meant an entire branch of numbers was off, all because I'd put in an equal sign where I needed a minus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does it, I'm done for the day,\" I said to myself. This had been one hell of a day too. So many numbers ran through my head that I was finally beginning to understand why six was afraid of seven. Looking away from my screen, smiling at that small stray thought I noticed the time to be only about an hour after I'd started, which didn't seem right, and then it dawned on me that I had been working so long that the hour hand had actually made a complete circuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, and I promised to meet Julian and Ko at that new restaurant too,\" I said to myself, gripping my eyes and trying to make the pounding in my head stop. I knew they'd both understand, heck Kokoro had done this more than once when she ran into a big equation that she just had to solve. Of course she'd at least take a break every hour or so, I'd been working overtime, and as I looked at the Quantum Computer's monitor gauge it showed that the thing was near to overheating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, forget it, not like this isn't the first time I've worked this long,\" I told the gauge, hitting a nearby button marked \u2018Shut Down' and walking off. I doubt I made it more than ten steps when I heard the telltale whining of the QC as it began to spin out of control, the heat gauge spiking as the system attempted to compensate for a perceived error in the drivers. As with every time before the whine then gave way to a kind of whoosh sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't turn around, just keep walking,\" I told myself, after all I didn't need to worry about it, the QC was self correcting, and eventually would return to equilibrium. Still, if the system blew up, and enough records survived I would be in a lot of trouble, and so with a sigh I stopped and turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't I listen to myself?\" I asked no one in particular as I turned to find a very interesting looking vortex beginning to form, and sweeping up to me. If I'd just kept walked the vortex would have collapsed and I would have been able to get home to get some sleep and a bite to eat, as it stood now however I was swept up by the vortex, nearly losing my lunch as gravity began to shift wildly around me, and the sides of the vortex showed a thousand scenes at once. Not new to the experience though I was just able to keep everything down as I was spit out onto a field, and fell to earth with a resounding thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do the exits always have to appear a meter off the ground?\" I asked myself, knowing only that all three times this had happened to me, both leaving and going back to my home reality. Still, it wasn't too bad this time, as the short yellow grass I'd fallen onto proved to be a better cushion then the steel plate I'd ended up on last time this had happened. It did, however, cling to my clothes far to well, and I ripped out more than a few blades standing up, and looking around I found nothing in sight other than the yellow grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, yet another long walk. Why do I keep working with that darned computer?\" I derided myself as I began to inspect things closer at hand, looking down I finally caught sight of a small black dot in among the yellow grass. It moved as I looked at it, and I realized it had to be some kind of bug, which meant life existed on this alternate Earth. Heck, as far as I knew this bug could even be the local dominant species, and so I leaned down closer to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, you wouldn't happen to know what reality this it, would you?\" I asked it, and without giving an answer I could hear the dot took off into the grass, vanishing almost instantly. For a moment, just a moment I was going to pursue it, but looking around I realized that I could very easily step on the poor thing if I wasn't careful, so I decided to go off in the opposite direction, wading through the grass, which got up to my big toes as I walked farther on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an after thought I pulled back the sleeve of my gray jump suit and looked at the watch I wore underneath. Supposedly the watch would tell me how much time was passing in my home reality as compared to the one I was in by measuring the rotation of some vortex that moved at the same speed in all dimensions without being effected by the local speed of time. I sighed as I noticed that only about three milliseconds had past, and with it taking the computer more than ten minutes to find me and return me home, I was going to be in this place for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder if they've got burger joints here?\" I asked myself, rubbing me stomach. It had been more than a day since I'd eaten, and I was finally beginning to feel the pangs of hunger that went along with it, and remembering that I was supposed to have met Julian and Ko at a restaurant didn't help matters, thus did I walk off into a new world, looking for food to tide me over until I could at last get home.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Now here we have a specific item. As the Brief Description told you, this interactive story here is a collection of Role Plays created by Sage - a truly amazing author and good friend - and me, as you might have guessed. And these role plays deal with the theme we all like: stories inspired by movies such as \"The Fantastic Voyage\" or \"Innerspace\".<br>\r\nThe main characters in this story are Julian Sith (me) and Jon Sage (Sage, of course), with regular appearances of Chris (Jon\u00c2\u00b4s girlfriend) and Japanese beauty Kokoro (Julian\u00c2\u00b4s/my girlfriend). We are practically best friends in this story, but unfortunately, I am the lucky (?) one who always ends up in a shrinking-accident, and to make things worse, destiny leads me to places no man has seen with his own eyes before...inside my pal Jon!<br>\r\nTo make everything clear, each story starts with Sage telling the story from his point of view. Then in the next chapter, I describe the situation from my point of view, and so it goes on and on till the story actually ends. That way, we can make the situations we two end up in more interesting, intriguing and effective. Of course, if you really have any interest to join in as well and write a chapter yourself, you are more than welcome! As for the Role Plays Jon and me already created, know that the first choice in those chapters always belongs to either him or me, in order to be able to write the story the way we intended to, but the second chapter provides you with the possibility of showing your ideas. And of course, if you have an original idea for a new storyline, then don\u00c2\u00b4t hesitate and write it down!<br>\r\nWell, then, here are the rules for those attempting to add:<br>\r\n1. NO SEXUAL STUFF. Simple as that.<br>\r\n2. And especially no gay stuff, please.<br>\r\n3. Try to keep the main characters alive, and do not humiliate them in any way! They represent me and Sage, after all.<br>\r\n4. Keep in mind that Julian is always the \"prey\" or the unlucky one who ends up shrunk and most likely inside Jon. The roles are clearly defined.<br>\r\n5. In case you really want to add to a chapter based on a Role Play Sage and me already created, then you may use the second choice. The first choice is always meant for our ideas.<br>\r\n6. Once the story goes inside Jon, you can make things intersting by providing us with some interesting twists.<br>\r\n7. Most importantly, keep the narrators\u00c2\u00b4 perspectives in mind! First Sage\u00c2\u00b4s point of view, than mine.<br>\r\n8. To everyone: have fun reading our stories! And of course, have also fun adding to them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd one last thing I would like you to know: in case you are rating AND reviewing this interactive story, always keep in mind that half of it belongs to Sage. So, always review his and my writing.<br>\r\nWell, what are you waiting for? Go ahead and have fun!</td>",
