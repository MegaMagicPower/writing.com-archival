The Red Sand Rabaroos female team <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Red_Sands_Rabaroos\" target=\"_blank\">http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Red_Sands_R...</a> and of course Korra and Bolin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the investigation from Lin Bei Fong on the Probending finals, it was deduced and proven correct that Hiroshi Sato had paid the refs to have the Fire Ferrets lose. After that the Fire Ferrets won thanks to disqualification.  The Fire Ferrets found themselves with great fame.  As a matter of fact Bolin had received a letter from Probending magazines requesting the Ferret brothers as they had been coined to join them at the Red Sand Island for the judges of a bikini contest of all the female probenders for the promo of next season.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin couldn't believe his luck on Mako quitting to become a cop.  He was really bummed deep down, but a chance to get alone with Korra while they were on a 'break' was just begging for a friendly shoulder to cry on.  And maybe to caress and used to seduce the girl onto a date.  He was on the boat as he and Korra were sitting in the seat while female probenders were making use of the buffet.  As the Future Industries Fire Ferrets, Bolin was forced to bring his manager and backer, Asami Sato.  Who was rather cold to Mako ever since he forgot to break up with Asami before kissing Korra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin would always love his brother, after all they were family.  But, seriously if you forget your dating edict then deserve to get chi blocked, slapped and kicked in the balls.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami was in her room right on the yacht.  Bolin then got up as he began to walk to her room as he went someone decided to follow him.  Who was it?</span></div></div>",

She was incredibly attractive, by all accounts, and he was naturally more than a little infatuated with her. Though he wasn't sure why she had come along on this trip, since it was <i>officially</i> just for Pro Benders, he certainly wasn't protesting the presence of this beautiful woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" he said a little lamely, slowing his pace a little and waving to Ginger. \"How's it going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead (and Bolin wasn't sure if that was her natural hair color or not, but then he didn't really care) smiled at him softly, an unusually warm gesture for him to see coming from the typically aloof star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just fine,\" she said, casually resting a hand on her hip as she matched her pace to Bolin's. \"But I have some business that I need to discuss with your team's manager regarding certain... plans for the photo shoot. Varrick insisted that I come here to coach these girls personally, after all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin chuckled sheepishly. \"Yup!\" he said. \"He<i> sure</i> did.\" Then there was a brief pause as he thought. \"Um... By the way, what IS it that you're supposed to be coaching them on, anyways? I'm a little fuzzy on the details...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinger rolled her eyes briefly, before giving Bolin an assessing look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you <i>are</i> supposedly very popular with the ladies...\" she murmured, eyeing him up and down. \"Though <i>why</i> I cannot say...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there is a considerable market for Probending merchandise,\" explained the sultry redhead. \"And also considerable markets for certain kinds of... <i>adult</i>... entertainment... And, well, Varrick has apparently gotten it into his head that crossing the two things would result in a great deal of profit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin frowned slightly as they finally reached Asami's room and he pushed the door open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh... And by <i>adult entertainment</i>, you mean...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinger smirked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's the usual glamour shots, and boudoir sessions,\" she said. \"But apparently Varrick has also been thinking of using that motion picture technology to shoot pornographic movers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin's eyes bugged out, and Asami looked up from her work, perhaps having just overheard the last part of this conversation. How did the two take this news?</span></div></div>",

Oh, how she would have fun with him, strap him down to a table.  Throw off his pants and paddle his thighs until they came apart lifting up his cock.  Then she would lightly slap it and then lick her hands, giving his cock a mouthless blow job.  Oh, how would she torture him making him earn his way to he pussy for the ultimate orgasm.  The first one was always the quickest and it should be treated with great tempting and fevor for delay, until he would rather kill himself than for her to suddenly stop.  Then when she saw that conviction would she only then finally grant him release making him live for sex.  Creating him into a desperate sex slave wanting more and more sex from his mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami saw this and stood up as she said to him, \"Yes, it's a lot like that Bolin.  As a matter of fact me and Varrick made this whole thing.  But, all you have to do is meet me and Ginger in the main shoot room before we land on shore.

The young man was remarkably naive for his age, and she could only imagine the look on his face when he finally realized what was happening as she stripped him down and strapped him to the table...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have a <i>lot</i> of fun breaking that one in,\" she purred once the door closed behind Bolin. Asami frowned at this, though, and the backer of the Fire Ferrets gave the superstar supermodel a black look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'd prefer it being done by someone he can <i>trust</i>,\" she remarked a little cattily. \"He's a good guy, and his first time should be with someone who cares about him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but I <i>do</i> care!\" replied Ginger huskily. \"I care about seeing him squirm and hearing him scream my name as I show him pleasures he could never imagine...\"  She sat down on Asami's desk, and she leaned back, giving the owner of Future Industries a good, clear view of her considerable, creamy cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Sato blushed, seeing the sultry look Ginger gave her. But still she glared at the mover star balefully, subtly curling her lips into a bitter snarl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Whore</i>,\" she muttered darkly. But Ginger simply smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I prefer to think of myself as <i>experienced</i>,\" she replied airily. \"Bolin needs somebody to <i>guide</i> him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only thing you'd <i>guide</i> him to,\" retorted Asami hotly, \"would be your own bed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that the point, though?\" Ginger replied, smiling smugly and lustily up at Asami. \"He would be much better off with a more experienced mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he'd be even <i>better</i> off,\" snapped Asami, \"with someone who <i>cared</i> about him! Somebody who wants to see him <i>happy!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinger's eyes twinkled, and she slowly turned around on Asami's desk, grabbing Miss Sato by her sleeve and pulling her down on top of her, on top of the desk. The lovely young businesswoman let out a soft gasp of surprise at this, and her lips were very cute in that tiny <i>o</i> shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How <i>cute</i>,\" the redhead purred, a knowing smile on her lips. \"You <i>like</i> him, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami's blush deepened, and she stammered weakly. Ginger pulled her down closer, locking their bodies together in a very <i>suggestive</i> embrace. Their breasts mashed together, fabric rumpling and rustling as Ginger drew Asami tightly into her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're <i>that </i>serious about him...\" said Ginger, seeing how flustered Asami was by this line of discussion, and their physical closeness. \"...I <i>suppose</i> I could let you be his mistress...\" She smiled wickedly, then. \"That is, on <i>one condition</i>: you have to become <i>my</i> mistress, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami scowled, even in spite of her continuing embarrassment at her position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I do <i>that?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinger leered wolfishly at Miss Sato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't play second fiddle,\" she said simply. \"Not to <i>anyone</i>. If you get Bolin, then I get <i>you</i>. Capisce?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami's blush deepened, and for a moment she considered this. Bolin had certainly displayed no small amount of attraction to the sensual Ginger, and Miss Sato regrettably had no doubt who would come out on top in a contest for his heart (or certain other, more <i>southward</i> parts).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was her response to Ginger's ultimatum?</span></div></div>",

She kissed the younger woman deeply, passionately, her tongue invading the fair lass's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she rolled over, pinning Miss Sato beneath her even as she deepened the kiss yet further, causing Asami to weakly moan and shiver. She tasted every inch of Asami's mouth, devouring the sweet scent of her breath. She traced every contour of her palate, licking the younger woman's tongue and nibbling her soft, plump lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinger's hands moved up and down Asami's body, deftly undoing buttons and buckles. She undressed the Republic City entrepreneur, discarding the various pieces of her outfit. It was like a puzzle, almost, finding the right part to remove to expose the other parts, and gradually revealing the smooth, pale flesh of Miss Sato's beautiful naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Asami was fully naked, Ginger finally broke off the kiss, leaning back a few inches to smile hungrily at the <i>adorable</i> young woman. She raked her eyes greedily up and down the lass's naked form, appreciatively beholding the many generous hills and valleys of Asami's young, nubile body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look almost good enough to eat...\" the redhead coyly remarked, causing Miss Sato to blush. Then she smirked, and skillfully slipped off her own dress. She wore nothing underneath, and the garment was easy to remove. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami's eyes widened a little at the sight of Ginger's naked body. The supermodel might have been the most buxom woman she had ever encountered, surpassing even Korra, and every facet of her body seemed to be utterly flawless. If Asami herself was beautiful, then Ginger was a veritable <i>goddess</i> of glamour and sensuality. She was <i>gorgeous</i>, from her striking red hair all the way down to her hourglass figure, miles-long legs, and her dainty, adorable, perfectly pedicured toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed, feeling very self-conscious all of a sudden. Certainly, Miss Sato took a sort of pride in her lovely appearance, but for Ginger looks were <i>everything</i>. Her beauty was her life, her earning power, and Ginger did everything in her power to preserve and perfect those mover star looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe that was just the difference between them. In terms of looks, Asami might have been a firecracker, but Ginger was a megaton bombshell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Asami, half unconsciously, cupped the redhead's generous bosom with a hint of awe, blushing as she felt Ginger return the favor and then some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They say that massaging your breasts helps them grow,\" remarked Ginger casually as she kneaded Asami's mammaries, rubbing and rolling them between her fingers. She let out a soft moan, then, feeling Miss Sato tweak her nipples. \"<i>Oh!</i> My. <i>Good</i>...\" she purred. \"<i>Very</i> good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami yelped when she felt Ginger do the same, but with an added twist and tug that had her panting and groaning incoherently. Her pussy was wet, and she whimpered when she felt Ginger's gaze shift to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like you're getting ready,\" was all the redhead said, before suddenly leaning back and pressing her own womanhood against Asami's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Sato moaned along with Ginger as the two of them began furiously scissoring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

She placed her hands over her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMind made up, though, the muscular young earthbender unzipped his trousers and took his flaccid dick in hand. He approached the hole, which was conveniently right at waist height, and with considerable courage considering the circumstances, Bolin stuck his penis through the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdi was peeking through her fingers when he did this, and she licked her lips appreciatively. Bolin was <i>very</i> well endowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm,\" said Bolin, somewhat awkwardly shifting his body to move his penis around in the hole. \"I don't <i>feel</i> anything... Feels pretty open, actuallLLLL--\" His words suddenly trailed off into an incoherent squeal mid sentence, and his head rolled back on his shoulders, his eyes wide and his mouth in an <i>O</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdi afforded herself a small smirk. She already knew perfectly well what was on the other side of the hole -- it was a part of the on-boat set for filming and photo shoots, and she and her teammates had decided to get a head start on making some magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a so-called <i>glory hole</i>, a central prop for a series of planned shoots and short films revolving around female probenders anonymously servicing some lucky bastard's cock.

The pale, lovely brunette's eyes immediately alighted on Bolin's cock, still covered with a fair amount of honey, and she licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks good...\" she said softly, quietly appreciating the view. Her eyes danced with lust as she walked forward, and Zhu Li immediately trained the camera on Miss Sato as she moved toward Bolin's dick, discarding articles of clothing piece by piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Asami reached the appetizing wall-sausage, she was completely naked, and Zhu Li was biting her lip as she filmed, drinking in the scene as Asami got down on her knees and smiled up at the camera, cupping her breasts to push them up and together, emphasizing her bosom while concealing her nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" said Zhu Li encouragingly. \"The camera loves you, baby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami's smile widened an iota, and she turned her attention back to Bolin's cock. She placed a kiss on it head, tasting precum mingled with honey and saliva, and she let out a lewd moan, pinching herself on the nipples as she took the earthbender's meat into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the shudders that must have been running through Bolin's body as she anonymously pleasured him. She took his length all the way into her mouth, deepthroating him eagerly. Anonymity was a liberating thing, she thought. Bolin had no idea what she was doing, and she was free to express all of her sexual desires on his cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was exhilarating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe licked up the rest of the honey from his dick, greatly enjoying the sweet taste. She moaned shamelessly, vibrating her tongue against Bolin's shaft and wiggling her hips for the camera as she fingered herself and twisted her nipples. Horny and lustful and filled with a perverse pleasure at what she was doing, Asami came for the camera, and pulled her head back when she felt Bolin's cock twitch warningly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came, and the seed from Bolin's manhood sprayed all over Asami's face, landing in her hair and on her cheeks, and also upon her outstretched tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZhu Li, Ula, Umi, and Ginger all gave Asami a thumbs up.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bolin was all geared up and ready for his match, it never failed to amaze him how far he and his brother Mako had come. Two kids living on the streets of Republic City, seemingly never going to amount to anything, now finding themselves on their way to becoming Pro-Bending champions. As he walked down the hall to the arena he passed the gym and from the corner of his eye he noticed someone was in there, when he turned his heard to get a better look he notice that someone was a girl, a very pretty girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her mocha colored skin, cyan eyes and blue clothing she seemed to be from the Water Tribe. She was tall too, almost as tall as him. And while she had some rockin curves she also had some great muscle tone. He could immediately tell that she could hold her own in a fight. She seemed to be just looking around the gym, she didn't even seemed to notice him yet. So Bolin put his game face on and casually walked up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there. What'cha doing here? \" he said friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly turned to him surprised at his greeting and noticed his Pro-Bending uniform. He must be one of the fighters here \" Uh..I was just looking for the bathroom and got lost.\" she shrugged sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah the old 'I had to pee' excuse.\" he said knowingly \"It's okay I get it. Your a big fan of Pro-Bending, but didn't have money to pay for a ticket. But you just love Pro-Bending so much you had to see this fight since it would be the first match you would see in person. Tell me, am I warm?\" he asked with charming smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was amazed that he could see right through her so easily and blushed a little since he was pretty handsome \"Uh..yeah that just about sums it up.\" she said with an awkward grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry I won't call security. In fact if you want I could take you to the best seats in the house.\" he casually offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was stunned at his generosity \"Really? You'd do that for me? But you don't even know me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I believe that strangers are just friends you haven't met yet. So what do you say, friends?\" he said with an open smile and hand extended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn ear to ear smile crossed her face \"Definitely!\" she ignored his hand and nearly tackled him to the ground in a powerful hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Wow she's stronger then she looks.] he thought to himself feeling his spine popping. \"Names Bolin by the way.\" he said in slightly strained voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Korra.\" she introduced herself unaware of her strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe released him and Bolin gestured to the hallway \"Now if you will follow me miss.\" he said with playful gentlemen tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you sir.\" she played along, even giving a curtsy with her fur pelt. They shared a good laugh as he escorted her to the ring \"Seriously though, thanks.\" she said sincerely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of walking Bolin opened the door that lead to the fighter podium. \"What i'd tell ya? Best seats in the house right?\" he asked knowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow..this place is even more amazing the I imagined!\" she said giddy as she looked over ever inch of the stadium like a kid in a candy store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer enthusiasm made him smile fondly, it reminded him of himself when first saw this place. \"Psst, Bolin.\" whispered his brother Mako from behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you to not bring your crazy fan girls in here before the matches. Get her out of here.\" he said rather rudely as he put on the rest of his uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw come on Mako..she's not a fan girl she's a friend and I promised her she could stay. Besides something tells me there's something special about her. Korra,\" he took her shoulder to face his brother \"I\"d like you to meet my brother, Mako.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mako? Wow I heard you play on the radio!\" she reach out her hand eager to shake it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Bolin, we're up.\" he ignored her putting on his helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra looked down at her wondering if she did something to offend him \"Or I could meet him later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sorry about that. My brother always gets so focused before a match.\" he explained as he put on her own helmet \"Well I got go. Wish me luck, not that I'll need it.\" he said with a confident swagger as he joined his team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh Good luck. Knock em out!\" she punched the air in emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bout between The Fire Ferrets and The Tiger-Dillo's was intense. The Ferret's lost the fist round despite giving it their all, but manged to barely win the second keeping them in the game. But just as the third round started The Ferret's water bender stumbled into Mako cause them to be knockout of the ring into the drink. It was all up to Bolin and despite his best efforts to bob and weave between the blows he found himself at the edge of the ring with the water waiting below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like all hope was lost, but then just when it looked like it was over a miracle happened. Bolin dug in his feet and endured The Tiger-Dillo's assault. It was a risky, some would even say stupid move. But despite being pummeled by a relentless barrage of fire, earth and water Bolin refused to budge an inch. He was completely rooted, as unmovable as a mountain. And when The Tiger-Dillo's paused their assault to catch their breath Bolin returned the favor 10 fold and knocked The Tiger-Dillo's out of ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stadium was silent for a moment as nobody could believe what just happened, but the crowd cheered so loud it could deafen everyone in it. But no one was cheering louder then Korra. She had never seen anyone with such sheer grit and force of will. And she watched the underdog hero smiled, waved and blew kisses to his adoring fans she felt time slow to a crawl and the cheers of the crowd go silent. He was covered in dust, his uniform singed, had a black eye and his teeth were red from the blood in his mouth, but he was so happy, so full of pride and strength. Her heart hammered in her chest and her face turned dark red with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then her seemed to move on it's own as she leapt into the drink, rocketed herself onto the ring with a waterspout, ran to capture him in her arms and give him a powerful kiss on the lips. His was frozen stiff at the sudden assault on his lips, but he quickly recovered to return her passion with his own. The crowd cheered even loud at the display as it seemed a new love was born.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Or at least that what happened Korra's mind as she fantasized before being brought back to reality by a bruised Bolin shaking her shoulder slightly. \"Huh?\" she said puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said what do you think? Bolin's got some moves huh?\" he asked trying to be suave, but with the shape he was in wasn't working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Korra was still starstruck by him as she grabbed him by the collar of his uniform to pull him in close \"What did I think? What did I think?! That was amazing!\" she said joyously before giving him what was suppose to be a playful shove, but she once again didn't realize her own strength as Bolin was sent tumbling to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gck! There go my ribs..\" he moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing what she just did made Korra very guilty and embarrassed \"I am so sorry! Here I can help heal you!\" She acted quickly by lifting Bolin off the floor and laying him on the bench. \"I'm gonna need you to take your shirt off.\" she said as she got water ready from the waterskin she always kept on her person. (Just like Katara taught her)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah going a little fast aren't we? I'm an old fashioned guy, your going to have to buy me dinner first.\" he tried to laugh it off only to grimace in pain \"Ow..it hurts to laugh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled at his goofiness \"I need skin to skin contact to heal you properly you dork.\" Bolin thankfully complied as he lifted his shirt to reveal his battered, bruised and perfectly sculpted torso. She was briefly distracted by his amazing muscles but regained her focus bending the water over his wounds. Luckily the damage look worse then it really was so after a few minutes of treatment he was going to be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man that feels amazing! You really know your stuff huh?\" he said very impressed by her healing touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I learned from the best.\" she said proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did more harm then good out there! You almost cost us the match!\" Mako scolded his Waterbending teammate as they walked into the podium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won didn't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barely!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off my case pal!\" he angrily threw his helmet to the floor and stormed out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Useless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys were incredible out there!\" Korra exclaimed happily pausing in her task for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you're still here?\" he asked rudely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you're still a jerk?\" she responded in kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Bo, what were you thinking tanking all those hits like that? You're lucky your fan girl here knows how to heal otherwise you wouldn't be in any shape for the next match!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Bolin won the match for you, you ungrateful jerk!\" She was getting really tired of this guys attitude and was about to teach him a lesson, but Bolin grabbed her hand to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Korra he's right. The next match is tomorrow and I would be a walking bruise for days without your help. I may have won the match but my stunt could've cost us being in the championship.\" he said a little disappointed in himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra couldn't stand see such a sad look on his face. He deserved to be happy and proud of what he accomplished tonight, plus he was so much more handsome with a smile on his face. \"That doesn't change the fact that you won. You had every odd stacked against you and did the impossible. That already makes you a champion in my book. All you need to do is make it official to everyone else. And I know you can do it.\" she said with upmost confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin was really taken a back by this. No one, not even his brother gave him such praise or showed such faith in him. Sure Mako believed in him and praised him, in his own way, but not to this degree. Korra's lovely cyan eyes shone with nothing but honest admiration for him. It left him spellbound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you guys are going to start making out, could you at least wait until I'm not in the room.\" Mako ruined the moment with a slight tone of disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two young benders hearing what he said blushed hotly and turned away from each other embarrassed. Korra awkwardly cleared her throat to help regain her composure \"Anyway, I've been immersed in Bending my entire life but I never learned how to move like you guys do! It's like there is a whole new style here!\" she said with increasing excitement. \"After I'm done healing you do you think you could teach me a few tricks?\" she asked Bolin eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely!\" he answered with just as much enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Right now? Come on Bolin.\" Mako asked annoyed once again bringing down the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just ignore him. But yeah I can show you the basics. I'm just not sure how my Earthbending will translate to your Waterbending, but we'll figure it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, I'm also an Earthbender and a Firebender.\" she said with a proud smirk while lighting her fist on fire to prove it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her being able to bend more then one element could only mean one thing \"No! Way!\" Bolin said in astonishment. He then turned to his brother pointing at her while whispering loudly \"The Avatar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(A few minutes later)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to his word as soon as Bolin was all patched up he got right to teaching Korra the basics of Pro-Earthbending, which she of course proved to be a natural at. \"Man you're picking this up quick!\" he said impressed by her progress. \"Got to admit I'm a little jealous. It took me a week to get this good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say? Bending just comes naturally to me.\" she said a little smug, before remembering her frustrating lack of progress in Airbending. \"I wish my Airbending came to me just as naturally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with your Airbending? If you don't mind me asking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sigh* Ever since I was a kid I could bend Water, Earth and Fire easily, but no matter how hard I try I've never been able to produce a single puff of air. I thought when I moved to Air Temple Island to train with Tenzin I would finally be able to Airbend, but still nothing.\" She then sat on the floor with her knees tucked into her chest a little depressed after baring her soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin was heartbroken seeing such a woman who normally looked like she was ready and able to take on the world in such a sorry state. He racked his brain to try and think of a way to cheer her up. He snapped his fingers when an idea came to him, he didn't know if it would work but he had to try.</span></div></div>",

Why?\" Korra asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because the night is still young, I've got some money I've been saving up and most importantly we both could use some fun.\" he reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But..what would we even do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever we want! Come on Korra let's paint this town red!\" He didn't give her much time to ask any further questions as he dragged her out of the gym to hit the streets. At first Korra was very unsure about all this but she quickly warmed up to the idea when Bolin took her to his favorite eatery which was famous for it's authentic Water Tribe food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So..what do you think?\" Bolin asked Korra who was happily chowing down on a bowl of noodles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's delicious! I didn't think I could miss Water Tribe grub so soon.\" she said with a hint of nostalgia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is but a taste of what this city has to offer. No pun intended.\" he said before continuing to enjoy his own meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you ask me out all of the sudden anyway? Or to be more accurate kidnap me.\" she said jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well..I just couldn't stand seeing you sad. If I could help you figure out how to Airbend I would, but since I can't I went with the best thing I could think of.\" he answered sincerely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight blush appeared on her face and warmth filled her heart at hearing this. She smiled sweetly \"Thank you Bolin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a smile and blush of his own as he rubbed the back of neck awkwardly \"So..how are you liking Republic City so far?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well..to be honest my first impression was pretty mixed. I ended up getting arrested.\" she frowned thinking about her rather unpleasant encounter with Lin Beifong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin's eye's widened in disbelief \"Really?! For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I stopped a group of thugs from tearing up a helpless shopkeepers store. But did Beifong listen me when I explained it to her? No! She just treated me like a criminal for no reason!\" Just thinking about that woman made Korra's blood boil a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what Bolin knew about Chief Beifong she was tough as nails and scary, but fair and professional. She must of had a good reason right? \"Well how did you stop these thugs?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra had a smirk on her face as she remember teaching those thugs a lesson \"Oh it was great! Their leader tried to throw a water spear at me, but I threw it back at him freezing his face and kicked him into their car! Before this other guy could even try to Earthbend I launched him into the air with an earth column and he fell into a fruit stand! The last guy tried to fry me but I powered through the fire and tossed him through a shops..window.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice lost some of it's vigor as she started to realize just how much damage she really caused in her scuffle with The Tripe Threats. \"And before they could get away I sent their car crashing into another..shop.\" Remembering that last bit really drove it home. She was lucky nobody else was in that shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof.\" Bolin said with a grimace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus I may have tried to run from the police and injured a couple of them before I was caught.\" she said embarrassed as she remembered kicking one guy in the face and causing another to ram into a wall of ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Thinking about it now I guess she had plenty of reasons to treat me like a criminal.\" she said sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say! Nobody is above the law with Chief Beifong. I'm honestly amazed your not in jail. Um, no offense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken. But yeah she was ready to lock me up and throw away the key, luckily Tenzin was there to bail me out. *Sigh* Some Avatar I am huh? I try to help people and all I end up doing is causing trouble.\" she said self deprecatingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, none of that!\" he said sternly before saying warmly \"You stood up to a group of bullies single handedly to protect innocents. I say that not only makes you a great Avatar but great person over all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blush returned and she shyly played with one of her side pony tails \"You really think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Sure you messed up a little but you'll get better. And hey if you ever need any help in saving people, don't hesitate to give me a call! I'll drop whatever I'm doing and come running!\" he said sincerely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew he meant every word, but felt like she needed to test him a little. \"Really?\" she asked raising an amused eyebrow \"Being The Avatar means I'll most likely face against all sorts of danger. Are you sure you're up for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin crossed his arms with a confident grin \"You better believe it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but if we end up facing the end of the world together don't say I didn't warn you.\" They shared a good laugh at that even though they both knew the possibility was very real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to tell you the truth, I'm a bit of a criminal myself.\" he confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Korra's eye's widened in disbelief \"No way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way.\" Bolin's face turned solemn as he thought back to some of his darker years \"It happen a few years after our parents were killed. We lived on the streets for the most part, it was rough, but we managed, barely. Then one day, one of the Triple Threats came walking down the ally we were sleeping in for the night, I guess he saw some easy cheap labor in us and we were desperate at the time, so when he offered us some work we accepted. Mako helped with book keeping and money management, he was always good with numbers. And I was strong for my age so I helped with cargo. They worked us hard and we saw some..unpleasant things while working for them. But we had a roof over our heads and decent meals for the first time in what felt like forever, so we just kept at it. Doing what we had to do to survive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra could feel her heart breaking the more she heard, she never could have imagined how someone could've gone though all that and still be so sweet and full of life. \"Bolin.\" she said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, this story has a happy ending! Or at least it will soon.\" He said with a big smile returning to his face. \"When we saw that Pro-Bending could give us the opportunity to go straight and make some serious money, we saved every little penny we could and when we were finally old enough to compete, we left The Triple Threats and never looked back! And now The Fire Ferret's are well on their way to becoming the first rookie team in Pro-Bending history to become Champions!\" he exclaimed triumphantly while flexing his muscles like a body builder for maximum cool factor, only to accidentally spill his drink all over the table. \"Oh geez, I'm sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra chuckled heartily at his silliness \"It's fine Bolin, don't worry about it.\" she said happily as she helped him clean up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter recovering from that embarrassment Bolin then said \"So anyway, what do you say we put all that heavy stuff behind us and focus on the here and now! Because we still got a whole night of debauchery ahead of us, so lets finish our meal and get back to it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" she wholeheartedly agreed \"This city's not going to know what hit it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a city as big as Republic city there was all kinds of things to do, especially at night if you know where to look. So the only question was what would the young benders do next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After finishing their meal the young couple went to a nearby soda bar to share a few drinks, which then turned into a burping contest much to the chagrin of the other patrons, but they didn't care about what others thought, they were having fun and that was all that matters. They then went to Harmony Tower to really take the sights of the city, or to be more accurate Korra was taking in the sights while Bolin was mostly watching her. It made him so happy that he accomplished what he set out to do with this sudden date, even more happy then his victory in the ring earlier. Seeing Korra in such high spirits and having a good time was more rewarding then having a crowd of a million fans cheering his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after they went to a night club still filled with people dancing to some smooth tunes. This was when Korra started to feel a little unsure again because she never really danced before and with so many people there she didn't want to make a fool of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's the matter?\" Bolin asked noticing her not have fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well..I know it's silly but..I've never really danced before. To be honest before I came to Republic City I never really did much else but train.\" she explained. \"So this whole night has been quite the experience for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good or bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, great even! This is night has been the most fun I've had in a long time.\" she said sincerely as she rubbed her arm shyly \"I just don't want to ruin it with my lack of dancing skills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you're worried about?\" he asked with relief now knowing Korra was still having fun. She was just a little shy when it came to dancing apparently, surprising given her usually confident attitude but it was nothing he couldn't fix. \"Korra, look at most of the people here, do they look like expert dancers to you?\" he asked gesturing to the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did as he said and sure enough most of the people in the club like amateurs, not good but not bad either. Although one guy  looked like he was having a stroke rather then dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No?\" she answered unsure where he was going with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do they look like they care if they're expert dancers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked looked back at the crowd and noticed that just about everyone here was having a blast in spite of their lack luster skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" she said with a little more of her usual confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I don't care if you two left feet or not, I just want you to forget all about your troubles and have fun.\" he said sincerely before a devious smile appeared on his face \"Or maybe the big, bad Avatar is scared of a little dancing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh it is on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bolin, shut up and dance with me.\" she commanded as she dragged him to the dance floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am!\" he said happy to have the old Korra back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Korra was a very awkward dancer, she stepped on a few toes and bumped into some people, but with Bolin's encouragement she was able to find her rhythm and started to move in perfect sync with her partner. Their dancing wasn't anything fancy at first but as the night went on they seemed to be subconsciously teaching each other as with each new song that played they seamlessly change from an awkward but cute slow dance, to an upbeat tap dance, to graceful waltz, and finally to a passionate and intimate tango. Needless to say they were the most watched couple of the club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut sadly all good things must come to an end sooner or later as the clock showed it was well pasted midnight and they both had long days ahead of them. So Bolin escorted Korra to the bay where she would swim back to Air Temple Island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't have to do this Bo.\" she said with a tired but content voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but I do. As I said I'm an old fashioned guy so I must escort my fair lady home.\" he said with a legitimately suave voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised an amused eyebrow at him \"'Your' fair lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe back peddled realizing what he just said \"Um I-I mean that is not to say I own you or anything! But you are a fair lady, more then fair in fact! You're gorgeous and fun and-\" His tangent was cut short by Korra giving him a quick kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like the sound of that.\" she said with a cheeky wink before she jumped into the bay and swam with the grace and speed of a mermaid back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin was left stunned as he touch the spot where Korra kiss. Then a huge, goofy grin spread across his face as hearts floated around his head \"What a woman.\" he sigh dreamily as he headed back home.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tenzin approached Korra's room cautiously as he knew that she was not a morning person on the best of days, 'the morning is evil' as she has frequently put it. And with her failures in trying to learn the basics of Airbending over the last few days she was no doubt going to be in a rather frustrated mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was proven wrong as just as he was about to knock on her door she opened it, freshly dressed and well rested judging from the content smile on her face. She stretched her arms over her head \"*Yawn* Good morning Tenzin.\" she said pleasantly as she walked pasted him to the dinning room for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenzin was somewhat stunned at this, but recovered quickly to follow after her \"Good morning Korra. I trust you slept well?\" he inquired politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. Best night sleep I've had in awhile.\" she answered honestly. Her gentle smile increasing slightly thinking about her both her date and dream from last night. Both of which involved her being in the arms of a certain upcoming Pro-Bending champion. Only in her dream things ended in a more..exciting way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear it.\" Tenzin said happy for her before turning solemn \"Now Korra I know the last couple of days haven't been as..productive as either of us would have liked.\" he said carefully \"But I just want to take this time to remind you that Airbending isn't about brute strength and aggression, it's about using passive resistance in response to aggression. There is flow it, a rhythm if you will. You must surrender yourself to that rhythm and allow it to guide you through the gates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenzin had tried to explain this to her many times already, but it has always gone completely over her head. But her experience last night made her pause to really think about his words. \"A rhythm huh?\" she said quietly to herself cupping her chin in deep thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Korra?\" asked Tenzin puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tenzin, do you guys own a record player by any chance?\" she asked with a brainstorm forming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea! I'll tell you all about it after breakfast!\" she said while racing down the hall, eager to try out her idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenzin blinked rapidly at her curious behavior, but as he smelled his wife's delicious cooking he power walked to join her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1 hour later)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra stood before her old nemesis, The Spinning Gates, with a determined fire in her eye. She looked over to Jinora who had the record player ready and gave her a nod. The young Airbender placed the needle on the vinyl and a soothing orchestra filled the courtyard as Korra closed her eyes and let the melody flow through her. She slowly swayed over to the gates and with the grace of a ballerina she spun, twirled, cartwheeled and flipped through the gates without touching any of them once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the music faded out and the gates stopped spinning a slightly out of breath Korra was greeted with a standing ovation from Jinora, Ikki and Meelo while Tenzin was frozen in astonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That..that was incredible.\" Tenzin whispered in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beautiful!\" Jinora added with wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing!\" Ikki squealed with cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" Meelo exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra blushed slightly at all the praise, but was very happy to finally be making some progress in her training. \"Aw shucks guys, was it really that good?\" she asked modestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was better then good!\" Tenzin said just as happy at Korra's performance as his children. \"Your training method was rather unorthodox, but creative thinking is heavy encouraged in Airbending. Tell me, how did you come up with the idea to use music to help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra was unsure of how to answer that and was even tempted to lie, but she thought better of it and decided to just tell the truth. \"Before I say anything Tenzin, I want you to promise wait until I'm done explaining and try your best not to be mad.\" she pleaded to her master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenzin had a bad feeling about this, but his curiosity over her sudden leap in skill needed to be satisfied \"Very well, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Korra told him about all that she did last night while make it very clear that nothing really big happened between her and Bolin. Needless to say Tenzin was not happy to hear that Korra disobeyed him in leaving the island, especially at night to go see a Pro-Bending match. And then she apparently went on a date with some boy named Bolin?! His fatherly instincts kicked into high gear upon hearing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenzin took in a deep breath \"Korra..I am very disappointed that you disobeyed my wishes for you to stay on the island and I made it very clear on my thoughts on Pro-Bending.\" he said as calmly as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Tenzin, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was cut off by Tenzin raising a stern hand \"I let you say your peace Korra. Now I will say mine.\" he said with his tone not changing. Korra was silent as he continued \"I'll be honest, I was beginning to lose my patience with not just your lack of progress but also in your attitude. And ordinarily hearing this last stunt you pulled on top of all that would've been the last straw before I would lay down the law.\" he said with his tone getting progressively harder, causing Korra to tuck into herself meekly. \"However,\" his tone then became warmer \"it's clear to me now that perhaps I need to apply some creative to my own teaching methods. My father once told me that if a teacher is unable to learn with their student, then they are not meant to teach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra blinked in surprise at this and a hopeful smile appeared on her face \"So, does that mean I can see Bolin's match tonight? I promised him I would be there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can, on the condition that you will take your training more seriously. And in return I will allow you more freedom, but within reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal! In fact why don't you come see the match with me? I think you will actually like Pro-Bending if you give it a chance.\" she offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah daddy, can we all come too?! Can we?! Can we?!\" Ikki asked bouncing up and down with excitement with Jinroa and Meelo joining in. Jinora wanted to meet Bolin while Meelo was joining just for fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenzin sighed resignedly \"Very well.\" Korra and the children cheered as they joined together in a group hug. When the group hug ended Tenzin then went back into teaching mode \"Now Korra, let's see if you make it through the gates without the music.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Later that night)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tenzin agreed to take his family out to see a Pro-Bending match he did not expect it to be this nerve racking as apparently The Fire Ferret's Waterbender was a no show and Korra volunteered to step in for them, much to Mako reluctance. It was a rough match to say the least as while Korra was a very skilled bender she wasn't very familiar with the rules of Pro-Bending, her inexperience causing them to lose two rounds. She even Earthbended at one point during the match revealing herself as the Avatar. But she was able to continue as long she only bends water. And luckily for her all of her Airbending training from today was really kicking in as during the last round she became untouchable as The Platypus-Bears exhausted themselves firing at her, allowing Bolin and Mako to deal a Knockout, wining the match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he wasn't happy with it at first, Tenzin had to admit that Pro-Bending was a lot fun to watch. Especially when it gave him the opportunity to see his student put what he taught her to good use. And his family had a great time too, cheering Korra on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now at the fighter podium after celebrations had died down and Mako had stepped out to give them some privacy Bolin and Korra now found themselves trapped in an awkward silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So..about last night..\" Bolin started \"I just want to make sure I'm not getting any mixed signals here. Are we a thing? Are we just friends? Or..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra thought long and hard about how to answer. She had never felt this way about anyone before and didn't want to screw it up. She knew Bolin was a sweet guy, strong, funny, dependable and handsome. Qualities any woman would want in a man, but she never dated before and didn't want to break his heart if they didn't work out. He didn't deserve that. So after giving it much thought she decided..</span></div></div>",

Sure Korra was rough around the edges, but he thought her rough edges were charming. Also she was not only a very pretty girl, but a very pretty girl that could kick ass and loved to have a good time. Needless to say, Bolin felt like he hit the jackpot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely!\" he cheered as he scooped her up in a bear hug which she happily returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem.\" The new couple froze in place before turning behind them slowly to meet the Airbending family. Pema and the children all had varying degrees of amusement on their faces, while Tenzin was stone faced and his robes bellowed slightly from a breeze of his own making. \"Are we interrupting something?\" he asked rhetorically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tenzin! Everyone, hey!\" Korra exclaimed nervously. \"Did you..enjoy the match hehe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Korra, when we agreed to come to this match you said nothing about you participating in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't planned I swear!\" she hastefully explained \"Their Waterbender was a no show and I couldn't just let them forfeit! They're my friends and Pro-Bending means more to them then you realize, I had to do something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It appears to me that you are more then friends with this..Bolin was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep that's me! Bolin of The Fire Ferrets at your service, sir!\" he announced nervously while standing at attention like a solider, even giving the Airbending master a salute for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Giggle* He seems like a nice young man.\" Pema said playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's cute. I can see why you like him Korra.\" Jinora teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's funny looking!\" Ikki giggled at his goofy posture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeelo was silent for a minute as he gave Bolin a once over. \"Meh. She could do better.\" he shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Korra was drowning in embarrassment over their comments on her new boyfriend, Bolin felt like a prison inmate on death row from the stare Tenzin was giving him. And as he slowly approached the young Earthbender, who was now sweating bullets, the podium went silent as everyone waited with baited breath on what Tenzin would do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you have proven yourself to be a positive influence on Korra thus far, you have my blessing to pursue this relationship.\" he stated calmly, sending a wave of relief to everyone present that he also approved of Bolin. \"But let me make one thing clear,\" his voice now feeling like the calm before a storm \"If you hurt her in anyway, you will answer to me. Are we clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As crystal, sir!\" Bolin squeaked out feeling like he was about to wet himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Tenzin said pleasantly, his ominous aura disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear,\" Pema said gently wrapping her arms around her husbands shoulders to help relieve the rest of the tension in the room \" why do we all go out for dinner tonight? It will give us all a chance to get to know Bolin properly and celebrate Korra taking her first steps in her Airbending training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenzin hummed thoughtfully to himself while stroking his beard \"An excellent idea.\" he agreed much to their children's delight, they have gone out as a family in a while. Pema sent a subtle wink to Bolin to let him know that he had her full support, much to his relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bolin, why do you show everyone the place you took me last night?\" Korra suggested, excited in both everyone approval in their new relationship and getting to eat some of her favorite foods from home again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea!\" Bolin said happily \"We should a remember to invite Mako too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, do we have to?\" Korra pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes we do. He's my brother and your new teammate, you're both gonna have to learn to get along.\" he said with a playfully stern tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" she pouted more with arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled at her cuteness before he remembered something important \"Oh, I should also introduce you to Pabu before we leave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Pabu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My best friend and our teams mascot! You're gonna love him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough Korra instantly fell in love with Bolin's Fire Ferret and Pabu quickly warmed up to her as well. And the rest of the night went by quickly but pleasantly as The Airbending Family bonded very well with The Pro-Bending Brothers. Sure Mako was a bit of a stick in mud at first, but even he was able to get over himself and have some fun. Before the new couple parted ways for the time being they shared sweet embrace and a quick but heartfelt first kiss. It was an adorable sight to all who saw it. And as the night went on said couple stared into the distance of the bay from their rooms, pondering what the future held for them before drifting off into a peaceful sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This morning had started out so promising. Bolin was training with his brother and girlfriend in the gym, having some quality time together. But then the owner of the area, and their landlord, came in to give them their earnings for last nights match, only to immediately take it all back to pay for rent, Korra's new gear, gym rentals from last month and of course groceries. If that wasn't bad enough it turns out they needed to ante up 30000 yuans for the championship pot and if they didn't come up with the cash by the end of the week they were out of the tournament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with that in mind Bolin came up with the idea to have Pabu preform some of the circus tricks he had been teaching him, but neither Mako or Korra really had faith in that idea. But Mako reassured them that he would think of something, he always did. And Korra promised that she would do all she could to help, but she needed to head back home to resume her Airbending training, so after giving him a parting kiss on the cheek she raced back to Air Temple Island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite what either of them have said Bolin went forward with his idea, confident that people would be blow away by Pabu's talents and reward said talents with lots of money. Only to have that confidence shattered as all he had to show for all his hours of work being one measly yuan coin in a cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One yuan down, 29999 to go.\" he said while dejectedly staring at the coin. But just then a highly customized Satomobile drove up in front of him. The driver revealed himself to be a shady looking Water Tribe man appropriately named Shady Shen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bolin, is that you?\" the gangster asked casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Shady Shen.\" Bolin responded halfheartedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heard your a big time Pro-Bender now, not bad.\" said the crooked man with slightly a condescending tone as he approached the young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Bolin said sarcastically quickly getting sick of talking to this guy. \"Cut to the chase Shen, what do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ho! Look who's grown some backbone since we last met! \" Shen said a little impressed \"Alright so here's the deal, Lightning Bolt Zolt is looking for some extra muscle. And I thought that you would be up for it, you know for old times sake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh uh. No way. I am done with The Triple Threats, go bother some other poor schmuck with your sales pitch cause I ain't buying.\" Bolin said while turning his nose up at Shen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, but your the only poor schmuck we need for this job. It's just a little security work, nothing crooked.\" Shen obviously lied. But to sweeten the deal he reached into his outer jacket and pulled out a wad of cash that he tossed into Bolin's cup. Bolin was honestly surprised by the amount of money he was just given, it looked to be 10000 yuans easily. \"You game?\" he asked with a self-satisfied smirk, confident he sealed the deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin was honestly tempted to accept, but he knew that he would never forgive himself if he allowed himself to break his word to cut all ties with The Triple Threats. And that's nothing to say about what would happen if Mako and Korra found out if he did accept, he refused to disappoint either of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked up the wad of bills and tossed them back at Shen who caught it with stunned look on his face. \"My answer is still no.\" he said steadfastly. \"Come on Pabu.\" He picked all his stuff and began to walk away with his furry friend in tow, but the shady man still had an ace up his sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well look at little Bolin all grown up.\" he said with faux pride as he pulled out a small photo from his pocket \"Has it really been 2 years since we last saw each other? My how time flies..\" he trailed off as if he was actually reliving fond memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious as to what he was talking about Bolin turned his head to get a better look at the photo, only to feel a wave of horror wash over him. It was a picture of him and Mako sharing a small cake from his 14th birthday, with Lightning Bolt Zolt in the background with what looked like a proud smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone knows that The Fire Ferrets used to be street urchins, little kids who came from nothing. But through hard work and grit were able to make something of themselves. A truly heartwarming underdog story, but we both know that's only half the story. Right Bo?\" Shen said with that damn smirk. And he was right, neither he or Mako told any Pro-Bending officials about their time with The Triple Threats because no self respecting sports business would want to be associated with anyone who had ties to such a well know and powerful crime boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin clenched his hand into fist so tight his knuckles cracked and he was about to bury the smug prick, but Shen just raised his hand in a stopping motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh uh uh. We don't want to be making a scene now do we?\" he asked rhetorically while gesturing to the people around them, some of who were watching the scene curiously. \"Now you have two choices Bolin, you can either stick to your guns and walk away. Which might be the right thing to do, but also the dumb thing as I would have no choice but to do the right thing as well and let the Pro-Bending big shots know that they have a Triple Threat in their ranks.\" he said while tauntingly waving the picture. \"Or you can do the smart thing and take the job. And as long as you play ball with us, this little photo and all the others we have of you and Mako, will never see the light of day. So champ, what's it gonna be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShen had him by the balls, because their entire future was at stake. With how popular Pro-Bending was word would get out fast about this whole scandal. And after they were kicked out to save face every other business would want nothing to do with them in order to protect their own reputations. And that's nothing to say of what will happen to Korra's reputation if it got out that she was dating a criminal. He was given two choices, but he knew he only had one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sigh* Fine.\" Bolin said resignedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you would come around.\" Shen said smugly as he turned back to get in his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Shen's back turned Bolin took the opportunity to give Pabu some instructions \"Pabu, go find Mako!\" he whispered quickly. The ferret understanding the order scurried off to do just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bolin joined Shen in the car, a question came to him that he just had to have answered. \"Shen, why does Zolt really need extra muscle? And why me specifically?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShen pondered for a minute on whether or not he should answer before deciding it couldn't hurt to tell him a bit. \"Well to make a long story short, something big is brewing in this city. And all the players are getting ready for whatever it is. And as for why you, well with all your big wins in the ring lately your one of the most popular picks on the market right now. Zolt wanted me to make sure we got you first. Believe me, you're lucky I did. A lot of the other guys in the game are not as..civil as me.\" he explained as he started the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin shuddered a little because he knew Shen wasn't kidding, he remembered some of the \"business deals\" he witnessed while with The Triple Threats. Some of them got really..messy. And he always had to help clean up, he still had nightmares about those time to this day. It was one of the many reasons he and Mako tried to break free of that life, but now he was being roped back into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[And today started so promising.] he thought dejectedly to himself. [Well, it could be worse.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Later that night)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[It just got worse!] Bolin thought with terror running through his body as he was bound and gaged in the back of a truck with other Triple Threats. He had a faint glimmer of hope when he saw that Korra and Mako were trying to rescue him, but that hope was quickly snuffed out as he felt the truck stop and one the Equalists tell them that Amon was waiting for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin had heard many stories about Amon, but a lot of them painted Amon so many different lights. Many said that Amon was an Anti-Bending Revolutionary. Others said Amon was a hero defending the weak from the criminal element of the city. And some said that Amon didn't even exsist. Hell in a lot of times in these stories most couldn't even agree on if Amon was a man, a woman or even human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what all these stories had in common was in telling that Amon was dangerous and if you happened to be their enemy, you're screwed. And Bolin hoped to any high power listening that he would be spared Amon wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truck doors opened, Equalists grabbed them and threw them on to the floor of a warehouse where the silhouette of Amon was waiting for them.

She walked down the row of kneeling gangters before her until she came to Bolin at the end. He was so full of terror that it felt as if Koh The Face Stealer was right in front of him, looking to add to his collection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd his terror only increased when she crouched down to get a better look at him. Those shadowed eyes felt like they were looking into his very soul, judging him for his final destination. She reached out a hand and Bolin saw his life flash before his eyes, he then closed them shut, waiting for the end, hoping it was quick and painless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to feel his cloth gag be removed with surprising gentleness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you here?\" asked a deep, but very feminine voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin opened his eyes to see Amon holding the gag and staring at him with what seemed to be simple curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh..\" was all he could responded with, too amazed with the fact that he was still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am.\" A mustached Equalist spoke up \"We found him in the Triple Threat headquarters and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was speaking to him lieutenant.\" Amon cut him off calmly. \"I want him, to answer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin realized that maybe he had a chance to get out of the mess, so he took in a deep breath an explained as calmly as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not with The Triple Threats by choice! They had dirt on me and my brother, if I didn't work with them Shady Shen was going to destroy our chances at making an honest living! I mean sure we did some work for them back in the day, but it wasn't anything too bad I swear! I helped load cargo and Mako ran numbers, that's all! Well okay we also helped with clean up after deals didn't end well, but that's really it, I promise! We were kids off the street, our parents were killed when we little and we had nowhere else to turn and..and..*sob*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin was sure that it didn't matter what he said, with no proof their is no way the would ever believe him. And he doubted that the water works would sway them, even though the tears were genuine. One way or another, his life was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least that's what he thought before he felt Amon gently cup his to raise his face and look her in the eye. He could faintly make out what seem to be light blue eyes full of empathy and he felt his tears being softly wiped away with her thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then stood up and back the row of captives until she found Shady Shen. She the search his person until she found the photo that had Bolin on a leach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is telling the truth. Let him go.\" she ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But ma'am he's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An innocent strong armed into a gang war he wanted nothing to do with by scum he left behind in pursuit of an honest life.\" she finished for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then walked toward her lieutenant to make sure he heard her clearly. \"Need I remind you lieutenant that my mission, your mission, our mission, is to bring justice and equality to all. Bender and Non-Bender alike. You would do well to remember that. Am I understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lieutenant folded before his leaders gaze and bowed in remorse \"Perfectly ma'am, forgive me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are forgiven, but do not make me remind you again.\" she calmly warned as she walked back to Bolin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she helped him to his feet and freed him from his bounds she said \"You are an honest soul Bolin. And from what I've seen in The Pro-Bending arena a skilled and honorable fighter. I am honestly a bit a fan of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" he asked in astonishment as he rubbed his now freed writs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Despite what rumors may say, I am human and I have a life outside of my work.\" she said with a slightly cheeky tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin chucked a little at how surreal this all was, he never would have imagined that Amon had a sense of humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I'm sure your brother is worried about you and you are eager to get home, but I must warn you that the streets are dangerous at this time of night, especially at this part of the city.\" she informed the young man \"But I will not force you to stay if you wish to leave. So, do you wish to leave or would like to come with me to my quarters to rest for the night? I give you my word that I will escort you home first thing in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin was really taken aback by her generous offer, but he had to admit, taking sometime to get to know the mysterious Amon a little was very tempting. But he also knew that Mako and Korra were no doubt worried sick about him. So after a minute of thinking it over he decide to..</span></div></div>",

And don't worry I know this town like the back of my hand.\" he stated confidently. \"Besides, I'm a big boy, I can take care of myself.\" he said while flexing his muscles to prove his point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmon let out a small chuckle of amusement \"Clearly. But before you go I would like you to have this.\" she said while handing him a piece of paper that had a portrait of Amon reaching out with her hand as if it had the answer to an age old question with the words 'Witness The Revelation tonight at 9:00.' on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this revelation?\" he asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no doubt heard rumors and misconceptions of my goals for this city. I plan to set the record straight tomorrow night. And you are welcome to attend, along with anyone else you would like to bring with you.\" she explained \"Which reminds me..\" she turned her attention back to the criminals kneeling on the floor \"Get the rest of this filth ready for tomorrow.\" she ordered her troops who carried out her order quick and efficient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin turned the paper over to see if it had instructions on how to find where this event was taking place, but all he could see was a red dot in the upper left hand corner. \"But there is no map on this thing, how will I find out where is if I do want to come?\" he asked very confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned back to face him \"You're a big boy, I'm sure you can figure it out.\" she teased. Even though he couldn't see it because of the mask Bolin was sure that she had a shit-eating smirk on her face. \"Until we meet again.\" she said with a parting bow as she vanished into the darkness from wince she came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin stood alone in the warehouse room for minute to really process all that just happen. \"Man she is awesome.\" he said to himself softly. \"Scary beyond all reason, but awesome.\" With that said he then walked to the exit confident that he would find his way home in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The next morning)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I passed that shop 3 times already.\" a hopelessly lost Bolin said to himself. \"Aw man, my feet are killing me.\" he complained as he sat down to rest for a minute. After catching his breath he noticed a tram waiting booth across the street, they always had maps that told your current location. So he picked himself up to get a sense on where to go from here, only to meet two familiar faces. \"Korra?! Mako?!\" he exclaimed unable to believe his luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bolin/Bolin!!\" they shouted with relief as they ran to embrace him in a group hug, which he welcomed wholeheartedly. \"We were so worried!\" Korra said with moist eyes as she peppered his face with kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you manage to escape?\" Mako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's the thing, I didn't. Amon just let me go.\" he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What/What?!\" they asked greatly confused as the broke the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true! Once Amon found out I wasn't really with The Triple Threats she set me free. Even gave me this.\" he said while showing them his invitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just pieced together where this revelation taking place too.\" Korra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Because I can't make heads or tails of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's part of a puzzle bro.\" Mako said as he put all the pieces together for him to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh. That makes sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now all that's left to do is find this Amon and teach her a lesson.\" Korra said as she cracked her knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually Amon isn't as bad as you think she is, I mean she did let me go.\" Bolin reminded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, after her lackeys kidnapped you.\" Korra countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, we don't have to do anything else. Bolin's safe, so lets just call it a day.\" Mako reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think we should go. I'm sure if you guys give her a chance you'll see that Amon's better then you think.\" Bolin reaffirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see about that.\" Korra challenged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMako gave them a deadpan stare \"You two are perfect for each other, you're both crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Later that night)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin, Korra and Mako now found themselves in a crowd of thousands of people from all walks of life in what seemed to be an abandoned factory. There was a stage set up and the people were anxiously waiting for the event to start. Then the stage was lit and an announcer spoke \"PLEASE WELCOME YOUR HERO, YOUR SAVIOR, AMON!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheered as from under the stage floors rose Amon with 6 of her finest men behind her. Amon waited for the cheers to die down before she addressed her audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever since I was little I believed that everyone had the right to be treated fairly, equally. Only to learn quickly that few shared my beliefs. Our world is not a fair place my friends, this is the reality that we face everyday. Poverty, starvation, disease, discrimination, war. These are horrors that have plagued humanity since the beginning of time. It often makes one wonder, what's the point of it all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer speech had the audience hooked as they could feel the genuine emotion from her voice that made up for not being able to see her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a question I have asked myself many times before. And every time I do I remember my favorite story. It is the story of a man who lost everything and to top it off was burdened with the task of bringing peace and balance to a world ravaged by a century of war. A man who faced the absolute worst humanity had to offer when he was just a boy. A man who was told that if he was to save the world, a world that has already taken so much from, he must sacrifice his beliefs, that all life is precious and worth protecting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone knew this story, it was the story of Avatar Aang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And in spite of it all he managed to do the impossible, he saved the world while also staying true to his beliefs. And with the friends and allies he made on his journey, he founded The United Republic Of Nations. A place for people from all over the world can come together to share their cultures, learn and explore new ideas, to live a life full of endless possibilities. I ask you, how can one not be inspired by such a story?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were whispers in the crowd, ranging from people agreeing with her sentiments, people grumbling about how she could actually side with benders, to others who were just wondering where she was going with all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure many of you are may not agree with me, I am aware that many of you were hoping I was the leader an Anti-Bending Revolution. But the truth is, I share the beliefs of Avatar Aang, that in spite of all the ugliness, all the darkness, all the evil that plagues our world that there is also beauty, light and good in this world. And it's worth fighting for. And I also believe that we all own great debt to Aang and all the Avatars before him. For too long have the people of the world forgotten that we too have the power to make a difference. For too long have we looked to The Avatar to protect our world for us. The time has come for us to repay our debt and come together to forge a better future for everyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin was in awe at Amon's passionte speech, he could she truely believed in what she said. The power of her charisma was even starting to make her neigh sayers come around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand that such a feat sounds daunting, but I am here to tell you that it is very possible. You maybe wondering, what is the revelation? You are about to get your answer. I am aware that many of the worst criminals in this city are powerful benders, scum who abuse their gifts to exploit the weak and take for their own gain. I have battled against this filth for years, I have studied bending in all it's forms and after countless hours of training and study I have created the ultimate chi-blocking technique. It is an ablitiy believed only to The Avatar, a power that was used to save the world from Ozai. The power to take someones Bending away. Permanently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the crowd was in shock at hearing this, Korra was especially sure that such a thing was impossible. But the proof was in the pudding as to demonstrate her skill Lightning Bolt Zolt was brought to the stage and was allowed to fight for the right to keep his bending. And despite giving it his all, even when firing his trademark lightning bolt at near point blank range Amon gracfully dodged all his attacks and closed the distance between the with incredible speed. She then brought him to his knees and placed a thumb on his forehead and crowd watched with awe as the lightning changed to fire and then the fire was snuffed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the proof of her power laid bare Amon turned back to the audiunce. \"Behold the revelation! That through hard work and being steadfast in your beliefs, anything is possible! Now I beseech thee, my freinds, join me! And together we will create a new era peace and balance! I can not win this fight alone, so help me! Take charge of your own future! FOR JUSTICE!! FOR EQUALITY!!\" she finished by raising an emporing fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheerd so loudly it could be heard all over the city. Bolin had to admit, he was pretty enamored by Amon's sheer chraisma himself. And as he looked to his friends he saw that Mako was in a similar state. But with Korra on the other hand, her eyes were filled not with admiration, but fear.</span></div></div>",

Bolin didn't really understand what had Korra so freaked out, sure Amon can take peoples bending away, but she made it clear that it was a means to strip power from those who would abuse it, much like The Avatar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought made Bolin pause and think [Could that be it? Is Korra afraid that Amon may replace her?] he pondered. But his thoughts were interrupted by the music on the radio being changed to a broadcast from Amon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening people of Republic city, this is Amon. As you may have read in the papers The Republic Council has voted to make me public enemy number one. Councilman Tarrlok purposed the idea and like clockwork the others voted in favor, with the only voice of reason on the table, Councilman Tenzin, being ignored. This proves that The Council, the elected leaders who are meant to represent the people are nothing more then puppets and a tyrant who treat the legacy of Avatar Aang like a joke. They fear me because they know the people are with me, and they hate me because I am a threat to their power. But I refuse to let the fear of puppets and the hate of a tyrant sway me from my mission. To protect the innocent of this city and fight for justice. No matter what or who stands in my way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin felt chills down his spine from Amon speech \"Or maybe it's because that woman's default tone is intimidate.\" he said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Tomorrow afternoon)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin was walking down the street on his way to Air Temple Island to visit Korra. From the corner of his eye he noticed a bakery and a flower cart, which gave him the idea to buy a little something for her while he was at it. When he saw a break in traffic he ran across the street towards the bakery, only to be blindsided by a young woman on her moped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so sorry! I didn't see you!\" she said with a sweet voice full of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah don't worry about it.\" Bolin said with a slightly bruised pride, but otherwise fine. \"No harm dooo...\" he trailed of as he got a proper look at her, only to be bewitched by her beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong wavy raven hair, flawless porcelain skin, plump lips with the perfect amount of lipstick, soft green eyes accentuated by light purple eye shadow and of course an hourglass figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do..duh..who..where..words..can't..\" he was reduced to gibberish. Maybe he was hit harder then he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay? Did I hurt you? Agh, I'm such an idiot!\" she chastised herself as she helped him to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, really I'm fine.\" Bolin reassured as his speaking skills returned. \"I been hit by worse everyday in practice.\" he said as he dusted himself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman's lit up as she got a better look at him \"Hey I recognize you. Your Bolin right?! You play for The Fire Ferrets!\" she said fangirling a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! That me!\" he said with pride as he placed his fists on his hips and puffed up his chest like a superhero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lightly smacked herself, feeling like a complete fool in front of her favorite Pro-Bender. \"I am so embarrassed.\" she said with a cute blush. \"My name is Asami.\" she introduce herself with a handshake, which Bolin shook. \"Let me make this up to you somehow. Umm..how about I treat you to dinner? Tomorrow night, 8:00, Kwong's Cuisine.\" she invited generously as she walked back to her moped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kwong's?!\" he asked incredulously. That was the most upscale restaurant in the city! He would need winnings from half of his matches this seasons just to afford a nice enough suit to get in! \"Don't have any clothes nice enough for a place that classy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take care of that. All you need to do is show up.\" she said as she put on her helmet. \"So..it's a date?\" she asked hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuh yeah sure.\" was all he could say to such a generous offer from such a beautiful girl \"I'll see you then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she drove off she gave him one last smile that sent his heart a flutter, only to feel a wave of horror was over him as he realized what he just did. \"OH CRAP!! WHAT HAVE I DONE!!\" he shouted with his eyes nearly popping out of his skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'll tell you what you did Bolin, you broke the number 1 rule of dating!\" he chastised himself \"Never ask another girl out when your already in a relationship!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well technically she asked me out.\" he weakly pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't make it better!\" he countered harshly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDone arguing with himself he took in a deep breath to calm down \"It's okay. I can fix this. First thing I need to do is tell Korra the truth. And make it clear that you committed to her and you will let Asami know about your relationship with Korra when you see her tomorrow night.\" he said firmly to himself. He then gave himself a nod, confident in his plan. Only to feel the wave of doom wash over him again \"That's if Korra doesn't feed me to Naga first.\" he said with comical tears flowing down his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Later)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please forgive me!\" Bolin pleaded with a bow while handing out a rose and a tiny cake in a plastic bag as a peace offering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra stared in utter confusion at her boyfriend's odd behavior, even for him \"For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin then went on a rapid and detailed explanation on what happened between him and Asami, all though maybe a little too detailed when describing what Asami looked like. When he noticed the deep frown on her face he realized he might have said too much. So he did the smart thing and zipped his lip and waited for her judgment.</span></div></div>",

And I'm proud of you for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course I did!\" He stated like it was the most obvious thing in the world to do. \"I would have to be a special kind of idiot to do any of that other stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere in Republic City Mako let out a hard sneeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra giggled at that, but a familiar feeling of insecurity came over her \"Bolin, I want you to be honest with me. Do you think this Asami is prettier then me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin was about to tell her no, but he realized from the look on her face that such an answer wouldn't satisfy her. She wanted him to be completely honest, so after taking a minute to find the right words to say he gave his answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In terms of being a classy lady that would look amazing in any dress you gave her and having natural feminine charms, yes, she is prettier.\" he answered calmly. \"However, in terms of being a brave, strong, gorgeous warrior goddess that can kick ass and look good while doing it, you have her beat by miles.\" he finished with a charming smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra's face was hot with a blush and her heart was pounding so hard she could hear it \"You really feel that way about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I felt that way since the moment I met you.\" he said warmly as he captured her lips with a passionate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened at his bold action, but they fluttered closed as she melted into his kiss. After minutes that felt like hours of making out the young benders broke the kiss in order to breath in much needed air. \"Bedroom.\" Korra said short of breath as she grabbed him by the collar of his shirt to drag him to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin offered no resistance but did ask if she was sure of this, to which she said yes and as so as they entered her room she tackled him onto her bed. She then recaptured his lips and had her hands roam under his shirt, drawing a map in her head of his washboard abs and mountainous pecs. Meanwhile Bolin was undoing her hair tails, combing his fingers through her silky tendrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but surely their clothes fell to the floor and the young couple laid together naked as the day they were born. They hadn't gone all the way yet as Bolin could sense that as the more they got into it the shyer Korra became.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you really sure you want to do this?\" he asked gently while cupping her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, I really do. It's just..\" she pause for a moment to calm her racing heart. \"This my first time and..I want to do this right but, now that we come this far I find myself completely clueless on what to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I understand, it's my first time too.\" he reassured while bringing into a comforting hug. \"Korra, it's okay to be unsure. It's okay to be scared sometimes, especially when making a decision this big. I have no idea what I'm doing and I'm scared that I might do something to hurt you. But more then that, I want learn how to make you feel good. I want to explore your body and find all the best ways to please you.\" he whispered hotly in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis word lit a fire in her belly hotter then any she had ever felt before in Firebending training. \"I want that too, so badly.\" she whispered back with a voice full of arousal. \"Take me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so he did, slowly, awkwardly and a little painfully at first, but soon pain gave way to pure ecstasy as Bolin seemed to make it his life's mission to make love to her in every conceivable, which he did, for the rest of the day and well into the night until Korra passed out from sheer pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sweaty and slight out of breath Bolin stared at his catatonic girlfriend worried that he might have gone overboard, but when he noticed the content smile on her face as she slept his worries faded. After cleaning up a bit he then gently tucked her into bed and tenderly kissed her on the cheek \"I love you.\" he whispered softly as he walked silently out the door to let her rest in peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too.\" Korra whispered in her dreams, which were filled with wedding bells and her many future children.</span></div></div>",

He made sure to bathe before coming here and spruced up his outfit as best he could, but he still feared that they would throw him out since you could take one good look at him and all you could think was 'dirt poor'. [Well halfway in the river already.] he thought to himself as he took in a deep breath before taking the plunge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, welcome to Kwong's Cuisine, Master Bolin.\" greeted the Maitre D with practiced politeness and a deep bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master?\" Bolin questioned awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then found himself in the employee dressing room where the Maitre D himself dressed and spruce him up to meet the standards of the restaurant. It was a weird and little uncomfortable experience, but as he looked himself in the mirror when ready, all he could think was [Who's that good looking guy?] with honest amazement at nice he looked. The people who worked here were the best money could buy for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now sir, if you would follow me please?\" Maitre D instructed politely as he escorted Bolin to his table where Asami, who was a knockout in her amazing red dress, was waiting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bolin! I'm so glad you could make it.\" she said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if my presence alone is enough to make such a fine lady happy, then I'm glad I came to.\" Bolin said with playfully exaggerated gentlemen tone while taking his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled at his silliness \"Oh stop it.\" she said casually waving off his flattery with a slight blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[She's so cute!] he squealed in his head before smacking his face with both hands to regain his focus [Head in the game Bolin! You have to tell her that your already in happy relationship with Korra. Just have to find the right opportunity.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" she asked concerned with his odd behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm yeah! I'm fine! I'm just..\" he paused to find a good excuse \"making sure that I'm not dreaming this all up is all.\" he said with sheepish grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you think you're dreaming?\" she asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your kidding right?\" he asked back as if it was obvious \"Me, a random bum off the street dinning at Kwong's with a lovely woman like you? How could I not think I was dreaming?!\" [Dial it back on the complements you idiot!] he chastised himself in his head. But he said back to himself [I can't help it! She's so pretty! You know I can't lie to such a pretty face!]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't be ridiculous, you're not some random bum. You're Bolin of The Fire Ferret's, the best rookie Pro-bending team in Republic City! You deserve to be here.\" she said genuinely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[And she's so nice!] he cried to himself inside [Oh this nights going to be torture!] Luckily he was able to successfully mask his inner turmoil with a grateful smile. \"Thanks. So I take it your quite the Pro-bending fan huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A huge fan. I caught all your matches this season. My favorite was the one with the Tiger-Dillo's at the end when it was just you against three, they way you bravely tanked all to hits without budging! It was like you were made of steel!\" she said with increasing excitement, before regaining her composure \"Sorry, it just gets me pumped up whenever I think about it. I can't wait to see you in the tournament.\" she said with a cute blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, maybe next year.\" he a little down at remembering his teams financial problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked puzzled \"You made it in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did but..It turns out that we need to ante up 30000 yuans for the championship pot and we don't the cash so..we're out of the running.\" he explained depressingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not fair.\" she said truly sad for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey don't worry about it.\" he said returning to good spirits \"I'm honestly amazed we made it as far as we did, so I'm of proud me and my team. But enough about me, I'd like to get to know you more. Though from the way you got so excited about taking about my match with The Tiger-Dillo's it sounds to me your a bit of an adrenaline junkie.\" he teased with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami blushed again and twirled a strand of her hair shyly \"Well..I do test new Satomobile models on the race track at home so you might be on to something.\" she admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Race track? So you're a racer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon me Miss Sato, you main course.\" said a waiter placing two silver platters on the table. He opened the lids to reveal some sort of fancy, but tiny shrimp dish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure this is the main course?\" Bolin said while curiously pointing at the meager meal \"It looks more like an appetizer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis innocent question combined with the waiters very unamused face as he walked off made Asami burst with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it something I said?\" Bolin asked confused, which only made Asami laugh harder. He wasn't really sure what was so funny, but he had to admit she had a lovely laugh. [Is there anything about this woman that isn't cute?] he wondered to himself, before her last name registered with him. \"Wait a minute, Sato?! As in Hiroshi Sato inventor of the Satomobile?!\" he asked astonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, he's my dad.\" she said casually as she recovered from her laughing fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious. You want to meet him?\" she asked while taking a sip of her tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meet arguably the richest man in the city if not the world?! Twist my arm!\" he said while digging into his meal, finishing it in five seconds. \"Oh man this is good.\" he said with a slightly full mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis rather poor table manners made quite a scene for the other patrons who thought he was some uncouth simpleton, but Asami found it refreshing since she was so used to people trying to impress her all the time. To see him be himself even when he found out who she was made her feel relaxed as he was treating her like a normal person instead of royalty which she got enough of as is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh do you mind if I bring one of my girlfriend with me to meet your dad?\" Bolin asked thinking the was the perfect opportunity to bring it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girlfriend?\" she asked a little shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Korra, my Waterbending teammate. You would mind would you?\" he asked wondering if maybe he made a mistake in telling her like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not at all. The more the merrier.\" she said with a forced smile as she turned to her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah he screwed up alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't really sure how to bring it up.\" he admitted awkwardly \"I didn't mean-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no it's fine really.\" Asami reassured him. \"I should have figured a guy as sweet as you would be off the market anyway, all the best ones are.\" she said a little down at her missed opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Bolin was the kind of guy who couldn't stand to see a woman in distress, especially if was the cause of said distress. So he knew there was only one thing to do at a time like this..</span></div></div>",

Let's get out of here.\" Bolin stated boldly as he stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Asami asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to be honest, this place is fancy and the food is delicious, but it's not fun. I really appreciate you going through as this trouble for a poor schmuck like me, but now it's my turn to repay you for your kindness. So I propose we start this date over and go for a night on the town.\" he said while reaching out a hand for her to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis whole change in tone really threw Asami for a loop, but she had to admit that while she was used to dinning in places like Kwong's she did not like the near impossible standards places like this had for customers just to get in. All the favors she called in and strings she pulled just to have Bolin be able to enter was ridiculous. Definitely not the most welcoming place. Though she did often wonder what it would be like just to go on a simple date without all the extravagance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess we could try. But what about your girlfriend won't she-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You let me worry about that. For right now the only woman in my life is you. And I want to make this a night you will never forget.\" he said with a charming smile. But then he realized how what he just said could mean something totally different then what he meant \"In a good way of course.\" he added sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis goofy charms made her giggle and was enough to convince her \"Okay, let's go.\" she said as she quickly paid for their meal and took his offered hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked outside Asami escorted Bolin to a custom made Satomobile with her butler waiting for them. The butler being a tall, intimidating but beautiful Water Tribe woman. Her dark hair reached just past her shoulders and the only blemish on her otherwise perfect skin was a small third degree burn scar on her right cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finished already Miss Sato?\" the driver inquired professionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noa, how many times do I have to tell you to call me Asami when dad's not around?\" Asami asked like they have had this conversation a million times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possibly more then you already have.\" Noa answered with a small grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami pouted a little but she knew it was all in good fun. \"Bolin, I would like you to meet Noataka. She's been a part of my family ever since I was little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pleasure.\" she said neutrally with a small bow and offering her hand for a handshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you.\" Bolin said friendly as he accepted the gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe butler's grip was as strong and cold as iron. This was a tactic that she used to really test the character of people who associate with Asami. If they buckled under her strength or commented on how cold her hand was it meant they were weak and not just physically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice grip you got there.\" Bolin said impressed as he squeezed his hand to match her strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise.\" she said impressed herself at Bolin not only not buckling under the pressure, but meeting the challenge with his own. \"I like this one.\" she said with a slight flirty tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noa!\" Asami exclaimed with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoataka let out a small chuckle as she released the handshake and open the car door for the young couple. Once they were all buckled in Noa asked \"Where to ma'am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, where do you think Bolin?\" Asami asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin pondered the question for a minute until he found his answer. \"Let's go to get something real to eat. Don't get me wrong, Kwong's was the best food I ever tasted, but it wasn't what I'd really call a meal, you know? And this time, it's my treat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good.\" Asami agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Bolin gave instructions to his favorite food joint and when they got there Bolin offered Noataka to join them. She was going to refuse at first but she had to admit it had been years since she had an authentic plate of Water Tribe food. The scent of some of her own favorite foods coming from the eatery brought up many fond and bittersweet memories of home. So she figured, what the hell, and joined them at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food was not as fancy as Kwong's, but it was still very good, and filling. And best of all the atmosphere was much more welcoming and friendly. The small talk at the table was comfortable and full of laughs as Bolin regaled the ladies with tales of some of the funniest moments he and his brother had while training in the gym. Like how one time Mako accidentally hit Bolin with a head shot and set his hair on fire. Or the time when Papu peed on Mako's uniform and he spent the whole afternoon chasing after the ferret, threatening to make to make him into a hat, only for the ferret to constantly outwit him in increasingly embarrassing ways for Mako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their bellies full the trio returned to the car, this time it was Asami's turn to decide on where to go next and she decided on..</span></div></div>",

There's something I want to show Bolin.\" said Asami with a fond smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoataka immediately understood what her young mistress was talking about as fond smile of her own appeared on her face \"Of course ma'am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short drive later and the trio arrived at Republic City Park. As Asami guided Bolin through the path she wrapped her arms around one of his muscular arms and rested her head on his broad shoulder. Bolin was a little surprised at this intimate action, but he welcomed it by tenderly brushing some of her silky hair over her ear [She smells like Jasmine.] he thought pleasantly to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what is it that you want to show me? Or is it some sort of surprise?\" he asked excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That.\" she said while pointing to a tree. There didn't really seemed to be anything special about this tree that set it apart from all the others in the park, so Bolin was a little confused as to what the big deal was. \"This is were I first met Noataka.\" Asami clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh I see. So there's a story there huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hm, I was 5 at the time. My parents were taking me on a carriage ride through the park. Then I saw an ice cream cart, so naturally I begged my parents to go get some and they both left the carriage to get enough for all of us. As soon as they left a gust of wind blew my favorite sunhat away, so I got out of the carriage to chase after it. I don't know how long I had been chasing it but, by the time I finally caught it I realized I had no idea where I was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must have been terrifying.\" Bolin said full of empathy. He remembered all the times when he got separated from Mako on the streets, it was not fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was. My parents taught me that if I was ever lost, I should find a safe place to hide and stay put until they could find me. So that's what I did, I hunkered down on the base of that tree and waited. I waited for hours, it was getting dark, cold and was even starting to rain and I was so sacred. But then I heard a voice say-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright little lady?\" Noataka finished for her as she seemed to appear out of nowhere, causing Bolin and Asami to jump out of their skin a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must you do that Noa?\" Asami asked slightly irritated while placing a hand on her racing heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but it's fun.\" the cheeky butler said with a small smirk. Her face turned soft as fond memories flooded her mind \"I remember clearly finding a scared little girl then putting on the bravest face she could and saying to me 'My parents told me never to talk to strangers, especially if I'm lost'. And I said to her 'Your parents taught you well. But a little lady like you shouldn't be left alone in the rain, so I'll keep you dry and safe until your parents find you.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami had a soft smile of her own as she continued \"And that is what she did. Noa used her Waterbending to not only keep me dry, but used it to entertain me while we waited. She would make the water dance and take so many shapes it was like I had a front row seat at a circus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I did used to work in a circus.\" Noataka pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Bolin asked in slight disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. 'Ty Lee's Traveling circus.' I worked for her from my late teens to my early twenties. I learned many things from Ringmaster Ty Lee.\" Noataka said with a far away look as she recalled her rather whimsical years in the circus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait..Ty Lee?\" Bolin asked as the name registered in his head \"As in the same Ty Lee that worked for Azula before she rebelled and joined The Kyoshi Warriors?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The very same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's awesome. What was she like?\" he asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoataka paused for a minute to think on how to best describe her former boss \"Pink. Very very pink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what Bolin had heard in stories that seemed about right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before long I heard my parents calling out for me and Noa rushed off to guide them to me. When my parents asked her how they could repay her Noa insisted the didn't have to, but my mother would hear none of it. So she convinced my dad to hire her to be my personal attendant and made sure Noa had no choice but to accept her new job.\" Asami said with a cheeky tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoataka had a sweat drop on the back of her head \"Yeah, Lady Yasuko could not be swayed when she made up her mind about something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why was she so insistent on you working for them?\" Bolin asked the attendant curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoataka actually looked a little embarrassed as she explained \"Well..that was because at the time I was homeless. I had left the circus about a year ago at the time to try and see if I could make a new life for myself here in Republic City. Unfortunately I was woefully unprepared for city life as I had only lived in The North Pole for most of my life and the circus was like it's own little world, so for a time I was force to live as a vagabond.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Asami's mom basically had to force you to not be homeless anymore?\" Bolin asked with amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More or less.\" Asami answered for him with an amused smile of her own. But then her smile turned sad \"Mom really was the best.\" she said softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\" Noataka agreed solemnly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin read the mood and recognized the pain in their eyes \"I see. I lost my parents when I was very young too. In fact it happened so long ago..I can't even remember what they looked like.\" he said with tears falling down his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's terrible.\" Asami said with empathetic tears in her own eyes as she wrapped her arms around him in a tight embrace which he returned. Noataka looked on at the touching scene before her with with a smile smile, happy that her mistress could find someone other then herself to find comfort in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after Noataka had dropped Bolin off at the stadium, but not before Asami gave him a parting kiss on the cheek and said \"See you tomorrow.\" with a warm smile as they drove off. Needless to say Bolin was equally looking forward to and dreading the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The next morning)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin walking with a dance in his step and a Papu on his shoulder as he approached his girlfriend who was too busy playing with Naga to notice him just yet. \"Hey there gorgeous.\" Bolin called out happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bolin!\" Korra shouted with glee as she all but leaped into his arms and kissed him. As she broke the kiss Papu scurried off to go play with Naga \"So, how was last night?\" she asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! It got a little awkward when I told Asami about the fact I was already with you, but we still managed to have a good time.\" Bolin answered honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's good to here.\" she said happy that things went so smoothly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and Asami invited you to come with me to meet her dad, who is Hiroshi Sato by the way!\" Bolin said ecstatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" Korra asked astonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't so sure about meeting this Asami girl, but she did trust and love her boyfriend enough to at least give it a shot \"Well alright then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me Korra, you're going to love Asami!\" he said optimistically. But on the inside he was freaking out and praying that the meeting well go well.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bolin and Korra were in awe as Noataka escorted them through The Future Industries Main Factory, all the workers assembling Satomobiles in the hundreds at once truly was a sight to behold. Then they came across the head honcho himself Hiroshi Sato and his daughter waiting for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you must be Bolin! Asami has told me much about you.\" Hiroshi greeted him with a friendly handshake \"And you must be Avatar Korra, it's an honor to meet you.\" he said with slight reverence as he shook her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise.\" Korra said politely. She then turned her attention to the person she really came to see, and came to the conclusion that Bolin's descriptions of her really didn't do Asami justice. She could see why her boyfriend was so enamored with her, even if she didn't want to admit it out loud. \"You must be Asami.\" she said with a slightly forced polite tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you.\" Asami said kindly, but even she had a slight edge in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Okay, so far so good. Just got to keep things friendly and hopefully everyone can walk away from this happy.] Bolin thought to himself a little panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think of my little operation here.\" Hiroshi asked snapping Bolin back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um..\" he paused to look around to think of the best way to put it. \"It's very impressive, Mr. Sato.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please call me Hiroshi. So, I understand you're dirt poor.\" the industrialist said rather bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well..yeah.\" Bolin said a little embarrassed as there was really no other way to put it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young man, it's nothing to be ashamed of.\" the upper class man said kindly. \"I too came from humble beginnings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh here we go.\" Noataka rolled her eyes at having to hear this story for the millionth time. As she did her best to tune out Hiroshi telling Bolin about how he started his industrial empire, she noticed how Korra and Asami never took their eyes off each other. The looks they were giving one another weren't hostile or friendly. But they were definitely judgmental as if they were trying to decide on whether or not the other was worthy of something. Or to be more accurate someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she heard that her boss was done with his story, so she thought it would be best to get things moving again. \"Wonderful story as always sir. But how about you tell him what he really wants to hear.\" she said professionally, to which Hiroshi chuckled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Bolin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my daughter passionately told me all about your hard earned success in The Pro-Bending arena. And about your teams current..financial stumbling block.\" he said as he placed a comforting hand on Bolin's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words caused Korra to break her staring contest with Asami and turn her attention towards them, with Asami doing the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now my own rages to riches experience has made me quite the fan of underdog success stories. Which is why I'm going to sponsor The Fire Ferret's in the tournament!\" he announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For real?!\" Bolin asked astonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For real!\" Asami cheerfully confirmed \"He's going to cover your ante for the championship pot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's terrific!\" Korra exclaimed gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're back in business baby!\" Bolin cheered as he scooped Korra into his arms and spun her around in celebration much to her delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is one catch.\" Hiroshi cut in to the celebrations \"You all have to wear The Future Industries logo on your uniforms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tattoo it on my chest if you asked sir!\" Bolin stated while pointing to his chest for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have one for my back please!\" Korra joined in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful now, he might just tell you to do that. And then you will be his property forever.\" Noataka warning playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noa!\" Asami shouted while lightly smacking her on the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm..Owning The Avatar. Now that is a tempting idea.\" Hiroshi stroked his chin, seeming to give the idea some thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad!\" Asami gave him a light punch in the gut, knocking the wind out of him and causing everyone to burst into laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much!\" Bolin said as he gave Hiroshi another strong handshake \"I promise that The Fire Ferret's will repay your kindness by winning the championship with style!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you will young man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey dad, would you mind if I take them to the track?\" Asami asked hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The track?\" Korra asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's time for you to see the best part of in making the Satomobile.\" Asami said eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Later)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roar of Satomobile engines echoed across the paved field as Bolin, Korra, Asami and Noataka sat in the bleachers of The Furture Industries Race Track watching two drivers testing out new models in a race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty cool, right?\" Asami asked her new friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way cool.\" Korra said in awe at the machines speeding down the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know anything could move that fast!\" Bolin said very impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have either of you been behind the wheel?\" Asami asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been driven places, but never learned to drive myself.\" Bolin admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the only thing I know how to drive is a polar bear dog.\" Korra said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to go for a spin? Noa and I have been needing to have a tie breaker anyway.\" Asami said giving her attendant a challenging smirk, who responded in kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple looked at each other for a second before giving a nod in unison \"Let's do it!/Let's do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin and Korra now found themselves buckled in the back seats with Noataka and Asami respectively. The rumble of the engines sent shivers of excitement through their bodies as they wait for the flag man to begin the race. Two waves of a flag later and they were off with Noataka quickly taking the lead and almost causing Asami to drift off the track, but she managed to right herself and stepped on it. She soon caught up to Noataka, but her attendant was not going to make it easy as she swerved from side to side to keep her from passing. But Asami wasn't so easily descouraged as she switched gears and floored it just in time to make a successful pass and gain the lead. Only for Noataka to switch gears herself to match her mistress's speed and soon they were neck and neck as they passed the finish line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drivers parked in the pit stop and a camerman came running up with a photo he took of the finish line to show that Asami had managed to win by just a hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" she cheered as she and Korra shared a high five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man! And I thought Pro-Bending was intense! We were going so fast I thought we were going to fly off the road a few times there!\" Bolin said while leaning against the car trying to slow his pounding heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got to admit, I had you pegged wrong.\" Korras said to Asami humbly. \"I thought you would be kind of prissy and spoiled. No offence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine.\" Asami shrugged \"I'm used to people asuming I'm daddies little rich girl, but I like to think I can handle myself. Dad's taught me about engineering since I could speak and Noataka has been teaching me self-defence since I was 6. That way if I was to one day take over the family business I would be ready for whatever life threw at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra smiled as she seemed to really look at Asami for the first time. Not as a threat or rival, but as a person. As a friend. \"You know what Asami? I think you and I are going to get along just fine.\" she said as she extended a hand in friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\" Asami smiled as she accepted the hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin pumped his fist in triumph as things today worked out better then he could have hoped.</span></div></div>",

It was pretty rocky at first cause for the first hour it seemed that Korra couldn't tell the difference between the gas or the brake, so she couldn't go more then 10 feet without suddenly stopping. And by the time she could tell the difference she nearly crashed into a wall. Luckily she was able to stop in time. But despite the nerve wrecking experience Asami was able to keep her cool and patiently teach Korra one step at a time. Soon she was smoothly driving laps around the track, chatting up with Asami, really getting to know her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt warmed Bolin's heart to see them getting along so well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Bolin.\" Noataka said with a small but warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinked in surprise at her sudden comment \"For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For coming into Asami's life the way you did.\" she explained as she watched her young mistress drive by, Asami was laughing along with Korra at likely some joke they shared with one another. \"It does my heart good to know that she has finally found real friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin at first couldn't believe that someone as amazing as Asami didn't have friends, but as he thought about it he understood. With her vast wealth and incredible beauty most people must've felt like they weren't worthy to even be in her presence, he certainly felt that way when he first met her. And anyone she would normally associate with were likely stuck up rich folks who felt like they were better then everyone else, and that's not to say of any young men she met before. Only thinking about how to get it in with the gorgeous daughter of Hiroshi Sato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust think about all these shallow people made him sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to see you understand.\" she said snapping him out of his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make the exact same face I make whenever I think about all the other people Asami has had to meet over the years.\" she said while pointing at the deep frown he currently had. She then turned back to see the happy face of her mistress drive by again. \"I honestly haven't seen her this happy in a long time. Not since..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face turned grim as dark memories filled her mind \"Lady Yasuko's death was hard on all of us. She gave me a home, a family when I had nothing. The only thing Asami inherited from her father was his knack for machines. But her kindness, her beauty in both body and soul, all came from the woman who became like a sister to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin was getting a little scared right now cause even though Noataka's face was calm her light blue eyes blazed with righteous fury. \"And she was taken away from us all because of a man so consumed by greed he was willing to murder, all for the sake of getting a few yuans.\" she hissed with a voice colder then the arctic depths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact the air around them felt like it dropped at least 10 degrees, Bolin swore he could see his own breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Noataka was able to reign in her wrath by taking a deep breath, exhaling a chilling mist. \"Ever since that day Mr.Sato buried himself in his work to escape his grief, while I had to step in and take care of a little girl who's entire world crumbled all in one night. And I would do it all again a thousand time over. Asami is like the daughter I've never had. I can only hope that Yasuko is proud of the woman I raised in her place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She would be very proud.\" Bolin said with utmost confidence. \"If Asami really is anything like her mother, then she would tell you that you did an amazing job. And I bet if you ever had kids of your own, you would be a fantastic mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoataka had to admit, hearing him say that with such certainty made her heart skip a beat. She smiled at the young man softly \"That's very kind of you to say.\" She then approached him and placed her hands on his shoulders, looking at him with moist eyes. \"Bolin, should anything happen to me, please take care of her.\" she pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his heart stop at seeing such a normally composed woman so vulnerable, but he gave her the most determined look he could a said with all the strength he could muster \"I promise I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wrapped her arms around him with strong but trembling arms \"Thank you.\" she whispered sincerely. She truly felt reassured when she felt his own powerful arms return her embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on here?\" asked a confused Asami with Korra looking just as puzzled at the scene in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoataka broke the hug and wiped the tears from her eyes while giving her surrogate daughter a soft smile \"It's nothing to be concerned about.\" she said with her normal professional tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The next day at Air Temple Island)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin blinked in puzzlement at the strange but adorable sight in front of him. Ikki and Meelo were pretending to drive rather fancy new Satomobile with a pink bow on it's hood. \"So..where's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Korra practicing over that way! Now get out the way, the police are gaining on us!\" Ikki exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll never take us alive!\" Meelo shouted at the imaginary cops behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin chucked at their game and head towards his girlfriend in the middle of training. \"Nice new ride. I think Naga's going to be jealous though.\" he joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Like that hunk of junk has got anything on Naga!\" Korra jested in in kind as she went through some Airbending forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But seriously, what with the new car?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a 'gift' from Councilman Tarrlok. He's been sending all kinds of things to try and get me to join a task force he's recruiting for to take down Amon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! But Amon is a good guy, or well girl, why would he think she needs to be hunted? I mean, I get that she is scary, but she not a threat to the innocent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know that for sure Bolin. Nobody knows who she really is. Why does she wear a mask? What does she have to hide in the shadows? And why make such a big spectacle out of taking someones Bending away? Those sound like the actions of someone with something sinister planned. All that big talk about making the world a better place could be a lie to cover up her real plans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she puts it like that, he could understand where she is coming from and could even agree somewhat. But he saw the truly kind side of Amon, behind all the shadows and speeches. When she had no reason to think he wasn't with The Triple Threats she didn't just disregard his pleas of innocence, instead she listened, search for proof and when she found it she let him go, no strings attached. She even offered him safe harbor for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus he got the feeling that Korra wasn't being completely rational in her judgement of Amon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Avatar Korra!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir conversation was cut in by Tarrlok's secretary approaching them with a polite smile \"I have something for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter how many gifts Tarrlok sends, I'm not joining his task force!\" Korra said as she used Earthbending to spin him around and kick him in the butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a gift. It's an invitation.\" the secretary said keeping a professional tone as he held a pamphlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To what?\" she asked curiously as she swiped the pamphlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Councilman Tarrlok is holding a gala in your honor. All of Republic City's movers and shakers will be there. The Councilman humbly requests your attendance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra had a thoughtful frown as she looked at the pamphlet as it explained all the details, including the fact that she could invite a plus one. She looked to Bolin to see what he thought about this, but he just shrugged as to say it was up to her. She decided..</span></div></div>",

It's not like him to throw a party for the fun of it.\" he said seriously, bringing down her chipper mood a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin wrapped his arm around her shoulder to reassure her \"Oh relax Tenzin, it's party. We can still have a little fun.\" he said with casual enthusiasm. But then he noticed Meelo standing on a table near a punch bowl, pulling his pants down \"Though you might want to stop Meelo from..spiking the punch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenzin turned to face where Bolin was looking and panicked at what his son was about to do. \"No Meelo! That is not a Toilet!\" he exclaimed while running off to stop the little Airbender from peeing in the punch bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin and Korra shared a laugh at Tenzin's plight \"I don't think Meelo will be coming to more parties anytime soon after this.\" Korra said amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A shame. Kid's the life of the party.\" Bolin joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bolin! Korra!\" said a familiar voice. They turned around to see Asami walking up to them wearing the same dress she on her date with Bolin. \"I'm glad you could make it. You guys are some of the only people I can really talk to.\" she said with a slightly tired smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you again.\" Korra said happy to see her new friend as well. She notice someone missing though \"Where's Noataka? Isn't she like supposed to be like your shadow or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh she's around somewhere, hiding. She always does this whenever we go to gatherings like this.\" she said used to her attendant's mysterious behavior. \"But if I ever really need her she'll come running.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin and Korra looked around to see if the could spot the elusive butler, but saw neither hide or hair of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah don't bother. If she doesn't want to be seen then you'll never find her.\" Asami said amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's..kind of creepy.\" Korra said a little freaked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it.\" her boyfriend agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So glad you could make it Avatar Korra.\" Tarrlok said with practiced flattery as he approahed his guest of honor. \"If you'll please excuse us, the city awaits it's hero.\" he said gesturing her to follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra looked up to Bolin apologetically, but he gave her an understanding smile \"Go get 'em.\" She smiled gratefully at him and kissed his cheek sweetly before she followed the councilman to shake hands and make headlines with the big shots of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite understanding why she needed to go Bolin was still pretty bummed that he wasn't able to spend as much time as he would've liked. He felt Asami place a comforting hand on his shoulder and she gave him a sympathetic smile, which he very much appreciated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, why don't you come with me and meet The Airbenders?\" Bolin asked while offering his arm for her to hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and gently took hold of his offered arm \"I would love to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenzin was in the middle of scolding his son for nearly peeing in the punch bowl as they approached him. He paused when he noticed the young couple before turning back to Meelo \"We will talk about this more when we get home young man.\" he said sternly. He then took a deep breath and put on a polite smile \"Ah, you must be Ms.Sato. Bolin has talked much about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only good things I hope.\" she said in good humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're pretty. Can I have some of your hair?\" Meelo asked innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn awkward silence filled the group as nobody could knew what to say at that. Though let's be glad Meelo was 5 and didn't really know any better otherwise that would've REALLY been creepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meelo perhaps we should go find mommy? Excuse us.\" Tenzin said with an awkward smile as he escorted his son away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until we meet again beautiful woman!\" Meelo said happily waving goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin and Asami gave each other a look before sharing a laugh at the sheer randomness of that whole exchange. \"Kids.\" Bolin shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bolin!\" Ikki cheerfully cried out as she ran up to meet them with her big sister in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ikki! Jinora!\" Bolin cheered in kind as he scooped up the two Airbenders in a warm hug. \"How are my two favorite girls doing?\" he asked warmly as he placed them back on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say that and yet you also have Korra and Asami.\" Ikki said accusatory. \"Which of us are really your favorite girls?\" she asked with narrow eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh..\" Bolin was really put on the spot and had no idea what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ikki knock it off.\" Jinroa said coming to his rescue. \"You know he's dating Korra right now. And we are far too young to be dating anyone anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you would like to date Bolin wouldn't you?\" Ikki asked her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinora face turned completely red at her insinuation \"NO I WOULDN'T!!\" she strongly denied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what does Bolin dating Korra have to do with him not dating Asami?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ikki, how many times do I have to tell you? Open relationships are only accepted among Airbenders! Everywhere else is is monogamous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's stupid! Asami clearly likes Bolin and you like Bolin, so why can't you guys all be happy together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because that just how the world works! And for the last time I do not like Bolin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sister continued to bicker all Bolin could do was give a confused Asami a sheepish grin \"Hehehe..kids am I right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami's confusioned look turned mischievous \"Actually, I would like to who your two favorite girls really are myself.\" she said with a smirk as she leaned into him, making sure his muscular arm was buried between her full breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin was speechless at her boldness and his brain shut down at feeling her soft assets against him [Their softer then Korra's.] he thought in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before he could even think about forming a response the flashes of many cameras and reporters asking questions drew their attention to the stairs as Korra was about to give her answers to the press on how she plans to deal with Amon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Avatar Korra, you witnessed Amon take peoples bending away first hand.\" stated a male reporter. \"Even though she claims it's to protect the innocent from those who would abuse their power, can you confidently say that Amon won't abuse this power herself and use it on the people she claims to protect?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra nervously cleared her throat \"I think..that Amon can't be trusted with that kind of power.\" she said with little confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTarrlok smiled smugly behind her, thinking that it was only a matter of time before Korra backed herself into a corner and fell right into his hands. Meanwhile Tenzin was hoping that Korra could find a way out of the mess she unwittingly found herself in, while Bolin and Asami weren't sure what to think and could only hope that Korra knew what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why have you refused to join Tarrlok's task force?\" another reporter asked. \"As the Avatar shouldn't you be going after Amon if you think she is a threat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well..I..\" she wasn't sure what to say and the cameras flashing in her eyes certainly didn't help get her thoughts together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you backing away from this fight?\" the same reporter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" she asked with slight indignation. \"No, I have never back away from anything in my life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even as she said that, the cameras kept flashing and the questions got more personal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You promised to serve this city, are you going back on that promise now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think Pro-Bending is more important then keeping the peace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you think Avatar Aang would have handled this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you afraid of Amon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the last straw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not afraid of anybody!\" Korra declared for everyone to hear.\"But I'll tell you who is really afraid, Amon! If she was any real hero then she wouldn't always be hiding in the shadows like a coward! So get this message out to every paper and broadcast it from every radio in the city! Amon, I challenge you to a duel! No task force, no chi-blockers, just the two of us tomorrow night at midnight on Avatar Aang Memorial Island! Let's cut to the chase and settle this once and for all! If you have the guts to face me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that declaration she stormed her way down the stairs and through the crowd of reporters all hoping to get another comment, but she ghosted them and left the party in a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Korra wait!\" Tenzin cried out running up to his young charge. \"Korra this madness!\" he said sternly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't try to stop me!\" she said stubbornly \"This is something I have to do Tenzin. And I have to do it alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you don't.\" Bolin said strongly as he walked up to his girlfriend with Asami in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bolin don't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made a promise to help you face any danger you would encounter as the Avatar, even if it meant facing the end of the world. And that is a promise I intended to keep.\" he stated resolutely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra could feel her heart about to burst with love as she saw the strength in his green eyes, he really meant every word he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm coming too.\" Asami said suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Korra blinked in surprise. \"Why would you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys are the only real friends I've ever had. There is no way I'm letting you face this alone.\" the upper class lady said with conviction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra found herself moved by her new friend's loyalty. \"But I said I would face Amon alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You exact words were 'No task force, No chi-blockers.' You never said anything about 'No friends.'\" Bolin pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, who's to say Amon will even honor that whole 'No chi-blocker' rule?\" Asami added \"You need to be ready for anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we won't get in the way of you facing Amon, we will just be there to stop her from trying anything funny.\" Bolin finished. Even though he did trust Amon more then most he wouldn't put it passed her to stack the odds in her favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra had to admit, they both made good points. And she could see that she couldn't talk them out of it, so she figured it's best just to accept it. \"Alright. I'll be counting on you two.\" she said gratefully<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won't let you down!\" Bolin shouted with a salute, making the girls chuckle at how seriously he was taking this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Tenzin watched the whole exchange bemused. He was suppose to try and talk Korra out of going through with this crazy plan of hers, but as he quickly learned when dealing with Korra when she made up her mind about something it was almost impossible to change it. All you can do in the end is be there for her when she either triumphs or fails, but as he looked at the friends she made since coming here, he found himself surprisingly optimistic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Tomorrow. Near midnight.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe press did their job as every newspaper and every radio in the city was talking up the upcoming duel between Korra and Amon. They were saying it could possibly be the most epic duel the world had ever seen since Aang vs Ozai. You would've had to be blind, deaf, dumb and living under a rock to have not of heard about this fight. So naturally Mako caught wind of this and tried to talk his brother out of it, and when that didn't work he then said he was coming too. He would not let his little brother walk into a Sabertooth-Moose-Lion's den alone if he could help it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Korra stood with her friends on top of the memorial building waiting for the clock to strike 12. Korra thought she saw something move from the corner of her eye, so she got into a fighting stance with everyone else following suit. But it didn't seem that anything was there so they relaxed there guard, only to all jump at once when the clock ringed, signaling that it was now midnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team all took in a deep breath to steel themselves for the fight ahead. And this time everyone saw something at the corner of their eye and they turned to face the masked vigilante herself stepping out from behind one of the statues feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I received your invitation, young Avatar.\" Amon stated calmly \"Though I was under the impression you wanted to face me alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I will.\" Korra retorted with as much courage as she could muster. \"My friends are here just in case you decided play dirty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm..preparing for the inevitable fact that your enemies will not fight fair. There just maybe hope for you yet.\" the masked woman said honestly impressed. \"Then I hope if you don't mind if I brought a few friends of my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if they were summoned from The Spirit World 12 Equalists ambushed Korra's friends. And in the blink of an eye they had their chi blocked and were brought to their knees in submission holds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra tried to come to their aid, but she was stopped by a bola with a rope warping around her ankles. Her feet were pulled out from under her and she was dragged towards Amon, but Korra broke free with a flaming hand stand kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra got into her fighting stance and glared hatefully at Amon \"You are going to pay for that.\" she hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shall see.\" said Amon not fazed in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stared each other down for a minute and as if to add more dramatic weight to this duel rain started to fall. And with a flash of lightning and roar of thunder the two heroes clashed!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Korra made the first move by unleashing a ferocious barrage of fire punches and kicks, as well as tossing in some earth bullets for good measure. Amon effortlessly bobbed and weaved between the flames and rock launched her way and responded to Korra's attack by throwing a set of throwing knifes. Korra back flipped to dodge the blades, but this left her open for Amon to catch her mid air with two bolas which wrapped around her arms and ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the young Avatar struggled to escape her binds Amon quickly closed the distance between them and place a thumb on Korra's forehead, which made her and her friends freeze in horror. Amon kept her thumb there for a good few seconds before pure frantic instinct took hold of Korra which gave her the strength to tear apart the bolas and attack with reckless fiery abandon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer wild strikes were powerful, but left her wide open and her fear clouded mind allowed Amon take advantage as she flowed through the chaotic elemental barrage to sweep kick her legs and pine her to the floor on her back with a knife near her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is two times in the span of a minute that if I really wanted to, I could have either taken your Bending or your life.\" Amon explained menacingly as the rain began to change to a down pour. \"Be thankful I do not view you as an enemy, otherwise you would have gone down in history as the youngest Avatar to have ever died. And all before you had ever really accomplished anything.\" she taunted as she slowly brought the knife from Korra's throat to her left cheek and used the tip to leave a small but deep cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra's anger was able to overpower her fear as she let out a powerful breath of fire causing Amon to jump off her lest she suffer terrible burns. She then sent out a couple more fire balls to follow up, but the rain quickly snuffed them out. \"Firebending in the rain, not very smart of you.\" the masked woman taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra growled in frustration, but it quickly turned to smug satisfaction as she realized that she now had the upper hand. \"True, but Waterbending in the rain is another story!\" she said with a triumphant smirk as she summoned all the water around her to forum octopus tentacles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom then on the battle completely turned to Korra's favor as all Amon could do was dodge Korra's never ending watery assault. From using her octopus technique to both attack and defend, to launching a literal hail of ice daggers, to sending a tidal wave crashing towards the masked fighter and more. Amon had to use every bit of her seemingly inhuman agility to stay in the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for a minute until Korra was able to sneak in a little ice on the floor which tripped Amon up and allowed Korra to trap her in an ice prison. \"Ha! Not so tough now are you!\" taunted the smug Avatar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right! Go Korra!\" Bolin cheered from the sidelines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't go celebrating just yet.\" warned one of the equalists pinning him. \"Amon's is far from finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra turned her attention towards the lackeys that held her friends captive \"Yeah right! I got her right where I want her! And once I'm done with her your..next..?\" Her threat lost it's strength as her left arm fell to her side, numb. \"What's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be the paralysis agent taking effect.\" Amon explained, seemingly not fazed by her freezing confinement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paralysis?! When would you have..wait..\" Korra replayed the battle so far in her head until she found the answer \"The knife!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Amon confirmed \"Laced with Shirshu saliva, just enough to cause numbness for a few minutes. It normally takes longer to take effect, but with how fast your blood is no doubt pumping through your veins from this battle it's much more fast acting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU CHEATING BITCH!!\" Korra screamed in rage as she tried to launch a fire fist, but the agent had spread to her leg, throwing her of balance and sending her to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the contrary, this duel was staked in your favor from the very beginning.\" Amon retorted \"If being able to wield all the elements wasn't enough, I knew it was going to rain at this time of night, there for giving you an even greater advantage. Also..\" the ice prison around her melted rapidly, revealing a shocking fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a Waterbender?!\" Korra exclaimed in astonishment \"You mean this whole time you've been-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holding back? Yes. And those men who have your friends at my mercy? They are actually some of my newest recruits. They have been under my direct tutelage for only 6 weeks. The only advantage they had on their side was surprise and numbers. If your friends had been more alert, then they would've been able to best them easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you telling me all this?!\" Korra asked frantically, doing everything she can just to stay on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To teach you just how woefully unprepared you are to face the cruelty, the insanity, the pure evil that plagues this city.\" Amon stated with overwhelming authority. \"You are highly skilled and well trained Korra, but there are people in this world who are willing to do anything to kill you, to make you and those you love suffer. Observe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmon unbutton her uniform to reveal not only a well toned, curvy body fit for a warrior, but also the dozens upon dozens of scars from the many battles she faced over the years fighting the dark underworld of Republic City. Scars from knifes, burns, puncher wounds in her ribs, and that was only from what they could see from her torso. She no doubt had many more all over her body, this woman had been through hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra and her friends were horrified at this gruesome sight, many of those wounds made them wonder how it was possible that this woman was even still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have face horrors you can't imagine, I have nearly died countless times. And the only reason I am still fighting, the only reason I am still alive is because I have someone so precious to me that I am willing to do anything to protect them. Someone I am willing to die for, so they can have a better future. Where as the worst you have ever faced is some common thugs off the street and a few athletes in a safe, regulated sport. You may be The Avatar, but take that away and what are you hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra was in tears as she fell to knees powerless in the face of her greatest fear, not Amon, although she was a close second, but an even greater fear. A fear that the masked hero could see all too clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you what you are..nothing. Just a scared young woman who is way in over her head. A naive child who wants to do good, but has no idea what she is doing. Someone who doesn't even deserve the incredible power she wields. A girl who if she wasn't the Avatar, nobody would need her. Or even care about her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT\"S NOT TRUE!!!\" Bolin roared as he almost broke free from the Equalists holding him him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We blocked his chi! How is he this strong?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't love you because you're The Avatar Korra, I love you because you're brave, kind, headstrong, beautiful, you don't take crap from anybody, you can dance and burp with the best of them and so much more! There have been many Avatars, but there has never been one like you Korra! You are one of a kind and I love you!\" he cried out with all his might as he slowly, but surely was able to break free and fight the amateur Equalists with sheer brute strength fueled by the power of love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are the most stubborn and frustrating woman I have ever met!\" Mako said passionately as he was able to use the shock of the Equalists caused by his brother to break out of his own pinned position. \"But you are also the best thing to ever happen to my brother! I have never seen him more happy in his life then when he's with you! So don't you dare disrespect his love for you by giving up now!\" he chastised as he joined his brother in laying the smack down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are one of the only people outside of my family that I ever made a real connection with!\" Asami confessed as years of self-defense lessons kicked into high gear as she gave one the Equalists a backwards headbutt, causing him to loosen his grip and allowing her to get the leverage she needed to throw the other over her shoulder. \"We may have not been friends for long, but you didn't care about my wealth or status and that means more to me then you could ever realize! Avatar or not, you are my friend Korra and you always will be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra felt happiness she never thought could exist as she witness her friends fight with skill and spirit she had only heard of in stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A truly moving sight indeed.\" Amon said honestly impressed at the display. But she steeled her heart for what needed to be done. \"However..\" with a few gestures the young heroes were quickly all pinned together in ice, she then formed an ice sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra's eyes widened in terror \"NO!! PLEASE DON'T!!\" she screamed in desperation trying to fight through the numbness. But Amon did not head her as she charged with sword in hand intent a 3-way execution. \"NOOO!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every last bit of strength she had she threw a punch that blast not fire, water or earth, but for the first time in her life a blast of air so powerful it not only hit Amon, but it blasted her clear off the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was in awe, but none more so then Korra as she looked at her fist in disbelief \"I can Airbend? I can Airbend!\" she roared in triumph as she let loose more air blasts Equalists. At seeing how outmatched they were they fled the scene. With one threat out of the way she freed her friends to help finish this once and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team found Amon laying on the ground seemingly in defeat, but not taking any chances Korra bended an earth prison around the masked woman, leaving only her head free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then pulled down her hood and took off her mask \"Alright Amon let's see..who you..really are..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody could believe the true identity of Amon, but their she was clear as day with a proud smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well fought Korra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOATAKA?!?!\"</span></div></div>",

In the event that Korra had failed to do anything to save you, then I would've simply made the ice blade melt when I followed through on my swing. Everything I did was a means to test you, to see if any of you were ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for what?\" asked Mako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"War.\" she stated heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA feeling of great dread washed over the young heroes, they looked among themselves with eyes full of worry before turning their attention back to Noataka. \"What do you mean? What war?\" asked Korra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A war that has been brewing in this city for years, a war that I may have inadvertently caused.\" she said with great shame. \"When I first began my mission I did so alone. My intention was to become an entity that could strike fear into the hearts of even the coldest, blackest hearts of the most hardened criminals. Much like how parents use stories of Koh The Face Stealer to get their children to behave, I wanted the mere mention of my name to be a powerful crime deterrent. And for a time I succeeded, crime was dropping, the streets were safe to walk at night and the people were happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that didn't last long huh?\" Bolin asked understanding were this story was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. It wasn't long before criminals became smarter in their activities, more ruthless in their methods. They formed alliances and developed counter strategies for my skills. And no matter what I did to evolve my skills or upgrade my arsenal, I soon devolved from being crimes worst nightmare, into nothing more then a constant annoyance. Much like the police.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging from all the scars she showed them earlier she wasn't kidding. It started to make sense why Amon was so terrifying and ruthless, she had to be in order to not only fight crime, but just to stay alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I quickly realized that if I was to have any real hope in my war on crime I needed help. I started out small, with only one man I could trust at my side. Then more joined the fight and as the years pasted I soon became the leader of a small, but highly skilled army who's sole purpose was to protect the weak and fight evil.\" she said with a small smile, remembering brighter times. But then her face turned grim again \"Or at least..that was the idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Despite all of our success, many of my followers started to believe I was too soft in my methods. They said that I wasn't going far enough, that so long as criminals always had their Bending they would never stop terrorizing the helpless. They even started to believe that Bending in of itself is the root of all evil and that we need to simply get rid of Benders all together. That is why I created my technique to permanently take someones Bending, to not only take power away from those who abuse it, but to keep my more extreme followers in line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That reminds me.\" Korra interjected \"How do you take someones bending away anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a question that everyone wanted the answer to. And for a brief moment Noataka was very reluctant to tell them one of her darkest secrets, but deep down she knew that if she was ever going to get them to trust her, especially Asami, they needed to know the truth. She took in a deep breath to steel herself \"I use Bloodbending.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis answer left everyone stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin:Say what?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMako:No way..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami:I don't believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's impossible! It wasn't a full moon that night!\" Korra pointed out in denial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bare in mind Korra, that the art of Bloodbending itself was once believed to be an impossible skill.\" Noataka reminded \"The same with Metalbending. And generating lightning was an ability once only know to those of Fire Nation royalty. With enough time, practice and talent any skill can be learned, created and improved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. That is deep.\" Bolin said with awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said at The Revelation, I studied Bending and how it works for years. Through my research I discovered how the chakras in ones body can influence how all of ones chi flows. If even one of these chakras is damaged, then ones chi becomes impossible to use, thus taking away their Bending.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but there's something that I still don't get.\" said Mako puzzled \"Why go to this extreme to fight crime instead of joining the police?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami's eyes widened as the answer became clear \"It because of what happened to mom..isn't it?\" she asked softy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoataka's eyes were filled with silent tears at the mention of her surrogate sister \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's how your face got burned too. You hunted the man who killed her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean that scar on her cheek?\" Bolin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It used to be so much worse. Nearly her whole face was burned.\" Asami said with grimace at remembering the horrid sight of her attendant's injury. \"My dad spent a small fortune on facial reconstruction surgery to heal her. Most of the damage was healed, but only physically. Psychologically however..\" she fell silent at the memory of how scary Noataka was on her road to recovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was in a dark place, to say the least.\" Noataka finished for her mistress. \"I was sent to the North Pole to receive physical and mental therapy from Master Katara. She had to use every bit of her skill, wisdom and patience to heal not only my damaged face, but my damaged mind. I spent many of those grueling months denying her treatment, spitting in her face, cursing her and every other Bender. Saying things like how the only thing Bending has brought to the world is suffering and she should just die. I have even attempted to take my own life.\" she said full of guilt and hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami was in tears herself as she now understood all the pain the Noataka had to suffer alone. Korra feeling empathy for the both of them and know Noataka wasn't a threat she Bended the earth prison away so that the two of them could embrace. Bolin was weeping like a baby as he gave his own brother a hug at hearing the tragic story, which Mako returned. He then looked to Korra and offered her to join in which she accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few minutes pain was shared and plenty of tears were shed, before Noataka was able to finish her tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But in spite of all my misplaced anger and self loathing Master Katara only ever responded with kindness and understanding. She would tell me stories of her travels with Avatar Aang, of all the things she saw, the people she met and helped, of all the struggles she and her friends faced and even of her personal quest for revenge against the man who killed her mother. And every full moon she would use Bloodbending herself to help heal the rest of my injury. When I asked her why she would use a skill that she outlawed, said was evil she told me 'It took me many years to realize this truth, no skill is good or evil. All that matters is how we decide to use them. So the only question is Noataka, how will you decide to use your skills? It's all up to you.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I decide to use my skills to fight for a better future for the ones I love. But in doing so I fear I may have emboldened those who will use the skills I have taught them for their own ends. Ends which could endanger the lives of countless innocents. So I beg of you, all of you. Please help me fix my mistake and save the city. Help me protect what I love.\" she pleaded sincerely reaching out with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra smiled softly as she grabbed the veteran hero's hand \"I will.\" she promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So will I.\" Asami said placing her hand on top of theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're in too.\" Bolin said boldly as he and his brother joined in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Noataka said with great relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look out criminals of Republic City!\" Bolin shouted out while pointing to the city \"Cause The New Team Avatar is here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH!!\" they all cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The next day at City Hall)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra stood at the podium with all her friends behind her as she looked out at the huge crowd waiting to hear her address about what happened on the island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be completely honest with all of you. When I came to Republic City I thought if I just learned how to Airbend then I would be The Avatar I needed to be in order to bring balance and peace. I didn't realize just how much of my sense of identity was tailored to my Bending, to my title as The Avatar. And that it was the very thing that held me back from achieving my potential. But my duel with Amon taught me that it's not my ability to Bend all the elements that makes me The Avatar, but my desire to help people, to protect those precious to me and make the world a better place. And that is potential that exists in all of us, Bender and None-Bender alike. I understand now that I can't protect the city alone, I will need the help of my friends and all of you. So as I continue to learn to be a better Avatar, I encourage the people of this city to remember that you too have the power to make the world a better place. And it is only possible when we all stand together. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished her speech with a humble bow and the people cheered at her inspiring words. She then felt familiar strong arms embrace her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well said Korra.\" Bolin said with a proud smile.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>3 weeks seemed to pass in the blink of an eye as The Fire Ferrets, aka Team Avatar, have dedicated nearly every waking moment of their lives to training for not only the championship tournament, but for the war that Noataka warned was coming. And with how tensions between Benders and None-Benders started to rise ever since Tarrlok created his task force it seemed she had very good reason to be worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though he would tell the public that Amon was dangerous and needed to be stopped, it was becoming clear that he was the dangerous one, as he was arresting people without due process just because he suspected them to be Equalists, without hard evidence. And anytime he actually made a legitimate arrest, like when he took down a secret chi-blocking training gym under a book store, it was in places that were once crime invested neighborhoods. But thanks to not only The Equalists direct actions did crime drop greatly in these neighborhoods, but the people also had the means to protect themselves, their homes and families thanks to what they learned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf that wasn't bad enough every supposed unlawful thing he did was technically legal, thanks to the nearly unlimited power the council granted him when he created the task force. So even if someone like Chief Lin Beifong apposed any arrest he made, which she did, frequently, there was nothing she could do to stop him since he wasn't technically breaking the law. Worst of all is that no matter how much Tenzin tried to stop Tarrlok from getting more power he was outvoted every single time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA task force headed by a power hungry Bender, brought in to law by a council comprised only of Benders, able to lawfully judge any None-Bender as a criminal and imprison them with impunity. This was giving Amon's more zealous followers plenty of reasons to revolt against her and start an Anti-Bending Revolution. The city had become a barrel of blasting jelly ready to blow, if something wasn't done about it soon the city would fall into absolute chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily Noataka did have a plan to not only prepare the young heroes for the worst, but also help ease tensions just enough so that a peaceful resolution could still be possible. With Pro-Bending being the most popular sport in the city, it was the one place were Benders and None-Benders could put aside there differences and enjoy the spirit of healthy competition. And with The Fire Ferrets quickly becoming everyone's favorite team with their underdog origins and sheer likability, then wining the championship was the perfect means to raise positive moral among the people and teach Team Avatar the skills they would need, like teamwork, for when they began real hero work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich brings us to our young heroes currently in the middle of an intense three-way sparing session as Bolin, Korra and Mako unleashed excellently executed attacks and defenses, all under the watchful eye of their new coach Noataka. Soon the young Benders each found openings in each others defense as Mako hit his brother with a curved fireball knocking him off his feet. But Bolin notice Korra's attention was focused on Mako so he launched an earth disk her way just before he hit the ground. The earth disk hit it's mark in her torso just as Korra launched a water bullet which blasted Mako in the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of them hit the floor at near the exact same time, but they just laughed it off, proud of each other for how much they had improved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great work team.\" Noataka said with a proud smile. \"As individuals you have improved by leaps and bounds..but now lets see how well you have improved as a unit.\" Her smile changed to a smirk as she got into her fighting stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Benders jumped back to their feet and got into formation and in perfect unison attacked their coach from all sides. Normally 3 against 1 would be unfair, but for someone like Noataka who has face far worse many times it was more unfair for The Ferrets. All she did was dodge, never raised a fist or fought back, but within minute The Ferrets were back on the ground panting in exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you didn't hit each other this time, so that's a good start.\" the veteran teased. She then turned serious \"Just remember, in a real fight your enemies will use any means to get the upper hand, there are no rules or safety gear on the streets. When the time comes you can not hesitate or show mercy, your enemies will kill you if they get the chance. Do Not, give them that chance. Watch each others backs. Enhance each others strengths. Cover each others weaknesses. And most importantly, never give up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra smirked \"Good advise.\" She then sent out a sudden gust of wind that knocked Noataka of her feet. To which Bolin and Mako followed up with earth and fire one-two combo to knock her higher into the air. Korra then quickly finished with a hammer blow of water, slamming her to the ground and pinned her in place with ice. The Ferrets then quickly closed in with their respected elements at the ready for a finishing blow, but stopped just short of following through. \"I think you forgot one crucial thing to remember..\" Korra said smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never let your guard down.\" Mako finished with just as much satisfaction at finally getting one up on their normally unbeatable mentor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ferrets 1, Noataka..101. Man I really wanted to follow up with something cool there.\" Bolin said embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get plenty of chances later sweety.\" Korra said compassionately to her boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha! Well played team!\" Noataka said full of pride for her new students. She melted the ice around her and stood up \"Alright now, huddle up.\" The team did so, looking at one another with pride in how far they've come and excitement for the matches ahead. \"Your first match in the tournament is tonight. You may not have been a team for long, but I can safely say your one of the best teams I've ever seen. Your ready for this.\" she said sincerely \"Do you feel ready?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're Ready/We're Ready/We're Ready!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite yet.\" Asami called out as she walked into the gym with a basket of new Pro-Bending uniforms \"You'll need these.\" she said with a playful wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet!\" Bolin cheered as he ran over to find his uniform \"You managed to get my measurements right? It's really hard for me to find clothes able to fit all..this.\" he said while flexing his very impressive muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami blushed at the display, but kept her composure \"Yes, I made sure to put in a special order.\" she said playing along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright enough flirting you two.\" Korra casually interjected as she wrapped her arms around one of his biceps \"We're having lunch with Tenzin's family in a hour, so if you will excuse us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um..yeah we got to go. See ya later tonight guys.\" Bolin said nervously as his girlfriend escorted out. \"You know I wasn't really flirting with Asami right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I was just teasing.\" she said knowingly. \"I know you wouldn't ever cheat on me.\" she snuggled into his broad shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed in relief and smiled warmly at her, happy with the fact she was so understanding. Little did either of them realize that Asami was watching them leave with pained, dare I say jealous look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the comforting hand of Noataka on her shoulder, she looked to see her surrogate mother give her a sympathetic smile \"You still have a crush on him, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Not anymore.\" she said honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoataka was surprised and a little confused, but as she notice the tears started to while in her mistresses eyes she understood. \"I see. You love him don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried to let it go. I can see that he's happy and I like Korra, their good for each other. I should be happy for them. But everyday it gets harder for me to see him in the arms of another woman. And I don't know what to do!\" she confessed with a voice full of pain and confusion. \"What do I do Noa?! Everyday it feels like my heart is being squeezed! I don't want to end up being bitter and hating them! What am I suppose to do?!\" she cried out desperately as she buried her face into her attendant's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Noataka could do was wrap her arms around Asami \"I don't know.\" she said with empathy.</span></div></div>",

I didn't know vegetables and fruit could be so flavorful. And the tofu actually tasted like real meat, how did you do it?\" he asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Years of practice and my own special recipe.\" she answered with playful wink as she and Tenzin cleaned the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you enjoyed your meal Bolin, but you should work on your table manners if you plan to eat with us again.\" Tenzin advised calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't be so hard on him dear. Meelo has much worse manners then him.\" his wife reminded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. It's hard enough trying to teach him to behave, I don't need another Pig-Sheep at the table.\" he said tiredly. Pema rolled her eyes at him, but knew where he was coming from. Their son was quite a handful on the best of days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of Meelo, where is he?\" Korra asked when she notice that the youngest Airbender was missing, in fact so were the rest of the children. Her question was answered when Bolin was hit in the back of his head by a snowball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey turned to see Meelo standing at the doorway looking triumphant, Ikki giggling mischievously while tossing a snowball of her own up and down in the air and Jinora blushing in embarrassment at her siblings immature behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin wiped the snow off his head as he calmly stood up to face the children with a playful smirk \"Oh, it is so on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RUN!!\" Ikki screamed in delight as the Earthbender chased after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra shook her head in amusement as she went after them to make sure they didn't tear up the island with their game. Once she reached the courtyard she was greeted with the adorable sight of a full on snowball war between Bolin, Ikki, Meelo and Jinora. With Jinora on Bolin's side of the fight, a fact that her siblings were not above teasing her about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joining forces with your future boyfriend is not going to make a difference Jinora!\" Ikki exclaimed as she threw a ball aimed at her sister from behind an earth barrier Bolin made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taste my fury, traitor!\" Meelo shouted as he threw a ball of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many times do I have to tell you?! I don't have a crush on Bolin!\" Jinora shouted with an angry blush as she retaliated at their snow barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what your diary says!\" Ikki shouted back, before realizing what she just said covering her mouth in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU READ MY DIARY?!?!\" Jinora roared in fury as she let loose a mighty blast of wind that kicked up so much snow it became like a tiny, but powerful blizzard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scatter!\" Meelo shouted as they abandoned their post to escape their sisters wrath. But while Jinora's attack didn't hit it's intended targets, it did hit someone. Or to be more accurate it buried them in snow, that someone being Korra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Korra!\" Bolin exclaimed in concern for his girlfriend. However his concern quickly turned to dread as the snow melted into steam. His dread only increased as she gathered a huge amount of snow and was then ready to unleash it like a tidal wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's first?\" she whispered with a dangerous smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom then on it was a full on free for all as Bolin, Korra and The Airbending Kids battled it out with snow, dirt, air ,fire and more in an intense, but fun brawl. All the while Tenzin and Pema watched on with fond smiles on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're having so much fun.\" Pema said with a little jealousy at the fact that her heavily pregnant state made it impossible for her to join the fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\" Tenzin said as he tenderly rubbed his wife's belly. He then realized something when he saw the huge smile beaming across Korra's face \"I don't think I've ever seen Korra this happy before. And I think that might be the reason she has been struggling with her Airbending for so long.\" he theorized with stroking his beard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you mean?\" Pema asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For nearly all her life Korra has know she was The Avatar, and while she has made it no secret at the fact that she loves being The Avatar, she has never really allowed herself to be anything else. Nearly every other Avatar that came before her has had a childhood from where which they didn't have to worry about shouldering the fate of the world. Even my father, who found out at a younger age then normal, had a carefree life, as every child should, before he learned of his destiny. A life of fun, freedom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh..I see.\" Pema said with understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where as all of Korra's life has been preparing her for her duties as The Avatar, a life full of training, responsibility and sacrifice. The only things she ever did in any spare time she had was riding on her Polar Bear-Dog and even more training. She only ever got to see her own parents a few times every year.\" he said with regret \"And I had the gall to lecture her about embracing freedom when I was one of the people who took it away from her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so hard on yourself honey.\" she said compassionately. \"Don't forget that Korra made the choice to reveal herself as The Avatar and jumped head first at the opportunity to train. Just as Aang long ago made the choice to run away from his duties when he learned he was The Avatar. They both made choices that neither had any way of knowing the consequences, but in the end things are the way they should be. If Aang never ran away, then he never would have met Katara or any of his friends. Which means you would have never been born and I never want to think about what my life would be like without you in it. And sure for awhile Korra couldn't Airbend, but now she is making great strides in her training and discovering things about herself by the day. And look..\" she said while pointing at Korra's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenzin followed his wife's finger to see that the snowball war had ceased with no clear winner, but Jinora was still chasing after her sister to make her pay for reading her diary. Meanwhile Meelo was all tuckered out from the battle, so Bolin and Korra decided to take a nap with the little guy. All three of them were snuggled up to Naga who acted as both a great pillow and source of warmth. Bolin and Korra looked like a young married couple sleeping with their son and pet. Tenzin's heart nearly exploded at the cuteness of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see that smile on her face? That's the smile of a woman who is right where she belong, in the arms of her soulmate. So don't worry my love, all is right with the world.\" she finished with her usual gentle smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenzin smiled warmly at his wife gave her a tender kiss which she happily returned \"And people say I'm the wise one.\" he said with good humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I like to think I learned a thing or two from you over the years.\" she responded in kind.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few hours later, and The Fire Ferrets had won their match against The Rabaroos, the only all female team in the Pro-Bending League. While The Rabaroos put up a good fight, they were just no match for the superior teamwork and training taught to The Ferrets by Noataka. We now find our heroes having a congratulatory dinner at Naru's,(Bolin's favorite eating joint) everyone happily chowing down on a bowl of green noodles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, I don't know if it's because of the match we won earlier or the chiefs have done something different, but this might just be the best noodles I've had yet!\" Bolin said happily as he went to town on his bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't eat to many bowls again bro.\" Mako warned as he looked at the small pile of empty bowls stacked next to his gluttonous little brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry 'dad' I learned my lesson from last time.\" Bolin replied with a hint of sarcasm before returning to his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened last time?\" Asami asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bolin had a dozen bowls before sparing with me in the gym a week ago.\" Korra explained \"But instead of earth vs water like we normally do, he decided that it would be fun to mix things up a little by testing his Earthbending against mine. It was going good at first, but then he took a zinger to the stomach and lost his noodles all over the place.\" She remembered with a mixture of humor and disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clean up was not pretty.\" Mako added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have to make me scrub the floor with a toothbrush?\" Bolin asked his coach with an indignant pout \"It took me forever and my hands were killing me for days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was both the best way to clean your mess thoroughly and for you to learn to eat with more moderation.\" Noataka answered calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems more like you guys just like to pick on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone at the table looked at one another thoughtfully for a minute saying..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMako: Yeah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra: Maybe a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami: Sometimes..sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoataka: Yep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoiln's pout deepened \"I hate you all.\" he said flatly as he went back to his food to ignore his friends who were now laughing like a bunch of Hyena-Dingoes at his expense. But as the laughter died down Korra noticed a group of six giving them hostile stares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, who's that creepy guy over there that keeps glaring at us?\" she asked a little weirded out. Everyone turned to see where she was looking and as soon as they did the joyful mood disappeared when they recognized the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Tahno. And The Wolf-Bats.\" Mako informed quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pro-Bending champions for the last 3 years.\" Asami added with a slight edge. For if there was one team in Pro-Bending she truly didn't like, it would be the Wolf-Bats. They were without a doubt the nastiest team in the league, both in and out of the ring. They not only defeated most of their opponents, but left many of them hospitalized, especially the rookie teams. And to add insult to injury, they won most of their matches with One Round Knockouts. Many promising careers were ended because of these bullies disguised as athletes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it seemed that they were looking for more careers to end as Tahno stood up from his seat and made a pompous gesture for his entourage to follow him as he approached their table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well, if it isn't The Fire Ferrets. Pro-Bending saddest excuse for a team.\" he with condescension practically oozing from his tone. \"Tell me, how did a bunch of amateurs like you luck your way into the tournament?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a better question.\" Bolin interjected \"Who's the guy who styles your hair? Cause he should be fired for making it look like the backside of a Snake-Rat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone at the table snickered at Bolin's comeback, even some of Tahno's entourage gave a few chuckles before he silenced them with a glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you must be Bolin. The idiot that everyone can't shut up about since the match with The Tiger-Dillo's. I've been hearing all kinds of things about you since then, one of them being that you're somehow dating The Avatar here.\" he gestured to Korra with a stare like he saw a fine piece of meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra just gave him a very unimpressed grunt and dirty look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually upon giving it a better look, I see now you couldn't pay someone enough to intentionally style that monstrosity.\" Bolin casually piled on. \"So that means you style it yourself. Man, you have the fashion sense of a blind Skunk-Bear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snickering intensified as Bolin continued to roast the Pro-Bending champion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTahno eye twitched in barely contained fury \"You better be careful with your insults there rookie.\" he said seething.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, everything I just said was a fact. Cause there exists no insult that I could possibly say to properly describe the utter tragedy that is your do. Seriously, I've been styling my own hair since I've been living off the streets. So either I have a hidden talent in hair style or you should never be allowed to hold a pair of scissors again, cause that thing you can somehow look at in the mirror everyday and say 'Yeah this looks good' is a crime against humanity. And let me tell you the dumpsters I had to crawl through to find food as a kid, the rotting and putrid things I've seen and smelled, absolutely pail in comparison to the creature that died and somehow attached itself to your head.\" the young Earthbender said completely straight faced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly the entire restaurant erupted in hysterical laughter at Bolin's unrelenting barrage of comments on Tahno hair. It took every once of willpower and self control that The Wolf-Bat had to not make The Fire Ferret suffer for his humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better hope I don't see you in the finals. Because if I do, I will send you to a watery grave.\" Tahno warned hatefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not gonna happen pretty boy.\" Korra stated hotly, coming to her boyfriends aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cause The Ferrets are going to show you who the real amateurs are.\" Mako added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then having that horrid hair cut will be the second worst thing to ever happen to you.\" Asami hit the final nail in the coffen for Tahno's dignity as a second wave of laughter went through the restaurant. Tahno gestured to his giggling entourage to leave at he angrily stormed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha Ha Ha!\" Noataka smacked her hand against the table \"I have never seen someone so close to having an aneurysm before! I could literally sense his blood vessels about to blow!\" she said a little out of breath while wiping a joyful tear from her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, that was the hardest I've ever laughed in my life.\" Korra said as she gazed at her love with tender eyes \"You, are one of a kind Bolin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, do go on. I enjoy praise.\" he said with his trademark cocky swagger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1 hour later)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe now find Bolin and Korra snuggling under a tree in the park with Naga napping nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is nice.\" Bolin said quietly \"With all that been happening lately we haven't had much quality alone time together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it.\" Korra agreed as she nuzzled deeper into his warm, chiseled chest. She then felt him gently undo her main ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you say we make the most of it.\" he said as he kissed her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You read my mind.\" she replied eagerly as she returned his kiss with a kiss to his neck.</span></div></div>",

First he had to probend with a traitor of a brother who couldn't decide on who he should date.  Then the losing of the probending finals and losing the only home he could remember.  And while he was happy that he was living in a mansion now, he still silently hated how he had to live in his brother's girlfriend's house.  What the fuck was wrong with him?  Not even the girl cosplayer of the Fire Ferrets team would go on a date with him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin fucking hated this as he just ate another bit of the noddles.  His one and true love, noodles would never betray him.  He then pulled out his money and placed it on the bar.  He got up and walked out with his belly having been expanded.  Not by much but there was evidence to his over eating.  He felt his shirt was a bit tight so he looked at his wallet and went into a clothing store.  He put on an 1XL shirt as he then saw that you could see his belly's shape.  Pulling it off he went into the 3XL section and pulled it on.  He liked it, he wasn't big enough yet to be truly showing.  While he was here he bought three pairs of pants that were 42s, evidence to his weight gain.  Nothing that would prevent him from his bending and if anything at least now he would have a reason to repel women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out of the stall he would be okay with his size and grinned.  Screw the world and all the ladies who don't dig his funny jokes or his feelings of romance.  Screw them for not hooking up with him cause of his weight.  No, he couldn't do it.  Not fully at least, he decided he would just be himself. Just a bit larger than usual.  Bolin bought the three pairs of pants and pair he was already wearing.  He also bought the shirt he was wearing plus three more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin walked out with two bags as he threw away his old cloths that were just too small.  He put them into a donations box for the homeless.  He really hated this as he began to walk in the frigid cold air.  Then suddenly a female voice asked him, \"Hey, Cutie, mind walking me to my flat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?</span></div></div>",

Adi, a firebender from Red Sand Island, was the founder and leader of the Red Sands Rabaroos, a strikingly pretty young firebender who had decided to make her mark in the heavily male sport of probending. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdi was the only other person here, and Bolin was momentarily befuddled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, are you talking to me?\" he asked nervously, unable to believe that this pretty probender could possibly have been referring to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at him, eyes sparkling like tiny stars in the lamplight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you see anyone else here?\" she asked him wryly, amusement in her tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin momentarily glanced around, and he did indeed see that he and Adi really were the only people here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" he said, abashed. \"Well, um... Okay...\" he stuttered awkwardly. \"I-I... Y-you want me to walk you back, back to your apartment...?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdi nodded, smile widening infinitesimally. Bolin couldn't help but feel flustered with how pretty and confident she was. He had heard the rumors, of course, regarding the RSR captain's extremely active love life, and he found it easy to believe them, faced with the woman herself in the flesh, out of uniform. She was lovely, indeed, and there was something about the way she comported herself that bespoke considerable experience with courtship and romance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she said, taking a step towards him, taking one of his hands, pulling one of his thick arms into a rather tight embrace. \"If you would be so kind.\" She fluttered her eyelashes, covertly pressing Bolin's arm into her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earthbender of the Fire Ferrets was a bright, fluorescent pink by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, then...\" gulped Bolin. \"I suppose it would be rude to turn down such a pretty lady...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdi giggled, and she showed him the way to her flat.

Adi and Bolin stopped to see two Red Monsoons water bending at a small shop owners place.  Bolin was tried of bullies as then looked to Adi who nodded.  Bolin looked around and saw a small shop keeper behind him selling earth pots.  Bolin then asked Adi after he felt his pockets, \"Got a couple of bills?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdi nodded as she handed him a couple of bills and he went to buy two pots.  He then earth bent them into discs as he carried them giving his bags to Adi.  Adi watched as Bolin ran in and tossed up the two earth discs.  He bent one at the feet of a Red Monsoon as he hit the ground.  Leaping into a tackle Bolin hit the other one to the ground as he then earth bent the last disc at the one he had knocked making sure he was down.  The two were about to get up as Adi then walked up with fire in her hands saying, \"You sure you want to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then ran as the shop keeper said to them, \"Thank you thank you.  Please, take whatever you want for a reward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdi looked to see it was a restaurant, \"Mind if we get a free meal tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shop keeper nodded as Adi said to Bolin, \"That settles it, tonight is date night for me and the girls.  See you at 8.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin was waiting at the shop 3 hours later finely dressed in new cloths that were big enough.  Thanks to Asami's cash load he could afford new cloths for this date.  He was thinking it was a loan, but she for some reason blushed when he asked to borrow a couple of bills.  Bolin was waiting wondering what Adi had meant.  Maybe she was saying that her 'girls' was her bosom and was going to accentuate them or was she bringing the other rabaroos?</span></div></div>",

She was wearing a low-cut blouse that did wonders for emphasizing and accentuating the size and shape of the firebender's breasts. Bolin could not help staring a little at her exposed cleavage as she walked over to him, a confident smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only after almost half a minute of staring that Bolin managed to tear his gaze away from Adi's chest and meet her eyes. She was grinning at the blush on his face as she slid into the booth opposite her date, and she leaned forward over the table, crossing her arms under her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what you see?\" she asked him coyly, smirking knowingly. Bolin's blush deepened, and for a second he had to avert his gaze out of anxiety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look... very nice, tonight,\" he said awkwardly. \"Um, not that you don't <i>usually</i> look good...\" he stammered nervously, beginning to ramble even as his eyes were drawn, as if by a gravitational force, back down towards Adi's cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed quietly, smiling at Bolin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be shy,\" she told him. \"You like my tits? That's good. If you like them, then enjoy your fill. I'm sure you'll be able to return the favor after dinner.\" She winked, and Bolin's stomach fluttered nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as inexperience as he was, he could tell what she was implying. And while he wasn't sure how much was serious and how much was just banter, he nonetheless looked back up into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, um, I do like your, uh...\" He blushed. \"...er, your <i>you-know-whats</i>, but... Your eyes are just as pretty.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scratched the back of his neck then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, geez...\" he mumbled, abashed. \"That sounds a lot cheesier out loud than it did in my head...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdi shook her, giggling lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" she said, \"I think it's sweet. You're a good guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin felt Adi's toes brush against his shin, and he became aware of how intensely she was eyeing him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not <i>that</i> good...\" he murmured, feeling self conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense,\" Adi replied. \"You're a true blue gentleman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot went higher this time, tracing its way up his calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin blushed even redder. He gulped nervously, and silently he wondered when the waiter would get there... He was torn between wanting them to come right away, and wanting them to take their sweet time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdi's foot brushed his thigh this time, and he shivered, aware of how close she had come to his crotch. Idly, the notion entered his head to reciprocate what Adi was doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid he?</span></div></div>",

She was dressed in a green kimono with yellow brown trim and all silk with a dragon print.  The obi was yellow brown and the menus she was holding were Jasmine Dragon menus of the worlds largest franchise restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonoka smiled at them and them blushed at seeing Bolin.  She couldn't deny the fact that she liked men that were big enough to totally hold her all around and were soft enough to lay on.  She then said to them handing them the menus, \"Welcome to the Jasmine Dragon.  I have been informed that you are to have a free meal.  Whatever, you want you will get, thank you for your services.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was known that after the cheating that the wolf bats used on the mongoose lizards that Honoka broke a portion of her chi line.  She could bend, but it would take a couple of years before she would probend again.  To pay for the doctors bills as a server to get into the sport she loved would take her til she was in her forties.  Bolin didn't like how everyone fell from the wolf bats cheating ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin then looked at the menu as he asked her, \"Can we have the 10 tea special?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding Honoka then said to them, \"I'll let you let you read over the menu while I go get your tea ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonoka went as walked into the line of vision of Bolin's with a shake to her hips.  She made an aggressive display luring his eyes to her rump that was really full.  Bolin then went to the menu as Adi smiled and licked her lips.  She enjoyed men who had divided attentions, cause that meant they would get creative if more than one girl was in bed.  Plus, that would leave her open into inviting men into the show if she wanted and she was sure Bolin didn't mind.  She then asked him, \"Bolin, what are your opinions on open relationships?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin thought about it as he then said to her, \"Well, the whole community relationship of where you are dating someone and I'm dating someone.  And we all hang out as if we're a big couple while me and you are dating.  Does have it's advantages, but I will not <i>you know</i> with a guy.  Sorry, I'm a ladies man, but watching a guy go down on a girl is okay or the other way around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling Adi then said to him as she stroked his inner thigh with her foot, \"Oh, this relationship is so going to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonoka then arrived as she said to them, \"Here is your first round of tea.  Yellow Mint Leaf tea, I hope you enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a sip of the tea Adi then said to him, \"This tea could use some creamer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin then replied to her as he was moving to grab some of the powder, \"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he looked where Adi was, he realized that she was gone and so was her cup of tea.

He had a pretty good idea of who it was, and his ears were pink as the warm fingers skillfully worked his little bender to full mast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced aside to where the waitress, Honoka, had been standing, only to see that she had also vanished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he felt another hand grab his member, working together with the first to tease him higher and higher. Bolin whimpered quietly, overwhelmed a tiny bit by the sensations being inflicted upon him. Adi and Honoka had ducked underneath the table, and the two of them were now double teaming his dick with remarkably deft hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight when he was at the brink of coming, Bolin felt the hands leave his dick. He was dismayed by this, for a moment, right up until he felt the two pairs of lips kiss either side of his cock's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came with a shudder, biting his lip to keep from crying out. A moment later, Adi emerged from under the table, a smile on her face and an unmistakable white substance in her hand. While Bolin's date dumped his seed into her tea and began to stir, their waitress was licking his manhood clean, or at least that was how it felt. Certainly, she sucked on Bolin's sausage for several seconds, and he had a feeling she was doing it as much for herself as she was doing it for him or Adi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut eventually Bolin came again (Adi peacefully sipping her tea, smiling at him suggestively), and Honoka finally reemerged from under the table, licking her lips and beaming at the both of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you two like anything else?\" she asked. \"Some noodles? Some fish? Or perhaps...\" she leaned over the table, a vulpine grin tilting her lips. \"...you'd like a taste of <i>me?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdi smirked, and Bolin blushed.

A new server walked up to refill their drinks as Adi had a small plate with extra cum that she had slipped onto it for <i>creaming</i> her tea.  She put in a spoon full as she then drank this new tea that was green pineapple.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 30 minutes later a cart was pushed in.

It was not painful (if anything, it was quite a pleasurable sensation) but something about it startled her, and Korra seemed to feel it too, judging by how her cheeks darkened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra gave Asami a soft smile, and slung her arm over the other girl's shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're awfully hot,\" the latter remarked, earning a wry laugh from the former.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" she said with a cheeky wink. \"I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami rolled her eyes, although a smile quirked her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mean like that, Korra,\" she said. \"It's... you feel like you're burning up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra's stomach noisily rumbled at that moment, causing the avatar to laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm <i>starving</i>, is what I am,\" said the dark-skinned beauty. \"I feel like I could eat a whole ostrich horse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami nodded sheepishly, feeling her own stomach churn as though she'd not had a bite for days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know what you mean...\" she murmured. \"Is that a side-effect of going to the spirit world?\" She placed a hand over her stomach. \"Because I know we weren't gone for <i>that</i> long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra looked thoughtful at this, smacking her lips and narrowing her eyes as she stared into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember feeling this hungry the other times I came back from the spirit world,\" she commented, \"but maybe something was different this time?\" She shrugged. \"I don't know, but I am FAMISHED. Let's grab a bite to eat, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you asking me out on a date?\" she said with a twinkle in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra grinned toothily, brusquely stealing a kiss from the fair young woman's lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm game if you are,\" she purred huskily, making it clear that she was much more interested in something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami smiled, and stole the kiss back with interest. There was a fair bit of tongue, and one of her hands may or may not have found its way to the curve of Korra's firm, shapely rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a date,\" she whispered, gazing intently into her beloved's glistening sapphires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra laughed heartily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

Opal had a look on her face like a kid who had been caught in a cookie jar. Bolin's eyes were as wide as dinner plates, and he was blushing fiercely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... I know what this might look like...\" he said awkwardly, feeling all too aware of Korra and Asami's eyes on his naked body. \"But, er, it's not. This is not what it looks like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpal looked torn between covering her face, covering her body, and continuing to suck her on-and-off boyfriend's cock. She settled for closing her eyes and sucking extra loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Smack. Smack. Smack.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know EXACTLY what I'm looking at,\" Korra replied. There was a hungry gleam in her eyes as she surveyed the many and varied foodstuffs which had been laid out on Bolin's body. \"Free grub!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhat curiously, her eyes were focused more on Bolin's dick when she said this, rather than any of the food. The predatory way she stalked forward certainly did not help matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami smiled, watching quite hungrily as Korra swayed her hips. Her eyes twinkled, and she licked her lips. She watched Korra grab a slice of bread from Bolin's chest, and a lump of cheese from his abdomen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra took a sizable bite out of her cheese-laden bread, then turned and mashed her lips against Asami's. She grabbed her girlfriend's ass with her free hand, squeezing playfully and pushing some of the food into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin watched them with eyes with and mouth agape, feeling very rude for staring as Korra and Asami did things to that mouthful of bread and cheese that made him feel as hard as the rocks he bent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...wow,\" he mumbled, gulping and feeling his balls tighten almost painfully as Korra and Asami's bodies pressed together in such wonderfully soft and bouncy ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was unable to tear his eyes away as the two lovers made out, swallowing their first mouthful and bringing the rest up between them. The pair tore strips of bread and chunks of cheese away with their teeth, suggestively masticating in between sessions of heated kissing. Hands roamed freely up and down one another's bodies, the two suggestively stroking and squeezing, embracing and undressing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Korra and Asami finished off that hunk of bread, most of their clothes were lying on the floor. They were half naked, and seeming uncaring of Bolin and Opal's presence as they moaned as rubbed their bodies together. Asami fondled Korra's firm, muscular thighs, and Korra pressed a couple of her fingers down Asami's top-of-the-line panties, teasingly rubbing them up and down over a hot and moist slit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin gawked at the pair, completely incapable of looking away. His eyes were glued to the duo's all but naked bodies. And when Asami freed Korra's breasts from their restraints, he was not able to maintain his grip any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpal squeaked, surprised by a sudden, copious ejaculation that filled her mouth with Bolin's seed. She blushed hotly, mewling as her cheeks puffed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm... Mmmph...!\" she pulled her mouth off of Bolin's manhood, a fair amount of his sperm dripping from her lips. She could barely keep it in her mouth, and it was a struggle to swallow the full amount. As it was, a good deal of his semen clung to her chin and dripped down onto her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpal looked at Korra and Asami, and she blushed hotly to see both sets of their eyes on her. The pair stared at Bolin's semen on Opal's face, and on her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra's stomach grumbled like a sky bison. A bit of drool leaked from Asami's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is it?</span></div></div>",

He blushed hotly, fidgeting awkwardly in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be a good boy, dearie,\" Opal said, shooting him an almost imperious glance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe immediately obeyed, stiffening up in more ways than one at the tone of his girlfriend's voice. His eyes followed Korra as the avatar bowed her head to lick a bit of his seed off of Opal's cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, this is very bold of you, Korra,\" Opal remarked, a playful lilt to her voice. \"Mm, oh! Watch where you're putting those hands, now. Your girlfriend is right there behind you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra grinned, feeling emboldened by Opal's words, and kissed a dimple on her chin. She hefted the other girl's left breast, squeezing the underside testingly. Asami chuckled, hearing Opal squeak as Korra started licking her way down the airbender's neck, past her collarbones, down to the swell of her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami took the tip of Bolin's prick into her mouth, smiling against his penis as she licked the slit, tasting the lingering flavor of his latest ejaculation. She purred, her tastebuds bursting into life, a party rocking up in her mouth as she teased her lips slowly and torturously down his shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra licked semen up from Opal's cleavage, roughly squeezing and kneading the girl's breasts as she all but buried her face in her bosom. She followed the spatter of Bolin's sperm, thoroughly and systematically licking Opal's chest clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami rocked her head back and forth, swirling her tongue around Bolin's pecker. She was finding it surprisingly easy to take his respectable length into her mouth, nimbly and skillfully working her lips back and forth over smooth, velvety skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra took one of Opal's nipples into her mouth, Bolin's semen all but forgotten in light of the airbender's fairly generous bosom. She kissed Opal's areola, gently pinching the nipple between her teeth, licking and sucking. She eagerly worked her fingers deep into the tissue of Opal's other breast, the young woman moaning and writhing beneath Korra's hungry ministrations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami slid her mouth up and down Bolin's manhood, deepthroating him with a preternatural ease, working his balls in the palms of her hands. He whimpered and groaned as he suckled at his cum faucet, working the tap with deft pumping motions. Her eyes rolled back in her sockets, and she purred delightedly, vibrating her mouth against Bolin's cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah! Asami, I'm...!\" Bolin gasped, his eyes clamping shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis dick twitched in her mouth, and he bucked his hips. Asami pulled back so that her mouth was only an inch or so from the earthbender's prick, sticking her tongue out to catch the coming eruption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin blew all over Asami's face, into her mouth, and down even onto her torso. He came in waves, aftershocks of the initial orgasm propelling additional loads of semen from his meatus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami moaned, catching as much of his sperm on his tongue as she could, swallowing every drop to get into her mouth. This still left quite a mess, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking, Asami licked her lips and stood up. She looked down at the thick ropes of white which clung to her front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I make this look good,\" she commented, looking at Korra. \"Don't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe avatar gave her a lopsided grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" she agreed. \"You look good enough to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes twinkled lustily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

A soft hiss slipped through her teeth and she ground a drenched slit anxiously on the purplish head of his cock for moment, before shuddering and pushing herself downward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh....!\" she squealed, shivering. A bit of warm nectar spurted out as she sheathed the earthbender inside herself, and she felt Opal's hands dancing over her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It hurts a little at first, doesn't it?\" Opal remarked, grinning as she squeezed one of Asami's buttocks. \"He's pretty big, so I reckon it can take some getting used to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami smiled, and kissed Opal. <i>Hard.</i> There may have been tongue involved. Korra whistled at this, egging her girlfriend on with a husky growl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kiss lasted for several seconds, Asami's hands roaming over Opal's back, and Opal's fingers digging sharply into Asami's bum, the airbender thoroughly surprised by the intensity of this smooch. Finally, after what felt like an age and a half, Asami broke the kiss, Opal gasping and blushing hotly, and she licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a perfect fit,\" she purred silkily, her voice sending a shiver up Opal's spine. \"Mmm...

He felt something warm and sweet and moist press hard against his lips, and it took him a moment to realize that this something was <i>Asami.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Bolin was startled by the suddenness of Asami's appearance, or the passion behind her kiss, then Mako was downright <i>gobsmacked.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Asami?!\" he exclaimed, but if the girl heard him, she did not react. She appeared to be too busy exploring Bolin's tonsils to pay Mako any attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or so, though, Asami eventually pulled back from the kiss, and she smiled up at Bolin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did it take me so long to realize my feelings for you?\" she wondered out loud, lazily running a hand up and down his broad chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ubuh?\" said Bolin, a little too dazed from the kiss to be very coherent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami's smile widened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so handsome,\" she purred, pressing her slender but also curvy-in-all-the-right-places form against him, uncaring of who might see what she was doing. \"So sweet, and funny, and loyal... How did I never realize it until just now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh... I dunno,\" said Bolin intelligently, unsure how to respond. The fact that blood was starting to flow from his brain to his nether regions probably had something to do with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The second I saw you, just a moment ago, everything just <i>clicked</i>,\" she whispered. \"How you were there for me when things were going rough with Mako, how you saved me from my father... It all just came together, and I realized how much you mean to me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile widened, and she grabbed Bolin's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <i>want you</i>, Bolin,\" she purred, beginning to drag the earthbender toward a secluded alley (Mako had already taken the hint and made himself scarce, not really wanting to watch his brother and his ex swapping spit).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did Bolin react to this declaration?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a short fight, all told. Asami was a fine fighter, as far as non-warrior, non-benders went, but there was a good reason the Avatar had existed for so long, had been chosen to keep the balance. A gout of flame forced her back against the wall, into which she was then earthbent by Korra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinora did not fare much better. She was a talented airbender, but there was a reason she did not yet bear the arrow tattoos. She was still learning. She still had yet to master her element, whereas Korra had, thus far, mastered three -- and was well on her way to mastering the fourth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra bent away the gust of air Jinora sent at her, circling the wind around her body like a sling before shooting it back at Jinora, who dodged only to get caught in a splash of water, and then the <i>crack</i> of swiftly freezing ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn just a little over ten seconds, Korra was the victor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to her went the spoils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her attention back to Bolin, who was by now painfully hard once more, Korra smirked and licked her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tasty,\" she said, hungrily eyeing the earthbender's naked body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he had a <i>great</i> body, though of a different sort than Mako. Where the firebender was more lean, with most of his strength focused into his arms and shoulders, Bolin was built like a brick house. He was stocky and stout, broad and doughty, solid and bulky. His body was thick and hard all the way down. Even where the earthbender <i>looked</i> soft, Korra knew there was plenty of firm, dense muscle just beneath the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe licked her lips again, and, walking over to Bolin, Korra proceeded to get down on top of him. Sizable, round, supple, brown breasts she pressed against his broad, barrel-chest. Stiff, dark, puffy nipples jabbed into his skin, the sensation nearly as arousing as the feeling of Korra's nether lips teasingly rubbing the tip of his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so cute when you're horny,\" said Korra lustily, planting a deep, hot, wet kiss on Bolin's mouth. And even as her tongue flitted past his lips, the Avatar thrust her juicy, wide, meaty hips downward onto the earthbender's manhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moaned happily into his mouth, rocking her pelvis up and down as she rode him -- slowly, at first, but gradually, steadily gaining speed, until she was fucking him zealously, fervently, frenetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin groaned and writhed as Korra rode him, long and hard, and he reciprocated her kiss passionately, eagerly. His tongue curled and twined with hers, a little clumsily in the beginning, but as their kiss continued he swiftly grew more confident, more capable. Soon, Korra was moaning as much from kissing him as she was from fucking him, and his large, calloused hands eagerly attended to her breasts, squeezing and rubbing them with a childlike wonder, enraptured by the large twin globes of Water Tribe teat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt length, Korra came, and she came <i>hard</i>, screaming and shivering and gasping and panting. Her pussy clenched tightly down on Bolin's, hungrily, greedily milking his cock for seed, which it gave up readily, eagerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin's sperm filled Korra's womanhood, poured into her womb, and she moaned delightedly at the feeling. She felt so <i>fulfilled</i>, so <i>satisfied</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

She had a broad, sorta drunken grin on her face, body still flush with the tingling, giddy warmth of orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wall in which Asami had been trapped quite suddenly opened up, freeing the girl. At the same time, the ice which had encased Jinora's limbs instantly melted into water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get over here,\" she said to the two. \"I think it will take more than just one girl to satisfy this earthbending stud.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Avatar smirked, glancing down at Bolin's cock, which was still quite hard and erect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami and Jinora, following Korra's gaze, smiled also and licked their lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you might be right,\" said Asami sultrily, beginning to sway her hips seductively as she walked over towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Jinora, blushing a cute pink as her eyes drank in the sight of Bolin's nakedness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe earthbender in question simply stared silently, raptly, as the naked bodies of this three lovely young women came closer and closer, before they finally <i>pounced.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJinora got onto Bolin's chest, flushing a little bashfully, but also perversely, as she started to press and rub her body against it. And she started to kiss his neck, too. Her actions seemed a little awkward -- and maybe even hesitant -- at first, but then she began to pick up the tempo, and soon she was grinding her youthful body against the earthbender's hard chest while biting and licking his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami, for her part, took Korra's place on Bolin's dick, eagerly taking his full length into herself. Her legs were spread as she rode him reverse cowgirl style, bouncing hungrily up and down on his cock, her fairly generous bosom jiggling most interestingly as she did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands, meanwhile, she placed on Jinora's hips. Asami happily fondled the young airbender's nice little bum, squeezing small round buttocks and slipping a finger here or there into Jinora's tight virgin asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra, on the other hand, sat on Bolin's face, hungrily pressing her pussy against his lips. She desperately implored him to eat her out, moaning and playing with her lewd chocolate milk jugs as mashed her pelvis into his face. Bolin obliged her readily enough, eating Korra out, licking up her juices. He was a little flustered to realize that there was a fair amount of his own semen yet inside of Korra, but it was not for no reason that the girls had declared his seed <i>delicious</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it was still weird for him, if only because it was his own sperm that was mixed in with the Avatar's juices, but the embarrassment only made him harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came inside of Asami, who moaned in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bolin was tired of all the turn downs.  He walked down the street of rupublic city as he just came from a fire ferrets game.  They had won, but only Mako and Korra got the attention as the couple on the team.  Girls would laugh in his face as he asked them out and he was feeling hopeless.  He eventually came to a park as he sat down in the park.  Mako was going to stop being a member of the Fire Ferrets soon and join the police force.  Korra at this news decided to break from the team and now the team was splitting.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Bolin quit the thug life and gave everything he owned on the fight that decided his life. He now was losing everything around him.  Unless if he found another fire bender and water bender soon he was going to get no where.  What he found in the park was Pabu wrestling a small frog newt.  Stopping the two Bolin then said to Pabu, \"Stop it Pabu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin then grabbed up the frog newt after seeing it was hurt.  He then decided to take it with him calling it Hama.  As Bolin was sitting in his room in the Probending gym he let the frog newt stay in it's new home.  It had been three days now that the new room mate had joined him.  He was given an eviction now that he didn't have a team. He had two days to find a team and he had pretty much given up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPabu hated seeing her owner be in the dumps, if it wasn't for him defending her from the pet shop owner.  She would not be alive today.  She went over to the frog newt environment.  She then spoke to the frog newt, but to Bolin it sounded like chirps and ribbits.  Pabu said to Hama, \"<i>I know you are a resurrected person facing punishment for past life crimes. What is your name?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHama then said to the creature, \"<i>I am Hama, I never committed a crime.  I just avenged my people, but I suppose that life is over now.  Now all I do just eat bugs all day.  I so desire to be a young human girl again.  That Bolin is kind and cute, plus those muscles don't harm him.  By the way who are you and if you can talk then that means you are a resurrected person too.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPabu responded to her, \"<i>I am Pabu, in my past life I was killed for stealing the royal cornation flame of the Fire Nation.  I would have gotten away with it too if it wasn't for that traitor.  But, I've had a good life as a fire ferret.  If there was only some way to help out our new owner like he has helped us.  I use the term owner lightly by the way.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a flash of light came as the pair of animals covered their eyes.  Aang was standing there as he then said to them, \"You have learned your lessons and with that I shall grant your last chance at a noble life.  If you live life honorably, you shall live in the spirit world upon your next death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAang rose his hands as the pair then had light flash all around them as they changed into girls again.  They were young girls that were 16 years old each and were in the nude.  Hama was a young girl with blue eyes with long black hair and a very decent bosom.  Pabu was a yellow eyed girl with long red hair with streaks of brown here and there through out her hair.  Her bosom was extra generous as she looked like her bosom was two jack fruit covered in flesh.   What did the girls do first?</span></div></div>",

She then pulled money out as she then went to go pay for it.  She was wearing a one piece red dress that went to her mid thighs. It was too small but she did not care, she needed something to wear.  She flirted with the male cashier til he let it slip as he accepted the money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin woke up at the shaking of two girls.

And considering Bolin's track record with Water Tribe women, this was entirely in her favor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer decent -- though less than Pabu's(?) -- curves didn't hurt either, of course, and neither did the fact that she was dressed, if it was possible, in a manner even <i>more</i> scandalous than the first girl, in clothes that looked more like lingerie than anything somebody <i>sane</i> would actually wear outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A very <i>nice</i> dream,\" Bolin corrected, his gaze inevitably zeroing in on the delicious, brown, Water Tribe cleavage. \"But who are you?\" he asked, a moment later. \"You don't look like Korra, and she's the only person I usually have these kinds of dreams about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused, looking a little sheepish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...well, okay, so sometimes Asami's there, too...\" he added. \"...and there was also that one with Lin and Pema, a couple weeks ago... and the one with a grown up Jinora and Ikki... and, okay, so maybe I dream about a LOT of girls aside from just Korra, but I can't help it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scantily clad Water Tribe girl smirked seductively at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then...\" she said huskily, lustily swaying her hips in a very entrancing manner as she walked towards him. \"...Allow us to show you something far better than any dream, Master...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPabu, from atop Bolin, purred agreeably, and she mashed her sizable bosom against the earthbender's broad chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she chimed in, reaching a hand down to his zipper, \"Let us show you the adoration and love you so clearly deserve, Master...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolin groaned, shivering as he felt Pabu pull down his trousers, and then felt the cool air on his thick, pulsing erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls eyed his hardness delightedly, and they hungrily licked their lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

It was only natural for a man his age that he should, now and again, have dreams of a sexual nature. And if, in these dreams, he conducted himself in a manner most unlike how he would actually behave in reality, well that was the prerogative of his subconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as Bolin knew, this was just another wet dream, and so while under normal circumstances he would have probably gone catatonic at being exposed like that before two very beautiful women, in this instance he simply growled and grabbed the first girl, Pabu, by the shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped, a little, when he leaped to his feet and pushed her down on her back, though it was certainly not out of dismay or displeasure that she did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, Bolin hiked up the hem of Pabu's criminally short dress, baring her soaking wet womanhood. She moaned, feeling his hungry gaze on her most private, intimate place. And when Bolin, without the slightest hint of hesitation, plunged his dick -- which was close to the double digits in inches of length, and of a considerable girth as well -- into her pussy, she let out a lustful, almost bestial scream of ecstasy, the desires of her human consciousness melding with the primal instincts of her fire ferret incarnation as the man she loved and desired forced himself upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHama watched in aroused interest as Bolin all but raped the buxom, sensual Pabu. As the earthbender continued to ferociously, animalistically fuck the reincarnated thief, the former bloodbender began to masturbate, fingering herself and toying with her breasts as she eagerly fantasized about her own turn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of being dominated by her master in the most carnal of ways, Pabu came with a high, keening wail. The walls of her pussy clenched down tightly on Bolin's cock, squeezing it hard enough to push him to orgasm as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watered her blossom with the seed of his manhood, coming in unto her with a grunting moan. Pabu's eyes rolled back in her head, and she went boneless, moaning happily at the wonderfully full feeling in her belly. She moaned lewdly, weakly, smiling up adoringly at Bolin, whom she saw as her master, her love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Master\" said she. \"I love you,\" she whispered panting and red-faced, her skin covered in sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",
