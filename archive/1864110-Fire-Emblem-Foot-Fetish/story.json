Nothing difficult, nothing you haven't seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow wrong could you have been?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your shipmates, beaten by a small group. Your leader dead, a majority of your friends, too. You surrendered the moment you saw the man you called 'captain' fall, and let yourself be captured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were laid down, bound, gagged and alone in a dark room under the decks. You were terrified for your life but... you were also quite aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls who managed to beat you were rather beautiful, particularly the mature redhead, who, by hearing the others speak, you knew was named Celica. You hadn't fathomed seeing such a beauty on a ship like the one you stormed... so why? why was she on that ship? and why did she spare you? was she some kind of saint?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were interrupted by the same Red-Haired beauty entering the dimly lit room, a flame in her hand, her other hand on the hilt of her sword. She was still rather cautious of you, despite your predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the only soldier who surrenderred without so much as a struggle. Why?\" She asked curiously. Seeing her, high above you, looking down at you with both disdain and gentle kindness in her eyes, you began to feel something within you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No reason\" you tried to say, the cloth around your motuh stopping you. it was here, she ungagged you, letting you speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies. I should have asked after that\" She bowed her head in forgiveness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright\" You said, stretching your body a small bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Celica, a Priestess of Novis\" She smiled gently. \"What might your name be?\" She questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not important. What I wanna know is, why're you here?\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is... I wanted to know, why did you become pirates? and... do you know your way around these waters?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to explain what you knew, You didn't know much, but you explained your situation, your life as a pirate, how you were driven to it by starvation and desperation. Celica could only look on in pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's horrible...\" She sighed. She lit up the small torch scones in the room, and took her hand off of her blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not much, but it was something\" You said back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat herself down on a rickety chair in the corner of the room, bringing it closer to you. It was here you began to look more at her attire. Her beatiful clothes, all light and graceful. She was almost akin to a Goddess, like the one she likely was a Priestess of. Your eyes eventually looked down to her boots, Beautifully fashioned, right in front of your face, and seemingly having been worn for quite a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then... what might it be that I have to do? that is, to have you help us?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help you...? I mean... regular stuff and... well, a guy's got his other needs\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Right\" She bites her lip. \"And how exactly would you satiate those 'other needs', if I accepted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was the moment. You knew you could say almost anything in your perverted fantasies, as long as it didn't do anything bad to her group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it'll only affect you positively, I'm sure\" In that moment, you decide to...</span></div></div>",

This beautiful priestess was really letting you are her feet! but you knew you had to be careful... she held all the power in this arrangement. You delicately wriggle closer, taking more of the boot into your mouth, its pristine texture filling it, overpowering your senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend almost 10 minutes just kissing, licking and engulfing the front of her boot, the incredible flavour only making you more and more excited and lustful. You began to lick and kiss faster and faster, hungrily lapping at it like a wild beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and see Celica's shocked face. She seemed concerned and confused at the sight of you going at her boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're... enjoying yourself, I see\" She finally speaks up. You stop for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, of course!\" you look back at the boot, and remember how rabid you had become. \"I'm sorry!\" You exclaimed, slamming your head into the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's alright!\" She tries to calm you, kneeling down and patting you on the back. \"It was... just confusing, is all\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Suppose so. It's something you don't expect someone to like\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, Priestess or whatever... how 'bout I show you a bit more reason why it can be beneficial\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica goes back into her seat, putting one leg over the other. \"How so? I'm afraid I... can't quite understand yet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take off your boots and I'll show 'ya\" You goad. You manage to make her curious enough to entertain your request. Her black stockings slowly emerge from the white boots, soft, medium sized and quite damp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies... but my feet are quite wet. I haven't been able to change out of these\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine... just makes it better\" You grin as you hop your bound body as her stocking clad feet, sucking the sweat from it, and licking at it with your tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica looked down, the trace of a blush on her face. You got it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued to do as you did with the boot, letting the wonderful aroma engulf your nostrils and the intoxicating taste at your lips. Celica's face at this point was deep red and a small smile spread across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Celica pulls her feet away, putting them back into her boots. \"Thank you... I think you've made your point\" You were slightly disappointed you couldn't continue, but she was adamant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then... since you're into this... humiliating... thing. Perhaps you would prefer staying down here like this when we don't need you? we'll come down every once and a while, to fulfill our end of the bargain\"</span></div></div>",

Well, I'll stick with Priestess. has a better ring to it, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelica nods. \"I thank you for your co-operation\" before she leaves the room, she takes off her boots one more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I... get a final kiss?\" She asked sweetly and innocently.

Celica's eyebrows raise, but she ignores it, putting her boots back on and leaving the cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were left to yourself for a while, all left for you to fester on that taste. That sheer flavour contained in those stockings. the sublime scent and taste teased you for hours, and you were left constantly frustrated from your inability for relieve yourself of your overwhelming euphoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you began to feel tired, but your aroused state didn't seem to let you sleep.

Mae simply say beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soo... let's get started huh, Mr Pevypants?\" Mae teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Mae and Celica took their feet out of their boots. Celica had replaced her stockings and Mae had only some short socks to contribute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ooo, Celica... this is gonna be a nice learning experience, yeah?\" Mae said as she unitied you. You take the moment to move a bit, the ropes were starting to chafe, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty, buddy, put your clothes all over there!\" She commanded. You did as instructed, Celica witnessing every part of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou eventually were down to just your underwear, to which Mae and Celica pulled them down themselves with their feet.

Get ready, boy, cuz we're going aaaaaaall in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMae and Celica tied you up all over again, however, Mae seemed to be more... instructive, like a teacher. She tied intricate knots of rope all  over your body, keeping you in an almost immovable bind.

Celica, still seemingly surprised at her friend's more sadistic and kinky side, could do nothing but obey, taking her stokcing clad feet, and rubbing them all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTotal euphoria filled your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pumped up and down, the pleasure became more and more intense, you moaned and groaned into your gag in pleasure and satisfaction but...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nbefore you could ejaculate, she stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right on! perfect Edge!\" Mae clapped. She struggled around the frustration intense. Your denial only made you more aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! Uhh... how did you like that?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grd! grrrd!\" you tried to say through your gag 'good, good!' but the thickness of the stockings and the packing stopped it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe... well! let's see if you like THIS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMae rose up and planted her soft, large, cozy arse on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were enveloped by soft, supple, bare skin, you could see nothing, you couldn't speak, you could feel nothing but this weight od her arse on you. You loved it.

Your frustration adn arousal was rising to heights you thought almost unreachable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Mae and Celica got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh... sir. Thank you\" Celica bowed .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yeah! this was fun! shame about not cumming, huuh?\" She teased, flicking your cock with her finger, causing you to writhe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you... really alright with this?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, Celicaaa, he's a pervert, and he loves humiliating stuff like this, right? not being able to cum is probably like a field day for him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now left alone in that room, with as raging as a hard on as before.</span></div></div>",

Since then, the two of you have been through a lot, hoping to help her Grandfather and defeat Lord Lundgren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout your travels, you've stopped at many Inns, and made camp in many places, alongside your ever growing army. Yet there was something about Lyn that you couldn't help but love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer large, long, shapely legs, combined with her perfectly sized feet, were perfect. A true joy to behold in the moments you had to see them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough now... you thought perhaps you may have been looking too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyn called you into her tent for a private meeting. To talk about the next plan of action, you had thought, but instead, you were welcomed by Lyn sitting on a chair in front of you, her bare feet resting on top of a desk, something you couldn't help but look at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a problem?\" She asked. You shake your head, taking the chair from the side. You waited for a moment for her to put her feet down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's taking you so long? Come on, sit down\" She gestured to the other side. Your mind began to race. 'Did she know?' you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you sit down, right in front of Lyn's feet, the beautiful soles barely a few centimetres from your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? enjoying the view?\" She smirked knowingly. \"I've noticed you've been looking at my feet quite a bit, so this shouldn't bother you much, right?\" She asked, feigning a stretch, pushing her feet into your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! my bad\" She said, moving her feet back. You face seemed to follow them for a moment before you moved it back, not out of anythign stuck to it, but rather your fixation on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, did you enjoy that?\" She asked knowingly. You gave a small, curt nod. \"Seems I was right, you like feet, hm? well, I can't say I expected this from you\" she sighed, looking away for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou asked about what it was she wanted to talk about. She then replied \"Not a lot to discuss now, really. I know almost all I want to know. All I want to know now is... want to experience that again?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, wide-eyed. Lyn pressed her feet back onto your face, smothering yout lips, nose and eyes. She shuffled them around, massagin your face with the perfect soles. You penis began to perk up from under your trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a small lick at Lyn's sole, to which she jammed that sole straight into your mouth, using the other to slowly reveal your now erect penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like someone likes this even more than I thought\" She smirked. She began to rub the tip of your penis almost professionally with her toes and demanded you suck on her other ones. You oblige, getting between the toes with your tongue and slathering them in saliva. You began to suck harder and lick faster the harder she stroked your penis, feeling almost ready to cum when she kicked it, and slid her foot out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the other one?\" She asked sweetly. She swapped the feet's roles and you could feel the saliva-covered feet jerk your penis whilst your mouth licked at a fresh dry sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, both feet were clean, and you were highyl on edge, having been edged for the past 10 minutes. \"I'm sorry but... people like you don't get the right for something like that\" She smiled innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Lyn took out a long length of rope from her chest in the corner of the room, and began undressing the rest of you. your cloak, your shirt, all of it. Eventually, you were naked, your penis still erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyn tied you tightly, keepig you on your knees. She tied your hands behind your back. Your legs were tied spread out, showing your erect penis to the world like some kind of great treasure. Finally, she looped some around the robe harness she made around your body and secured you to a pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won't be moving out for a while, due to some of the wounded, so we'll have plenty of time for you to get to know my feet a little better\" She came in close, using one of her bare feet to give you a final stroke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now... what to do with you tied down like this?\"</span></div></div>",

It was then that Lyn asked Florina to come live with her on the plains... and she accepted. The two were happily married a few weeks after the war's conclusion, and it was now a month since then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliwood and Ninian had just announced their engagement, and Hector had formally stated that he would be marrying Serra immediately after. For all intents and purposes, the land of Elibe was finally, truly at peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Florina had recently begun to... feel strange things, attractions, to a very peculiar body part of her wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecifically, her feet and toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she first realized this, Florina's immediate reaction was to hide it from Lyn and find out what it meant on her own. Following some extensive research, she came to the embarressing conclusion that she had what was known as a 'foot fetish'; in other words, a sexual attraction to a person's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started off innocent at first; she would capture glances of her wife's bare feet, her soft soles, her lovely toes, and imagine what it would be like to sniff them, to taste them. She kept said thoughts to herself, however, and never acted on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a week later, while her wife was out training some new recruits, Florina boldly snuck into her beloved's closet, and stole a pair of socks. She then proceeded to rub herself sore while sniffing the sock for a good two hours... completely unaware that Lyn had returned home early and stood outside the door, peeking in with a massive blush on her face. From there, it became a sort of mutual activity, albeit with Florina blissfully unaware that Lyn knew of her fetish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Lyn would take to deliberately sleeping barefoot, or gently rubbing Florina's shin with her ankle to tease her. She would always giggle upon seeing Florina's reaction, but never told her that she knew of the knight's fixation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, a month came and went. Lyn decided to take action, and called Florina to their shared quarters. The knight smiled and tilted her head. \"Is something wrong?\" Lyn smirked and spun around as she raised a socked foot and began to remove it; slowly, while wiggling her toes. The action, in turn, caused the knight to tigthen up and sweat. Lyn waved her finger, smiling mischeviously, as she said...</span></div></div>",

She had that sort of indomitable charisma, as a determined Princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou idly walked around the grounds of the monastery, thinking of what you wanted to do today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne particularly nasty thought entered your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a thing for feet, and always had. You were perverted through and through, and wanted only to satisfy those cravings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had dreamt of the scent of the future Emperor, and now, you were going to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snuck your way into her room. You had your methods, being quite the lockpicker, despite your noble lineage. The room was open, and you were free to enter. Her room was beautiful, incredibly well decorated. You began to search through her drawers for her stockings, finally finding multiple sets of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was your time to indulge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sniffed, licked and sucked on these stockings, your penis slowly growing beneath your trousers. Eventually you could take it no longer, and tore off your trousers, wrapping one around your penis. The feel of the silky smooth stockings was euphoric, to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese stockings engulfed you in lust, You lost track of time, and jolted back to reality when you saw Edelgard staring down at you, trousers off, a throbbing member covered with her stockings, with more around your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the- you pervert!\" She accused slamming the door shut, piling on top of you. You had to fight back, if you were to continue.</span></div></div>",

The way her eyes examined you... made you excited. You noticed your penis still had the stocking wrapped around it, and that more had been applied to bind your arms and legs. \"You perverted monster... you tried to indulge in your lust, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. You could do no more than that.

You took a deep breath with every stomp she made. Despite your pain, you pressed on. Her foot was heavenly, but the way it was being used, not so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that will not break you in... I will have to force you into servitude\" She hissed, bringing her feet to your mouth. \"Lick\" She commanded coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jumped at the chance, licking her foot from the tip of her toes to the end of her heel. Her foot tasted of sweat, her beautiful sole tough and large.

I want to hear you!\" She commanded. Out of fear, and of lust, you continued, and obeyed, going faster and more thoroughly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Edelgard stared down at you. \"What to do with you now... what will break you in?\"</span></div></div>",

You had been confronted by Dorothea of the Black Eagles House. A beautiful Songstress who was a part of the Mittlefrank Opera Company, a well-renowned group in the Empire. She was seen as a Bewitching Beauty by the other students, and now, you got to hang out with her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, right on time. I shouldn't have expected less, now, should I?\" Dorothea greeted as you walked up to her. You took a moment to glance over her apparel. She was dressed in the Officer's Academy Uniform, but she had a black hat over her head, on top of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing that stuck out to you, however, was her boots. They were black, heeled boots with golden lining, almost like that of the Officer's Academy Uniform. They emphasised her feet, making them all the more attractive to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then... shall we be off?\" She smiled warmly, gesturing for you to follow her. you obeyed, striking up a conversation with her along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Dorothea spent your time walking around the monastery, making idle chitchat. She seemed to take a teasing side with you, almost stringing you along with compliments and quips. Something you noticed was how direct and to the point, she could be. If you told her how all the men at the academy thought of her to be incredibly beautiful, Dorothea would respond with 'do you think that?' with a sly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as you walked, you spent a lot of time ogling her feet, rather than her face. You had a lot you wanted to do to them... though you wondered if you would ever have the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if right on cue to your obvious visible disappointment to your own remark, Dorothea said \"Ahh... I am tired. Would you lead a girl back to her room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. A plan starting forming in your head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou lead Dorothea back to her room, to which her first impulse was to take off her boots and neatly place them at the side of her bed. \"That is much better!\" She remarked with a sigh. You couldn't help but stare at the feet before you. Whilst they were still covered in socks, you could tell underneath that cloth cocoon was a sole like that of a Goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothea coughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately averted your gaze. Did she notice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am so tired... my feet are so worn out... hey, do me a favour, will you?\" Dorothea asked, bringing a foot up towards you. \"Give me a massage, It's what a gentleman noble would do for a lady after a long walk, right?\" She asked, a sadistic undertone present.</span></div></div>",

Lemme help\" You offer, getting down on your knees and kneading her soles.

She decide to be tentative and place a small kiss on the foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are...?\" She lookd down at you mid-kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you... kissing my feet?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... this is a, uh... way to help with the healing, yeah?\" You reply, trying to come up with an excuse.

Are you alright?\" the Cleric known as Lissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, why do you ask?\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard a scream like 'aaahhh!' or something... sure that was nothing?\" Sumia seemed taken aback. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nothing to worry about, she just tripped. I helped her out. turns out she had her boots on the wrong way, fancy that?\" You replied quickly. You weren't lying, per se, that was the case, but the scream came from something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... yep! that sounds like you, Sumia\" She giggled, patting her on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone fell silent when your leader and his retainer walked into the room. Lord Chrom of Ylisse and his Knight, Frederick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention, Shepherds! we've got a problem with some bandits a bit down south, let's take 'em down!\" He commanded with zeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of you all went to fight. Sumia didn't have a mount or anything, so she was restricted just to her feet. You began to wonder what her feet would be like once it was all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you reached the Bandit camp. The Shapherds charge into battled, clashing steel against steel against the bandits. Your skills were greatly over that of the bandits, you slew each one that came your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the battle, you looked to your right and saw Sumia in danger. You rushed to her aid and saved her from a possibly fatal strike. \"Thanks!\" She called over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem!\" you replied. You fought back to back, your bond deepening with ever strike deflected for the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of your fight, the both of you were sweating, tired. \"Phew... that was close...\" She huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... thanks for having my back\" You reply. Sumia beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a problem. If anything, I should be thanking you! I'm not an amazing fighter yet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, but you will be if you keep this up, Sumia, I'll tell you that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you visited the village you had just protected from bandits. the villagers said they'd give 'anything in thanks for their protection'. You looked to Sumia, a smirk on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, we have some requests, if you don't mind!\" You ask the villagers. You asked for various items that would 'enhance your time together with Sumia', as you had discussed before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Villagers managed to assemble all of it and put it in a sack, handing it to you. You hoisted it over you shoulder and the two of you walked back alongside the other Shepherds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you arrived back at the Headquarters, your first thought was to place the sack in Sumia's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to make use of our new gains tonight?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S...sure!\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive back into Sumia's room and...</span></div></div>",

You had an incredible track record, but not even yours could compare to Cordelia's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer beautiful figure, her mastery of Combat. A true prodigy, although she disliked terms like that. Her body was like that of a Goddess, and her luscious red hair made her easily stand out in a crowd even more than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis morning, the two of you were training together. Unmounted Lance Combat. The two of you dodged and weaved through each others attacks like it was a sort of dance, until finally, Cordelia managed to strike a clean, decisive blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!\" She announced in victory, holding her lance to the sky. \"Phew... you did manage to tire me out, though. Almost got me\" She extended a hand, to which you took, raising you back to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a workout...\" She stretched. \"Come with me, let's go and relax for a bit\" She smiled warmly. The two of you headed into a nicely lit room. It was cool inside, quite relaxing in comparison to the scorching heat outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh...\" Cordelia stretched, taking off some of her equipment, though notably not her breastplate. She pulled off her boots and a wonderful aroma came spiralling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My... apologies. I suppose I was starting to sweat quite a bit in those boots...\" She sighed. You assured her it was alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fancy a massage? those feet are looking like they could use it\" Cordelia looked to you with a slight blush, extending one of her perfect legs towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead...\" Is all she said. You began to knewad her feet like dough, getting your thumbs into her feet. They were large and beautiful, much like her thighs. Cordelia closed her eyes and her posture relaxed. \"That''s good...\" She sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly began to get aroused by her tender feet. When you sayw her toes wiggle, when you heard her sighs of relief and relaxation. It was all beautiful anf contributed to your arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot was so tantalising from this close. The sweat still dripping, her soles ever so close to your face. Surely at least a sniff wouldn't hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you gave into your temptations and began to sniff her feet every once and a while, as well. Despite being stuck in boots for a while in warm weather, they were actually quite good-smelling. They were not bad by any means at all. You began to sniff more and more, until you couldn't hold back anymore, and gave a small lick across the center of the foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a tap on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and see an arm, leading down to Cordelia's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... enjoying them that much, are you?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...\" Was all you could say before she cut you off. \"Don't mind me... you can keep going. It's... nice, but... don't go too far\"</span></div></div>",

The torches were lit with a mysterious purple flame, suggesting it was a Dark Mage that put you here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour questions and suspiscions were answered as Tharja walked into the room, her curvy body and arousing outfit were always something that made you at least get a small erection, but in such a setting, where it was overflowing with sexual airs, your penis could do nothing but become fully erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh... somoene's happy to see me\" She smirked, looking down at you. \"Enjoying yourself?\" She teased, lightly using the tip of her heel to stroke your penis. You moan in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmhm... yes, we'll be hearing that quite a bit\" Her smile grew wider as she took off her heels, revealing her feet, clad in the same bodystocking as the rest of her outfit. She gently caressed you body, tracing your sensitive areas with her foot, teasing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... you're going to help me try a hex... and there's nothing you can do to say no\" She cackled. She took out her spellbook and spoke an incantation. With that, you body seemed to have become almost 100x more sensitive. Her foot grazing your stomach felt like it was touching your penis, it was that good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liking it so far? Hmhm... well, what if I...\" She touched the side of your penis with her foot and dragged it down. the pleasure was so immense you erupted in a mountain of cum. With another incantation, it was trapped in a bubble, then poured into a vial. \"This will be useful later\" She smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However... for now, enjoy that release... you won't be getting another for a good long while...\" She muttered another incantation and dark magic seemed to surround the tip of your penis, and then spread until it formed what appeared to be a chastity device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more for now... but let's see how frustrated we can make you... it's got to be perfect\" She smiled with glee as she slowly and sensually stroked your penis with her foot. With the incantation, you so desperately wanted to cum again, but couldn't. In the end, all you could do was moan loudly in your thick gag from frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahahaha! Wonderful!\" She licked her lips. She propped herself down behind you, her creamy thighs surrounding your head. He feet lightly danced around your body as she used her long nails to trace your nipples, playing with them. You squirmed and writhed in frustration and a want to release, but the incantation kept stopping you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww... what a shaaaamme\" She teased in your ear almost seductively. \"You're mine now... and when this is over, when you beg, and beg and beg to cum... and I finally answer, you'll wish you hadn't\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being drunk on arousal those words filled you with dread. Again, there was nothing you could do but moan and write in your bondage.</span></div></div>",

Being in the position you was, you clearly had no choice but to submit and to began to lick. Her feet, obscured by black stocking, were amazing to the touch of your tongue. It feels great, no doubt incredibly increased by the incantation. Her soles were sheer joy and filled you with nothing but lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou greedily lapped at her feet, all the meanwhile, behind you, Tharja traced her long nail around your face, slightly stroking your skin in a way that, due to the increased sensitivity, only made you squirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere your arms not bound, you'd have taken these feet and shoved them straight into you face, you were that lustful. Each lick was long and quick, this taste being almost addictive. The tenderness of the sole under the stocking, the feeling of the stocking against your face as it lightly grazed it now and again. It was intoxicating in its own right, and you could do nothing but obey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Foot Slave of my own... hmhmhm... this is wonderful\" She soothingly teased behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, her feet left your face and she stood up, lookign down at you.

Tharja took a moment to personally stroke your penis with her foot a final time before you ejaculated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the sperm built up released at once, forming a massive volcano, of sorts. It was all manipulated into a group of glass containers, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me- did you wonder why I brought you here?\" She asked.

You had just walked into the tent of the Junior Tactician Morgan when in an instant you shrunk to a mere fraction of your height. As you were processing your sudden decrease in size you hear a giggle almost reverberate around you. You recognized the voice and a sinking feeling welled up in your stomach. Two thuds resonate around you as you turn to look behind you. In front of you are...toes? Massive ones at that. You hear another giggle and the toes start to wiggle slightly. You look up and see Morgan smirking down at you with a mischievous look. She was holding a mysterious tome in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah finally, good to see you in one piece. I recently discovered a shrinking spell in this old tome lying around the library. I figured I'd try it out on something. Thankfully you showed up right on time, I was getting ready to search for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood there slightly dazed from everything. You shake your head and asked her if she can grow you back now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I was thinking about that; but now...\" She stops for a moment as she props her left foot up in front of you. \"I think I kinda like you down there at my feet, and I think you do too right?\" She gives you a small grin as she bends her foot and wiggles her toes in front of your face. You take this moment to get a better look at the foot in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foot itself is very pale, most likely from being trapped inside her boot. The toes have this almost milky sheen as the soft and supple flesh bends causing creases on her sole. This is easily the best foot you've ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan notices you staring at her foot and giggles at your infatuation. She takes her big toe and boops you on the nose, knocking you over. \"You weren't exactly being subtle about it even when you were normal size. Regardless I think I have a job for you. I've been walking around camp taking stock of everything and my feet are ridiculously tired, and considering your attraction towards them I think it's only fitting that you help me out by massaging my feet. Of course if there's more you want to do besides a massage just let me know. I'm sure if you ask nicely my toes will accept a kiss or two.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou readily agree to her offer due to your attraction. Now the only question is... Do you take it slow, or jump into licking and kissing?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was obvious to you she took care of them rather well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe! you actually did it!\" She laughed.

You didn't know how much time had passed, nor did you think that there was any possibility of anyone coming inside. Corrin, however, seemed quite casual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Good Evening\" She greeted the guest. From the sounds of the footsteps, you at least knew it was a lady. But who?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good Evening, Lady Corrin... it seems I was... interrupting something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all. In fact...\" Corrin finally lifted the soles from your face, releasing light into your eyes. The visage of the room became clear once again, as did the figure who entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Ice Tribe Chieftain's daughter. Her expertise in household chores was immaculate and her professionalism uncontested among the ranks of the Maids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... hmm, Footslave, here's your reward\" Corrin smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe called you 'footslave'. That name brought you both shame and arousement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Lady Corrin-\" You say before being interrupted by her feet planting into your face again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will now call me 'Mistress Corrin', now get kissing\" She commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora simply looked on as you kissed at her large soles over and over, madly in love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Lady... what is it that... Footslave, I suppose is what I should address him as, is doing?\" She raises an eyebrow to Corrin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's doing his new job. Worshipping my feet! He's quite good at it, you know?\" She smirks, leaning back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I suppose that is beside the point, my Lady... why did you ask of me?\" Flora inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that IS the point, Flora. I'm going to need you to acquire these things for me, okay?\" Corrin handed Flora a note, which you assumed she wrote whilst using you as a footstool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I see. So this will become more commonplace?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. He's mine now, so I can do what I want with him\" She grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were... hers? you weren't arguing, but there was no agreement! though... you did suppose her having knowledge of your secret really was the Ultimate Blackmail in making you her footslave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Azura began to feel warm inside as she took her first, decisive sniff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonderful did not even begin to describe it.

Corrin accepted her wants, and was more than happy to accommodate, it appeared. She truly was a wonderful wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each suck, and each lick, her affection for her love's feet grew. The heat in her body caused her to trance her hand down to a source of wetness. Her hand was quickly batted away by Corrin's free foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think I'll be letting you do that, you naughty little footslave\" Corrin teased with a wink. \"If you aren't sucking a foot, you'd better be massaging the other\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzura nodded, with a level of contempt in a small grunt. She NEEDED that release. It was like pure torture... it wasn't like anything but Corrin was stopping her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, she continued to obediently sniff, lick and massage Corrin's soles, taking two other times to attempt to reach down and satisfy her craving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azura...! tsk, tsk, control yourself!\" Corrin teased. \"Or do I need to find a way to stop you?\" She asked with a giggle. \"I may have to punish you if you do it again\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words set Azura's heart ablaze. Corrin would... punish her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was very much what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzura disobeyed one more time, bringing her hands down in an attempt to satisfy herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"now, now!\" Corrin said, getting up, toppling over Azura. \"I said I'd punish you, didn't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzura's heart began to race. \"Yes! Yes you did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want me to punish you, hm? what do you say to that?\" Corrin got up in Azura's face, foreheads touching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES! yes I do...!\" Azura shot back with a reply. Corrin smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin began by tying her arms behind her back. it was a temporary solution, she mentioned. She DID enjoy the massage portion of it, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's get this on you...\" Corrin purred, taking out a steel Chastity Belt, with a matching bra that seemed just right for Azura. Azura offered no resistance, letting herself be locked up. It was a dream of hers. Her arms were then untied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now... let's see what this magic spell can do...\" Corrin said, propping her feet up in clear vision of Azura. She held out her arm and cast a spell, and suddenly... Azura's sexual organs felt as if they were on fire. She so desperately wanted to touch them... she clawed at the panel between her and her vagina, tried to tear off the bra, but it all held. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go...! no more of that for you!\" Corrin teased. \"Awww, is my little footslave wife too hot and bothered?\" She mocked, pulling Azura to the floor, resting her soles on top of her. \"You're my footstool now, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzura stood on all fours, her mouth dripping and her libido in overdrive. \"Yes! yes, I understand!\" She yelled sensually, her voice filled with lust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin smacked her with a foot. Not seriously, but still enough to cause mild discomfort. This remained simple play, after all. \"A footstool doesn't talk back! do I have to also gag that mouth of yours?!\" Corrin looked down, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what kind of things I could do to you... so many things, I'm sure...\"</span></div></div>",

Corrin laid on top of her, Azura preparing for what her wife had planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started simple. Corrin simply sat on top of her, having her worship her soles. This was just as wonderful as before, as now, the wonderful form of her wife was also on full display. This worship only continued to increase in its intensity, until Azura's tongue seemed to move almost automatically between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Corrin snuggled up next to her wife, silently breathing into her ear as she slowly tapped at the caged area with her foot. The sound of her wet foot slamming against her chastity cage was intoxicating, and frustrating, at the same time. Her face was red with arousal as Corrin brought a manicured hand to her breasts, toying with them as best as she could. Azura's senses were in overdrive, and she wanted only to passionately please her wife. She began to moan, and beg, and plead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corrin... please...\" She begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little too early for that, isn't it? you want a release already? my, my, you're such a fickle, naughty, girl\" She teased, purring into her ear. \"If you only complain, I'll have to do something about that\" She added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she did exactly that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer teasing grew in intensity, and Azura's moans only grew louder. It came to a point that Corrin took out a thick cloth and wrapped it around her wife's mouth, silencing her. \"Mpphhh...\" Azura continued to moan beneath the thick cloth as Corrin continued her teasing rampage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you get for being so loud...\" Corrin whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued late until the night until Corrin decided to...</span></div></div>",

All headed back inside the grand palace of Nohr after all the hardships of the, the family was completely exhausted, with only just enough energy for some idle chit-chat.  \u201cGreat work out there on the battlefield, Corrin!\u201d The eldest brother Xander said, patting the general on his back as they all walked towards the lounging area for some well deserved rest. \u201cTh-thank you brother\u2026\u201d Corrin responded, happy to have some form of encouragement. \u201cI suppose your tactics were\u2026 acceptable today, although you could very easily improve\u201d Leo added in, dampening Corrins mood. However soon after saying his comments, Leo was met with a swift slap to the back of his head by the youngest and most cheerful of the family, Elise. \u201cLeeeeeo! Come on, it was good victory, no need to get all meanie on us!\u201d The young princess exclaimed \u201cIt\u2019s called criticism Elise\u2026\u201d Leo scoffed. \u201cWell I for one agree with Elise\u2026\u201d Another voice chimed in. \u201cIt\u2019s not very nice to pick on our poor, sweet baby brother\u201d The eldest sister Camilla continued. These remarks resulted in quite a bit of bickering as the weary family walked through the cold, dark halls. Their arguing went on for a while, until Xander decided he was tired of listening to it all and shouted out a hearty \u201cENOUGH! Quiet, all of you, there\u2019s no need for this! Besides, we\u2019ve arrived\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder prince pushed open the grand oak doors to reveal one of the many rooftop garden lounges of the palace, complete with chairs and couches for every one of them to get their well deserved rest. Each of them eagerly went to a seat to finally get a break from running and standing, quickly removing all the heavy armour and weaponry they all had attached to them. Corrin let out a deep sigh of relief as he finally sat down in his favourite chair in the whole castle, able to at last take a break after all the fighting. Corrin closed his eyes, swiveled in his chair and took in a deep breath of what he assumed would be fresh air, only for his senses to suddenly be overcome with a thick, dank and cheesy smell more powerful than anything he had smelled before. The dragon prince\u2019s eyes shot open only for him to be face to face with a pair of stunning bare feet, immediately taking in every small detail from the cute toes with purple painted nails, the smooth, sweaty soles and the high arches. \u201cOh i\u2019m so sorry darling! Let me move those things out of the way for you sweetie!\u201d Camilla said. Her feet had been propped up on the end of the couch right next to Corrins chair, so she moved them to the ground. Although even after she brought them down, Corrin\u2019s gaze was completely fixed on them, and he didn\u2019t know why, there was just something about them. The simple scent was able to get his lower area active, a feeling while not entirely new, was still very foreign to the prince who had been sheltered for the majority of his life. \u201cTerribly sorry dearie!\u201d Camillas voice broke his trance \u201cThere was so much running today, I just had to get my shoes off to relax\u2026\u201d The princess said. \u201cUh...mhm...yeah\u2026\u201d Corrin responded, completely distracted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot much later, after a bit of chatter between the royals, Corrin remaining completely silent unless addressed, trying to sneak peeks at Camillas feet when nobody was looking, Camilla stood up and stretched her arms upwards, allowing her large breasts to jiggle. \u201cWell\u2026\u201d she began \u201cI think i\u2019m going to go off to the hotsprings, any of you can feel free to join me, especially you Corrin\u201d She said with a wink. \u201cUm yeah\u2026\u201d the prince said. Camilla then went off, absentmindedly leaving her shoes behind, walking down the stone corridor barefoot. Corrin was extremely flustered at this point, contemplating if he should follow her or not, wanting to know more about this weird fascination of his, yet at the same time not wanting to make a fool of himself in front of everyone. Corrin decides to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Both Xander and Leo simply gave a wave, too tired to even pay attention. Realizing that nobody was paying him any notice, the dragon princes attention indiscreetly shifted towards Camilla\u2019s discarded boots. They still looked warm and he could just barely smell their permeating scent from where he was standing. Without even thinking about it, Corrin quickly grabbed the shoes unnoticed and ran back to his room, quickly going in and locking the door behind him. He gave a sigh of relief that he had avoided embarrassment and looked towards the shoes in his hands, contemplating what he just did. \u201cWhat am I doing!\u201d Corrin yelled aloud as he threw the shoes to the stone floor. \u201cThese being to my own sister! Her old shoes no less and yet here I am stealing them for my own sick twisted pleasure!\u201d The prince argued to himself. \u201cI should return these at once, this is disgusting and perverted!\u201d The prince thought to himself. \u201cAnd yet\u2026.. \u201c His attention shifted back to the shoes as he picked one back up\u201cI feel such a powerful draw to them\u201d. He went on, bringing the shoe up to his face. Then, without realizing it, Corrin took in a deep sniff, breathing in as much of the musky air as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir scent alone was enough to make Corrins erection spring back up almost immediately, to him, it was more heavenly then any scent of flower or food ever could be. He stood there for a few seconds, simply basking in the shoe\u2019s warm scent, thinking about Camilla. \u201cOh baby brother, come here, your big sister needs some pampering ~\u201d He fantasized in his head, \u201cThats a good boy, now get on your knees and lick ~\u201d Corrin didn\u2019t even notice that he had stuck his tongue out and had almost gotten it on the insole. The prince stopped himself before that, not quite being comfortable with this new fascination he had acquired, instead he picked up the other shoe, wentover to his bed and placed them underneath it. \u201cAs much as I enjoy it, perhaps I am getting too far ahead of myself.\u201d He thought \u201cI\u2019ll sort this whole thing out tomorrow\u201d. And just like that Corrin crawled into bed and drifted off to sleep, thinking thoughts of nothing but his sisters goddess-like feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Corrin woke up very groggily and tire, opposite of his usual energetic awakenings. He felt completely sapped of a well rest for seemingly no reason. Everything around him looked the same, he didn\u2019t remember waking up, his body felt mostly normal except for\u2026 \u201cOh no, please tell me I didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d Corrin frantically pulled away his sheets and blanket to look underneath them, only to find exactly what he had hoped wouldn\u2019t be there. Down below he saw his now flaccid cock out, dried cum and now much farther down the bed, one of Camilla\u2019s shoes. \u201cOh no no no no no no no no! How am I ever going to explain this to her!\u201d The prince thought in a panic as he picked up the shoe, stained from a wet dream. \u201cWhat am I going to do with this???\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The cum gave way, little by little, but it would take an incredibly long time to get it all off. It was obvious to him now how much he must have enjoyed it. The Boot's musky scent, the soft texture. Thinking about it, and the foot it belonged on, aroused him slightly, and made him calm down, ever so slightly. He even tentatively stroked his still-exposed penis, but was able to snap himself out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, he gave up, and tossed the boot aside in frustration, the boot landing at the floor with a loud thud that echoed through the floorboards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin then heard footsteps.

You've been naughty, and now I will have to show you why you are not naughty\" She said. Again, just as before, Camilla smothers Corrin with her breasts, incapacitating him. When he woke up, he was now on the floor, with bound arms and ankles, with an odd metal device around his penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Darling... let me show you how it's done\" She kicks Corrin, sending him onto his back, his legs spreading out to show his chastity cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That there will prevent any naughty things, and if I still see naughty things, it will only get worse\" Camilla instructed, gently teasing it with her foot, causing a shot of pain to enter Corrin's groin. He could not longer get hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over to the chair\" She commanded, snapping her fingers. Corrin pathetically made his way to the chair, clambering as Camilla watched with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her reached the chair, he was bound to it with chains, his head resting on the seat. \"Don't mind if I take a seat, darling\" She giggled as she sent her large ass down on Corrin's face. Corrin moaned up it, his cage flopped around, unable to truly get hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a naughty boy...\" She shook her head, toying with his cage with a boot. Corrin could barely stand this sheer pleasure he got as her ass sat on top of him as she toyed with his caged cock. Despite it being in chastity, he could still feel every sensation, and that was what really frustrated him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla rose up to make sure he wouldn't pass out every now and again. She wanted him to be awake the entire time, of course.Using his face as a cushion, Corrin was in heaven, he was ever so tempted to just start licking at her thick ass, but resisted  the urge, as she had not instructed him to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued on until...</span></div></div>",

AAAGH.\"  Corrin let out a cry as Camilla re-positioned her grip from his cock to his balls.  She had squeezed sending a wave of pain through his balls.  The pain was enough to send him to  his knees.  Camilla released her hold on his balls and pulled on his hair so he was forced to look up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corrin my darling boy, you aren't being given a choice. I will break you.

For as long as you could remember, you were locked away in this fortress, only visited by your Sisters, Camilla and Elise, and your brothers, Xander and Leo. The 5 of you were as close as close could be, you could share anything with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell... almost anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor as long as you could remember you were utterly enamoured with your oldest sister's feet. Camilla was a beauty unlike any other, with incredible feminine features, but what struck you most was her dominant, almost possessive, demeanour. She would keep you coddled in her arms for ages, rest your head upon her lap, and so on, but it was her feet that you truly loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet were large, meaty, like great slabs of meat waiting to be savoured. Her feet were well-cared for and her teasing gaze and smilky smooth voice only wanted you to go further with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recall, one night, you snuck off with her shoes, and had the greatest time of your life licking, smelling and having fun with them. You, in a forbidden sense, wanted to see Camilla look down at you with a disgusted, cold, stare and instruct you around. You wanted to be her very own slave, not an equal to her. That was your deepest, most forbidden desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the time would come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla came alone to the Fortress one night. It was a pleasant visit, she coddled you just as she did when you were children, and you couldn't be happier for it. You were enamoured with her whole being, not just her feet, after all. The quick shift from kindness to malice was both shocking and arousing to you, and so dearly wished to see that malefic gaze turned at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the night, Camilla petted your head as you rested on her lap. She had taken off her clothes for the night, now only in her nightwear. You were much the same. You were calm but not settled. You couldn't help but continue to fantasise as her beautiful toes painted with purple varnish sat there in front of you, mocking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, dear?\" Camilla asked sweetly. You looked up quickly with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, Camilla! I was just... uhh...\" You stammer. Camilla smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see these wonderful toenails of mine?\" She asked, wiggling her toes. \"They are rather beautiful, aren't they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... really beautiful\" You asked, face hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look on edge, my darling... what's the problem? come on, big sis will help you\" She caringly spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... couldn't\" You reply, looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure I can, darling. Anything you want, I can do, and if I can't... I'll find a way, just for my little sister\" She said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... then...\" You glanced around, not sure what to say. \"Camilla, I love your feet! I've loved them forever! please, let me-\" You were interrupted by a finger to your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, I see, darling... I see\" She smiled, but there seemed to be a dominating aura in her eyes now. You felt yourself become weak in her presence. \"In that case, go down on the floor. I'll satisfy you tonight\" She smirked, though it seemed quite evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body now on the floor, you brushed your hair out of the way, ready to receive her feet. Camilla brought one of her feet down, resting on your breasts. \"I'm so happy you were honest with me, darling... I'll do whatever you want me to, when it comes to this, certainly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder what to ask:</span></div></div>",

You were so excited and aroused, all too ready to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y... yes mistress!\" You reply happily as you lick at her feet with vigor. Her feet were just as you imagined. Absolutely perfect, soft in all the right places, with so much space for you to lick. Her toes were so wonderful to suck, her soles so wonderful to lick. You were in complete euphoria, almost drunk on her feet alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla coldly pulled away at your night gown, making you naked. Your breasts spilled out, and your vagina completely exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my... you're at least clean... now... where are your toys, slave?\" She asked with a sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Under the bed, mistress\" You reply, still licking her feet, gyrating your hips like no tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla seemed to find all your toys in a box: A large dildo, a vibrator, and even a Chastity Device for your Breasts and Vagina, with some ropes and gags tossed in for good measure. \"Hmm... yes, this will work wonderful, slave. You're loving pleasuring yourself, it seems. You seem oh so eager to do that, but... what if I just... locked you up?\" She asked, dangling the chastity devices in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... would love that, Mistress! please, lock this naughty girl away!\" You reply, heavily drunk on the heat of the moment. Camilla's wicked smile widened. \"As you wish...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCamilla dragged you to you feet by your long hair, forcefully separating your legs with hers. \"Now, now, naughty girl. You can't resist, can you?\" She asked. You put up an act of resistance, all for her to treat you worse and worse. You wanted everything that Camilla had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe attached the Chastity device without issue, then bound your wrists behind you, your tongue lolling like a dog's. The silver chastity devices were beautiufl, and with your armour, you could hide them. None would be the wiser this is what you and Camilla were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmhm... come on, slave, keep worshipping!\" She commanded. You obediently lapped at her feet like a gracious dog. With your wrists bound, you couldn't bring your fingers to your vagina to relieve yourself, causing untold frustration. Of course, even if you could, you'd just be blocked by that new Chastity Cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's enough for today, darling\" She said, returning from her sadistic self. You sighed, seeing that playtime was over. \"But don't think I'm removing those. No, not even the binds. you'll be like this aaaall day, tomorrow, and I assure you... it will be hell by day 3 of no orgasm, for you\" She winked, throwing you off the floor into your bed. She tossed her boots, which she cast off earlier, on to the bed alongside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be with you in spirit tonight... or perhaps in boot spirit?\" She chuckled. \"Night night, darling... slave\" She tacked on with a giggle.</span></div></div>",

Show me how much\" She stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin was surprised, but he went with it. He took more gentle, then after that, more serious licks and sniffs of Hinoka's feet. She didn't seem used to anything like this, her face blushing almost the whole way through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... like it\" She admitted with a smile. She looked down. \"And it seems someone else did too\" She smirked, seeing the bulge in your trousers. \"Is my brother so perverted to go that far for my feet?\" She questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinoka didn't wait for Corrin to answer. She pulled down his trousers, revealing his fully erect cock. She brought her sweaty feet to it, and began to pulse it up and down, bringing immense pleasure to Corrin. He began to moan as Hinoka's dextrous feet worked their magic, these heavenly soles pleasuring him was almost too much!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinoka eventually stopped... before Corrin was able to cum. He thrashed about, frustrated. \"We can't have you doing that here, brother\" She scolded. \"Vulgar, aren't you?\" she teased, putting her socks and boots back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me... we'll end this elsewhere\"</span></div></div>",

You took to your job quite well, cleaning away at floors and scrubbing the dishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough... there was always a problem. A bit of an oddity among your ranks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awawawa! Coming throoooough!\" A voice called through the hall. You sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA terribly Clumsy maid tasked with serving the Lady directly, as you recalled. She was not one of... suitable skill, in your mind, however. She was utterly hopeless at housework and chores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK! a pile of plates fell to the floor with a crash, and along with them, Felicia came down with a tumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was why...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem... are you alright?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! uh... yeah!\" She replied. \"...I messed up again...\" She looked down glumly for a moment. You sighed. Although you were quite agitated at what Felicia did, you couldn't help but be suckered in by her almost pitiful behaviour. both enraging and enchanting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Felicia, really? I'm quite sure there must be an issue... are you sure you aren't ill-prepared in any other manner?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure!\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at her attire. She seemed to be in perfect condition, her Maid clothes were fine. You found yourself... oddly gravitated to the heels she wore, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... is there a problem?\" She asked ditzily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap! She saw you staring, best make an excuse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahaha... yes, I think I see a small issue, is all\" You explain as you walk over to Felicia, still sat on the floor. You scrape away some of the now ruined plate and take her heels from her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the problem? don't tell me I have my boots the wrong way around!\" She raised her eyebrows in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... yes, these seem alright... hmm, there must be something amiss with your footing then...\" You glance over to her feet. Small, but cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... mind if I just take a quick look at your feet, Felicia? That couldn't have been an accident, I'm sure\" You explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... if you insist\"  She says, taking her foot and holding it in your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foot was wrought with ache and strain, you couldn't believe it. You slowly kneaded at her foot like it was dough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh... what are you doing?\" She asked, both amazed and somewhat relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A simple massage... your feet seem in quite bad shape, though a Hall with broken plates is nowhere to just do a full foot massage. Once we clean these up, let's get to your room and begin properly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia just nodded her head slowly, getting up. \"Right! let's get to work!\" She announced with zeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two of you finish and you head into Felicia's room. You instruct her to sit up on a chair whilst you sat down on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, there's two ways to go about this... let's see here...\"</span></div></div>",

It's me who offered, wasn't it?\" you replied with a smile. It wasn't just for her, either, you knew, but decided not to tell her that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massage was slow and steady, as her muscles slowly began to lose their intensity. Felicia seemed quite happy, moaning in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... are you alright now?\" you asked. Felicia snapped back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes! I'm alright now! Thank you!\" She bowed her head. \"Hey... but are YOU alright?\" Felicia asked, taking her foot, and placing it on your crotch. You hadn't even noticed that you had gotten hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, it's just... your feet are...\" You took a moment to think, but eventually looked to her face. \"Felicia... I love your feet\" you replied, beaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My... what?!\" She replied, utterly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true, I love them. I... they're so soft, and... beautiful\" you said, but by that point, Felicia put a toe to your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, it's alright!\" She reassured, putting a finger to her lips. \"I won't tell anyone! you have my word!\" She smiles. \"Besides...

Very few disturb you in this time, there's very few people around, all of them mostly asleep. A perfect time to train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" A voice calls over to you, disrupting your practice swings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're pretty dedicated, getting up at a time like this in the morning\" The girl from which this voice came from announced, a tinge of annoyance in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...? and what do you need?\" you ask brazenly, looking over to her. You recognise her as one of Lady Camilla's retainers. A real succubus of a woman, she surrounds herself with women just as beautiful. This girl, Selena, to your knowledge, is prideful and competitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you done now?\" She asked with crossed arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I will continue to train. There is more than enough space, why not join me?\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah... suppose that's true\" She muttered, standing next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Your footwork's wrong, loser!\" She pointed out you more odd way of handling your sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just different, it's a perfectly fine way of doing it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're getting in the way! and it might be good for, you know, hitting the air, but not for people like me with an actually GOOD style\" She boasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a challenge?\" You smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, then we're gonna have ourselves a little competition are we? fine by me!\" She backed up, putting her sword forward. \"Whoever loses has to do what the other wants them to from now on, got it?\" She sneered, a lot of confidence and snark in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine by me...\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you begins fighting, clashing wooden swords like mad, meeting each other point for point, not even managing to give each other any room for attack.

All you could do was groan, the strike knocked the wind out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, bigshot! Here's what you're gonna do!\" She smugly began to lay out your orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off, you're coming with me!\" she tugged at you arm, taking you off the ground. She led you to her room in the ruined fort. A lot larger and grand than the ones you and your fellow soldiers were assigned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being a retainer has its perks\" She smirked. \"And you don't deserve any of this, you loser!\" She kicked you down, sending you sprawling to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...take it off\" She commanded. You had to do a double take. \"Take. It. Off! Your armour, your clothes, I don't care, get it all off. You lost, and so i'm gonna humiliate you!\" Her commanding tone made you so frightened that you were subconciously performing those actions as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you were done, Selena had grabbed a bundle of rope. She tied you hands behind your back and tied another length of rope around your neck, forming something similar to a leash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo, what'cha think I'm gonna do?\" She asked, a sly grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I don't know\" is all you could do to reply. Selena responded with a swift kick to your face, only it felt rather soft and damp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally noticed that Selena had taken off her long boots, revealing her long tights. They stopped just where her foot met her ankle, and had a stirrup that looped around her foot. Upon gazing at the foot, your arousal seemed to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"huh? what's that down there, loser?\" She asked, stomping down on you penis, causing you to grunt int pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get hard! there's a job to do, you know?\" She said in an almost sickeningly sweet way. She took her boots and placed them in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clean my boots, and maybe, just maaaybe I'll rewards you\" She smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou proceeded to begin licking and smelling the boots. They carried a beatifully stuffy scent, not irratating but not a traditional form of beauty to them. You couldn't help but be entranced as you lapped at her boot leather, taking in eat and every little taste of sweaty leather. The pleasure this brought you was both embarassing and arousing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah... here\" She finally said, smacking her foot into your face. \"Lick it, you nasty perv...\" She muttered, looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as your current master asked, licking every inch of her foot. It was a soft, light, heavenly sole that was obviously taken care of. her skin fresh and supple, the sweat like a beautiful accompaniment. Selena seemed to enjoy it, as much as she didn't want to admit it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you took the foot and fit all the toes into your mouth, lapping at the in-betweens of her toes like a man in the desert would water. You craved her feet... you loved them, this was a feeling you hadn't experienced before... you loved it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Selena commanded you to stop for a moment, claiming it was so that you 'Didn't get too carried away and do something weird', but you saw right through her beet red face. She was enjoying it. just as much as you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Selena set you down in front of the bed, her powerful legs and tender feet dangling in front of you.

You'd just lost a duel that might have just made you a servant to this girl for life. And she was going to humiliate you, likely not just in private for very long. You were afraid, but at the same time, that same idea turned you on. Selena was cute, and so were her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you thoughts were disrupted by Selena returning, with even more rope. \"We'll keep you over there, for now\" She smirked, beginning to tie your legs together, and then putting you into a Hogtie. You grunted as she applied the ropes, being a tad too rough at points, almost unfocused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut uuup! it's not that bad\" Selena rolled her eyes in response to your grunts, taking off her tights and using them to gag you. You were tied all nice and snug, not a chance of escape. Ropes surrounded your wrists, your elbows, your ankles, your knees, even around your penis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's that for a work of art?\" She smugly proclaimed. You grunted in your gag in response, but she took one of her bare feet and pushed you back into the closet in the corner of the room, filled with various shoes and boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider that your new bedding, alright?\" She smirked. \"Hope you enjoy that snack in your mouth\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan and moan but soon the door closes, and you're left alone in the darkness. eventually, without anything to do, you settle down and sleep finally comes to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoughly 6 hours later, the doors to the closet open and...</span></div></div>",

Her long purple locks trailed down from her head down to her lower back. She dressed in black, and had a set of clothes that let very little to the imagination, when it came to the important areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it was true...\" Camilla looked on, a little surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! I beat him, Lady Camilla! Aren't I a great retainer?\" She proudly puffed out her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmhm... Selena, darling, you were already a great retainer\" She chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them carry your nude body out of the closet and on to the floor. The two of them seemed to have prepared some more proper materials for their wants from you today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right... slave, that's what we'll call you. That's basically what you are at this point\" Selena began. She wasn't quite wrong, you knew in your mind. \"We're going to have some fun today. Hope you're ready\"  Selena untied you completely. Camilla stood behind you to grab you if you ran away. There was no resistance against these two powerful women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off...\" She spoke, first pulling out a leather leash. You'd seen these things used on young Wyverns for taming and leading them around, so it was no surprise for you to see one. Selena attached the leash to you neck,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then...\" Camilla spoke into you ear. In a flash, you were on the floor, legs spread, revealing your dick at full mast. \"That truly pathetic thing there... needs some help\" Camilla took out a spellbook and muttered an incantation. Around your penis came a cage made of a dark grey iron. It seemed to appear and disappear as you became more or less aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's gonna make sure you don't make a mess whilst on the job, 'ya got it?\" She said, kicking your now caged penis. From this, you felt an instense feeling coming from the cage that erupted pleasure throughout your body, but felt the frustration of being unable to release properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally...\" Selena took out some expensive, exotic, red rope. Very fine, very thin, incredibly comfortable, not like what you had before. \"Just to show our appreciation to your lifetime of servitude, but don't get the wrong idea\" She said. Eventually, the only things you could do was moan, groan and move slowly due to the way you were tied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Selena, darling... let's take this out for a spin\" Camilla smirked evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena took hold of your leash and pulled you closer. \"Lick. When I say that, you lick the person who holds this leash's feet, got it?\" She hammered into your head. YOu obeyed, licking from tip to top of her long boots. They still tasted of heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But for today, we'll be the ones doing the talking\" Camilla spoke, taking a bunch of socks and tights, and shoving them into your mouth, sealing it off with another pair of tights. \"You're just a pet for today\" She lightly tapped your dick with her heel, causing the pleasurable reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey left the room, tugging you along. The humiliation was intense, with the many people looking on in confusion or bewilderment. You had never felt so aroused. You were instructed by Camilla and Selena to nuzzle close to their legs, which you did, you felt the creamy thighs of Selena and Camilla against your cheeks every once and a while, and occassionally they stopped to turn around to tease your now caged penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after almost 2 hours of this...</span></div></div>",
