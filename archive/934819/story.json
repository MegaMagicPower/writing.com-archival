The basket of flowers she had been trying to sell lay tipped next to her, and her head hung low as shift workers wandered past from the many factories of the industrial city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, something warm flashed against the side of her face. Rasing her head her brilliant green eyes fluttered open. Turning around and supporting herself on hands and knees she stared at a crack in the wall. Sparks popped from the opening, a bright neon emerald glow. She padded a soft hand against the rough cement wall and tilted her head, leaning closer to peer inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImages began to flood through Aeris mind, horrible visions leading up to her own demise by a man in a black trench coat. His long sword plunging unseen from behind until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe images stopped. Shaken, Aeris backed up and turned to flop down again against the building. She gasped, finding the same man from the visions standing before her. The huge blade of his sword was pointed right at her, and in his free hand, he held an odd glowing orb of materia. His piercing eyes glared down upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't have to be like that.\" The dark figure in the trench coat said, wavering slightly and putting his sword down to the cobblestone road, long white hair waving with his movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAeris, \"How did you know?\" A smile played across the mans lips. \"What was that? The future?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly nodded, \"We Ancients can bring a new era to this world. However, we need to return all life to the life stream first. I know you understand me. You know it is for the best. I am Sephiroth, and you shall be the instrument of this planets destruction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? I'm just a flower girl. How can I do such a thing? Why would I help you anyway?\" Aeris was looking around, talking loudly and hoping one of the workers would stop. Not even the soldiers cared, in fact, they seemed to be hurrying people out of the district. Her heart began to beat faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSephiroth shook his head, \"Do you want that future? Do you want me to be your end? This is the best way. The planet will not be harmed, only the life that should be cleansed from its surface.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bowed her head. What could a simple flower girl do? Rising, her soft leather padded boots tapped lightly upon the road. \"What do I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSephiroth sheathed his sword and held out the strange materia in both hands. In flashed brightly and Aeris saw the dark figure smile slowly, \"You are doing a good thing Aeris. This will spare the world much pain, and I know you want these creatures to be at peace. It is the only way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a burst of light, Aeris was blinded for a moment. When her vision returns, Midgar is nothing but a toy with the towers stretching up to only her knees.</span></div></div>",

He was just a bit bigger than a tiny spot before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith cold eyes flashing his rage, Sephiroth floated over and landed on her shoulder, \"Now Aeris, it is time. First, the Shinra building. I want you to punch into it and take each one of them out, one by one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAeris gasped, \"I thought you only wanted me to destroy them. That sounds kind of cruel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhipping out his sword like a pointing stick, Sephiroth cleaved it through the air a bit, \"Is it not cruel to just be a heartless killing machine? Punish those who deserve it Ancient. They would have to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConflicted, Aeris touched the side of Shinra tower. Her massive fingers splintered the glass windows and tiny metal frames, creating a deep creaking from the bending tower. Pulling back she frowned. It would be hard to snatch anyone from the broken building if it was this fragile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring down at all the roadways and blocky buildings in the slums at her booted feet. Trashing them would be easier. Many of the people below were running around and trying to escape the area. Since they were out in the open, it would be easy to make sure she returned them to the life stream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her gaze, Sephiroth noted, \"Do whatever you want, just make sure you get them all. We'll total Midgar first.\"</span></div></div>",

Midgar was one of the most technologically advanced cities on the planet but none of its defenses or weaponry came close to helping stop Aerith's rampage. With a stoic cruel expression she just stomped everything in sight, crushing buildings to rubble, turning people into blood splatters on her soles, annilhating anything and everything. Many of the slums residents were confused, Aerith was well known for her flower shop; why would she suddenly grow and destroy all? The question haunted almost every one of them as Aerith's sole dug into their delicate bodies, finishing them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the upper level of the Shinra Building Sephiroth chuckled, having entered from a hole Aerith made he watched as the giantess continued her onslaught. \"What a fool.\" He laughed, he showed the girl images of her future yes, but a possible future not a definite one. All it took was those images and minor manipulation and the girl became an unwilling killing machine, little more than Sephiroth's gigantic pet. He particularly enjoyed the method she used to kill everyone, regular people were nothing but bugs compared to the Ancients, thus it is natural that they should be killed like them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a chuckle the swordsman turned away from the destruction and delved deeper into the building. \"And at the end of it all, I'll finish off the girl... and then me and you can rule the world Mother, with no petty interferences.\" Sephiroth stopped in his steps, nearby he heard people yelling out orders, running, even shooting, and moments later a group of soldiers entered the room with the newly formed hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSephiroth smirked as he turned back to them, the group saw him and instantly he felt the waves of fear come from them. They were speechless but their basic thoughts were obvious, \"S-Sephiroth!!? H-He's dead!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe master warrior pulled out his Masamune, still smirking. \"I have returned to rule this planet with Mother.\" He swung his sword once, and every single soldier who entered the room, all twelve of them, were sliced clean in two before they had enough time to even think of pulling the triggers on their guns. Sephiroth just laughed as their sliced bodies tumbled through the buildings opening, raining their fleshly deceased blood onto the city as the corpses fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSword still unsheathed Sephiroth turned around and began walking again, he was on the Science Department floor, which meant his Mother would be nearby. More people littered his path, scientists, rogue experiments that escaped, soldiers, even members of SOLDIER, but Sephiroth decapitated them all before they even knew he was there. Soon he entered the main experimentation area, a large pod-like container was near, Sephiroth sensed the familiar presence within it. With another swing from Masamune the contained was destroyed, its cryogenetic ice and frost dissipating into the air. In the midst of the wires and destroyed  contained was an alien-like humanoid, Jenova.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSephiroth's eyes widened like he had stumbled upon the greatest treasure known to man, he stepped forwad, eagerly eyeing his Mother. \"Mother...you're beautiful...\" Jenova responded to his voice, convusling as it awakened to life once more. A voice rang out, it sounded almost godly as it seemed to come from nowhere. \"Sephiroth....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImages filled Sephiroth's mind as he stood before his mother, images of the destruction and carnage a gigantic woman like Aerith would reap. Junon, Gold Saucer, Wutai, every city was essentially wiped out, and the image of the one who caused it filled Sephiroth's mind next, the image had the gigantic Aerith with her stoic look but...there was another there too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see....thank you Mother...\" Sephiroth chuckled as the images vanished, \"One is not enough. We need a second pawn to fully do the job.\" The swordsman extended a gloved hand to Jenova, the alien-like creature seemed to leapt into his grasp. \"Together we will seek out this second pawn Mother. Someone who will obey us completely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Who are you?\" A scared unknown voice rang out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether with his mother Sephiroth turned around, a woman had snuck into the room as he was having his heartfelt moment. His lips twisted into a mad smile, \"Will this woman suffice Mother?\" Jenova seemed to convulse in confirmation. Slowly Sephiroth walked towards the girl......</span></div></div>",

Two frightened onlookers peeked out from a box they were huddled together in, trying to keep warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we run for it?\" The girl asked the boy in a ragged trench coat and worn gloves next to her, \"She's huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked to the girl next to him, wearing a ratty torn brown coat, a scarf and a battered flat brimmed hat, covering her black hair, tied back in a pony tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could, but maybe she'll leave the area alone. She's got to be in shock too. Plus as long as she doesnt knock anything over, shes not going to go after a box,\" he said to his companion as hugged her close, protectivly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could sneak away,\" she suggested, snuggling her head against his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could sneak off, are you sure you want to take that chance?\" He asks the girl quietly, awed by the movement of the giant form above them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl is kneeling down and unlacing her titanic boots, laces like bride support cables slam into the roadways around the sums, cracking the pavement with tremendous force. \"If this is what I must do, I want to make sure I get every last one. I can sense them under my bare feet, so I'll just take my boots off then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAeris pulls a gigantic foot out from her left boot, her leg arching up her pink skirt as her massive sole hovers high into the air. The two homeless Midgar peasants stare up as the giant girls green eyes glare down with a calm cruelty. She reaches near the box to a fleeing mob with her toes, squshing a few with the tips of her toes, poking at them and making sure they do not move again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll take that chance,\" the girl says to her friend, \"She might get bigger and just cause random destruction, she might attack this box.

Get back!\" One of the guards cried out, raising his gun. All too late he realized as the vagrant lunged forward and planted his fist square into the guards jaw under his face mask helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing up the dropped automatic weapon, he turned it to the other guard. A few more had come from various nearby posts to see what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're leaving!\" He announced, motioning for the girl to run to his side. She did and tightly hugged herself close to his waist. \"If you're smart, you'll realize this chaos is just that one girl and save yourselves too. As one citizen to another, get out of Midgar now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards paused for a moment, and one even lowered his own weapon. Removing his helmet he nodded to his fellow guards, \"He's right. This is serious. If we don't trust them, she may get us anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAeris was still making her way slowly along but was arching toward the sound of gunfire earlier. She was going to run straight to it, but when she didn't hear anymore, she assumed it may have even been unrelated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny people at her feet were mostly exausted now. Having mostly been chased from the slums themselves and avoided near death as Aeris' feet trod upon their friends around them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grimey soles of the flower girl had carelessly stomped down around fleeing groups, picking out each person individually to be ground under her soft skin. Those around her step usually dove to the ground for a moment, cowering and accepting their fate, only to learn that it wasn't their turn yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome, delerious and unable to go on even rested against the massive toes of the giantess destroyer who's feet were slowly becoming covered in the grimy slums debris, and it's inhabitants remains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beautiful towering flower girl, her long brown hair, tied back and flowing behind her, stared down for a long moment and sighed. She didn't really want to do this. But she knew the world was in a state of chaos right now. Mako energy was wrong. She knew that as well as anyone did. If this could bring about a new world, and these people would be brought back into a happier world, would it really matter if they had to endure being crushed into the grimy wrinkles of her soles?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAeris tipped some more people over and placed her foot on top of them so that the arch of her toes rested over them like a tight cave. She wiggled her toes and clenched them tightly, squishing the people between her soft padded toes and the plush wall of the ball of her foot. They quietly gave in to her. She was unsure if they were out of breath, or out of hope. All she hoped was that they knew it was for the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she should tell them she considered. Plead to the people to understand her. Would they really walk willingly to her feet so she could finish them off? It may be better. Or would they just think she was crazy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to Sephiroths cold glare, focused far below, she watched him float next to her like an evil advocate hovering over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Continue Aeris,\" Sephiroth commanded, not looking to her, \"The planet needs you to cleans her. Do not hesitate. More is lost every moment.\"</span></div></div>",

We have to go now!\" The peasant girl pleaded with the guards, some of which still stood wary and looked nervously at their companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of their radios crackled, \"Threat to Shinra seems to have been averted. Turn away all scum that attack the boarders in your sector!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, the guards exchanged glances. None knew exactly what they should do. These two we're just in their late teens, and didn't seem to pose a threat. Looking high up to the giant female form that blocked out the sky, cracking buildings with her flowing skirt, reminded them that even a sweet innoncent youthful looking person could be affected somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThundering steps got closer and closer. Finally one of the guards shoved forward and brought the end of his gun down on the vagrant boys arms, snatching the stolen weapon away from him. He nodded to his other companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back! Maybe if she takes you, she'll be happy. Probably sick of vermin like you slum dwellers. Thats why shes concentrating on getting every last one of you!\" Barked one of the guards, gun leveled at the two homeless Midgar peasants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl began to cry and hugged her companion again. He just began to walk back, hands up, frowning at their lack of trust. They wouldn't let their guard down this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get marching! I want you two to walk right up to that giant monsters feet and throw yourself upon them, or I'll do you in myself,\" Another guard commanded, locking his gun against his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing no choice, they turned to look down the street, flanked with rubble and overpasses. In the far distance the dull pink dress of the enormous flower girl could be seen shuffling about as she seemed to be picking people up with her toes and squeezing them high in the air, squashing them to the ball of her foot, then letting their remains fall down to the dusty roads below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands swayed casually by her sides. Aeris attention turned to something at the side of a building. Unseen to the two vagrants, the giant flower girl was staring down at a similar fearful couple, a man and a woman, also in ratty clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey cowered against the cold stone walls of a long forgotten warehouse. Bits of fallen concrete popping under the feet of the giant monsterous girl before them. Collectively, they gasped as she raised her right foot. The bottom was dusted in so much rubble, but an unmistakeable dark red color was mixed in to the grime. Wiggling her toes with casual anticipation of her next job well done, the massive wrinkles moved like waves frozen in place across the vast sole of Aeris foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but it will be better some day soon. It will be quick,\" she quietly said, padding down with the edge of her foot viciously at the two fearful peasants. Their tiny cries quickly ended under the flower girls massive dirty foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with the two vagrants with the guards at their back, not a move was taken. They stood stunned as this girl, so sweet and peacefully looking, mashed another life or more out under her gigantic feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're nothing but bugs to her, and she really seems like she wants to spend all day crushing us,\" the girl gulped, shivering as she held close to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we can get down the street far enough before she does, we should be able to ditch down an alley and escape the guards. Then again, maybe we can reason with her,\" the other vagrant offered as he fixed his friends scarf that had come undone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis female companion shivered and cuddled to his chest, \"I'll stick close to you, whatever you decide to do, I'm with you, to the bitter end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded. He knew he could trust her. They had lived in the slums together for years now. Keeping warm and surviving together while others lived out their own rogue lives in solitude. \"Let's do this.\"</span></div></div>",

The guards had decided it wasn't worth it to spill more blood, and with no other command units around, a little personal decision on their part wouldn't hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll be back,\" the vagrant boy said sadly, \"She's just going back to pick off any people she missed. There is something wrong with that. She is making sure that she doesn't miss anyone for a reason. A flower girl turned giant wouldn't just suddenly become this distruction, and concentrated on getting every last person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard who had removed his helmet moved closer to the couple, \"Something is wrong, you're right.

The metal wall was on sliders that she was able to jam and then force back into their holding unit. A full devider designed to keep rioters or any small army at bay was now broken and useless, unable to stop the mighty giantess flower girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinra lay beyond. Office workers feld as guards lined in rows to protect the tower. Weapons ready, they prepared to barrage Aeris with a rain of bullets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This started with all of you, so it's best if I take you all out first!\" Aeris said with a huff. She held no love for the Shinra corp, and under Sephiroths command, she was eager to feel the toy soldiers crunch under her feet. \"It's going to be slow and painful for you servants of Shrina, just as you have caused the slow and painful destruction of the planet!\"</span></div></div>",

She was wearing her black leather sleeveless jacket (as seen in Advent Children) over a white singlet top containing her ample charms, and her modest black shorts and belt fitting snuggly around her athletic body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a inn room somewhere nearby, Cloud was doing a quick mirror check to make sure he looked plausibly well dressed for his date with Tifa. He was already rather late, having spent the day with Aeris, and though didn't want to leave the inn without her, he had made a promise with Tifa that he would see her and that Aeris wouldn't get in her way. Cloud sighed heavily and moved towards the door, but he was stopped by Aeris waiting by the door. She went to him as he approached and threw her arms up around his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, Cloud... why do you have to head out now?\" Aeris pouted, \"I know you're going to see 'her', but you said you would stay with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud moved her arms off his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Aeris, I'm just going out to catch up with her. It's not like we're an item or anything, and I promised her I would.\" Cloud responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least let me come along!\" Aeris persisted, \"I know you say you're just friends, but she comes accross as far too suggestive for my tastes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud sighed again, \"We've been over this, you know I promised that I wouldn't bring you along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could hide somewhere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be seen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud dropped his head, realising that persisting in the conversation was only making him later, and Tifa more aggitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I'm off, I'll see you when I get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAeris grabbed his hand before he could make it out the door, \"Wait! I have one last idea. It'll let me come along undetected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud rolled his eyes, \"Aeris...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just close your eyes, and you'll see how well I can hide myself.\" Aeris mused, a slight grin in the corner of the mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\", said a defeated Cloud, \"But make it quick\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open your eyes in about 15 seconds time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud closed his eyes and stood facing Aeris. He counted out to 15 in his head, and then opened his eyes, expecting nothing out of the ordinary. What met his eyes was simply an absence. Aeris was no longer there. \"Brilliant...\" Cloud thought, \"A game of hide and seek...? What's so incredible about that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud stood still for a while, looking around the room almost expecting Aeris to appear from somewhere, although she didn't. In his state of utter confusion, Cloud failed to notice a tiny little lady barely the size of his finger clamber up one of his boots and cling to the laces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding it better that he take the oportunity to leave without a fuss, Cloud walked out the inn door and down the street to where Tifa was waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAeris struggled to find her bearings being jostled around in Cloud's shoe, but she soon made herself comfortable and got into a rhythm with Cloud's stepping pattern. She pulled a small globe of materia from her pocket and eyed it with a smirk. \"This will be very handy.\" she thought, \"I'll show that Tifa...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud's movements suddenly stopped, and Aeris was suddenly thrown sideways as Cloud sat down at the table where Tifa had waited. Aeris looked around to see that Tifa and Cloud were alone at the table, and Tifa was acting quite provocative in her manner and dress. Aeris could barely contain her excitement, and longed to execute her plan immediately, but the urge to listen in on the conversation above was tempting too...</span></div></div>",

They had started on opposite sides, but Aeris had noticed Tifa edging further around the table and closer to Cloud. Aeris could still see very little of what was going on, and all the noise from other patrons in the area made listening in on the conversation difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to get higher, and closer.\" she thought, \"Even if i'm seen, i can just execute the plan and be done with them. easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAeris placed the materia in her pocket to free her hands, and she scaled Cloud's trouser leg again to reach his thigh. Almost as soon as she had found her bearings, a giant hand slammed down right beside her. The impact must have been miniscule on a regular scale, just hard enough to notice, but to her it was like a clap of thunder. Aeris lept from Cloud's leg to the space beside him and looked up. Cloud was sitting perfectly normally; arms across the table, legs set just apart, looking normal. Tifa was now almost next to him, her hand very gently stroking his thigh, and Aeris was about to be sandwiched between Cloud's thigh and Tifa's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tifa edged closer to Cloud one more time, Aeris jumped as high as she could, just high enough to avoid being squashed. She landed roughly on Tifa's leg, but slipped on her silky smooth skin and toppled between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough with eavesdropping,\" Aeris thought to herself, utterly fuming with anger, \"I'll get that busty bitch for trying to steal Cloud from me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Aeris reached for the materia in her pocket, something stopped her...</span></div></div>",

The little whore must have been evesdroping on her man! With a swift movement Tifa snatched up the tiny Aeris, and begain to massage her across Cloud's inner thy. As she drew closer and closer to the massive tent in his pants, Cloud could tell there was somthing moving in Tifa's palm. He was about to comment on it, when Tifa made a bold grab of his crotch, and whatever words were about to come out of his mouth were replaced with a sharp moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Tifa...</span></div></div>",

With the swiftest of motions, Tifa pulled open the top of Cloud's pants, dropped the still fretting flower girl inside and let them fall into place.

His eyes wandered, searching the room for a source of distraction from the irregular sensation he was feeling; he had the vibe he may get lucky, and he felt he would never be able to shake off a disappointment to her. He continued to try and shake the erotic thoughts he was plagued by, though something was still bothering him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom inside the hot and sweaty confines of Cloud's trousers, the poor innocent flower girl, now with hair sticking up as much as Cloud's manhood, was still struggling to re-orient herself so that she wasn't upside down or in an embarrassing leg-lock with Cloud's aroused member. As she found herself upside down once again, the materia slipped from her pocket. With lightning speed Aeris narrowly caught the glowing orb before it fell eternally, and she clutched it firmly in her sweaty hands. She stared into the orb's light radiating centre, and contemplated using it now on Cloud, in the hopes that the two of them might escape from Tifa unnoticed... 'no', she thought; Tifa had already seen Aeris shrunk, and Cloud's disappearance would not be hard to explain. Tifa would surely find them. Aeris reconsidered, but with the prospect of shrinking Tifa; would she get a chance before Tifa took the materia from her? and would she have enough strength left to return her own height? she was already tired from the time she cast the materia upon herself, and she estimated she had one shot at using it before she would need rest to regain her strength. Aeris thought carefully of her next move....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the next room, Tifa heard Cloud's impatient footsteps pace her hallway. She smiled to herself, and took an extra long time fitting herself with a barely-functional bra (due to it's size) and a pair of underwear more closely affiliated with dental floss. She took some sort of odd pleasure with the thought that Cloud would be able to finish himself off purely with the THOUGHT that he would have a chance to be with her tonight, and she saw no reason not to make him wait it out a bit. Flipping idly through her wardrobe, she spied her old outfit from years past; her grey sweat-shirt and miniature black skirt. She had grown a bit over the last two years, but she couldn't see the harm in slightly small clothing. Plus, maybe the outfit would jog a few memories for Cloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a solid 5-10 minutes of getting dressed, Tifa left the room into the main hall where Cloud anxiously awaited her, and within the confines of his package Aeris plotted her next move...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She slunk around the corner, her long slender legs leading the way, but her eyes fell upon an empty room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly her grin vanished and her eyes darted from corner to corner of the room. It hadn't taken her a second to establish where Cloud would be; that Aeris bitch had shrunk him. She closed the front door first off, wedging a towel under the door to prevent any escape plan the flower girl and Cloud could have concocted. From then Tifa systematically began her search of the room; she dropped to her knees and started edging across the floor, her eyes piercing and sharp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly seconds before Tifa's bold entrance, Cloud had been standing by the couch in her room. The tingling pleasant sensation in his crotch no longer apparent, Cloud was quickly about to investigate when he spied a scarcely 3 inch companion dangling from his belt. Before his recognition of this tiny woman had finished and before his mouth had even formed the word 'aeris', a bright light engulfed him and he dwindled in size and conciousness...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAeris clung to Cloud's side as he shrunk and collapsed, and she narrowly avoided being crushed under his toppling body. As his size reached her own, she rolled him onto his back and tried to wake him up in vain, he had blacked out. As if perfectly coordinated, Aeris could just hear the increasingly deafening footsteps of her rival Tifa entering the room. Aeris struggled to drag Cloud's body under the couch, and she dropped to her knees breathless behind a couch leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched Tifa's movements with appropriate caution; carefully shifting her and Cloud's bodies so that the couch leg always blocked her sight of them. She cursed under her breath as Tifa blocked their exit under the main door, and this immediately spelled their impending capture. It would only be a matter of time before she would find them, and their only salvation was the shrinking materia. Aeris blindly groped in her pocket for the orb, and upon finding it missing she gasped, her eyes desperately scouring the floor for any sign of it. Her eyes fell upon it, some 20m (respectively) from the position where she sat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAeris considering running for it many times over, but each time she reached the conclusion that she would be seen. Even if she could retrieve it, it would be a few minutes before she had the strength to use it, and Tifa could easily find her and rid her of it in that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued to observe Tifa's movements carefully, waiting for the opportune moment to rush for the materia. As Tifa knelt down to look behind the table on the opposite side of the couch, Aeris took her chance; she ran as hard and fast as she could, not wavering or hesitating to any sound she heard, her eyes fixed upon the materia. As she neared it she reached out her hand in anticipation, and dived upon it, sparing not a second to grab it. As she did however, a voice shattered her salvation.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found you.....\" </span></div></div>",

Quickly she ran from her exposed position in the middle of the room to hide behind the leg of a stool, as she anticipated Tifa would probably attempt to find her aswell. To her surprise, Tifa seemed more entertained by the unconscious, and still fairly aroused, little soldier and seemed to display little interest in finding Aeris or the troublesome materia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose i should almost thank the little flower girl for this. I really hit the jackpot here.\" Tifa said, more to herself than anybody else. Her long slender fingers were already stroking over Cloud's tiny body, and she grinned as she padded his small bulge in his pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill enthralled by her newly found little toy, Tifa strolled out of the room beyond Aeris' sight, where she plotted to give Cloud a great sight to wake up to. As the door closed, a click sounded the end of Aeris' best laid plans to reclaim Cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAeris cursed her stupidity; she had played right into Tifa's hands and now Cloud was in every facet hers. Now that the door was locked, she could not regrow herself and follow Tifa to retrieve Cloud. Remaining small to climb under the door then regrow herself would not work, as there would be a length of time where she was too weak to shink Tifa, and she would certainly be physically overpowered in that time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer only option was to remain small, and get close enough to Tifa to shrink her, but how could she do it? She was not especially fast or stealthy, so she may well be caught. She could very well miss or hit Cloud by accident, and to compound matters she would have to be VERY close to Tifa for the spell to have significant affect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was broken from her thoughts by a sound coming through the door. She cringed, and then ran underneath; she would not give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last he had remembered, Cloud had been engaged in the mental conflict of sex with the most alluring and sensual woman on the planet, as well as fighting desire for the sweet flower girl he so admired and cared about. After a flash of white light and what surely must have been a hallucination of the tiny Aeris clambouring over his crotch, he remembered passing out. <br>\r\nHe woke in a slight daze, a light overhead hazing his vision. He tried to raise his arms to shield his eyes, but the seemed pinned in a spread eagle fashion above him, he found his legs the same. A gentle breeze from above brought to life he was completely naked and notably aroused, and a giant shadow soon swept over him. He recognised where he was immediately...</span></div></div>",

Then a thought hit her and she smiled to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they go for a walk in the garden, i can shrink them without anyone ever knowing... it's perfect\" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was drawn from her thoughts instantaneously as the ground under her shifted. She clung tightly to the material below her, the inside of Tifa's miniskirt, but she could not hold herself for long. She tumbled the length of her legs but luckily wedged herself in her sock. Aeris smiled again at her good forture and settled herself in for the walk, anxious to have her way, whatever it would take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa and Cloud stood from their table and walked out of the Cafe and into the nearby gardens. Tifa's lusty actions had had little affect on Cloud, as they had either soared over his head or he wasn't interested. Tifa was not going to resign herself yet, she dearly loved Cloud and it had seemed to come down to a race between her and Aeris. Tonight prooved in Tifa's mind that she had the upper hand; she had the evening alone with Cloud, while Aeris had only the day. Tifa smiled to herself a little as they wandered through the moonlit gardens, and she subtly took Cloud's hand in her own, much to the displeasure of her tiny competitor who could do nothing but observe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tifa was just noticing the cold that evening, she realised she had forgotten her gloves back at the Cafe. She cursed her idiocy, but thought it best to retrieve them, they had not gone far afterall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"erm, excuse me for a minute please Cloud. i forgot my gloves at the Cafe.\" Tifa said, and Cloud merely nodded in response. <br>\r\n\"I'll wait here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa smiled and ran off, valuing every second she could have alone with Cloud. She did not notice Aeris drop from her shoe to the ground, and unknown to her Aeris had been granted the prime opportunity of the evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud waited patiently for Tifa, but after hardly a few seconds he noticed a blaring light from the ground below him, which rose up to him in a flash. As his vision cleared, he found himself face to face with blades of grass that were formerly underfoot. As if that hadn't surprised him enough, when his eyes met Aeris clambering through the grass his jaw fell. He hurridly put 2 and 2 together, and assumed that this was what she had meant by being 'undetected.' It turns out she was right after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAeris smiled as she approached Cloud, but she was still troubled by his actions that evening. He hadn't exactly been coming onto Tifa, but he seemed to have been enjoying the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Cloud\" she said, \"looks like i got past the both of you undetected, and i must say your fidelity record seems to be somewhat in danger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud just stood eyes wide open and stammered an incoherent sentence, to which Aeris frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You find her attractive don't you...?\" she said, more to herself than anyone else, \"well what is it about her hmm? her toned figure? her smooth black hair? her smooth white legs? or the obvious choice, her unmanagable chest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAeris was only building up her anger as she continued, and Cloud just stood silently, every word cutting him deeply. By the end Aeris had tears welling in her eyes and her whole body shook with anguish. She ripped the materia again from her pocket and prepared to cast it again...</span></div></div>",

With only confidence as her foothole, she began the near vertical climb up Cloud's leg to the seats; sadly her materia was short range, and she practically had to be touching the target before she could successfully cast her spell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin crept across Aeris' face as she began to realise her own success; she was about to humiliate the man whom she both loved and loathed, and the woman who's soul life purpose seemed to result in taking Aeris' happiness. She completed the climb in good time, trying her best to both conserve energy and remain unseen, and proceeded to approach Tifa's massive toned thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dilemma then struck her as to how she would carry out the final and most vital step of her plan; shrinking the pair and escaping with ease. Her magical strength would permit her to cast only a single spell on one person without needing to recooperate. The first hit was vital, if she missed she would surely fail. Even if she hit, if she was caught then she would ultimately fail too. Her decision to shrink Tifa was easily justified; Tifa was more of a danger to her at normal size than Cloud was, and Cloud could easily be swayed if he caught her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe recalculated every step of the plan in her head as she continued to creep towards Tifa's enormous body; shrink Tifa, immediately duck for cover back in Cloud's shoe, rest, grow, return, shrink Cloud. It all seemed so simple and flawless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deep breath, Aeris pulled the materia from her pocket, held one palm against Tifa's bare skin, and waited for her one shot. Her eyes gazed upwards, paying particular mind to the couple's gaze. The moment came when Cloud seemed distracted by a noise behind him and he turned from Tifa. In an instant a bright light engulfed Tifa, and she dwindled instantaneously, without even the chance to scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa stumbled on unfamiliar ground, partially blinded by an incredible flash of light. The ground where she stood was slightly giving, and as her vision returned the sight of the very padded seat she had been sitting on transpired to be her new underfoot. Her mind raced, and her eyes darted, quickly taking in her surroundings; she estimated her height at only a couple of inches high, judging by the visible material textures of the seating and relative distances, her eyes looked longingly at the now enormous Cloud, who seemed bewildered at Tifa's disappearance, yet his sight had not yet fallen upon her. Finally her eyes saw a figure in a pink dress running across the seating towards Cloud. In less time than it had taken her to shrink, Tifa pieced together the puzzle, and with her teeth gritted in anger, she charged at full pelt towards the unsuspecting flower girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAeris' sight was still returning as she ran towards the sanctuary of Cloud's shoe. The plan went well, Tifa had shrunk, Cloud had not noticed yet, and the last she saw Tifa she was still stumbling blindly. Her overconfident smirk was quickly shatted when an unseen weight collided roughly with her back and rammed her into the ground hard. She slowly raised herself to see the shrunken fighter charging at her for a second time, this time managing to grapple the tiny flower girl in an armlock. Still flourishing with anger Tifa twisted the far weaker girl's arm under she screamed and tears well in her eyes. A wild swing of Aeris' elbow managed to connect with Tifa's shoulder and sprawled the two apart. However, as the two both raised themselves and prepared to scuffle again....</span></div></div>",

The three sat silently in a stalemate for what seemed like minutes, until Cloud slowly withdrew his hand and leaned closer to see the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aeris..... Tifa?\" Cloud whispered, still somewhat in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa was quick to respond. \"It's all her fault Cloud!

Assuring that there was no harmful intent, Cloud flattened his palm and extended it out to Aeris. She hesitated a moment before gingerly climbing onto his palm.

Neither of them needed to speak, as they both comprehended fully what motives had driven them to these situations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me the materia Aeris.\" Cloud finally said, after a prolonged period of silence. Aeris nodded and held out the materia in her hand, while Cloud gently lowered Tifa to the seat and carefully grabbed the tiny orb, which soon expanded to suit Cloud's size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cloud quickly grow me back!\", Tifa exclaimed, now grabbing at the fabric of Cloud's pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Cloud\", responded Aeris, \"You can't grow her back, there's no telling what she would try and do to either of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa's eyes flashed with rage, and Cloud interupted her before what he feared would be a second fight, \"I cannot grow either of you first, since neither of you trust each other. Until you two learn to cope, you will both have to stay like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAeris calmly accepted her fate, but Tifa was more opposed, \"No Cloud no! You can't do that to me!\" She had no climbed atop Cloud's leg and was screaming up towards him, \"This whole thing was her fault, why should I be punished for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Tifa, it's the only fair way\", Cloud responded as he gently picked up Tifa and brought her up to his face, \"but don't worry, I'll keep you both with me all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa smiled and leapt forward to hug Cloud. Her arms wrapped around the bridge of his nose and her ample chest was thrust against his face. Cloud gently removed her and set about leaving the restaurant, placing each of the tiny women in one pocket.

Her black boots clicked upon the cold tile floor. The whole building had the odd feeling of a sanctuary of sorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRinoa shook her head, 'A whole class on just squishing monsters. Lots of good it would do against anyone else with magical powers. They could still lash out at me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stepped outside into one of many student areas, sunlight poured over her soft pale skin and the marble like walls and floor shone like metal in it's peaceful glow. Birds chirped high above in the trees. All was as it should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rinoa! Oh thank goodness you're here!\" Valus said as he scampered up the stairs to the dark haired girl as her blue, trenchcoat like vest bloomed in the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Here we go,' Rinoa thought, seeing the out of breath nerd stumbling toward her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValus was dressed in his usual. Baggy light green clothes and a dark green vest. Nothing special really, but it did go well with his short blonde hair. His oval rimmed glasses looked sort of awkward, but they seemed to fit in with his array of freckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I got you some nice flowers!\" He held up a handful that had been thrashed during his attempt to run up to her, \"I'm here to help out with your homework too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, homework?\" Rinoa echoed. \"I don't really have any Valus. I hope you understand, but I don't think I'll have time to stay around today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRinoa began to walk down the stairs. Following with a quick stumble, Valus grabbed her arm gently and looked up into her eyes. He was the same height as her, but had stopped currently a little hunched over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't we just sit for a minute or two at a bench and I'll help you a bit? You know I'm pretty smart. I know you are too. Sometimes the teachers here are kind of unclear. I did help you pass that test!\" Valus rambled off, reminding Rinoa of her Chocobo colors exam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a heavy sigh, \"Fine Valus, but only for a little bit. It was boring enough as it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boring?\" Valus asked as he eagerly sat next to the beautiful girl he had such a crush on, \"Why was it boring? What was it about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mini. Stupid spell. Waste of magical energies if you ask me when a direct attack could work better,\" Rinoa said, leaning back against the bench and drinking in the sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friend struggled for a reply that may help to make her day better. Finally he blurted out, \"What if it wasn't in combat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRinoa's eyes fluttered open. A confused look crossed her face as she looked over at Valus, \"You mean, like for a covert mission?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! Think about it this way. You shrink someone and no one else sees it, no one would know what happened! You could even step on that person and chances are, after death 'mini' wouldn't undo itself. Wipe off the mess and move on to the next guard.\" Valus offered, half looking down at Rinoa's short boots, almost in comtemplation it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRinoa slowly grinned, \"Maybe you're right Valus.\"</span></div></div>",

Laughing nervously he said, \"Yeah, imagine that. Even worse with your boots off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't go over too well. Rinoa jumped to her feet and glared down at Valus, whom she had already written off as paste under her foot anyway, \"What's that suppose to mean?\" She growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Valus was startled, staring up at her he adjusted his glasses, \"I just meant that you always have those boots on, it must get kinda warm in there.

Rinoa was staring right back, eyes locked on to his tiny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to help with my homework. Now you are! I think I learned pretty well in class today. But the target isn't suppose to get so small! Oh well,\" Rinoa mused as she sat down with her big black boots positioned on either side of the miniature nerd and began unlacing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValus stumbled out onto the path and tripped over. Turning around her sat back, supporting himself with his arms outstretched behind him as he gazed up at the giant girl he desired so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed as she watched him, \"Don't worry.

The soft lines from her socks still left a light impression on her pale feet as the two bare soles touched down on the warm gritty ground before Valus.

He felt some excitement in the fact that he was about to feel her skin pressed all over his tiny body, yet her intentions left that feeling in a cold chill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Valus, it will all be over soon. My soft sole will wrap down around your body. Soft wrinkles folding down over your struggling form. Finally in the end, I'll just carelessly step forward and you'll go flat against the ground as my damp sole pressed to the path. You shouldn't have run. I may have let you live or at least die with dignity instead of being under my sweaty foot. Goodbye,\" Rinoa calmly explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's just what she did. The soft pale foot felt warm against Valus skin as his hands reached up to meet to plush surface of her sole. He was surprised when he found that he could actually push the wrinkes up a little. Almost like big heavy curtains that hung low from her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must have wiggled her toes a bit, as the wrinkled sole above him became a flat layer of descending flesh. As it touched down, pinning Valus flat to the ground, she clenched her toes. Wrinkles grabbed at Valus from all around. He coughed as the moist flesh gulped him up in its almost gooey embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the pressure began to mount and after a moment where it felt like his ribs were about to crack, the world seemed to crash down on Valus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRinoa only spent a moment wiping him off in the nearby grass.

After Tidus came back Yuna was occupied with him, and Paine really wasn't much fun anymore, either. Now she was just looking for some way to pass the time. There weren't really major threats on the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, why doesn't anybody have any good spheres anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRikku was starting to get frustrated after an hour of looking, when she suddenly stumbles upon something lying barely past the ocean's reach. It was of a turquoise shade (camouflaged in a way), but was still round and possessing of a certain greenish glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wowie,\" Rikku whispered, picking the sphere up. \"This isn't like anything I've seen before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, a stream of light shot out from the center of the sphere, and tiny words formed on the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am the ultimate power sphere. Your desire binds us together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Desire?\" Rikku said out loud. \"All I really want is to keep Spira safe. Can you help with that?\" She looked silly asking questions to an inaminate object, especially when it didn't answer back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked away from the water with the sphere in hand.

She figured it was a trick or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't. Rikku felt her body tingle like a shiver. Except this shiver was quite pleasurable. She felt her blood vessels running fast, channeling energy all throughout her body. She felt stronger, as in really strong. Then she noticed the rock wall behind her was lowering, from fifteen feet tall to about ten. Rikku felt her clothes tightening, particularly her yellow bikini top as her breasts stretched out. Her green skirt ripped in two, and her shoes literlly fell apart at the seams. Then, the top snapped and her breats poured out. Rikku, in a notion of modesty, cupped her hands over them. It felt good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God,\" Rikku said in a whisper, though at probably came across as a full voice. She was over nine feet tall! She was almost suffocating under what little clothing (her yellow bikini bottom) remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel...great! I've never felt so great!\" Still covering her breasts she glanced down at her body, shaking her ass and enjoying the view of her tan legs stretching for practically forever. She felt so powerful, more than ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she couldn't stay like this...people would worry, wouldn't they? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Rikku do?</span></div></div>",
