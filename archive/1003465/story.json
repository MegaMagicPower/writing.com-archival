His body is well scuplted from a 6 pack to his pecs. He was the quarterback of his highschool which required him to stay in shape but now it was summer and he was ready to kick back from the long year.<br>\r\n     His mom walks in from the front door carrying grocery-bags full of junk food.<br>\r\n\"Honey can you get the rest of the bags from the car.\" She asks<br>\r\n\"I am tired mom and it is summer.\" <br>\r\n\"Ya and all you have done this week is sit in front of that damn tv. you need to get up and active.\"<br>\r\n\"Ya, whatever.\" He responds flipping through the channels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~1 week later~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan was again sitting in front of the tv, but in his room this time eating some brownies and drinking a beer. He hasnt done anything all week except gone to a party. He leans back in his bed streched out staring at the tv when his phone rings.<br>\r\n\"Hello\"<br>\r\n\"Hey,Jonathan, it's me Tom, me and a few people are going to the beach today wanna come...well be there at 1.?\"<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh sure let em get ready and I will met you up there.\"<br>\r\nHe hangs up the phone and gets off his bed and finds his bathing suit. He slips them on and fasens the button.<br>\r\n\"Man these are a bit tight.\" he says as he walks in to he bathroom. He looks into the mirror and flexes his stomach to reviel a full 6 pack, but the bottom 2 are almost none apperent.<br>\r\n\"They must have shrunk or something.\"<br>\r\nAs he relaxes he stomach a tiny roll of fat pouches over the waistline and his abs are covered in a small film of fat.<br>\r\nHe steps on the scale in the bathroom and it rolls up to 178.<br>\r\n\"Man I must have put on some muscle or something\"<br>\r\nSo he </span></div></div>",

No one has noticed the slight suggestion of a curve resting on his hip bone, the slight softness under his navel or the general ripeness his body exudes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jon is completely conscious of it, of every line of his body. At first. So he pulls out a paper plate, fills it halfway with oily potatoes, the closest thing to a diet food. Meanwhile his friends fill up. Everyone is athletic, thin really, but no one has a body like Jon had. On the most fit guys, the most carefree, the most masculine, there's a layer of lively flesh that arcs over the v of their hips or their bathing suits. But some of the others have filled out, their tan stomachs round and completely smooth except for a hairy trail down the middle and a deep belly button. These latter are constantly touching their stomachs, waving at them, attempting to hide it , but their nervous looks only emphasize the round redness of their cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon finished his potatos and took another and then another. They were just potatoes, and so no one noticed his rapidly increasing appetite and Jon lost conciousness of the gentle creep of his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the other guys went to toss around a football. The girls went to watch, to scamper about, to compare their own meager bodies with the virility of their counterparts'. With no one to watch, Jon filled his plate, and then another. He tore off fried edges with abandon, shoved down brownies, refused to count calories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went up for his sixth serving, his heart racing and then a shot of adrenaline when he realized the food was finished. Only crumbs at the bottom of those tins. He still couldn't resist, dipped his finger in the grease picked up some crumbs and licked his finger. With the same hand he adjusted his bathing suit, which had slowly lost its parallel course along the top of his light blue shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon touched his stomach, which had neevr seemed fuller. Looking over his shoulder at the game, hearing the shouts of his friends, Jon was embarrassed. He waded in th pool for five minutes, then, afraid someone might see him when he inevitably had to leave, pulled on a shirt, which wet, clung to his body. He excused himself, blamed his mom, drove home, hand on his stomach.</span></div></div>",

After minutes of struggling, Jon was able to zip his work pants &amp; button them. He glanced up at his mirror &amp; noticed himself in a different way.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly was sticking out further than usual while his face seem to plump up alittle bit. \"Ahh it's probably just water weight,\" Jon thought to himself as he patted his newly but growing belly.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just to be on the safe side, I'll hop on the scale to find out how I weigh now,\" he told himself. Jon steps on the scale watching the dial past 178 lbs which was his weight last month. The dial finally stops at 198 lbs.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"198 lbs'\" he said shocked! \"I've gained 20 lbs since I started at Burger King one month ago but I still have another month &amp; a half till college,\" he thought.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe by the time college starts, I'll be back down in the mid 170's,\" he said optimistically.

His mom even went so far as to say to him, \"I think all the sitting around you do is really starting to show up.  Look at yourself!\"  Sure enough as she said it, Jon had a plate of mozzerella sticks resting on his belly, which had grown a bit since the beach party.  All water activities or anything that required him to take his shirt off he avoided because of his self consciousness.  In about a week, he had put on a good 5 pounds and last night, weighted himself at 184, meaning that in the first few weeks of summer, he had put on 9 pounds.  His abs barely showed and love handles were appearing.  a juicy fat roll sat on the waist of his board shorts.  It was a 9 pound spare tire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"You need to get out of this house, and find something to do with yourself very soon Jonathan,\" declared his mom</span></div></div>",

His buddy from football, Jake, and his former neighbor and friend Tim all were going together to Mexico.  He was excited, because Jake was an awesome person to hang out with, plus the two of them could always guarantee a few chicks.  Jake was 5'11\" tall, chicks always went for him because he was very good looking and had a good looking european face, even though he didn't have the killer body Jon used to have, he wasn't too shabby.  He had a slight belly and softer features but muscles definitely showed.  He was Italian and always down for a good meal, which Jon liked too.  Tim and Jon grew up together in their neighborhood.  Tim was a funny kid because he hated sports but he was a monster at 6'6\" tall and about 220 pounds.  He was 21 and a lot older than Jon but tehy were friends anyway, and spent his day smoking pot at his own place and beign reclusinve.  He was a total slob and very lazy, and had a very deep baritone voice.  But boy could that kid eat.  He ate like a machine, and could put away more liquor than anyone Jon knew.  He had big huge shoulders and a good sized beer belly from his big-time appetite, especially from being a pothead and all.  His giant features were softened by extra heft he carried, including a big bubble but that he constantly used with his sitting around all the time.  And he had a lot of scruffy facial hair that he didnt like to take care of.  What a  group of people.</span></div></div>",

When Jon took off his shirt, Jake was quick to mention, \"well, it looks like you've been eating since they football days!\" he said with a smile.  John rubbed his belly and said, \"its no problem to lose this, besides were on vaca, we have to eat well.\"  \"I agree, Tim bellowed, \"if I hear one of you two talk about fitness or nutrition on this trip, youll be out cold.

But you have to eat everything on your plate and no breaks for more room!\" Jon agreed because Natalie was a very beautiful girl and he would do anything to at least get a date with her.

Are you man?\" John said. \"Yeah!\"Matt said surprised. He called the local pizzeria and ordered 5 pizzas. Then he called the Chinese place down the street and ordered ten meals. Half an hour later the pizza arrived and Matt payed then they began digging in. Fifteen minutes later The Chinese arrived and they noticed they had eaten one whole large pizza. Matt payed then continued eating. By the end of three movies all the food was gone! Matt had eaten quite a lot, but John did a good job keeping up. They fell asleep. In the morning John woke up to find Matt's hand on his chubby waist. John got up and say that his gut hung far over his underwear and that when he put on his clothes the button hardly buttoned, they were tight pants to show off his once tight body, but none the less they were way to small now for his thick thighs and bulging belly. Matt's clothes didn't fit Matt at all so he went and got bigger clothes from his room. John wondered if Matt had been expecting to gain weight, but he didn't think about it long because he was starving. <br>\r\n     Matt and John decided to go to the downtown all you can eat buffet. Just before they left Matt's parents called and told him that they were going on a cruise and wouldn't be home for another month. \"Awesome!\" Matt yelled as he hung up the phone,\"My parents won't be home for another month! Do you think you could stay over that long?\" John called his mom and asked she said it was fine, he's eighteen and can make his own choices. \"Yeah man this is going to be awesome!\" Matt and John headed off to the buffet.   </span></div></div>",

Early in the morning, he would wake up hungry, and search the boxes in the room for remaining edibles for an early morning snack.  The elbow that had rolled into Matt's midriff had been encountering less and less muscle as the two weeks went on - Matt's parents, away on a cruise, had left Matt with lots of money that he spent on ever-longer trips to buffets by him and Jon and on ever-increasing amounts of food for their evening movie screenings.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt hadn't exactly been skinny when he first asked Jon to stay over - a few months layoff from football had seen to that - but now the two friends, running back and quarterback, were speding the summer rapidly growing to lineman size!

He didn't even want to think about doing anything more strenuous than sitting in front of the television for several hours.  A look over at Jon, who was focusing on the screen through heavily lidded eyes, made it pretty clear that Matt wasn't the only one who was content to spend the day lazing around.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there isn't exactly a dress code around here.  I've seen you in less than your boxers in the changing room over the years,\" he said with a grin.  \"Besides, I've got plenty of extra lounge wear that you're welcome to.

Don't take much convincing to keep me in this nice, warm bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince their \"breakfast\" had come at what was lunchtime for most other people, they were just awakening from their food induced slothfulness in time for dinner.  Even after finishing several pizzas a piece, both Matt and Jon were well aware of the grumbling of their stomachs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Jon said from his spot on the bed, \"are we doing takeout again or you feeling up to going out somewhere?\"</span></div></div>",

Without anywhere to go, it had to have been at least three days since the last time Jon had even considered changing his clothes, much less actually hitting the showers.  Now that he was thinking about it he noticed that he was starting to get a bit ripe and that he could probably use a shave, but what was the point of going through all that hassle when they weren't even gonna leave the car?  The only one who would possibly notice was Matt, and he was looking just as scruffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, throw me a shirt man,\" Jon yelled as he levered himself out of the bed with a groan.

You're gonna have to make due.\"  The shirt Matt had chosen didn't quite cover his furry paunch completely, leaving an inch or so exposed for all to see, and it looked like there were stains beneath the arms.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no.  Hope it doesn't ruin my outfit,\" he said, rolling his eyes.  As he pulled the wifebeater into place, Jon realized that he wasn't exactly in a better position.  There was a large grease stain over his gut where a slice of pizza had been dropped.

It's the first time we've been able to relax, we deserve it.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Jon replied,\"but no more fat jokes.\"<br>\r\n\"Fine Jon, but hey what's a few pounds for a football player? We need the weight anyway.\"<br>\r\nComforted by the care-free attitude of his fellow sportsmen Jon set about to enjoying the beach. He wasn't really out of shape, his abs were still obvious despite the nearly non-existent layer of fat growing on them. His pecs and arms wre still toned and his legs had never been better. The biggest problem in his appearance was the untrimmed beard he had started growing, being too laay to shave.<br>\r\nAfter a few games, and as the sun ascended in the sky, everyone decided to take a break and bring out the food that had been kept in coolers until now. After holding himself in check for a short minute, Jon went at the food with enthusiastic gusto taking comfort in his friends also pigging out. His first dish containing nothing but a small sandwich, Jon soon went up for seconds. He added a little bit more to his plate this time, taking three hotdogs that they had grilled loaded with toppings along with a hamburger. Upon finishing his second plate, Jon piled his third with heapings of whatever he could lay his hands on. Having finished the third faster than either of the first two he went up for another. He justified it to himself saying that his first hadn't been big enough to count.<br>\r\nThrough all of this Jon remained oblivious to his body and the few stares sent in his direction. He put off all gazing eyes off as admiring hsi still stunning body. unfortunately for him everyone else was very much aware of his body due to his decidedly bad choice of a speedo as swimwear. They took no note of his sandwich but after his second plate he had a noticable curve, not big but noticeable. His third plate filled his curve out making it much more portruding heavily. His final plate filled his gut, satiating its now expanding stomach. His gut had become extremely noticeable and nearly everyone's eyes flicked over commonly in at least passing interest. His belly had started out almost entirely non-existent but by this time it was clearly evident. It even stretched his speedo out testing its elasticity.<br>\r\nLetting out a satisfied belch jon patted his stomach. Feeling hsi gut sticking out over his speedo instantly brought him back to the world. Looking down he was shocked to see that he could no longer see the front of his speedo, and noticed the heavily strained sides. It was then that he saw everyone's eyes, flicking to and away from his gut or just outright stares.<br>\r\nAs he felt the heat growing in his cheeks Jon......</span></div></div>",

He put his shoes on and checked his watch. It was still only a quarter after one and he felt a little hungry.<br>\r\n\"Man must have really worked up an appetite swimming this morning.\" Jon thought to himself. \"Well might as well eat a little now before I end up pigging out like I did earlier.

Finally he took it off and his gut spilled out a little over his pants.  He opened the door and walked outside.  He put his wifebeater back on but he noticed something different.

He went into the kitchen and got 2 beer bottles.  He began eating the brownies, soon enough he finished all 15 of them.  He put the box aside and took a swig off beer tho wash it all down.

He looked down to see his gut resting on his lap in front of him.  It was round but not that soft it had shape to it.  He continued eating and finished the pie, he opened the second beer bottle and drank half of it.  After finishing all 12 cupcakes and the beer Jon figured he ate about 3 pounds of food.

Jon ate it andit tasted great, then Jon's stomach let out a growl that was atleast a 4 on the richtor scale.  After hearing that Silgi brought Jon a platter of brownies.  Jon ate the brownies like a starved animal, but the more he ate the hungrier he felt.  Then Silgi took a box down from it's neat little stack.  He opens it and takes out a tray of hamburgers, and handed them to Jon.  Jon began eating one and before he knew it he finished all 20 in under 5 minutes.  Suddenly Jon stomach felt very tight and ready to explode, but he felt as if he could eat an entire grocery store.  He rubbed his stomach to soothe the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take this\" said Silgi handing Jon a pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon ate it like he did everything else.  Then his stomach felt better, he could feel his skin loosen up a bit in order for him to eat more.  Silgi opened another box and took out enough food for 10 people.  Jon ate all the food and kept eating, he kept eating for another two hours until he finally couldn't fit anymore food in him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still hungry\" Jon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once you eat some normal food you won't\" said Silgi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normal food?\" asked Jon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean..uhh food without my special spice\" said Silgi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon suddenly heard a creaking noise, under his immense eating weight the wooden chair broke.

Jonathan, on the other hand, had no interest in working out at this point in the summer but ordered food anyhow.  Twice a day he would rest the food on his little belly and eat heartily.  After two weeks of this, he had put on ten pounds  of fat.  His stomach now had one roll that folded over his board shorts when he sat, and when he stood, his deeply tanned stomach revealed that it was well fed, showing a curvier stomach that portruded slightly.  His V shpe was still there but less severe.  His whole body was less severe-looking, softened by the layer of fat he had put on by enjoying his food and his lounging to the fullest.  He now weighed in at about 187, a 12 pounds gain in 3 1/2 weeks.  It looked delicious on his big pecs, and big arms that he used to send a football soaring, and a nice butt that totally filled out his board shorts.  His very fitted T-shirts also revealed a healthy, happy boy that ate well.</span></div></div>",

She was in a car accident last night and her back is all out of wack.  She can't do anything for herself!  To top it all off, her husband Steve is still away on a bussiness trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....what's the catch?\"  asked Jon as his stomach rumbled.   He was so hungry he had a sharp pain in his gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the catch is that there's no one else to look after her but me.  I know you leave in for college in three weeks, and I'm sorry I have to do this to our last summer...\"  she trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom seriously, don't worry about it.   I'll be fine!  And it's not like I'm not ever gonna call you or come see you.  I mean, I'm just going up the road a few hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know dear,\" Jonathan's mom said as she seemed to pull herself together.  \"Well, I'll be gone for 18 days.   And then I'll be back to help get all your things off and ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she handed him $300.  \"Now be careful with this money.  I want you to enjoy your last few weeks here, but I don't want you going crazy and spending it all on food now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would never do that!\"  Jon said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right, just make sure you have enough to do whatever you need and there are plenty of leftovers in the fridge, so don't be shy.  Alright dear, I hate to be in a rush, but your aunt needed me 6 hours ago.  Love you dear.

'So what if I'm a little bigger than I used to be,' he thought, 'at least I know how to have a good time.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached in for another wing only to discover that he had eaten all 40.  The nachos were pretty much demolished as well.  'Wow' he thought.  'where did all that go?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he wasn't exactly starving anymore, he wasn't quite full yet either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he got the perfect idea:  MILKSHAKE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon went into the kitchen and retrieved a blinder, the (very newly replenished) vanilla ice cream  (his mom had got three different flavored gallons of icecream, but Jon doubted that would be enough for 3 weeks.), the whole milk and the thing of chocalate syrup.  After blending the whole thing up he had quite the masterpeice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed a spoon, stuck a straw in the very full blender and took his extra large milk shake back to the living room to resume his same station of eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the phone rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Who could that be?'  he thought with annoyance.  He had just sit down, and now he had to hoist himself back up again? <br>\r\nWith a little effort, he got up and answered the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\"  he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jon?  This is your bro...Kyle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh heeey Kyle!!  What's happening?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle had also been on the football team with Kyle, except he had always been a lineman.  He was never fat in high school, but he was very thick and built and had always had a little soft tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing at all man!  I haven't done jack-shit all summer!  Except sit on my ass and play video games!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"haha, sounds kind of similar to mine.\"  Jon said, sipping his milkshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just thinking man, I haven't seen you all summer....and we're both leaving for college soon...  Let's hang out!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely!\"  said Jon.  Though he wouldn't have wanted just anyone coming over, Kyle was someone who he knew would not judge him for \"kicking back\" these last few months.  \"Why don't you come over right now??  My mom left for the next 18 days man!  I got the house to myself!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude.  Hell.  Yes.  Give me an hour, and I can totally get my hands on a 30 pack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and bring some snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snacks?.....what for?\"  asked Kyle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better question Kyle.  Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touche friend, touche,\"  laughed Kyle.  \"alright man, I'll see you in about an hour with a 30 pack and some awesome snackage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet.  Later man\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon hung up the phone and sat back down.   He was excited to see Kyle, it really had been a long time.  He went to take another sip of his milkshake only to hear the loud sound of and empty liquid through a straw.  He had drank the entire blender-full.<br>\r\n'Not again...' he thought.  'Oh well...I should get dressed now anyways.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went up to his room and changed into a pair of his 36\" cacki shorts (which looked suctioned onto his body.  The button was straining against his much larger belly, and his flabby torso tended to flop over the pants on every side) 'These aren't going to work for very much longer...' he thought.  And also grabbed a medium white T-shirt (which clung to his ever-softening and widening curves making his every role apparent for any eye to see).  'Looks like I'm going to need a new wardrobe soon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he went downstairs there was a knock at the door.<br>\r\nHe opened to find his old buddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KYLE!!\"  he yelled as he looked at:</span></div></div>",

He had a complete and total baby face, that happened to be very expressionate at times.  He was about 6'1\", but Jon noticed a small difference in his body.  It looked as if Kyle had gained a little bit of weight judging by his newly gained belly.  It wasn't too noticeable, but quite apparent if you had seen the Kyle of last football season.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends shook hands then embraced in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammmn,\" said Kyle, \"looks like you have been living it up!!\"  he said as he slapped Jon's belly, sending ripples around his body that could be seen through his shirt.  \"you know they make bigger clothes than what you've got on...right?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\"  yelled Jon, pushing Kyle back some.  But to surprise, his chest seemed much softer than usual.  \"Looks like I'm not the only one porkin' out!\"  he said, pinching Kyle's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yeah, well at least I have clothes that fit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon knew he was right about that.  He looked absolutely rediculous being almost 3 sizes too big for his clothes.  \"Well not all of us can afford knew clothes!\"  Jon wasn't going to say anything about the $300, but knew that the majority would be going to food instead of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's cool man,\" said Kyle as he put the 30 pack along with three other bags on the counter, \"I'll go get some of my clothes later.   They should definately fit your chubby ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP!!\"  yelled Jon as he punched Kyle in the arm.  \"This is my summer off and I'm aloud to do whatever I want...and that includes eating!  Plus you know the ladies love more pushin' for the cushion!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah....whatever you say man..  Now check out this sweet snackage!\"  Kyle started to unpack the bags pulling out 2 full packs of Double Stuffed Oreos, a big bag of Cheetos and a big bag of BBQ Ruffles, a box of Ding Dongs, 2 large bags of powdered donuts, and a box of 38 assorted candy bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a feast!!\"  said Jon as he opened one of the bags of donuts and started digging in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus, I have some extra money, so we can totally go to McDonalds later.  If you're still hungry that is.\"  Kyle smiled.  He couldn't help but love that Jon had gained so much weight.  It made him want to get Jon to gain as much weight as he could, (not to mention put on some more pounds himself).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two old friends opened their beers and sat down, they began to fill each other in on their crazy summers.  And while one of them was talking the other was putting one fattening treat into his mouth after another.<br>\r\nAfter about 7 bears each and more than half of the snacks there was a loud pop.<br>\r\nJon's button had flown off, causing his pants to spread apart as his huge belly expanded onto his lap.<br>\r\nAfter a moment of silence, the two friends bursted into somewhat buzzed laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so huge!\"  Jon said, grabbing his gut.  \"Look at this monster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nothing!!\"  said Kyle, \"Check this bad boy out!\"<br>\r\nHe took his shirt off to reveal a big belly consisting of three large fat rolls and love handles which actually hung over his jeans.  \"and what's crazy...\"  said Kyle, \"is that I'm still hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\"  me too!!!\"  said Jon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what we can do.  Let's order pizzas!  I'm pretty sure there still open.  And we can get two each!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three each!!\"  said Jon, upping the stakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really??  Then let's make it interesting.  4 pizzas each.  All of them large.  The first one to finish gets to make the other one make, buy or prepare whatever kind of food he wants to eat for a whole week.  Kind of like a food slave.  The winner gets to eat WHATEVER HE WANTS!  Deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon thought about it for a second, he was getting chunky.  But at the same time Kyle had offered to bring him bigger clothes + he wanted to be able to indulge and eat whatever he wanted for the next week + he was starving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal!\"  he said, and the two husky boys shook on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Kyle called and ordered 8 large meat lovers pizzas.  While they were waiting they ate the rest of the snacks and a few more beers, and finally the doorbell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle went to answer the door (as he had the most clothes on) and when he closed the door behind him and set down the pizzas, the competion had begun.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the weeks rolled by, the rolls set in, and the weights slammed against the rubbered floors, Jon had become an entierely different person.  He ate every single chance he got and worked out just as often.  By the remaining few weeks of summer Jon's weight had climbed to 235 pounds.  He was in complete rapture.  But, soon enough, Jon was fired from his lifeguarding job for simply being too fat and out of shape to ensure the safety of the fellow swimmers.  Up until then, Jon was just lifeguarding so he could get an enormous amount of free food and unlimited access to the weight room.  But now, Jon was without a gym, and without money to afford a gym membership.  Food, on the other hand, would still be in an almost endless supply thanks to his mother.  Without a gym, essentially without a purpose, Jon was lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith only 3 weeks left of summer, and about 60 pounds added to his frame, Jon was feeling lonely.  He had very little to do considering he had become somewhat of a recluse after eating his way into oblivion, few if any girls would want to date a fat slob, and to make matters even worse, he could not work out anymore.  To ease his loneliness, Jon took to what he knew best, eating.  Due to Jon's ever increasing appetite and his habits formed by heavy powerlifting as a lifeguard, Jon was up to consuming almost 9,000Cal a day.  Every day was the same.  Jon would lay on the couch stuffing his face all day, his mom would come home from work, walk into the living room and see Jon's 235 pound body sprawled out on the couch, clothed in a stained undershirt that did little to hide his burgeoning gut, and a pair of boxers that hugged every mound of flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite seeing this scene every single day, his mom would echo the same sentiment, \"My my Jon, you certainly are a growing boy.  I just don't know what I am going to do with you.  You are always hungry.  But that is just it, you are a growing boy, that is to be expected.\".  Then, she would walk over to him loving rub his fat gut and with a final pat or two would proudly state, \"Well, since you have been such a good boy, I got a surprise for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mouth full of chips, Jon would muffle, \"Oh yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" his mom would affirm.  \"I got you your favorite.  Two #5's from McDonald's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon's body would quiver with pleasure and he would beam, \"Oh, wow thanks mom, you didn't have to do that.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't be silly Jon, you are such a good kid, how could I not?  You never give me any trouble.  Plus, I know how much you love McDonald's.,\"  said his mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this same scene would repeat every single day.  And with that enormous amount of repetition, Jon's weight had crept to 255 pounds.  But something was different.  Where as before, Jon was always grateful for his mother's unlimited supply of food and constant gifts of delicious food, after a few weeks of being given everything he could possibly ever want, Jon became spoiled.  He expected his mother to give him whatever he wanted to eat.  He expected to always have a full fridge and a full pantry.  And being the traditional and eager to please mother his mom was, she complied lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the last week of summer, the scene had changed from his mother gifting McDonald's to an elated Jon, to an impatient and ravenous Jon sitting on the couch demanding his mother hurry up with his food.  He was a growing boy after all.  At the last day of summer Jon was teetering at 262 pounds.  He had a huge descion ahead of him though.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes he forgo college in favor of his new lifestyle, or suck it up and head of to state school?  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Most students have settled into the routine of waking up early for classes, spending their free time on their schoolwork, and saving money by eating nothing but crackers and instant noodles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon was not one of these students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon came to at about two o'clock. Like almost every day that month, he found himself on the couch in his parent's basement. A multitude of fast food wrappers covered him completely, like a blanket. This was a testament to Jon's eating abilities, because his mother had thrown away all the garbage only a few days ago. As he continued to wake up, his makeshift blanket fell away to the floor, exposing Jon's new body, only some rather dirty boxers, a size too small as well, could hide his new found fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was much flabbier than when he was lifeguarding. By now, all the muscle he built up melted away. It was nearly twenty pounds of muscle, but Jon made up for it with his now 285 pound body. The only time his belly wasn't jiggling about was when he had stuffed full to bursting. His arms, still swollen, but now without any muscle to speak of, would grow tired and heavy from simply feeding himself. If he could see past his bloated belly, Jon would have seen sausages, each leg nearly as wide as he was at his skinniest, his thighs touching nearly to his knees. Even his toes had gotten fat, though he could never see them, his visibility obstructed by his belly and, only recently, his second chin. With some difficulty, he heaved his globular ass off the couch, ignoring it's loud creaking, and made his way to breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he made his way upstairs, a task that had become more cumbersome in the passing weeks, Jon couldn't help but grumble and complain about his mother. His mother got a big promotion, with a giant pay raise, which meant that more money could go to her growing boy's happiness. The only downside was that she was given more hours, which meant she couldn't wait on him all hours of the day, something he couldn't stand. He was her only child, after all. Wasn't she supposed to put his needs first? But no, he had to haul himself up the stairs to the kitchen and eat the now cold buffet she had slaved over, for over an hour before she left in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not another thought of his mother was thought when he saw the spread. The kitchen table was weighed down by all the sausages, bacon, ham, eggs, omelettes, toast, and an entire pitcher of orange juice. Jon went into an eating frenzy, not caring that the food had been cold for hours. Over half the table was completely decimated before he even realized that his stomach, swollen and extended, was about ready to burst. He slowly waddled his way into the living room to digest, and play the new video games his mom bought him to keep him entertained. After an hour, he returned to the kitchen, finishing off breakfast, and foraging around for anything else edible. He then made his way downstairs, to the waiting glow of his new flat-screen and his second gaming system, all conveniently only a few inches from his couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his mom returned, she rushed downstairs with the bags of fast food she bought just for her son. She didn't bat an eye when he took them from her without so much as a thank you. Her boy was still growing after all. She would spend the rest of the night rushing up and down the stairs, making sure her son was always happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jon played and ate until the early hours of the morning, he found himself wondering why he would have ever wanted to leave home.</span></div></div>",

Frankly, I think you'd be a standout as a defensive lineman.  With the size of our opponents, you'd be a big enough obstacle if you did nothing but  stand  there but I'd like to see  you do  more.

Listen I'd love to chew the fat but my gut is so stuffed that I can't think straight.  I jost gotta lie down.\"<br>\r\nJon watched Bud swagger out of the donut shop then he stood up and walked over to the counter. The proptietor looked over at him and smiled.  He hadn;t had a customer like Jon before. Already Jon could feel his body storing the fat but he had a long way to go.  <br>\r\n\"I need some donuts for the road.\" he said.<br>\r\nThe proprietor smiled.  \"How many, sir?\" he asked.<br>\r\nJon paused and replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With that thought, Jon was happy he was never going to see Rachel again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jon drove home from that bizarre and awkward date, he obsessed about the status of his waistline and his recent trend of self-indulgence.  \"What is happening to me?\" he pleaded.  \"I'm always hungry, I've put on 8 pounds, I can't seem to find the motivation to workout anymore,\" he complained.

On the kitchen table was a tray of home baked chocolate chip cookies with an accompyning note reading, \"Jon, I figured you would hungry by now, and lord knows you have recently developed an insatiable sweet tooth, so, I baked these for you.  From a loving mother to a growing boy, enjoy!  Love, Mom.\"  Jon smiled and reticently reached out for a taste.  But then, Jon demanded, \"What are you doing?  You need to lose weight, not gain it!  I have to take a stand.

By the afternoon, Jon had successfully and surprisingly controlled his cravings and had consumed a modest amount of food.  Jon was beaming with pride.  He felt he deserved a reward.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the disastrous evening with Rachel, Jon felt it would be appropriate to go on a new date with a new girl to compliment and reward his new found \"self control\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who should I call?\" Jon wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does Jon call?<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Amy, athletic never miss a workout Amy, had piled on lazy summer weight herself, and at only 5'3'', the extra weight really showed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon's gaze was fixed on the new Amy.  His eyes slowly and methodically surveyed her.  Amy's chocolate brown hair was tied back in a quick and easy ponytail.  Her face looked fresh and bright and completely clear of all makeup.  Jon could not look away.  Amy's brown hair and milky white skin framed her intense azure eyes and long eyelashes perfectly.  Her button nose and full, pouty, almost wet, lips only enhanced her deep beauty while not betraying her inherent girl next door charm.  If anything, any weight that had found its way to Amy's face had only served to soften her sharp jaw line and enhance her angelic beauty.  Then, Jon's eyes broke free and drifted southward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was wearing a cardinal red t-shirt with their former high school logo and name printed across reading, \" North Hill Patriots Cheer Squad\".  While this shirt may have been loose a few months ago, it looked amply snug around Amy's new and impressively full, yet perky, breasts and her thicker waist.  Even beneath this slightly loose t-shirt, Amy's newly formed little pooch gently stretched out some of the material.  Traveling down even further, Jon saw Amy was wear a pair of navy blue track pants that did an adequate job of hiding what was beneath them while slightly indicating a healthy pair of hips were holding them up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCountless thoughts and feelings flooded Jon's mind all at once: \"Holy shit!  What the hell happened?  She is the last person I woulda . . . she doesn't look that bad.  I never would have thought . . . it's not that big of a deal, is it?  I'm just overreacting, she looks . . . wow she put on a lot of wei . . . hmmmm, she actually looks really good.  At least I know I am not the only one.  I am just overreacting.  She looks fine.  She actually looks like a normal girl now that she isn't all toned and athletic looking.  Say something . . . Say something you idiot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon quickly stammered with genuine honesty, \"Wow, Amy, you look great\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy, stroking an errant lock of thick and lustrous brown hair back over her ear, and subconsciously rubbing her tiny belly bulge, blushed, and muttered, \"Oh . . . oh thank you, Jon.  You look great yourself.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon could help but stare at the new Amy.  He probably would have kept staring if Amy had not said, \"Well come in already Jon.  What are you waiting for?\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon's concentration was finally broken and he rambled, \"Oh, sorry I was just thinking, I mean, you look really great.\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's face was now as red as her shirt and she just playfully punched him in the shoulder.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce upstairs, Amy quickly realized and apologized, \"Oh, Jon, how rude of me.  Would you like anything to drink or eat?  We have pretty much anything you could want.  Oh, and I actually have taken up baking as a bit of a hobby lately and have made some absolutely delicious, or at least I think they are delicious, brownies.\".

The main living room had an alcove with a dinette at one end with a counter at the left that separated it from the kitchen area. Amy motioned for him to sit down while she went into the kitchen to fetch the brownies.  She took two glasses from the cabinet and filled them with milk.  As she placed the container back in the refrigerator he noted that it was well stocked.  Like his own mom Amy\u2019s family obviously had not been skimming on the groceries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy put six brownies on a platter, then brought them with the milk to the table, remarking to Jon, \u201cHopefully these will serve as a good appetizer for wherever we\u2019re going for lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon swallowed hard in amazement at the casualness of her comment, then smiled as he took the first bite, which electrified his taste buds.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cthis is delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know,\u201d smiled Amy as she took a brownie for herself. \u201cSince taking up baking and cooking I\u2019ve already picked up a few pounds, but people tell me its actually not bad.  My mom and dad are actually happy so far, though mom fears it could become addictive. For now, I\u2019m just letting my body decide what it likes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d remarked Jon, \u201cI will agree that you look healthier and the most attractive I\u2019ve ever seen you.  But what about cheerleading?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood memories, but history. Practicing every day takes up time better used for other things \u2013 cheerleading in college is more demanding than in high school and for what? Frankly I\u2019m getting to enjoy cooking along with baking more than performing in front of a crowd. My brain rather than my torso is what needs developing for a career now that I\u2019m in college,\u201d she said as she began devouring her second brownie.  Jon, amazed, followed her lead.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known one another since, what, the 8th grade?  But i guess you are changing and in my opinion for the good. I agree with the mind thing but surely you can tell I\u2019ve been acquiring a few pounds myself,\u201d Jon acknowledged as he chomped into his second brownie and she reached for her milk before taking a third. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoin took a sip from his glass, watching with a pleased expression her obviously enjoying her treat that Amy duly noted.  He then continued \u201cI think the pounds I\u2019ve put on this summer should bother me, but what does my mom do? She serves up dishes like chicken alfredo for supper, then leave cookies out when I get home from dates because she knows I\u2019ve developed what she calls a summertime appetite.  With food like hers and this any weight concerns go out the window.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked him in the eye and settled her chin onto the open palm of her hand reaching up from where  her elbow ad arm were braced on the table. \u201cYou are over 6 feet tall and less than 200 pounds and fussing over your appetite, probably because of concerns over what other people might think. What would you say if I said I liked husky guys and expect to become a bit of a chubette myself? I seem to be heading that way, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she reached for the last brownie for effect and Jon shook his head in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou do know that\u2019s your fourth brownie out of six \u2013 and that I\u2019m taking you to lunch when I finish my milk?\u201d he stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and I\u2019ll be watching you enjoy me eating whatever just as you did these treats. Margie was right and I\u2019m happy to have found the key after liking you for six years, Amy replied/<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Jon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMargie, one of my best friends who analyzes people a lot, says you never looked really happy dating in high school and were frequently stealing glances at heavier girls like they were forbidden fruit for quarterbacks. She thinks you\u2019re secretly a closet chubby chaser,\u201d Amy declared. \u201cThat\u2019s part of why I\u2019ve given in to my own appetite, which I totally enjoy \u2013 and look what happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon put his hand to his brow and nodded down. \u201cWell, i never thought of it that way, but yes I\u2019ve always thought fuller figured girls to be attractive and you to be overly thin, but I never thought they were off limits. I just never was close enough to them for us to develop a relationship.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s be honest \u2013 you never developed a steady relationship with anyone because it couldn\u2019t be your priority, not with the team, various clubs, a part-time job, a car and your studies. But Margie figured you out and let me know what, in her view, it would take, answered Amy.  \"But she was apparently off by thirty pounds, because here you are before its become that noticeable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, actually, \u201d he confessed, \u201ci didn\u2019t call because I knew you were changing. I was sorting out other problems and just needed someone accepting and uncritical. I knew you\u2019d always wanted to be closer and so I called.  The weight thing was a pleasant surprise and you\u2019re a terrific baker.  But now we\u2019re past that and have mutually admitted our improved appetites, so, shall we get going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d smiled Amy as she finished her milk.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
