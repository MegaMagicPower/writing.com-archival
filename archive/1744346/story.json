Then he let himself fall over and laid on the ground wheezing. It was the final gym lesson of high school, his last gym lesson ever, and this day also marked the end of his last diet. his third this year. He pulled himself up and followed the others into the locker rooms.<br>\r\nIn the shower Tim looked at his classmates. Muscular chests, abs, beefy arms, the whole package on most of them, some were lean and scrawny and a few was chubby. Tim was the only one who could be called fat. He looked down at his big round belly and sagging moobs and thought about the chubby tights that were beneath them. He hated his body. All it did was slowing him down. He had tried to loose weight several times, but always gained back what he lost, if he lost anything at all. He was not sure why he was so fat. He had been fat as long as he could remember, making it hard to know what caused it in the first place. But he knew his lazy primary school years had helped. At least noone made fun of him anymore. After he got dressed it was time for math, then the it was home to study for the upcomming exam and to see if his diet had worked.<br>\r\nFor the past 3 weeks he had been excersising regulary, attended all of the football trainings he loathed, not eaten any candy and only had two servings at dinner, against his usual 3 and a half. He had always been a big eater, but Tim thought that, if he felt hungry, he was hungry, and therby could eat more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day was over and Tim was on his way home. As part of his diet he walked the two kilometers instead of taking the buss. Despite the whole way beeing flat he always felt tired when he made it home. The first thing he did was locking himself in the bathroom, take of all his clothes and step on the scale. He had been 251 lbs when he began 3 weeks ago, and the diet promised a 4 pound loss a week. The numbers flashed before ending at 250 lbs. Tim made an annoyed groan and stepped off. Down 1 pound after three weeks dieting. He hated diets and he hated exercise, but he hated his belly to, but this was it. He would not take it anymore. He had tried more than 20 diets the past 5 years and never dropped more than 10 pounds (which came back quick). He was sick of struggeling on the football field, of eating salad with no dressing, of having to explain to his friends why he never joined them for McDonalds. This was it. Screw diets, if they didn't work anyway he might just as well start enjoying life like this.<br>\r\nHe went to his room and collected all his dieting books and threw them away, then he opened a bag of chips, the first he had eaten in more than a month and went to watch TV.<br>\r\nAfter about an hour he gets tired of Simpson reruns and heads to his room to study. He brings a bottle of soda.<br>\r\nAt dinner that day he takes 4 servings and eats dessert for the first time in 6 months. His parents, knowing how sensitive he is about weight doesn't mention it, but notes how much Tim is scarfing down. After dinner Tim...</span></div></div>",

It was true, Carl had always been a little chubby, but the past three years, their high school years, he had grown alot. He had grown from a somewhat chubby 16 year old to a fat 19 year old. Though not quite as large as Tim.<br>\r\nCarl looked at him and said: \"Maybe a little, still smaller than you. How did your last diet go?\"<br>\r\n\"Not good,\" said Tim: \"I'm gonna give up now, it doesn't work.\"<br>\r\n\"It does work, you are pretty strong. And few guys your size are as fit as you. It just doesn't show.\" Carl said, knowing how sensitive Tim was about this.<br>\r\n\"Why bother if it doesn't show? From now on I'm just gonna laze around and have fun.\"<br>\r\n\"You'r gonna end up in terrible shape.\" Warned Carl<br>\r\n\"I am in terrible shape, you should see me in gym.\"<br>\r\n\"It's not gonna get better by giving up.\"<br>\r\n\"Screw that, I hate working out. I'll never do it again. And who are you to talk, you are getting fatter every day.\"<br>\r\n\"But at least I try to do something with it.\"<br>\r\n\"And so have I, until now. Enough is enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two overweight boys went to the pool. Carl wanted to swim for some excersize, so Tim bought himself a ice cream and sat down in the cafe while he did so.<br>\r\nWhen Carl was done, they went to the slide. It was a rather long stairway up to the top and while Carl was only breathing a bit heavy, Tim was panting heavy. The ride down went quick and soon they were on their way up again, slightly more tired than the last time.<br>\r\nAfter their third trip Tim was quite exhausted and sat down in the cafe area with a soda and a candy bar. Carl only bought a bottle of water. The indoor pool was nearly empty. Three hunky 16 year old boys were racing each other in the pool while a rotund 8 year old boy was floating around in a rubber ring. A group of adults of various sizes, mostly chubby were having coffee together.<br>\r\nAfter a little while Tim regained some strenght and the two boys...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Beads of sweat formed on Tim's face as he sat on one of the stairs leading up to the top of the waterslide. His heart raced due to the sheer effort it took for haul his 250+ pound body up those stairs again and again and again. He needed a moment to catch his breath and gestured to Carl to go on without him. The smaller boy walked past him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he recovered, something caught Tim's eye. Not too far away was a separate pool for those wanting to swim laps. It was typically occupied by svelte boys and girls who swam through the water as if they were birds gliding through air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut under the waves, Tim spotted the figure of an utterly massive person. Even from a distance and obscured by the water currents, he could tell that whoever was swimming in that designated lane was pretty big, perhaps as even wide as the lane itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim watched as the figure slowly yet consistently moved under the water, crawl a few feet then pop up to take a large gasp of air before plunging down again. It must have taken at least ten minutes to do just one lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large swimmer then went over to the pool's ladder and pulled himself out. That's was when Tim got a good look at the guy. He guessed the swimmer was around Tim's age and probably the same height, but the swimmer was much, much heavier than Tim. A belly nearly the size of a beach ball with two fatty slabs for moobs resting on top with nipples stretched to the size of silver dollars, love handles that seemed to reach totally around his back, tree trunk thighs, and a butt that looked like two basketballs shoved into what had to be the largest red Speedo Tim ever saw. Were Tim closer, he would have noticed faded stretch marks around the swimmer's bellybutton, nipples, upper arms, and thighs. The mammoth of a boy plodded to a nearby chair where he began towelling off, starting with his mop of unkempt brown hair and working his way down, being sure dry off his folds of fat as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrying off the best he could (Tim noticed he wasn't able to reach too far past his enormous belly), the swimmer wrapped the cartoonishly large towel around his waist and waddled in the direction of the locker room, his flab wobbling as he waddled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim was in awe and intrigued by the boy. Here he was, hovering around 250 pounds and barely able to get up a flight of stairs. Yet that guy, who probably around 400 pounds, was doing laps and hardly looked winded afterwards. </span></div></div>",

I'm just going to head to the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" said Carl. \"I'll probably still be here when you get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim then dashed off to the locker rooms. It was pretty quiet, so he judged that it must be pretty empty. Going along the aisles of locker, Tim peaked around each one which were all empty until he found the swimmer who was alone at a locker on the opposite side of the room. He hid behind the lockers not wanting to be seen. The towel the obese swimmer was previously drying off with was still wrapped around his thick waist, but the oversized Speedo laid on a bench nearby dripping water onto the floor. Tim saw that the swimmer was chugging from a shaker bottle. Its contents were a light brownish creamy substance that he guess might have been a kind of protein shake. The swimmer drank with wanton abandon. In a manner of seconds, the liquid was in his blubbery belly. He gave a low, rumbling belch and placed the empty bottle into his locker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door, the swimmer placed the lock through the metal slats. However, Tim noticed that he didn't bother to actually lock it. And why borther? Theft was something happened at this pool. The swimmer then shuffled away, seemingly in the direction of the saunas.</span></div></div>",

The size was apparently 3XL and didn't look anywhere close enough to fit a boy that size. But Tim tugged on it a bit. It had plenty of room to stretch, though probably just enough to cover a 400 pound guy's butt. Tim set them back down on the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the lock off the locker door, Tim slowly opened it up to see what was inside. There were a few extra towels (all of which were ridiculously large), the shaker bottle (Tim popped off the cap and smelled the remains, which reminded him of vanilla milkshake) and the swimmer's wallet and phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim supposed that he didn't have a lot of time to look around, so he'd only be able to scoop around on the obese swimmer's phone or peak into his wallet but not both.</span></div></div>",

Some of them were popular mobile games, a few of them were utility apps, but it was CaloCount that caught Tim's eye. It was a popular calorie counting app known for its easy user interface and vast library of nutrionial information. In fact, Tim had used it back when he was dieting and, while he personally didn't have any weight loss success, he had to admit that it was a pretty handy tool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim tapped on the icon and the app loaded up. \"Retrieving Ethan's profile\", he screen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, his name is Ethan,\" said Tim. \"So let's see if he's lost any wei-....woah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim took a few minutes to scan Ethan's profile history on CaloCount. It recorded him as having started his profile four months ago and logged in a weight of 313 pounds and displayed a chart noting all his other weight entries. But whereas most people would post losses, Ethan was posting gains. Big gains, in fact. The last weight entry was from five days ago where he entered his weight at 387.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God damn,\" Tim muttered to himself. \"Over seventy pounds in a few months...\" He then clicked open a tab that displayed a list of his daily calorie intake. Scrolling through them, Tim didn't see a day where Ethan ate less than ten thousand calories. And there were a few days where he got pretty close to thirty thousand calories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha! Hey, these's yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim spun around in shock having not heard anyone enter the locker room. Standing there was one of the young jocks he saw running around swimming pool earlier today. He was holding up the oversize Speedo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, no,\" Tim sputtered as he placed the phone back into the locker and shutting it closed. \"But they belong to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! They belong to a fat ass, that's who!\" The boy had stretch out the Speedo as far as it could go. Tim judged that the jock and one of his friends could easily fit in them. \"Wait, do these belong to that hippo? Oh man, I'm going to show these to my friends! They are going to laugh their asses off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jock turned and ran out the door. \"Hey! Those aren't yours!\" yelled Tim.</span></div></div>",

The three boys stood side by side with their hands behind their backs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, come on,\" Tim pleaded. \"Just give them back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give what back?\" one of the jocks asked, feigning ignorance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I mean, the Speedo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? It doesn't belong to you either!\" said another jock. The third started to slowly back away from Tim and he tried to conceal something behind him. Tim saw the third jock and got in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just hand them over!\" Tim yelled. \"Committing theft isn't some sort of game! Just give them back and I won't tell the managers that you've been steal stuff from the locker room!\" What Tim didn't know was the another of the boys actually had the Speedo and snuck behind him. As Tim was yelling, the jock wrapped the Speedo around Tim's face and pulled hard on the fabric. Tim was blinded by the red swimsuit covering his face, and his nostrils filled with the smell of musk and chlorinated water. He flailed for a moment as all three of the boys laughed. The jock then let go, and Tim pulled the Speedo off his face realizing that his face was digging into the backside of the obese swimmer's swimsuit that had been covering his blubbery rump only a few minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine!\" said one of the jocks. \"It's all yours now!\" They laughed as they walked always.Tim was furious with them, but he had gotten what he wanted and stormed back to the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mammoth-size swimmer was looking under one of the benches when Tim approached him holding out the Speedo. \"Hey, this yours?\" he asked knowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swimmer looked up and his face brightened. \"Yes! Yes, that's mine!\" he said enthusiastically as Tim handed them over. \"Where were they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some brats took them. But I got them back. Don't ask how.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I won't,\" the swimmer replied. \"I'm just glad to have them. Getting swimsuits in my size can cost quite a bit. I thought they would be okay drying off on the bench here. I mean, who's going to take them? There's not many guys my size swimming around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say,\" Tim replied. \"I don't think I've seen a guy your size doing laps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm not all flab. Under this chub is some serious muscle!\" said the swimmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll have to take your word for that! I'm Tim, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ethan, nice to meet you!\" The two shook hands, the swimmer's chest wobbling as they did. \"Man, I owe you a favor. Let me buy you lunch sometime, or dinner, or both. That's still be cheap that having to replace my Speedo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Time said happily. If this guy really did put on a ton of weigh in such a short period of time, Tim needed to see how this guy ate. Having the meal covered would be icing on the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan pulled out his phone and asked for Tim's number which he put into his contacts. \"Cool. I just texted you, so you have my number now. I need to hit the showers and take off pretty soon, but let's hang out!\"</span></div></div>",

It sold all of the chain fast food staples with a much higher quality.

Tables, because there was no possible way for Ethan to squeeze him and and nearly four hundred pound body in a booth. Not much was said between them.

His enormous belly took up well over half of his lap as it churned away at digesting the gigantic meal he had eaten not long ago. The obese swimmer's tent-like shirt and sweatpants lay in a crumpled heap on the living room floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make yourself comfortable,\" said Ethan as he unlocked the door to his apartment. \"Because I know I will.\" At first, Tim was taken aback as he started to strip down to his underwear. But then he remembers that he had seen much more of Ethan at the swimming pool and wasn't too weirded out. Soon thereafter, Tim's jeans and shirt were on the floor next to Ethan's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim sat at the opposite end of the couch, lazily rubbing a hand over his painfully stuffed belly clad only in his black briefs. His belly, normally flabby and jiggly, was taunt and round and made Tim look several months pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys watched television quietly, the silence only broken up by the occasional burp or the groaning of one of their bellies. After a couple of hours of this, an alarm on Ethan's phone went off. He heaved his blob-like body and reached for the phone on the coffee table to dismiss the alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be right back!\" Ethan said as he waddled into the apartment kitchen. Tim continued watching television but was distracted by the loud whirring of a blender. He pulled himself off of the couch and walked to the kitchen to see what Ethan was up to, his gut swaying as he moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthan pulsed the blender as it whipped together its thick, light brown contents. Tim surmised it might be similar to the shake he saw Ethan drinking in the locker room the day before. The pitcher was filled to the absolute brim as the swimmer blended the concoction. On the counter was a jug of whole milk, a carton of heavy cream, a bottle of chocolate syrup, and two large tubs. One of the tubs was a generic whey protein, and the other, Tim read, was something called BulkBlaster 3XT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatcha making there?\" Tim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, it's a kind of nutritional shake,\" Ethan replied. \"Burgers and fries don't give you all the vitamins you need!\" He then pulled the lid off of the blender's pitcher and stuck a fat digit in, licking his finger off. \"Hmm, there we go. I think it's done.\" Taking the pitcher off of the blender's base, he raised it to his mouth and started drinking. Tim watched in awe as Ethan chugged the entire mixture in the pitcher only stopping to take a couple of deep breaths before going back to drinking. A small trickle of the substance ran down the swimmer's cheek as he drank. It dripped down from his double chin and landed his his flabby chest. Creaks and groans were audible from Ethan's belly which was already straining from dinner. Ethan's eyes winched in pain as he was nearing the end. He slammed down the pitcher onto the counter when he had emptied it. A pained expression was on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are...are you okay?\" asked Tim. Tim held up a finger indicating that he needed a moment. The rotund boy leaned against the counter, silent and with eyes shut hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....OUCH,\" Ethan bellowed a minute later. \"Brain freeze! Ugh, I've got to remember to slow down.\" He licked off the shake that remained on his upper lip and wiped his chest off with his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I thought you were going to explode for a minute there!\" said Tim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, this belly can handle it.\" Ethan patted his gut which was considerably more swollen than it was minutes ago. \"I usually do this every night before bed. Been doing it for a few months now.\" Tim imagine ingesting all those calories before bed, each one being converted into fat, practically inflating him during the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, uh, I bet,\" said Tim. \"I mean, it looks and smells good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does!\" Ethan replied. \"You want one? I mean, not a whole pitcher. You're not ready for that...yet.\" The swimmer smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim was interested in trying some of that extremely caloric shake. But his poor belly was still trying to digest dinner and he was sure it could handle much more in it.</span></div></div>",

The rest of the wallet didn't have anything interesting: A few crumpled dollars, a debit card, and a punch card from a local coffee place. But Tim had to do a double take when he glanced at the license.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe photo on the card was a happy, smiling young man with scruffy brown hair and a bit of stubble on his face. His cheekbones were prominent as was his jawline. The boy in the photo reminded him of a surfer from California. The rest of the card display all the important information:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNAME: Ethan Michael Anderson<br>\r\nDOB: 10/16/01<br>\r\nHEIGHT: 5'10\"<br>\r\nWEIGHT: 175<br>\r\nHAIR: Brown<br>\r\nEYES: Brown<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim could not believe that this card belonged to rotund swimmer who barely fit into a massive Speedo. And it appeared that the card was issued less than two years ago. There's no way th-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim's train of thought interrupted; he had heard the door to the locker room swing open. He quickly replaced the card into the wallet, shut the locker door, and placed the lock as he found it. Tim then shuffled over a few rows and pretended to be unlocking his own locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds later, the obese swimmer waddled over. \"Knew I forgot something,\" he muttered as he closed the lock. Tim glanced over trying to find the face of that skinny surfer under fleshy jowls and a thick double chin. The swimmer then turned away and starting walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...hey!\" Tim yelled at the swimmer who turned around. \"Are, uh, those yours?\" He gestured to the gigantic red Speedo laying on the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, it's mine,\" the supersized swimmer said. \"Just leave it there. I don't want to toss it in my locker when it's soaking wet. Besides, I doubt anyone's going to steal it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess not,\" Tim chuckled. \"I haven't seen you around here. Do you swim here often?\" Again, Tim searched the swimmer's face and could just barely recognize the boy from the license photo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, I'm usually here everyday in the morning right when this place opens up. I like starting my day with some laps. But I had to drop off my mom at the airport this morning, so I'm here way later than I'm used to. What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim had to think of a lie and quick. The only times he ever comes to the pool is when Carl drags him there. And more often than not, he spends the day lounging instead of actually swimming. \"Uh, well, no. But I trying to come regularly. Good, uh, exercise, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't I know it,\" the swimmer said. \"I'm Ethan, by the way.\" He stuck out his hand and Tim shook it. The flabby boy's doughy arm and chest wobbled. \"Hey, I've been looking for a swimming buddy for a while. I hate being here by myself in the mornings. It's kinda weird being the only one swimming. If you're looking for someone to swim with and aren't afraid to wake up before the crack of dawn, I'd enjoy the company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim was intrigued by the offer.

Tim watched Ethan's magnificent progress out of the room, before snapping out of his daze and heading for the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carl, you gotta get out, I met this guy, we're going to grab a bite,\" you gabble to Carl when he comes to the side of the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which guy?\" Carl asks as he drifts over to a pool ladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The big fat guy who was just swimming!\"</span></div></div>",

I've tried dozens of them and none of them seemed to work.\" said Tim. He, too, was clad only in a towel around his waist.

Now I'm free to eat whatever and stop working out all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you still might want to watch what you eat and stuff.\" Carl suggested. \"And maybe get some exercise in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, why would I do that?\" asked Tim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, you were dieting for so long and lost, what, one pound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but still.

In walked in the three hunks that they saw earlier running around the pool. Each of them were ripped with clearly defined six-pack abs and swollen pecs. They too only had a towel around their waist. Yet one could easily make out bludging quads and thick glutes underneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three boys were carrying on their conversation about wrestling practice as they sat on bench on the opposite side of Carl and Tim. One of them glanced over to the two overweight boys, and Carl gave him a nod of acknowledgement all the while trying not to blush in front of the physical specimens in their presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim started to feel self-conscious. He and Carl were nearly nude, their flab and pudge on display. Easily, both friends weighted more than all three of the hunks combined, and Tim wouldn't be surprised if he had more body fat than all them total. </span></div></div>",

Tim glanced down at his best friend's recently expanded belly which, in the bright light of the locker room, he could make out faint stretch marks around Carl's belly button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl tugged his shirt down over his bare belly. \"Oh yeah, that. Well, you remember my big brother Jeff, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I haven't seen him in a while. What's he up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's doing alright.

I never saw your brother as much of a chef.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither did I. But he really got into cooking lately.

And I may or may not have eat pretty much the entire pan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh...\" replied Tim. \"So that explains it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't always this way! First, he asked me to taste some of this or try some of that. Then it was 'Hey Carl, have a scoop of this!' and 'Carl, you look hungry! Have some of this!' And the next thing I know, he's making full meals...and I'm eating them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not just pass on it?\" Tim asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He...*umph* hates seeing food...*urg* go to waste.\" Carl said as he struggled to button his jeans as his pillowly belly made it nearly impossible for him to close the flaps. \"And I guess...*urmph* I do too...*umph*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The trick is to suck it in,\" Tim joked as he was trying his shoe.

But Carl's jeans could only hold back the cascade of blubber for a moment before the button exploded off bouncing along the cold tile floor of the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops...\" Carl said exasperatedly. \"Well, it's not like I need that button to hold up my pants with this thing...\" He pinched a sizable amount of flab from him stomach and gave it a shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, if you don't want to eat Jeff's cooking, then just say no,\" suggested Tim. \"If he's making so much food, then it's his responsibility to find some way of giving it away instead of treating his little brother like a human garbage disposal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not just that, his food is really delicious and irresistible!\" Carl pleaded. \"I mean, last weekend Jeff whipped up a dozen red velvet cupcakes and I promised myself I was only going to have two. But I ended up having the rest for a midnight snack...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, dude, it sounds like a willpower issue. I'm a big guy, but I've never devoured nearly as a dozen cupcakes in the middle of the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't believe me, then come over for dinner. Before I left, I saw that Jeff was preparing an absolutely gigantic lasagna. Taste for yourself how good of a chef Jeff is.

Carl was right; this thing was gigantic. The pan was two feet wide by three feet long and about five inches deep. And Jeff had filled it to the brim with noodles and sauce and cheese. The only side on the table was a loaf of garlic bread that was practically swimming in butter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff grabbed a plate and scooped up a huge portion for Tim that easily took up most of the room on it and set it down in front of him. It had been a while since Tim had seen Jeff, but he looked pretty much the same. Long blonde hair tied into a ponytail, a fairly muscular build with a flat stomach, and a face Tim always found to be quite handsome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl was then served up a portion just as massive as Tim's. \"Alright, eat up! If you need me, I'll be cleaning up in the kitchen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jeff left, Carl whispered to Tim. \"See! It's huge! This could probably feed, like, a dozen people! And he expects both of us to eat it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm willing to try,\" said Tim. \"This smells amazing!\" He took a fork and went to town on the lasagna. Carl signed and began to eat his dinner albeit at a much slower pace than Tim. Not much was said between the two as they ate. Tim was practically shoveling it in, and the moment his plate was empty he grabbed the spatula and cut out an equally massive piece as his first. Carl timidly nibbled on some bread as he watched his friend inhale the greasy, fatty meal and wondered if inviting him over was such a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Carl cleaned his plate. And Tim cleaned his for the third time. Tim moaned, his face stained with tomato sauce, as he rubbed a hand over his engorged belly that was busily trying to digest thousands of calories of meat and bread and pasta.  A third of the lasagna remained in the massive pan. Tim reached for the spatula again but Carl grabbed it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, stop,\" he said to Tim. \"I know what you're trying to do and I appreciate it.

He found Carl's total lack of willpower around Jeff's cooking to be amusing. And it certainly made him feel better about himself. Sure, Tim was fat. But at least he wasn't so drawn to food that he couldn't pull himself away. He overindulged, to be sure, but Tim still could keep himself from doing so everyday. Tim might be fat, but Carl was proving to be quite the piggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up his phone again, Tim began typing up a reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim: \"k. come on over.

So, Tim thought, maybe the better thing to do would be to make Carl stay at home. Perhaps an evening with a stomach ache from eating too many sweets or the stark realization that his pants size has gone way up may be what Carl needs to get him to learn some kind of discipline when it comes to Jeff and his cooking.</span></div></div>",

I ended up eating the entire thing by myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, really?\" ask Tim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not in one sitting. I ate so much that Jeff had to practically roll me into my bedroom. And when I woke up later that night, I snuck the rest of the pan into my bedroom. You know what it's like waking up in the morning next to an empty lasagna pan, face covered in sauce and so bloated you can't see your toes past your gut?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I can't say that I have,\" replied Tim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have. And this is getting ridiculous. And *this* is getting ridiculous!\" Carl pulled up his hoodie, exposing his belly which looked visibly heavier and softer than when Tim saw it last. An almost perfectly round sphere of adipose, Carl's belly spilled out onto his lap, easily covering half his thighs. His belly button had stretched and deepened. The stretch marks Tim saw the other day had lengthened and turned a brighter shade of red. Carl's belly was nearly hairless minus the golden treasure trail that went from his belly button and disappeared under the curve of his gut. His chest had also softened up into two puffy mounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim's eyes widened at the sight of his fattened friend. Carl has always been a bit on the chubby side. But now the boy was downright fat, undeniably obese. He was so big that Tim wondered if Carl outweighed him, and he was curious to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn...\" Tim said in awe. \"Do...do you know how much you weigh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" sighed Carl. \"But I probably should know. We don't have a scale at my place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I have one! In my bathroom! Follow me!\" Tim said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Carl stood nervously in front of Tim's scale. The baggy hoodie and sweatpants lay on the floor beside him, giving Tim a better look at what all of Jeff's cooking at done to his best friend. Carl's arms look relatively untouched, and all the new weight didn't do anything to his boyish face. His thighs thickened up considerable. They looked fairly jiggily and rubbed up against each other now. Carl's butt, however, clearly soaked up much of the new weight that didn't already pad out his belly. Each butt cheek was the size of a cantaloupe and both together stretched the rear of his black boxer briefs (which didn't leave much to the imagination anyways) to the degree that Tim was worried they'd burst apart in front of him. Much like Carl's belly, which despite it's weight and how far it stuck out didn't sag too much, so too did his butt retain a surprising amount of perkiness in spite of being so much heavier. Clearly, whereas Tim's fat spread out fairly evenly over his body, Carl's blubber mainly concentrated in his gut and rump giving him an almost cartoonish silhouette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, step up,\" Tim instructes Carl, who stepped into the scale, his belly and ass slightly jiggling as he moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...what does it say? I don't want to see it...\" Carl said with his eyes shut tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim looked down to scale. \"It says...241.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl let out a loud sigh. \"241?!? Seriously? I'm the fattest I've ever been! I mean, I could have already guessed that from the fact that I can't see my toes past my gut and that my ass ripped open my pajama bottoms last night, but damn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Tim wore an expression of dismay on his face to sympathize with his best friend, he did feel a rush of excitement. Tim no longer had a kinda chubby friend, but a totally fat friend. A friend that wouldn't talk about diets and working out or slimming down for beach season. No, instead Tim now had a friend who he could destroy buffets with, a friend who wouldn't make him feel bad about get seconds or thirds when it came to dessert, a friend who he could be shirtless around at the pool and not feel self-conscious about his body. Hell, at the rate Carl was blowing up, Tim won't be the fat friend for much longer. In fact, Carl's distended belly already stick out considerable further than Tim's. People might think Carl is the fatter friend if he didn't hide his weight under baggy clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet Tim saw the pained look on Carl's face and couldn't help but feel a bit bad for him. He didn't just let himself go a bit; Carl looks as if someone stuck a hose in him and inflated him. Tim had always been fat, but Carl had only recently ate himself into obesity. Not just that, with Jeff using his little brother as a guinea pig for his cooking, Carl was only bound to swell up even larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim wrapped an arm around the shoulder of his best friend. \"Look, it's a bit of a shock, I know. But I'll help you out...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tim knocked on the front door to Carl's spacious home. He was there to talk with Jeff about his cooking and the impact it was having on Carl's waistline. It was a promise he made to Carl last night as he came to grips with the reality of his weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Tim,\" Carl had said to him the night before. \"Once you talk some sense into Jeff, then maybe we can do something about this...\" He lifted up his hefty gut with both hands, wobbling the mass of blubber for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's what brought Tim over to Carl's house the next afternoon. Nobody came to the door, so Tim knocked again but this time much harder. A moment later he heard someone inside briskly walk to the door and throw it open. Standing there was Carl's older brother Jeff. It had been a while since he last saw Jeff, but he looks pretty much the same as he did before: About six feet tall with a fairly muscular build, long blonde hair tied back into a ponytail, pale blue eyes and a handsome, model like face. He was wear jeans and a simple black shirt, both of which had patches of flour on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim! Hey! Long time, no see!\" Jeff said. \"Sorry, I didn't answer the door sooner but i was just pulling something out of the oven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, no problem,\" replied Tim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. Are you here to hang out with Carl? He's not here right now. I think he went out clothes shopping or something. But he should be back soon  since he left a few hours ago. Do you want to wait inside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I will,\" Tim said as he stepped into the house. The moment Tim walked inside, his nose was hit with the aroma of cooked meat and sausage. \"Wow, something smells good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I just got done with some homemade pizzas! Come on, have a few slices!\" Jeff led Tim into the kitchen where two pizzas, each easily two and a half feet in diameter, sat cooling on the counter. Both were covered in thick layers of meat and cheese. Jeff looked for a pizza slicer in the drawers as Tim took a seat on one of the stools at the kitchen island. After slicing the pizzas up into wide slices, he served up a few onto a plate and handed it to Tim. It looked as if Jeff had given him at least a third of one of the pizzas. But Tim certainly wasn't complaining after taking a large bite of slices and experiencing an explosion of cheese and savory flavors, even if it was a bit greasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, this is really good!\" Tim said, munching away on the slice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks! It's actually not that hard to make a good pizza so long as you know how to bake the crust the right way,\" Jeff replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, whatever you did, it works!\" Tim shoved the last of the slice into his mouth, only to start on another right afterwards. \"You know, Carl has told me all about your cooking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff's face lit up. \"Really? Only good things, I hope!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, only good things.\" Tim said as he finished the second slice and began working on the third. \"Actually, that's something he ask for me to talk with you about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\"</span></div></div>",

He's turning into quite the butterball. In fact, he's outgrown pretty much everything in his closet. That's why he had to go shopping today. Poor guy, he had to ask to borrow some sweatpants from me because he can't get his fat butt into any of his jeans anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering seeing Carl's rear last night and how much plumper it looked, Tim believed Jeff. \"Yeah, so can you, like, go easy on the cooking for him? Or maybe find someone else who might enjoy your food as much as Carl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" Jeff said as he leaned against the kitchen counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" said Tim. \"Why not? He's your little brother and he needs your help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he stopped being my 'little brother' a few dozen pounds ago,\" Jeff joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is serious!\" Tim yelled. \"He needs you to stop or give your food away to someone else or something! Carl can't even stay here when your cooking! He was over at my place yesterday because he was worried that all the cookies and pies and everything would end up in his belly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they did anyway when he came back home,\" replied Jeff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff smirked and gestured to the kitchen counters. \"See any cookies. Or pies? Or cakes? Look, thank you for looking out for my brother. But you don't understand the whole picture. He whines and moans and complains to you about it. But deep down, I know he loves it, and he knows he loves what happening to him too. So, stay out of it and let Carl keep eating to his heart's content.

So cut it out!\" said Tim. \"Because I know he's not liking what's happening to him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Tim,\" began Jeff. \"You think that C-\" The older brother stopped himself. He had heard a car pull up to the front of the house. Peaking through the kitchen window, he saw that it was Carl's car that had pulled in. A devilish smirk appeared on Jeff's face. He then started to take slices from the second whole pizza and stack them up on a plate. \"You know what, Tim? How about I show you? I'll show you that Carl is loving this. So just sit down, shut up, and watch!\" He slammed the pizza-laden plate on the kitchen island for emphasis which startled Tim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-fine...\" said Tim with a scowl on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front door opened and closed, then there was the sound of someone kicking off their shoes and shuffling down the hall with some plastic bags. \"Carl? Is that you? Come into the kitchen!\" Jeff yelled in a overly friendly manner. A few seconds later, Carl appeared in the doorway holding a couple of large plastic bags from a discount clothing store from the mall. He was wearing the same black sweatpants from the night before, as well as a white shirt that was starting to ride up on his doughy, spherical belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey bro,\" said Carl. \"Something smells go-\" He saw that Tim was sitting in at the kitchen island. \"Oh, uh, hey Tim...\" the boy said sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. Tim and I were just talking about you. Now, sit down! You're late for lunch!\" Jeff said pointing at the clock in the stove. It read 1:14pm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, actually, I think that I'm still pretty full from breakfast...\" Carl patted his belly for emphasis. Small ripples were sent their his flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense. Now sit. I made pizza!\" replied Jeff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe after I put away my new-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit.\" Jeff said firmly while looking Carl square in the eyes. He pointed at the stool in front of the pile of pizza slices. Carl gulped, slowly waddled over, and took a seat all while trying to avoid eye contact with Tim who looked on puzzled. The stool groaned slightly under Carl's weight<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim walked over to his brother and placed a hand on his shoulder. \"So, 241, huh? Gettin' pretty heavy, eh?\" Carl look down, his cheeks burning bright red. Jeff raised Carl's chin up and asked again. \"241, yes?\" Carl nodded slightly. \"Atta boy, someone's getting all big and strong!\" Jeff said sarcastically as he patted his brother's belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, open up,\" Jeff said as he picked up a greasy slice of pizza and held it to Carl's mouth. Carl shot a look to Tim who was looking on silently in awe. \"Open, now!\" Jeff demanded this time. The moment Carl's lips were slightly parted, his brother shoved a slice in. Carl began chewing manically like a starving man eating for the first time in days, his jaws mechanically chopping away as Jeff shoved more and more of the slice in his brother's eager mouth. In just a few seconds, the first slice was entirely in Carl's mouth as he desperately chewed and chewed, swallowing the slice down bit by bit and taking deep breaths while he tried. As soon as he had totally swallowed the first slice, Jeff was ready to shove another in and Carl devoured it in a similar fashion. The same happened with the third, fourth, and fifth slice. Carl's face and shirt became more and more covered in grease and meat and crumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy,\" said Jeff, holding the sixth slice in one hand and holding the back of Carl's head in the other. Carl's eyes were glazed over. He didn't seem entirely there anymore or aware of what he was doing, let alone the fact that his best friend what watching this spectacle happen. The boy's swollen belly creaked and groaned before Carl let out a long, rumbling burp. Jeff then resumed stuffing more pizza into his brother's already painfully bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl's pace as slowed considerably by the time Jeff was ready to feed him that final slice. He let off a whimper as he gently rubbed his belly in an attempt to soothe it. \"Aww, poor guy\" cooed Jeff. \"Feeling a bit full?\" Carl replied with a weak nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim, who had been silently watching all this happen, glanced over to the clock again. This time it read 1:22pm. Jeff had nearly stuffed that entire gigantic pizza into his brother in less than ten minutes. As he watched, Tim was filled with confusing feelings of excitement and curiosity. \"Umm, Jeff,\" Tim piped up. \"Maybe he's had enough...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff sternly looked at Tim directly into his eyes. \"Carl. Open.\" His brother obeyed. Without breaking eye contact with Tim, Jeff proceeded to forcefully stuff the final slice of pizza into Carl's mouth while the boy moaned and whimpered in pain. Tim's cheeks flashed red due to Jeff's assertive gaze, and he could feel a kind of stirring in his own nether regions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Carl was finished with the last slice of pizza, Jeff patted him on the back. \"Had enough, buddy?\" Carl slowly nodded as he sat there panting, his white shirt now covered in grease and tomato sauce. \"Looks like you need to clean yourself up!\" Jeff said, again in an overly friendly manner. \"Why don't you go take care of that? And maybe treat yourself to a nap. But not too long! Dinner will be ready in a few hours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, bro...\" Carl moaned as he slid off the stool, his packed gut wobbled as he did so. Tim's eyes widen at the sight of not only Jeff's protruding belly, but another protrusion, this one in Carl's sweatpants that caused the front to tent up. Carl was turned on, and Tim was as well having watched Carl get fed then force fed. Though Carl seemed oblivious to his arousal as he shuffled out of the kitchen to his bedroom. And Tim watched as his best friend's soft bits, and not so soft bits, bob up and down as he plodded out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? He loves it,\" Jeff said, smirking again. Tim's mouth was agape; he wasn't quite too sure what to say or think about what he witnessed. Then, Jeff grabbed a slice from the remaining pizza and walked over to Tim's side, hold the slice right up to his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, feeling hungry?\"</span></div></div>",

He was watching television while munching on another slice of Jeff's homemade pizza. Tim had managed to devour one of the entire pizzas that Jeff had made when he came over to visit. \"Here, let me wrap up the other one for you to take home,\" Jeff had said. \"Since you like it so much! Better get home with it soon before Carl sees what he missed out on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, he knows how to make a good pizza...\" Tim muttered to himself as he bit into his fourth slice. The boy's belly gurgled and moaned as it bloated out even more due to Tim's post-dinner snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis phone buzzed.

The room was lit only by the light of the television as the sun had gone down many hours ago. He glanced at the alarm clock on his night stand. It read 10:39pm. Picking up his phone, Tim expected to see a message from Carl. However, the number that texted him one he didn't recognize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n???: Hey, hope you liked the pizza!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim: Thx? who is this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n???: Oh, it's Jeff.

It was a photo Carl asleep on his bed wearing nothing but tight white briefs; one of his hand was slipped under its waistband and the other rested on top of his gut. He was on his back, and his engorged belly stuck straight up looking so full that it was ready to pop. A half smile was on Carl's face, along with some ketchup and mustard stains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim: well, looks lik he enjoyd dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff: He sure did. Six burgers and more fries than I could count. After I snapped that photo, I left a box of snack cakes by his bed in case he gets hungry in the middle of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff: Told you I was looking after him lol<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim: lucky carl. here i m, awke in the middl of the nigt with no snak caks lol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim: mayb thats a god thing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim: stil full from pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim: may hav had it for desertt<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff: May I see? lol<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim hesitated for a moment. He had never sent anyone photos of his body before. Being fat all his life made him extremely self conscious about his looks. However, Jeff seemed to be comfortable around fat guys, and he did ask, after all. Tim got up and switch on his bedroom light. He walked over to his full-length mirror and timidly snapped a photo for Jeff, an anxious smile was on Tim's face as he took the photo with one hand rubbing the curve of his gut to show just how bloated he was and still dressed in only his boxer briefs. Nervously, he sent it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim: [PHOTO ATTACHED]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff: WOW. <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/heart.png\" alt=\"*Heart*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Heart\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff: I didn't realize that Carl had such hot friends<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim blushed.

It was already getting pretty late, so Tim crawled back into bed and went back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was went past 9am when Tim woke up the next morning. Rubbing the sleep from his eyes, he grabbed for his phone and saw that he had two new messages: One from Carl and one from Jeff. Both were picture messages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim opened the one from Jeff first.

Tim was surprising himself with how quickly he was going through his half of the pizza.  He had been kind of hungry when he got to the restaurant, but he had also been snacking throughout the day.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore too long, Tim managed to put away his half of the pizza and was watching Carl work on his portion.

It was a beautiful day out and they were both sick of being inside for so long after their tests earlier that day.  Even so, it was a pretty slow walk since both boys were pretty stuffed with pizza.  They didn't talk much during their walk, preferring to savor the fact that they were officially done with high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while they finally made it back to Tim's house.

Heading to the kitchen, Tim grabbed a bottle of coke for both of them and then began rummaging through the cabinets for snacks.

Carl rips open a family size back of chips while absentmindedly flipping through channels.  Not feeling very tempted by any of the junk he had found, Tim instead decides to take care of the leftover pizza.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're eating again already?

After a hearty meal made up of leftovers from dinner, Tim would lounge around in front of the TV for a few hours before calling Carl up to see what he was doing.  His friend had been spending his vacation in much the same way, so they usually decided to meet up, and there was a McDonalds conveniently placed at the halfway point between their houses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday's routine was shaping up in much the same way as Tim entered the McDonalds and made his way to the counter.

Still, Tim had noticed that Carl took full advantage of any food that was placed in front of him.  He would sit across from Tim and talk about maybe getting into shape through a mouthful of burger.  Tim hadn't meant to get his friend to follow his example, but he couldn't deny that he liked not being the only one ignoring their health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, Carl joined him at the booth, bringing with him a tray holding three burger meals, an extra order of fries and a large coke.

Tim was glad they wouldn't have to walk to the nearest bus stop and stand around waiting for a ride back towards his house.

Tim sat himself in the passenger seat, doing his best not to care as he felt the car sink beneath his weight, and buckled the seatbelt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys were both feeling a bit full and rather unmotivated, so Carl just drove them back to Tim's house.  Like usual, they spent the rest of the afternoon snacking in front of the television.  Tim got a call from his mom at around 5:30 telling him that she was picking up some fast food for dinner and that she would be home soon.  Rolling his eyes, Tim heaved himself off of the couch with a sigh and started to collect all the trash from their snacking.  He didn't want his parents finding out how much he had been eating lately and freaking out.

Tim was pretty full already, but it wouldn't be too hard to finish the last burgers.  It would be a waste not to.  He popped the whole first burger into his mouth, followed be the second and third.  Swallowing his last mouthful, he looked at Carl and asked, \"What happened to you keeping me healthy?\"<br>\r\nGiving his friend a wry grin, Carl said, \"After fifteen burgers, I don't really think three more will matter.</span></div></div>",

You're finally catching on.\"  <br>\r\nWith the countless channels provided by their satellite service, it didn't take long for the boys to find a movie they agreed on.  They got through half of the movie before Tim decided that something was missing from the experience.  With a sigh, Tim once again heaved himself off the sofa and made his way into the kitchen.  After a week's worth of heavy snacking, the cabinets and pantry were starting to look a little bare, but some rummaging uncovered a few neglected bags of chips.  Before he forgot, he grabbed a bottle of soda for each of them and headed back to the couch.<br>\r\nCarl still looked full from dinner, but he didn't bat an eyelash when Tim offered him a bag of chips.  Tim wasn't any more hungry than Carl was, but a movie was always better with snacks.  Despite the full bellies, they munched their ways slowly but steadily through the bags.  By the time the credits were rolling, Tim had reached the end of his supply of chips.  After draining his bottle of Coke, his jeans were feeling way too tight.  Reaching around his bloated belly, Tim unbuttoned his pants and let out a loud, satisfied belch before pulling his shirt up over his gut and starting to rub.<br>\r\nCarl, whose attention had been drawn by his friend's loud burp, once again found it hard to look away from his buddy's big, exposed belly.  He chugged down the rest of his own soda and tried to focus on the television, but Tim noticed his eyes flicking over to his fat gut every few minutes.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tim didn't see any reason to rock the boat, so he decided to keep quiet.  After all, Carl had flat out ran away last time he had brought up the subject.  Besides, he didn't really mind his attention all that much.  He just wondered what Carl had on his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer continued to creep past without any huge developments, much to Tim's delight.  High school was over, college hadn't started yet, and for once he wasn't suffering through any crazy diets.  Life was pretty good and he was intent on enjoying it as much as possible.<br>\r\nOf course, for Tim that meant spending a lot of time sitting around playing video games or surfing the web.  Now that he'd given up on trying to manage his weight he couldn't see any reason to go out and be active.  On some days the only thing that got him up off of the couch was a lack of snacks to munch on.  Every once in a while his parents would try to sneakily convince him to get out of the house for a while, but he mostly just ignored them.  <br>\r\nWhenever he did feel like going out, he and Carl usually just ended up at some fast food place or another.  Carl still sometimes talked about dropping his extra weight and starting to work out, but nothing ever came of it.  Without fail, the boys would just end up lounging around on Tim's couch and recovering from a fast food binge.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith such a lazy lifestyle, neither boy was getting any slimmer.  Tim was certain that his clothes were starting to feel tight; something that hadn't happened in a while.  Even though he had never managed to drop much weight, his dieting and exercising had always helped him maintain his heft at around 260 pounds.  Even though he was used to thinking of himself as a fat guy, it was strange to think that he was outgrowing his clothes.  He didn't do anything about it though.  He had already decided that he was done trying to manage his weight.  Besides, he hardly went anywhere anyway.  Carl wouldn't think much of it if his belly peeked out from beneath his shirt occasionally, and Tim couldn't bring himself to care too much if the patrons of McDonalds happened to notice that his pants were unbuttoned.<br>\r\nCarl had been slowly packing on the pounds for longer than Tim had, and by now he was also beginning to suffer from similar clothing malfunctions.  Unlike Tim, however, he was either oblivious or refusing to admit it.  Once again, Tim decided not to draw his attention to it and instead just watched as Carl's t shirts clung more and more closely to his belly and chest as the days went by.  Unlike Tim, who at least had a decent amount of muscle hidden beneath his thick layer of fat, Carl was starting to look pretty soft and flabby.  There wasn't a hint of muscle tone anywhere on his body and, instead of the relatively firm belly that Tim sported, his gut was rather saggy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, Tim was pleased with the direction that his life was taking nowadays.  He was probably getting fatter, but he really didn't care anymore.  Carl was definitely packing it on, but Tim didn't mind,  In fact...</span></div></div>",

Carl was definitely packing it on, but Tim didn't mind, In fact  Tim was happy about it. He didn't want to be the only fat guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a full month since high school ended and Tim knew he had gotten fatter. His clothes was definitly tighter. He had not checked his weight since he ended his last diet, but he was getting curious about how big he was now. Carl was also getting bigger, fast, but he didn't seem to notice. But Tim was sure he would soon, Carl had no muscles to speak of so all the new weight would affect him eventually, probably quite soon.<br>\r\nIt was 1 pm right now and Tim was just out of bed, it was his reflection in the bathroom mirror that had triggered this train of thoughts. His firm, round belly was rounder, and softer. The lack of excersise was making impact on him and his muscles was shrinking, not that you could see them anyway. But his firm belly was getting flabbier.<br>\r\nHe pulls out the scale and steps on it. The numbers starts to flash and ends up at 275 lbs. 25 lbs more in just a little more than a month. For a few moments his desire never to exercise again fluttered, but then he recalled all the hours spent playing football and never loosing weight, the taste of salad without dressing, and all the other things that came with a diet. So he went downstairs and began making a load of egg and bacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Carl came around later on Tim nearly asked him if he wanted to check his weight, but was afraid that would make Carl more serious about dieting so he just made sure that there was plenty of snacks aviable.<br>\r\nAfter the first movie Carl was already stuffed on potato chips and soda. His t-shirt was strained across his belly, which was getting a decent overhang when he stood and was starting to spill into his lap while sitting. They turn on the TV but theres nothing good on, they are bored of all the video games, and they have seen all the movies. They both sit there wondering what to do.<br>\r\n\"I'm so bored, lets go to the funfair. I can drive.\" Carl proposes.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, or we could go to the beach, get some tan. We're both awfully pale.\" Tim says.</span></div></div>",

They had somehow managed to spend another afternoon sitting in front of the television.Really, that wasn't very surprising given the way the summer had been going up until then.  Still, Tim didn't regret any of it, and Carl seemed to be pretty content with their sedentary routine.  <br>\r\n\"Alright, the fair it is then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hungry dude?\" Carl asked as he got behind the wheel of his old beater.  \"We could swing through a drive-thru if you want.\"  <br>\r\n\"I'm good, thanks,\" Tim puffed, attempting to buckle the seatbelt around his fat gut.  It took a bit more effort to force the band around his circumference and into the slot nowadays, but he managed.  \"I don't wanna waste space on fast food with all the good stuff they've got at the fair.\"  He could literally feel his mouth watering at the thought of all those corndogs and funnel cakes.<br>\r\nIt was still a bit early, so Carl was able to snag an ideal parking spot right next to the entrance.  The fair was already going in full swing and the sights, sounds, and smells overwhelmed them momentarily as they made their way in.  It didn't take long for one smell to win out over all of the other sensory input though, and before very long both boys were walking down the main promenade with a couple of corndogs.  <br>\r\nEven knowing that most of the games in the place were next to impossible to win, the boys stopped at several different stalls as they made their way through the park.  Carl didn't have much luck with any of the games, but Tim's long years of playing sports had at least given him the skill necessary to knock over a stack of bottles with a baseball, so they were both able to walk away with a few trinkets.  <br>\r\nDuring Tim's successful endeavors, Carl occupied himself by consuming a steady supply of cotton candy, chili cheese fries, and funnel cakes.  This wasn't the kind of place where it was hard to find food, and no matter what booth they stopped at, there would be delicious, greasy junkfood tempting him from mere feet away.  He wasn't even really hungry, but he couldn't resist.  It was all too tempting for Tim too, and before very long they had forgotten about the games and were instead focused on the snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I'm stuffed,\" Carl said, dropping a half-eaten hotdog back into its tray and gulping down the remainder of his soda.  Tim reached over and popped the morsel into his mouth, trying and failing to suppress a loud burp. <br>\r\n\"Nice one,\" Carl said, slapping him on the shoulder.  \"I'm pretty full now.  What should we do now?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After a while he just gave up. 'I should check my weight.' He patted his belly and stepped on the scale. He had to lean forward and suck in his gut to see the numbers. \"348\" he red out loud, more than he thought, but it explained his clothing malfunctions. He decided to hide his open pants with a belt. Carl should be here any minute. The moment he walked out of the door, Carl pulled up in his car. \"Ready for the All-you-can-eat-Buffet?\" Carl asked. \"Sure, I'm starving\" Tim said, as he sat on the passanger seat. He didn't even try to get the searbelt around his huge gut. Wouldn't fit anyway. He looked at Carl. He looked like he gained at least the same amount of weight as Tim, if not more.

As Tim emptied one of his boxes, Carl saw a scale in there. \"Hey Tim, I think we should check our weight. I think we both put on some pounds.\" He patted his belly, what caused it to wobble like crazy. \"Okay, I go first.\" Tim. Put the scale on the floor and stepped on it. But this time even with leaning and sucking in, he couldn't see the numbers. \"Carl, what does it say? I can't see past my gut.\" Carl laughed \"Wow you really got fat. 359.\" he said as he poked Tim's fat. Tim stepped off. \"Alright, your turn.\" Aa Carl stepped on the scale he also couldn't see the numbers. Tim had to laugh. Wow, it says you weight 373 lbs. Your even fatter than me.\" Carl looked shocked, as he stepped of the scale. \"I knew I put on some weight, but not that much. Maby I should go on a diet, before I get stuck in the doorframe.\" \"It's really not that bad, bro. I mean maby it is, but we're both fat and we had a lot of fun in the last weeks.\" \"Yeah, that's true. Maybe I should just postpone my diet to after my freshman year\" \"That's the spirit. Let's order some pizza.\" Carl's belly rumbled as an answer. They both had to laugh. Tim picked up the phone and ordered ten XXL Pizzas with extra cheese and some mozzarella sticks. They sat on the couch. Even thou it was a couch for 3 persons, the two boys filled it out completely. After about 30 minutes the pizza arrived. After about 3 and a half pizzas each they were both getting full, but they managed to stuff the rest in them as well. Now they were both sitting on the couch, too full to move and massaging their fat bellys. \"That's... burp... life.\" said Carl. Tim let out a huge burp and nodded. \"Yeah, I really could get... burp... used to that.\" Tim tried to stand up, but failed. He was simply too full. After watching TV for some time while munching on some chips, they both fell asleep on the couch. </span></div></div>",

Eating around 15.000 calories a day really did a number on their waistlines.<br>\r\nTim and Carl where right now on their way back from a new all-you-can-eat-restaurant and were both stuffed to the brim. Carl's belly was brushing against the steering wheel, as he pulled in the parking lot of their dorm. They had some trouble, but they managed to get out of the car. They waddled through the main entrance. Now they just had to climb up the stairs. Tim was winded, when he reached the the top. Because Carl was even more out of shape than him he had some time to catch his breath. Carl had to take a break at the middle of the stairs, but managed to get to the top. When they reached their dorm room they were still breathing heavily. Tim opened the door and tried to waddled through it. He almost got stuck, but managed to squeeze through. When Carl tried to squeeze himself through he had more trouble. He did his best, but it was no use, he was stuck. \"Tim, can you help me? I think I'm too fat for the door.\" Tim had to laugh for a few moments, before he could do something. Because he was already sitting on the couch, it took some time for him to get up, but after the 4th try he managed to heave his fat body of the couch and waddled over to the door. He had to pull with his whole weight, but managed to get Carl out. \"Maby you should go on a diet, bro.\" Tim said while still laughing. \"Very funny, don't forget, you're not much slimmer than me. I just turn sideways next time, but we really have to apply for a room on the ground floor next semester.\" \"Yeah, definitely. We should check our weight. I think we got fatter again.\" \"OK, but it can't be more than a few pounds.\" Tim pulled the scale out from under his bed and stepped on it. \"395\" Carl red out \"Wow, more than 35 lbs. Let's see what I got. Carl stepped on and Tim red the number. \" Wow Carl, We got a winner. 406 lbs. Bro, that's more than 30 lbs. Less than me, but you're still the fatter one.\" Carl didn't really care he took some snacks from the kitchen and started eating them in front of the TV.

He was still tired, but he needed to eat something now. Carl was still asleep on the other bed. He could see his giant belly rise and fall as he was breathing. Tim rolled to the side and heaved himself into a sitting position. His bed creaked loudly. He needed a moment to catch breath before he could stand up. Than he sat on the corner of his bed, spread his legs, to let his belly hang down between them an pushed himself up with his arms. Then he leaned forward to get balance, but failed an fell back on his gut. He tried again and in the 5th try he managed to stand up. He waddled over to the small kitchen an leaned to the wall to catch breath. He was exausted from the effort. After he was breathing normal again he took his phone from the table and ordered some food from the 24h Grill down the street. The food he ordered would have been enough to feed a family of 6 for the whole day, but here it was just about enough to feed two obese college kids for a few hours. The food arrived 20 minutes later. Carl woke up, when the food arrived. After he managed to get up he joined Tim. Both boys now had their own sofas, as they were to fat to sit on one together. After a good hour, the boys were leaning back stuffed to the brim, massaging their guts. After sleepinig for a while eating again, and showering, They decidet to try out the new scale they ordered form the internet. The old one had a 500 lbs weight limit and Carl broke it, the last time he stepped on. Tim took the scale out from under his bed an climbed on it. \"532\" Carl red out \"Dude, Thats mre than doubble your original weight. Alright step off, its my turn.\" Tim stepped of and Carl took his place \"541\" said Tim \"Your still the fatter one.\" \"Yheah, but you're catching up, dude.\" They had to laugh. After they watched TV for a while they started to gat hungry again, so they decidet to go to the cafeteria. They got dressed an with each others help they managed to squeeze through the door. They had to walk to the caf. It was only a few houndred feed away, but for them it was like running a marathon. They had to sit down on a bench after they walked half the distace, to cath breath. As they looked around Carm noticed, that there wasn't even on guy around that was thin. The slimmest person he saw was a young freshman with a tight T-shirt, that revaled his basket ball sized potbelly. Even thou they were probbably the fattest persons on the campus, they were still not really standing out. Most guys were at least 300lbs and a few looked like they were well over 400. He felt intantly better. Not, that he cared how fat he was getting, but he didnt want to be treated like a freak or something, but here it seemed to be normal to be really fat and nobody seemed to care. After they caught breath they continued their way to the the cafeteria. And it was true, erverywhere he looked he saw guys waddeling around in too thigt clothes and wobbeling guts. Interestingly there were almost no overweight girls, but he didn't really care. In the cafeteria, it was the same everywere young college guys with fat bellies in all sizes, but not a skinny person in sight. 'Great, thats the perfect place for us' Tim thougt. After they loadet up their trays with as much fatty food as possible, they sat on an empty table an began stuffing theit faces again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tim and Carl, now weighting 584 and 589 lbs, started to have real problems moving around. Standing up from the sofa or a chair was like running a marathon for them. And after a few meters of walking, they where completely out of breath and had to take a break, but they still managed to waddle around their dorm room. Jason and Tommy were practically there all the time. The four freshman were either eating or laying on the sofas, too stuffed too move. Jason now weighted 357 lbs and Tommy was 365, not that they really cared. Right now the boys were talking about their plans for Thanksgiving. They all agreed, that there was no way, they could fit in a plane, to fly home so Tim and Carl decide to stay here and drive home later for Christmas. Jason wanted to go home, but Tommy stayed with Tim and Carl. They spent the free time to eat even more than they normally did and were drunk most of the time. All in all, they had a really good time. When Jason returned, he could see, that his friends have put on even more wheigt, just like he had. After greeting everyone and going to the cafeteria they were sitting in the dorm, stuffed to the brim and barely able to move. They all knew, they had put on more wheigt, but decided not to check before the day they headed home for Christmas. When the day arrived It was Tommy's turn to step on the scale first. He couldn't see the number so Jason red it out loud for everyone. \"424, holy shit, dude. That's like 59 lbs. Wow.\" \"Calm down, dude. Let's see what you got there.\" Jason stepped on the scale. \"Look who isn't the thinnest here anymore\" laughed Tommy \"Dude, you weight 429 lbs. That's an impressive 72 lbs gain.\" Jason looked pretty proud as he stepped of the scale and patted his fat belly, causing it to wobble like crazy. After Tim managed to heave his obese body off the couch, with the help of Jason and Tommy, he stepped on the scale. It creaked loudly, but didn't break. \"626, only 42lbs\" Than Carl stepped on the scale. \"692, wo Carl, that's like more than 100 lbs. You really went to town, huh?\" Carl just grinned and sat back on the couch to take breath...</span></div></div>",

I've lost so much weight that I had to get new swim trunks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl had always been a bit on the chunky side. Although he was never as fat as Tim, his best friend was still somewhat chubby. That is, until Carl started dieting. When Tim told Carl he wanted to lose weight, he volunteered to slim down too as a show of moral support. Yet whereas Tim only shed one or two pounds, Carl practically deflated. By substituting carrots for cake and evening runs for video game sessions, Carl looked to be in amazing shape. His face no longer carried a second chin; his jaw line was now prominent. The belly that used to droop over his pants was all but gone minus some leftover pudge. And his flabby moobs turned into flat pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim stewed in jealousy as he watched his now fit and trim best friend swim laps in the pool from a chair nearby as he bit into his third hot dog. Crumbs fell onto his soft gut as he witnessed Carl go from end to end of the pool's length. There was a time when Carl was just as lazy and gluttonous as Tim, but now here he was, darting through the water like a dolphin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim's hunger wasn't sated. So the flabby boy hauled himself off of his chair and waddled back over to the pool's concession stand, his exposed flab wobbling and jiggling as he walked. From the stand, he bought two more hot dogs and a couple of cans of soda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his way back to his poolside chair, Tim spotted Carl chatting up a cute girl. Short blonde hair, a pretty face, and a trim body to match. Tim couldn't make out what they were saying, but Carl was making her laugh and smile. Seeing this brought up more feelings of envy in Tim. He and Carl used to commiserate in their being unable to get attention from either girls or guys. But now Carl, the former fat ass, was now picking up girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim felt angry about this and thought about sabotaging Carl. Or perhaps Tim should just get over it and let Carl be happy.</span></div></div>",

But having lost so much weight, he felt more confident about his looks and, in turn, more confident in his ability to attract someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I've enjoyed talking with you,\" Carl said, his heart nervously pounding in his chest. \"Do you think I could call you som-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Carl could finish his question, he felt a hand grab and squeeze his butt.

What the hell!\" he yelled. \"I was, like, *this* close from getting her number!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim chuckled. \"Oh, relax. It was just a joke!\" he said. \"Plenty of fish in the sea, after all. Besides, don't you think you can hook up with another cute girl now that you aren't a fat ass anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can. But not if you're perving up on me, grabbing my butt and making girls think we're together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, but how can I resist\" Tim said jokingly as he tried pinching Carl's behind. Carl slapped his friend's hands away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Alright! Stop stop stop!\" Carl said. \"Just don't blow it for me again! Now, I'm done swimming and could use a bite to eat. There's a Mexican place that just opened up not too far away from here that I've been meaning to try. Or if you want to hang out at my place, I'm sure I've got something to eat there.\"</span></div></div>",

He was almost certain he had it right, unless there was some big switch he wasn't made aware of. The door to Chase's room was partially open; light from the room was pouring into the dim hallway. Tim peaked into the room and recognized the mop of shaggy blonde hair that belong to Chase who had his back turned to the door as he played some new video game at his computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knock knock? Anyone here?\" Tim asked while peaking his head in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase turned around and saw Tim. \"Tim! Long time no see! Hang on let me pause my game...\" He hit the escape key and got up to give Tim a fist bump. Carl's younger brother looked exactly the same as the last time Tim saw him. Skinny as damn rail. The guy had practically no meat on his bones whatsoever. The tank top and shorts he wore showed off his spindly arms and legs. But his ganglingness was offset by his handsome face and bright green eyes. However, Tim was quick to notice the slight roll of pudge that was building up on his abdomen and shown off by his tight top. A quick glance at the garbage can next to Chase's computer desk would reveal the culprit as it was filled to the absolute brim with empty bags of chips, cookies, and chocolate. \"How have you been? What brings you around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been doing alright. Just graduated not too long ago. I swung by to grab some old clothes from Carl before he gave them away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, cool,\" said Chase. \"Yeah, he has tons of clothes to give away. His entire wardrobe is too big for him now. But who'd have thought that Carl would have slimmed down so much as soon as you slapped the snack cakes out of his hands?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm not complaining. What have you been up to? Any exciting plans for the summer? Oh, and happy birthday! You turned, what, 13?\" joked Tim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha,\" laughed Chase sarcastically. \"I turned 18, I'll have you know. And I'm not up to too much. I got Hammers of War the other day and I'm pretty much planning on playing that until I'm dragged kicking and screaming back to school in the fall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're not too busy raiding or whatever, we should hang out and catch up. There's this Mexican place that just opened up not too far away that I'v-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"El Burro Del Diablo?\" interrupted Chase. \"Love that place. I've pretty much been there everyday since they've opened last month. I'm a regular. One of the ladies behind the counter even has a nickname for me: El Engrosadito. Whatever that means. I took French as my language elective.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we should totally hit up that place together!\" Tim suggested. \"But I better go find Carl. He's probably looking for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but before you go...\" Chase scribbled his phone number on a scrap of paper and handed it to Tim. Tim and Chase fist bumped one more time before he went off to find Carl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late in the evening when Tim got home with his bag of clothes from Carl. He tossed the bag onto his bed and dug out the scrap of paper with Chase's number on it from his pocket. Opening the contacts app on his phone, he added Chase's information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim had forgotten what a cool and chill guy Chase was, especially in contrast to how Carl behaves sometime. Tim wanted to get to know Chase a bit better, but without Carl being there. Tim still liked Carl, no doubt, but they have been friends for so long. Yet Tim felt a little weird hanging out with just Chase and not with Carl there too.</span></div></div>",

It, much like Tim's own tray, was piled high with burritos wrapped in colorful paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The usual?\" Tim asked Chase as he bit into cheese and potato burrito of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Chase said enthusiastically as he sat down opposite to Tim and freed a burrito from its paper liner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. Why do you get so many bean burritos? You always end up stinking up my place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if it's so bad, just crack open a window.\" Chase replied, sticking out his tongue. \"Besides, they're tasty and cheap, so there's no way I'm not going to take advantage of that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the past month, Chase and Tim had been hanging out together pretty often. This was partially because the two boys got along so well and partially because Carl had less free time. Having invested in a gym membership, he had taken up weight lifting and went at least an hour everyday lifting weights. So, Tim was seeing less of his best friend but far more of his you get brother. The two would usually stuff themselves silly on greasy fast food before lazing about the rest of the day at Tim's place typically playing video games or watching movies while snacking on whatever junk food was in the house. And Tim was loving this. He felt free to eat to his heart's content around Chase. This wasn't just because Chase wasn't on a diet and would be judgemental about what Tim ate. Most of the times the two boys went out to eat, Chase would usually get an equally staggering amount of food. Such was the case with the small mountain of burritos he was about to devour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result of all of this, Tim had thicken up slightly. He noticed all of his pants were getting a bit too tight, and no belt was necessary to keep them around his waist. The boy's belly stuck out slightly more and his chest, which was already quite the handful, swelled noticably. That was quite the surprise when Tim brushed his teeth the other night and saw his moobs jiggly around. When he noticed that, he thought about hopping on his scale to see if he had put on some weight since deciding to completely give up on diets. But Tim decided against it; he no longer cared what number the scale said anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase hadn't been spared from the effects of all the gorging he did alongside Tim. The small roll of pudge he had weeks ago had balloons out into the beginnings of an actual belly. Many of his shirt were now tight around the abdomen so much so that one could easily see the outline his belly button. After filling himself up with fast food, Chase's stomach would be so round that his shirts would rise up, exposing a strip of pale belly skin as well as a view of the button of his jeans straining to hold back the expanding belly. Chase's butt, previously as flat as his stomach, was also absorbing many of the excess calories and had swollen up to the point that Chase was having some problems pulling his wallet from his back pocket. Tim frequently caught Chase pulling his underwear from his plumped butt cheeks when they were giving him a wedgie which was now happening quite often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys ate silently as they were too busy gorging themselves to carry on a conversation. The silence was broken halfway through their meal when Chase looked over his shoulders around the dinning room, scanning to see if anyone was looking in their direction. He then quickly stood up, giving Tim a glimpse of his belly straining his black t-shirt. Chase pulled up his shirt a bit and undid the button on his jeans. Giving a sigh of relief, he sat back down and begin working on another burrito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim chuckled to himself. \"Feel better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much,\" said Chase as he bit into yet another burrito. \"So, what do you want to do after this? Head over to your place or back to mine?\"</span></div></div>",

The moment Chase stepped into his room, he pulled down his jeans exposing his legs as well as his ballooning butt which again was swallowing up his black brief. He tugged the fabric loose from his cheeks and kicked the pants into a corner of his room where loads of other dirty clothes laid on the floor. As Tim closed the door behind him, Chase walked over his computer chair, picked up a pair of musky orange basketball shorts hanging off the back, and slipped them on. Pulling off his shirt, Chase let it drop to the floor and walked over to the pile of clothes. Tim caught a glimpse of his bloated gut which looked as if he had sallowed a bowling ball. Searching through the clothes, he picked up a black tank top. He sniffed the garment, shrugged his shoulders, and put it on. The bottom of the shirt didn't quite cover all of Chase's belly and left a strip of pale skin exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim hadn't been in Chase's bedroom in a while, but it was evident that he hadn't been exactly keeping things tidy. Fast food boxes were stacked up on his nightstand, his garbage can was overfollowing with junk food wrappers, and at least half a dozen empty 2L soda bottles we're stashed under his computer desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Set up the game,\" Chase said as he left the room. \"I need to get something from the fridge.\" So Tim powered upon the console and put in Knives of Justice 2 where they were going to start the multiplayer campaign. Tim then pulled the desk chair close to the large flat screen TV mounted to the bedroom wall. Chase wandered back in chugging from a large bottle of cola. He then let out a low, rumbling belch as he closed the bedroom door and lept onto his bed. Tim tossed him a controller and started their game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next two hours were quiet between Chase and Tim as they quietly concentrated their game. The silence was only broken by an occasional burp from Chase as he down more of his soda or when he lift up his leg and passed gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, gross dude!\" said Tim as he waved the stench away from his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoever smelt it, dealt it,\" Chase replied, not even looking away from the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys played their game for another hour before Tim heard the sound of a car pulling up to the house. He peaked through the bedroom window and saw it was Carl's car. Having not seen his best friend in some time, Tim thought about saying hello. However, he and Chase were having a good time together and didn't want anything to spoil it.</span></div></div>",

After they brought their luggage up to their room, they decided to check out the buffet. The  walked through the lobby, to the restaurant. They all had put on more weight during the last two weeks and it was visible. Tim had invested in some new clothes a few sizes bigger than he needed, so his clothes were pretty slag, but you could see his whole body wobble through the shirt and he started to develop a waddle. Carl was now even bigger than before his diet. He wore his biggest clothes and they were extremely tight. He couldn't even close his pants and tried to hide that with a belt. He blamed it on the washing machine. Chase was up another 20 lbs. Even though he got new clothes only a week ago, they were already tight again. His belly started so hang over his belt and jiggled as he walked, just as his small moobs. Also his lovehandles got wider, same as his legs and arms. His face was fuller as well and he now had a slight double chin.<br>\r\nThey got a table and started to load up their plates high with food. The food was excellent and after several trips to the buffet, they were completely stuffed. Tim and Chase both undid their pant buttons and Carl had to losen his belt a couple of holes.

A regular day would start around 10 with a huge breakfast in their room. Than, they would go to the pool and relax there, while being served countless 'snacks' like huge burgers with fries and giant pizzas. Around 2 they would go to the buffet and stuff themselves to the brim. When they were able to move again, back to the pool. Eating snacks there and relax. Around 5 they would go to the buffet again and again leave completely stuffed. Then pool again with snacks and buffet again at 8. After that, they would go to the bar and drink some cocktails and again eat some snacks. Around 11 they would go up to their room and order a midnight snack, that was more like a huge midnight meal. And every day they would eat a little more.<br>\r\nAfter three weeks of more and less that routine all three boys had blown up like balloons. Tim waddled out of the bathroom in the morning. Room service was already ordered. Chase got up from his bed and waddled in Tim's direction. Chase had clearly put on the most weight. He had a huge gut hanging over his waist band, large moobs and huge lovehandles. Everything wobbled when he moved. Carl was not much slimmer. He seemed to finally have accepted that he put on so much weight, cause he had bought new clothes a few sizes bigger after around one week into their stay. But now, just like Tims and Chases clothes there were way to tight. He decided to weight himself. He had weighted 230 lbs before his diet, but he knew that he was way fatter than that by now. He stepped on the scale but couldn't see past his gut. \"Tim, Chase. Could one of you give me a hand here. I can't see the numbers on the scale.\" Both boys came in. Tim red out the number. \"328. Wow, you really got fat again.\" Tim said. \"Look who's talking. It's your turn Tim.\" Tim stepped on. \"372. That's huge. You weighted like 250 after your last diet. \" Timm patted his belly and stepped of to let Chase on the scale. Carl looked down to read ot the number. It was...</span></div></div>",

They decided to ignore how far they have gotten and just enjoy their vacation.<br>\r\nOver the next 3 weeks the boys were eating more and more and everyday they got fatter and fatter. On the last day of their stay they decided to weight themselves again. Carl was 417, Tim was 429 and Chase ate himself to a huge 403 lbs. He was catching up pretty fast and was proud of that. <br>\r\nFor the flight home they all needed an extra seat in the plane.

Lying there on his bed he looked down at his gut, which looked bigger than ever since it was full of dinner and dessert. As he rubbed his full gut he remembered his boy friend Jim and how he just wanted to hug on to Jim and make all this disappointment hug away.<br>\r\nTim reached over to his bedside table and grabbed his cell phone and called up Jim. After a couple of rings, Jim finally picked up.<br>\r\n\"Hey sweetie,\" Jim greeted,\" How are you?\"<br>\r\n\"Bad,\" Tim answered directly.<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Jim said knowing what that meant. Jim had been there for the last couple of dozen diets, all resulting in short losses and sometimes gains. Always supportive, Jim always altered his eating habits around Tim to help him. If Jim was having a salad, he'd have one too, or something light. He'd also get Tim to go for a couple of walks while they were together and encourage Tim to keep at it.

Tim's thighs were closing in on being 28\" inches by themselves. All the gay movies Tim and Jim watched (Shelter, Get Real, Beautiful Thing), all featured slim guys with abs. <br>\r\n\"I know,\" Tim said frustrated, wanting to break out and just scream,\" I just can't seem to lose weight, no matter how hard I try. I'm just going to be a big fat guy for the rest of my god damn life.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh Tim..\" Jim said feeling so distant from his upset boy friend. Living on the opposite side of town and going to separate schools really didn't help. But the time the boys did get together they cherished,\" Don't worry. I'll make it up to you.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know how you're going to do that,\" Tim said wondering what magical trick his boy friend could pull.<br>\r\n\"I'm sure I'll think of something,\" Jim assured,\" When's your last exam?\"<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow,\" answered Tim knowing he had a night of studying to do.<br>\r\n\"Great, I'll think of something for tomorrow. Ok?\" asked Jim with a bit of enthusiasm in his voice.<br>\r\n\"Ok..\" Tim said rolling his eyes.<br>\r\n\"Com\u2019on Tim, cheer up!

They kept running into each other at plenty of different places.

Jim leaned in closer to his chubby boy friend, his long penis was hard and pressed against his shorts. <br>\r\nIt didn't take long before both boys were shedding their clothes and dripping precum all over themselves and the bed sheets.<br>\r\n\"Fuck you're hot,\" Tim moaned as his hands ventured over Jim's slim chest and down to his waist.<br>\r\n\"So are you,\" Jim replied and leaned closer and kissed Tim again while his hands cupped Tim's love handles.<br>\r\nTim didn't quite know how he felt. He liked how Jim, the hottest guy he had even know, was feeling up his love handles, belly, moobs and rolls more and more as he gained more weight. While Tim didn't mind all the cuddles and hugs he wondered just how much longer Jim would find him attractive if this weight gained continued. Would Jim still love him if another 20 pounds crept up on him? How about 30?? Or what if Tim got to 300 pounds, would Jim still love him?<br>\r\nIt didn't take long before Jim had a condom on his 8\" dick and was lubed up and gently inserting himself deep into Tim's wanting asshole. As Jim pumped and rocked against Tim's fat ass, Tim was left wondering what sex would be like if he weighed in at 300 pounds?<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Jim to blow his load and Tim followed. Both laid on the hotel bed and cuddled for a while, letting the orgasm fade slowly and calm down.<br>\r\n\"So are you going to tell me what happens at 8?\" asked Tim in the little spoon position with Jim's long arms wrapped around him while Jim's quiet breath brushed pass his ears and slight hard on pressed against his ass.<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" snickered Jim and held Tim closer.<br>\r\nThe two had a shower and got dressed and headed out into the big city and did a bit of shopping. They hit up a saucy boy\u2019s underwear store, one of the city\u2019s biggest comic book stores, a couple of clothing stores and went with a family owned Italian restaurant for dinner.<br>\r\nThe two boys found themselves back at the hotel room at 7:45.<br>\r\n\u201cAlmost 8..\u201d Tim said egger to know what Jim had planned.<br>\r\n\u201cI guess we should get ready then,\u201d Jim said and walked over to the suitcases and dug out the fancy clothes that the two had chosen. Tim had gone with a causal khaki shorts and a nice blue polo, Jim went with some nice pants and a button up t-shirt.<br>\r\n\u201cSo where we going?\u201d asked Tim once they were dressed.<br>\r\n\u201cCom\u2019on, I\u2019ll show you,\u201d Jim said and led the way out of the hotel.<br>\r\nAs the boys ventured further away from the hotel Tim noticed that they were getting closer to the gay district of the big city.  Tim wondered what Jim could be up to? It looked like they were headed to the less PG side of the district and closer to the more raunchy sex toy stores and bars.<br>\r\n\u201cHere we are,\u201d Jim exclaimed as they arrived at a bar called Paws and Tails, an obliviously bear bar with posters advertising an XXL event, whatever that could be.<br>\r\n\u201cA bar? How are we going to get in?\u201d Tim asked knowing both of them were clearly underage and didn\u2019t have any fake ID on them.<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I talked to the manager and told him how you were feeling down about your failed diet and said that you shouldn\u2019t be ashamed of your size and embrace it,\u201d Jim explained,\u201d Also, we\u2019re not allowed to drink.\u201d<br>\r\nTim didn\u2019t know what to say, but Jim dragged him over to the line behind a big hairy muscular guy wearing a black thong, assless chaps and a leather vest and in front of a guy with a big beer belly wearing some jeans and a white t-shirt.<br>\r\nAs the line moved up the two boys came face to face with a big beefy hairy man and a big muscular guy.<br>\r\n\u201cID?\u201d asked the muscular man.<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re on the list, Tim and Jim,\u201d Jim said pointing at the clipboard.<br>\r\n\u201cTim and Jim..\u201d said the door man looking over the list,\u201d Ah yes. Here you are. Tag them with black  Topher.\u201d<br>\r\nThe big hairy door man took out a few wrist straps and placed them on the boy\u2019s wrists.<br>\r\n\u201cBoys, no drinking. At All.\u201d commanded Topher once the wrist straps were on,\u201d If anyone starts hitting on you and you don\u2019t like them. Come tell us. We\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t become bear food.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Tim said feeling nervous of what Jim had got them into.<br>\r\nThe two entered the dimly lit club with flashing lights and loud techno music and surveyed the club. It was full of big guys. Really big guys. Tim suddenly found himself feeling pretty slim looking at the dance floor which had half a dozen guys that were easily 350 pounds or higher, a couple of  them shirtless.<br>\r\n\u201cSee why I wanted you to come and see?\u201d Jim asked.<br>\r\nTim nodded and relaxed his belly, an awful habit he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens in the club?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He couldn't believe he was being hit on by so many different people. As he continued to watch the crowd he saw that a couple of the guys approach some of the bigger guys much like how Jim approached his own. They would walk up to them and place their palms on the bigger guy's gut and as they got closer their hands would venture to the bigger guy's love handle as they went in for a kiss or hug.<br>\r\nTim felt he was being protected by Jim. Jim's arm was wrapped around Tim's shoulder and he carefully watched every slim guy to come close to the two.<br>\r\n\"See why I wanted you to come here?\" Jim asked getting behind Tim and wrapping his arms around his chubby boy friend and rested his chin on Tim's shoulder.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Tim nodded and felt Jim's hands caress his belly.<br>\r\nTim continued looking over the crowd and saw that he was still pretty slim by big guy standards.

Both boys moaning loudly as each load was unleashed. Tim slowly removed himself and collapsed down on the bed, covered in sweat and breathing heavily.

Always smiling, eating whatever he wants and making jokes about his own weight. It seems nothing can upset Jim about being overweight. Sure he didn't like shopping for clothes, but who really does? Where Tim is stuck in the mindset you have to be thin to be attracted, Jim has given up on diets and that thought. Jim has accepted he's a big guy and doesn't want to be a 'skinny little twig'. One of Jim's favorite sayings is \"Go Full Size or No Size\". Jim being full size, there's no going any smaller. <br>\r\nOf course when Tim and Jim are together Tim doesn't feel too big, in fact he feels pretty slim next to Jim. In a way it's relaxing, but every so often Tim would look at Jim's belly and realize he could easily reach that size if he let go and that kind of scared him. The two met at a local buffet, of all places.. Tim's latest diet of the time crashed and burned and he was filling the empty void in his belly that the diet created for 2 months. <br>\r\n\"Careful there, you just might catch up to me!\" Jim greeted in the buffet line as Tim piled on the goods,\" You can always come back for more, you know. I frequently do!\" With that Jim gave his belly a swat causing it to shake and Tim's face to brighten up. The two shared a meal and quickly became friends. <br>\r\nIt wasn't until their 3rd outing at a movie that the two became aware of each other's sexual preferences. As they sat in the darken movie theatre during a lame 'red text, white background' movie you know the ones), Jim's hands begun gently holding Tim's and slowly landed on his thick thigh and begun gently rubbing. By the time the movie was done the two were in a kissing frenzy. The rest is history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim walked out of his final exam and felt a weight being lifted off his shoulders, yet he felt a little sad that this was the end of his high school life. All there was left to do was return and grab his report card and attend that year end award thingy for the over achievers. As Tim walked into the early summer air he spotted Jim leaning against his big black truck. Jim was wearing some jeans and a white shirt that was a bit too small for him, as per usual.<br>\r\n\"Hey skinny,\" Jim greeted standing at the door as Tim got closer.<br>\r\n\"Nice try,\" Tim sighed and gave his boy friend a hug noticing how his fat belly pushed up and bounced against Jim\u2019s own bigger gut. Tim felt himself blush from embarrassment,\" So did you think of something?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, you bet!\" Jim nodded as they exited the embrace and looked down at Tim\u2019s belly.<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Tim asked surprised.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, get in, I'll tell you?\" Jim winked.<br>\r\nTim walked around the truck and got into the passenger side and felt the truck sink under their combined weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's Tim's idea?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He can find people easy.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok, I won't..\" Tim agrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim can't stop thinking Barry and it occupies his mind for the rest of the day, even keeps him up late at night. Tim learns from Jim that they'll meet Barry at the park at 11 am the next day and to arrive ready for a work out.<br>\r\nBoth Tim and Jim arrive at the park together and sit at the park bench close to the empty playground and it doesn't take long before a big black jeep pulls up and a big hairy guy in some green army shorts and a wife beater shows up. His wide shoulders are covered by black hair matching his shaved head and thick goatee. His wife beater does a horrible job at hiding his big thick tank of a beer gut. As he walks closer Tim can sense pride in Barry's stride, the way his way almost emphasize his belly is almost inspiring. <br>\r\n\"So this is Tim..?\" asks Barry from behind some aviator shades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of personality does Barry Bear have?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It had several kinds of food and the biggest selection of desserts Tim had ever seen. The boys walked right past the salad buffet and straight to the meat section.<br>\r\nJim was stacking his plate high with deep fried mozzarella sticks, but Tim was still looking around. It was just so much to choose from. He sees Jim is getting impatient and quickly piles up with cheese fries and some sort of meat lying next to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey find a table close to the food and digs in. Tims meat turns out to be some sort of burger, dripping with fat. It tastes really good and soon both boys are up for refill.<br>\r\nWhen they are nearly stuffed full on the food, they begin on the dessert selection. Brownies, ice cream, even deep fried snickers. Tim feels like he is getting fatter just by looking at them and he is really happy Jim took him here. He picked up a snickers and took a bite to test. The taste was amazing so he takes 5 more. He haven't quite given up getting skinny yet, but the amount of delicious food has him thinking: <i>There is to much good food in the world to worry about weight and calories.</i><br>\r\nThe first thing he does when he gets back to the table is to kiss Jim on the cheek and say: \"Thanks for taking me here.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you like it here. And nice to see you eat well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few servings of dessert both boys are so stuffed they feel ready to burst and neither feels like moving so they just sit there.

As Tim rose, Jim rolled towards him, so the two fat, stuffed guys ended up in a massive bear hug.  Tim loved the feeling of Jim against him, and this kind of bear hug always left him a little aroused, as his fat flesh melded with Jim's fatter flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That feels so good,\" Jim remarked.  \"Let's head back to my place - I'll drive - and we can carry on there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short walk out to Jim's car took a long time, as Tim alternated between leaning heavily on Jim's support and gently groping Jim.
