The buzzing of the small alarm clock that sat on your dresser near the edge of the bed.  You lazily lifted your arm and dropped it onto the snooze button. You didn't want to get up, you were already comfortable under the blanket. You looked over to the end of the mattress only to see your cat turning her head toward you, a little upset that she was woken up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually got up, standing in nothing but your soft pajamas. You grabbed your clothes you prepared for the night before and started heading into the bathroom.  Taking your sweet time, you eventually got into the shower to begin your daily routine.  The cold water splashed on your face as it sprayed all over your toned body.  After minutes of cleaning yourself, you stepped out of the shower and took a good look at yourself in the full length mirror while drying yourself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough your body didn't really match the description of a 'twig', it was a close comparison.  Your round face could only match that great smile of yours, with hair growing only past your shoulders by about an inch.  Your breasts 'hanging' out as their size is only described as 'cup size B.'  Your stomach being flat and toned due to the healthy diet you've been on for years, giving out a inward curve to your hips.  Not much they did anyways with your flat ass, going down to your toned thighs as your whole body is being stood by your petite feet. Nope, puberty really didn't do you much good. Maybe someday that'll change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finished your daily routing as usual.  Slipping on the outfit, only to brush your teeth, comb and dry the hair, and to put on a good dose of make-up. You soon exited the bathroom only to have your cat quickly follow you behind.  You opened the front door and reached out to grab the morning paper.  You flipped it open on the table and left it there as you got yourself a bowl of cereal. You couldn't leave the cat out of this either.  You reached into the cabinet where you kept the cat food, and poured a small bit into her bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glanced at the paper as you placed your first spoonful into your mouth. Big bold letters stating 'GRAND OPENING!' appeared on the headline, with a picture of the new mall under it.  You knew there was construction going on by your house for the past three months.  You figured they'd finished building it eventually, but so soon? You didn't really care.  It was hard enough trying to get some peace and quiet around the neighborhood with all that noise going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had nothing planned today, other than to read some boring articles in the paper.  You might take a swim in the pool, but definitely not this early.  You might as well go to the mall today as see what it's like. Probably need to leave soon so that you don't run into a big crowd planning the same thing.  You cleaned up after breakfast and grabbed your purse.  It was a nice day out and the mall was just around the corner, shouldn't take more than ten minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back later Bee.\" you said to your cat, who only looked up at you, swaying her tail side to side. You stepped out and locked the door behind you.  You started only walking toward the mall only to be greeted by a large banner hanging above the doors.  You entered the mall and, just liked you hoped, found that it was practically empty. Might as well look around.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decided to enter the clothing department. You planned on buying some new outfits for the summer anyway. You walked in the store and saw Karen walking down an aisle. She instantly looked at you and turned her head, pretending she didn't notice you.  She was always the shy kid in the group. In all honesty, you found it a little cute. But you decided to looked around the aisles for something new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that every aisle is strangely marked, all of the clothing being different. Most of the clothing didn't seem right. You walked down the weight aisle first as saw all different kinds of outfits in different shapes and sizes. The outfits were displayed from smallest to largest, something you noticed was that there weren't really many small outfits to choose from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then went down the aisle that was labeled 'gender.'  The rows were split into two, one half labeled 'Men', the other 'Women.' A detail you noticed in the women's section was that it had a section full of bras and panties with clothing of all sizes, some so enormous you didn't believe they could fit anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the 'age' aisle, different outfits of all kinds of shapes and sizes.  The clothing were displayed from outfits of younger kids to older adults.  There were diapers and baby clothing. Kid shirts and teenage outfits.  More mature looking uniforms and business suits for a more older look.  Smooth dresses and suspenders, canes, and walkers options for the much older look. Very strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn to the 'size' aisle, it got even weirder.  Like the weight aisle, it was displayed from smallest to largest. Outfits that were as small as your hand ranged all the way to outfits that were as big as giants. An employee noticed you browsing the aisles and decided to walk up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there. I noticed you're looking around the aisles. Do you need help looking for anything?\" said the man with the name tag saying 'Taylor.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thank you.\" you replied. \"Just looking around for a summer outfit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the dressing rooms are around the corner. Feel free to try on anything you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to go back to a certain aisle to try on an outfit that might look good on you.  Which aisle do you go back to?</span></div></div>",

You looked through the steel racks looking for a certain outfit hanging on one of the metal hangers. You finally found it. The bright pink T-shirt with the red heart-shaped patterns on them, along with the jean shorts that were cut off above the knee.  You took the outfit and walked straight to the dressing rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you set the outfit on the door hook, you noticed a number sticking out of the shirt with a number on it. You took a closer look and saw that the number was clearly.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You expected there to be a number to be in a dress size scale or at least in inches, but for some reason the clothing read \"250\". Perplexed, you held the shirt up to your chest to do an eye measurement. Sure, it was a little big, it might make a good sleeping shirt, but it wasn't huge. Taylor, the employee, took notice to the confused look on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something the matter, miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...Is this number right? Do you guys do some sort of weird measurement scale?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor gave a short laugh. \"Something like that. This is your first time in the mall isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou furrowed your brow, slightly annoyed that he seemed to be molding you as some sort of confused tourist. \"Yeah, so what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. Just trust me when I say you'll have no problem with fitting in any of our clothing, I guarantee it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was almost like he was calling you fat. You huffed and threw the outfit over your shoulders, determined to prove him wrong. \"Whatever. Where's the changing room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jabbed his thumb towards several doors on the far wall behind him. You stormed past him with clothing in hand and slammed the door shut behind you. You had half a mind to report that guy to his employer for being rude, but you turned to the task at hand. If these clothes didn't fit, which you were positive they wouldn't, you were going to give him such a hard time he'd regret picking fun at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stripped down to your bra and panties, tossing the outfit you were wearing in a heap to the side. The jean shorts you picked out might as well go on first, you stretched them out by the waist to find that it almost was as long as your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have gotten a belt...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't even need to unbutton them, they were so big. All you had to do was step in them and pull them up. Of course, there was no way they could rest on your hips beginning as large as they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pff, I knew it. That bastard's gonna have hell to pay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to pull it down when you felt a weird tingle in your legs. You were beginning to feel really odd and...heavier down below. Maybe you were just lightheaded, you sat down on the bench in the changing to a far more cushion-like seat than you expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. I gotta lay off those burgers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you realized that you were rising off the bench ever so slightly. You looked down at your legs and let out a squeak of surprise. Your lower body was inflating out like a balloon! The perfect legs you spent hours working on every week were disappearing from your very eyes! Your thighs and legs widened with fat as the pants that had been falling off your waist just moments ago were now fitting snugly. Though your panties were digging into your plump crotch now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you could do was just stare at your legs for a moment. You closed your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...This is a dream. It didn't happen. You'll just wake up falling out of bed as usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened them but were still greeted by a pair of massive legs underneath a tight looking jean shorts. Logically, there was no way this could happen. There was no scientifically plausible  way putting on a simple pair of pants could make you overweight from the waist down. But why was your heart racing so much? You weren't actually getting a thrill out of this, were you? After all, you spent most of your life staying in shape and watching what you ate. This wasn't how you normally acted, this whole situation wasn't normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet...You couldn't help but feel a hint of excitement out of this. You had just physically changed yourself in an instant. There was a rush of adrenaline from the power behind the ability to alter yourself at will. Is that what these clothes did? Change people?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock at the door interrupted your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything alright in there, miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a pause, you responded...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You responded by kicking the door down right on top of poor Taylor. Your predicament ultimately was the result of one thing, the bastard who was twitching due to being crushed underneath the door didn't tell you what the clothes did. Normally you weren't the violent type unless something REALLY pissed you off. Watching your well-toned legs disappear before your eyes just happened to be on that list. Eyes seething with rage, you stepped off the door and lifted the frightened Taylor up by the collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT! DID! YOU! DO!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I didn't do a-anything, I swear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began to violently shake him. \"Liar! You never told me what these clothes did! Do you know how much effort it was to keep myself in shape all these years!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I can only imagine, m-ma'am...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FIX. THIS.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely! Just please, put me down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou loosened your grip and Taylor came toppling to the floor, gasping for air. You cracked your knuckles, not taking your eyes off of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" He said between deep breaths. \"All you have to do is take the your pants off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slugged him right across the face. \"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean it like that! I meant that if you take off the outfit you put on, you'll return to your normal self! I promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glared at him, he yelped and hid behind the counter. Satisfied that he wouldn't try anything funny, you stomped off to another changing room with a working door, grabbing your old jeans and the remaining outfit from the previous room. Once you were in, you kept the door opened a crack to keep an eye on Taylor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short jeans were a little hard to get off around your thick waist. You didn't want to admit it, but you had an impressive butt like this though being skinny waist up made it seem almost comical. Once you slipped them off your pear-shaped thighs though, they flopped to the ground around your legs. Your legs started to revert back to their old form in an instant. In less than five seconds the damage that had been done was no existent. Sighing in relief, you put on your old jeans and walked out to find Taylor still cowering behind the cash register.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggled innocently. \"Um...Sorry about that. I guess I got a little freaked out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alittle!? You went berserk! I thought I was going to die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Well, I hope there's no hard feelings...So, every outfit in this store changes you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor cleared his throat, trying his best to seem professional. \"Yes, all clothing here will fit you no matter what size you are because it physically changes your body to match it. Anything from height, weight, gender, or age can be manipulated to suit whatever desire you wish. Nothing is permanent, you will revert back to normal once you take the clothing off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's...odd...But at least it's safe. Are there any normal stores here in this mall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I doubt it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" You said, looking down at the outfit in your hands. You were starting to get it. The tag read 250 because it was in the weight section. 250 was the size of the body that it was supposed to give you in pounds. You shuddered to think what would have happened if you grabbed a 600 or more by mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little pinch of excitement you had when you looked down and saw your legs had blown up like sausages was starting to really nag the back of your head. You could alter your body as much as you wanted with no consequences. It seemed to be a tempting offer and there was a deep carving for it in the pit of your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling you said to Taylor...</span></div></div>",

And though you'd never admit it, it was exciting to walk around uninhibited and overweight; being the complete opposite of how you always went about your life and having the power to change right back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor rolled his eyes, as if expecting that answer. \"Take your time then. I'll be here to answer any questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you were already nose deep in the racks of clothing before he could finish speaking. Taylor scuffed and pulled out his cellphone to begin texting; seeing as you lost interest to what he had to say and he was sure you'd stay out of trouble now that you knew the power of the clothing in the store, there didn't seem to be much need to keep an eye on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went straight for the Weight aisle again, picking up a few outfits that looked kind of cute. There wasn't much need to pay attention to the tags considering it was all going to fit you anyway, and it didn't take long before you were literally carrying a mountain of various outfits that were all different shapes and sizes. You were sure to get everything too, from bras to shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Taylor looked up from his cellphone at you approaching the register, he had a surprised look on his face. \"Do you...Have the money for all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How rude! Of course I do.\" You said as you pulled out a credit card. With the money from your grandparents you could probably buyout the whole store and still have plenty of money to spare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...It's your cash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took several minutes to ring everything up and even longer for the both of you pack everything in bags. There was only one question left...Wear one of the new outfits here or wait until you got home?</span></div></div>",

You drape the shirt over you as watch the magic happen. You look down past the shirt and feel your waist bloating up. You soon have a belly, and then a gut spilling over your lap like dough. You feel the sleeves against your arms as they sag down to gravity. You start to poke your arm, only to notice your fingers puffed up like little sausages. The changes stop as you somehow feel your underwear loosen up, as if they just grew with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up and take a good look in the mirror. Your cheeks are puffed out a bit and you now have a double chin. The outfit fit you perfectly now. Wait, was that what Taylor meant? That it would fit you no matter what. You looked like someone that weighed 250 pounds...the same number that was on the tag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no reaction to this, simply because you didn't know how to react! On one hand, all the hard work you spent keeping a toned body, was now pointless, all thanks to a bunch of weird clothes that had no scientific explanation of doing this to you. On the other hand, you didn't have to worry about that anymore! With a plus, you now have your breasts and ass you've always wanted.

This left you somewhat confused but at the same time grateful she didn't know who you were. While this new and unique power with the clothing would be fun to play with, the last thing you would want was for anyone to know who you were while you were super-sized. Shrugging, you turned to the matter at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as Karen was still in the store (and still watching you while blushing through a rack of clothing), you couldn't just change back to your old clothing and walk out without her knowing who you were. Maybe with some persuasiveness, that Taylor guy would let you walk out with the outfit on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForming the plan in your head, you stepped out with your old outfit under your chubby arm and headed straight for the cash register. Taylor, who was busy texting, looked up at you and asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything to your liking, miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...In fact I was wondering if I could just pay for it right now and walk out with it on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor laughed, as if people always asked the question. \"Sure, sure. Let me just take the tags off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a pair of scissors and snipped the '250' tags on both the shirt and pants then he swiped the tags on the scanner. You quickly paid the price and thanked Taylor then you quickly left the store.

It wasn't completely obvious, but it was certain that she had an interest in following you and tried not to be noticed by you. You eventually went down the long seperate hallway that led to the restrooms and the main office. After seeing that they were the only places you could go, you realized that you made the mistake of going down a dead end. You went into the women's restroom and grunted as you saw your new fattened reflection in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now had to face this problem dead on. You coudln't change into your old outfit, then Karen would definitely put two and two together. You had to go out the hall eventually where Karen would sure to be waiting for you. Hopefully, she won't recognize you. Even if she does, she really not one to blab about everything like Cassandra. If you asked her to keep this all a secret, she most likely would due to being so shy.

Everything seemed to be incredibly normal however the tag of all things seemed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me ma'am, are you here for the changing rooms?\" A women said wearing a neat blue dress.

Are there any rooms open?\" You say looking down the aisle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wouldn't mind me checking the tag quickly.\" The women said. You passed her over the dress, she'd quickly read over the tag and began leading you to the far left aisle.

Just as you reach the center of the room the women closes the door behind you leaving nothing but you, the suit and the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets see here...\" You say as you begin taking off your current clothes. Your suit seemed to fit perfectly, without it even being labeled as a small it just seemed to slip right on. \"This is so weird...\" You mutter to yourself.

Your gut, which had once been a nice slim figure was growing immensely. The longer you stood more real it felt until eventually it stopped.

At least you might be able to know how much you weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you step on the true impact of your weight kicks in, the feeling of being overweight was surprising as it was completely alien to you.

The cashier put the book in a plastic bag and handed it to you, when you heard a familiar voice from behind you. \"Hey, I thought I saw you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around and saw the man you secretly have a crush on. \"Oh, hi Bryce. What're you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got bored.  I just came to the mall to see what all the fuss was about. Nothing's really impressed me so far though.  What're you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same. I don't see much to do here either. Though I'd go back home and take a swim later.\" You said the last sentence in importance, hoping to hear a certain question from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I come over today? There's just nothing to do today.\" YES! He's coming over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I don't mind. Just get your swim suit and come over.\" You both exited the bookshop as he glanced at the plastic bag you were holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what book did you get anyway.\" You felt so foolish right now! For some reason, the book was so intrigued to you, you didn't even look on the spine to see what the book was called.  It was like, a force urged you to buy it.  You pulled the book out of the bag and read the title.</span></div></div>",

You feel something cold resting over your forehead. You lifted you arm to take the cool washrag off your head, but something didn't feel right. Your arm felt heavier than usual and your hand felt thicker when you rubbed your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered that Bryce was here, lifting your head up to see if he still was. However, your view was partially blocked by two giant orbs covered somewhat by a towel. You try to sit up, only to have Bryce suddenly come at your side. \"Hey, take it easy, not so fast.\" he calmly said. He helped you sit up with some difficulty as the towel slid down to the ground. You looked down at your body. God, your breasts looked bigger than Cassandra's, but it came with a heavy price. Your large belly wobbled as you shifted to sit more comfortably on the couch, keeping your well-sized breasts propped up..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slid your hands over your hefty love-handles resting on your wide, soft hips toward your rear. It's much more plump and wider than it used to be. You shook your legs a bit, and realized that your thighs were touching. You looked back to Bryce and saw that he was looking the other direction. You blush when you instantly saw that you basically burst out of your favorite bikini. You fold your meatier arms over your enormous breasts. There was no problem covering your bottom area, since your huge stomach spills over it. \"What....what happened?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fainted a few minutes ago. I carried you over to the couch before you got too, um..., heavy.\" He reached over to the end table and grabbed a glass of ice liquid. \"Here, drink some water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept your big girls covered with one arm and took the glass to take a sip. \"How big did that spell make me?\" you wondered, not remembering the number he stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I set the spell to make you 300 pounds, but I...I didn't think it would actually work! I had no idea magic would exist,  and be so simple too! I'm so sorry I did this to you. But the book has to have some reversal spell or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't blame you Bryce, I didn't think it was real either. I mean, it has to have some way to fix this. Oh God, you must think I'm hideous now with all this fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dropped your head down and was surprised when you heard him say.....</span></div></div>",

While he was usually about four inches taller than you, you were now at about eye level, but that was the least of your worries. Longer hair droops over her face, hanging down to her shoulders. You could still tell that it was Bryce by looking at her face, but it was much more feminine now. From the shape of her shirt, you realized that there must have been a pair of small breasts beneath it. You also noticed that his whole body structure was different now, where his once broas shoulders and muscles used to be, were now replaced by thinner arms and narrow shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryce noticed that the swim trunks were way lower than normal now. Down below the waist and hanging right on her hips. Bryce placed his hand over them, then quickly took it away, too creeped out at the fact that something wasn't there anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God,\" you said as you placed your hand over your mouth with shock. \"Those spells really worked.

Even as a girl, Bryce looked sexy. You may be a bi-sexual, but you wouldn't want him to be trapped in a different body forever. This also wasn't really a conversation started to try to get in a relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, there are plenty of spells in here. We can change you back anytime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's a relief,\" she sighed. \"Do you mind if you could read the spell that fixs this?\"</span></div></div>",

As he said, 100 feet tall is written on the page. <br>\r\n\"No way,\" you say, pacing the room, your 6'8\" form knocking into things on accident. You can already see on top of all the shelves in the room, and the ceiling feels dangerously close. But 100 feet? \"Read it.\"<br>\r\n\"What?\" Bryce asks.<br>\r\n\"Read the spell!\"<br>\r\n\"But...what if we can't reverse it? And the house...\" You grab him by the hand and drag him out the door, ducking at the doorway so your forehead doesn't knock into it. You let go of him once you're outside and stand in the middle of the yard. <br>\r\n\"Read it!\" <br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n\"Come on, there's always a reverse. Now read it!\" Bryce hesitates, then repeats the spell.<br>\r\n\"Height so tall, height so great, please let me grow to 100 feet!\" This time, you feel a massive tingling begin in your body. Next, warmth spreads through every muscle in your body. Finally, you feel a stretching sensation, and you begin to lengthen. Your arms stretch out, your legs sprout out, and your head rises. Soon, Bryce is down to your knees, and then your ankle. You pass the house quickly and you finally stop at 100 feet. Your clothes luckily kept themselves on, seemingly growing with you. You look down, way down, and see the punt Bryce, the book having dropped to the ground. He is half the size of your foot, the car he is next to also being dwarfed by your titanic size. Your house is knee sized now, and you can't help but laugh. You see Bryce backing away, but you quickly snatch him with your fist and raise him to your face. Bryce is trembling as you open your hand, the book still on the ground. <br>\r\n\"Well...this is impressive!\" You say. This mere action causes Bryce to cover his ears. \"Sorry,\" you whisper. \"Have to get used to that!\" <br>\r\n\"You're gigantic!\" He shouts. <br>\r\n\"I know! It feels fantastic too!\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Well, let's shrink you back down before someone gets hurt...\" <br>\r\n\"Actually...I'd like to stay this size for a while.\"<br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n\"No, I want to...\"</span></div></div>",

Just because you're big doesn't you mean you can do whatever you want...\"<br>\r\n\"We'll see about that.\" You place Bryce on your shoulder, and he ties himself to you with your hair. Smiling, you begin walking towards school. The ground shakes with every step you take, people run inside your houses, hoping they will be spared. Fortunately, you don't care about any of them. Your sights are on something else. As you walk, a car nearly drives into your foot, and the driver jumps out seconds before you step on it, crushing his vehicle as if it is paper. You frown, feeling something on your foot, and you lift it up to peel the car off. \"Gross.\" You drop the flattened car next to the driver and walk on, not caring to apologize to the man. <br>\r\nBefore long you reach the school, and already people are panicking. You stop at the entrance, grinning as you watch teachers and students run inside from their recess, hiding from your gaze. You also see a few teachers run out of the front, booking it for their cars. \"Ah, we have some runners!\" You quickly stomp on the cars in the parking  lot, nearly crushing a teacher as he is inches away from your foot. He scrambles back into the building, the other teachers following him. \"We can't have people escaping. Let's stop any further brave souls...\" You reach for a school bus, picking it up with one hand, and you thrust it into the school doors, making escape impossible there. Taking one large step, you clear the building and do the same for the rear. \"There. You're all staying here, got it?\" Your voice echoes across the school, and though you cannot hear an answer you know you have their attention. <br>\r\n\"Hey, that's enough. We shouldn't do this.\"<br>\r\n\"Bryce, lighten up! This is for you!\"<br>\r\n\"But...just don't hurt anyone okay?\" You wink at Bryce, then squat down at one corner of the building.<br>\r\n\"This corner should be...\"</span></div></div>",

Looks like all that gym time paid off!\" Peering into the room, you're glad to see that the exits have been blocked by falling debris, and now the twenty or so students and two teachers are at your mercy. Taking a seat, your legs extended along the walls, you lean over the wall like a child looking in at her toys.<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do to them?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, let's see here. Oh! Coach Jason!\" You extend a hand and snatch the diminutive coach. Normally a towering individual at 6'3\", he is is merely the size of your finger, barely able to put up a fight against your gigantic digits. <br>\r\n\"Let go of me!\"<br>\r\n\"Aw, is the coach scared of little old me? The girl you said would never make it in any gym class? Well, look at me now!\" You hold him in front of your face, his head pinched between your thumb and finger. <br>\r\n\"Ah...please it hurts!\" <br>\r\n\"It better! I went through a lot of pain in your classes because of how much you pushed me! Now you get to experience that! Go on, break free tough guy!\" The coach fights, slamming his fists into your fingertip, but you feel none of it. He tries pulling himself out, but your grip is too strong and he yelps in pain as you push together. <br>\r\n\"PLEASE! IT HURTS!\" Frowning, you drop him after lowering your hand to the gym floor. He curls up once he makes contact with the floor, and you can faintly hear him sobbing. <br>\r\n\"Look at that! Your strong coach, crying on the ground!

You open the book and read.<br>\r\n\"Height so tall, height so great, please let me grow to 1000 feet!\" The world suddenly starts to spin. You barely hear Bryce scream, then you're shooting up. Your entire body is on fire as you smash through the house, obliterating it as you rocket past 100...200...by 300 feet you're crushing the neighborhood. 400...500...600...the pleasure is indescribable. You moan as you continue expanding...700...800...900...you finally stop, reaching 1000 feet. You open your eyes, still getting over the absolute pleasure you just experienced. Looking around, you're astounded at the sights. No house even comes up to your ankles. Your house is now obliterated, and you can't tell if Bryce lived or not. You bend down, getting as close to the ground as you can. Your massive face dwarfs all, and you can barely make out small details. Luckily, you see Bryce with the book in hand. <br>\r\n\"HEY BRYCE, IT WORKED!\" Your voices shatters windows as the volume of it is too great. Bryce falls to the ground in pain, and you frown. You carefully pinch him between two fingers and you drop him into your other palm. \"Hey, sorry!\" you whisper. Looking around, you notice there is total chaos due to you simply existing. Already you can see the national guard showing up, but you giggle. Their tanks are barely the size of your toes. \"Well, looks like I'm drawing some attention! I think others deserve to see me though...let's go...\" </span></div></div>",

You're coming to Cassandra's birthday next week, right? Practically everyone's been invited.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your face scrunch a little. You <i>hated </i>Cassandra. She was one of those prissy girls obsessed with material goods, the sort who didn't put a filter on her mouth when speaking to other people. \"...I didn't know anything about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" he patted on your shoulder. \"I'm sure she's let you in if you come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it was having your crushes' hand on your shoulder that made your heart suddenly skip a beat, but you found your mouth moving on its own. \"I'd love to, Bryce!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terrific! I'll swing by your place around noonish on Tuesday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great...,\" your brain was now catching up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to go get my trunks. I'll meet you at all the pool in an hour, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day went on as Bryce and you planned. You hung out at the pool for a little bit while Bryce jumped around in the deep end like he was a little kid. You were too embarrassed to be wearing a bikini, being the twig that you were, so you stuck to a one piece. At least Bryce didn't seem to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't even get the chance to look at the book you had bought until later in the evening. You were mostly caught up with the party you had agreed to go to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even like that bitch,\" you mumbled to yourself as you fixed yourself a salad for dinner. \"What in the world did I say yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryce's casual smiling face flashed around your mind, reminding you why your brain had taken a five-o-clock coffee break. You supposed you could always just make up an excuse, but you didn't want to risk it. Being your neighbor, and a friend to all of your friends, Cassandra would probably take any excuse you gave Bryce as a sort of snub. She was so petty that she would probably hold a vendetta against you. But if you went...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides from being an airhead with no personality, Cassandra had a body that could rock a mini skirt. She was as skinny as you, but had also been blessed with big friends. The girl was practically built like a Barbie doll. And it didn't help that you caught Bryce glancing at her rack on occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groped yourself before chowing down on lettuce. \"Who'd want big breasts, honestly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't even fooling yourself, you knew that you carved to be the center of attention with a curvy body. But another dreaded thought occurred you, yanking you away from your big boobed fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's probably going to want a present or she's not gonna let me into the party...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment that you realized you had been eating your dinner on top of the bag containing the book you had bought earlier. You ran your fingers over the intricate carvings, it was only now you noticed they formed a sort of shape. It seemed...female?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a closer look. The etchings did look strangely like one of those fat female idols people would sometimes find in neanderthal caves. The pages were really delicate and old, the paper left dust on your fingers. You only glanced at the first page and read the wording out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Property of Marigold Underwood, Witch.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes. A person like you would be the first to scoff at the unexplained like magic. You should have known this is what the store meant by spellbook section. Maybe you could fool Cassandra in taking this piece of junk off your hands for your birthday. Then again, there was no harm in reading further. Was there?</span></div></div>",

At best, it would end up as a decoration in your room, a trinket to spark a conversation. But while you weren't interested in the fantasy of magic, history was another matter. Maybe this book really belonged to one of the old Salem witches or perhaps a pagan. It certainly looked old enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriosity was suddenly renewed, and you delved deeper into the book's contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were disappointed. Beyond the first page with the owner's information, all the pages were blank. You scoffed and considered tossing the book at the wall for being a waste of money, but you eventually reached the last page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the world is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the center of the page was what could only be described as a circular rune with a pentagram in the middle. It didn't look evil, as most pentagrams in movies were, but almost refined and precise. The ink almost seemed to glow and words surrounded the rune. Some were in another language that you barely registered as Latin, but there were a few words in English upside down below the pentagram.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Place hand...,\" you read. \"...And speak Boreas...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps this was some sort of spell. Staring deep at the rune, you suddenly noticed the faint outline of a human hand in the ink. Without thinking you pressed your hand against the page, finding that the hand outline was the same size as your own hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must be part of a ritual or something. Honestly, who believes this stuff? And what's this Boreas-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't get to finish as at that moment that runes shined with a blinding blue light. There were no windows open in your apartment, but the wind scattered debris around in the kitchen. You felt your hair blow up the top of your head as the wind formed into a tornado surrounding you. Though you wanted to put the book down and run, you found that you couldn't. It was almost like it had been glued to your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the wind ceased in an instant and you could remove the book from your palm.

The air around you seemed to give her shape, her entire body pulsed with the shinning blue light from the runes. As she completely stepped out of the book, the light peeled off of her, exposing her pale skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a redhead, her hair was so scarlet that you would have mistaken it for being dyed. Her face looked perfect, no wrinkles or blemishes like it had been Photoshopped. And she had a better, more curvaceous, body than Cassandra. This was very noticeable to you, as she was completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed at the sight of her as she opened her jade colored eyes and said. \"Salutationes mortale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cocked your head. \"...Eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl furrowed her brow and said something else. \"\u05de\u05d4 \u05d3\u05e2\u05ea\u05da \u05e2\u05dc \u05d6\u05d4?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you replied. \"Now I really didn't understand that at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" said the redhead. \"You speak English.

Naked, I might add!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman crossed her arms, glaring at you. \"Is there something wrong with the naked female form? In my time, artists lusted to portray my perfect beauty and printed me on everything from books to vases.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nowadays that's called pornography.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman huffed. \"Look, this argument is pointless. Let's start over: Greetings mortal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still distracted by the attractive nude woman standing in your kitchen, but decided to play along to get some answers. You offered your hand for a shake. \"Huh...Hello.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman just stared at your palm like you had sneezed in it. \"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A handshake...You grab my hand and move it up and down. It's a greeting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How whimsical,\" she mumbled and awkwardly obeyed your command. \"Tell me, mortal, what year is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...It's 2013.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truly? Almost 400 years...I have been gone a long time. May I borrow some garments to cover myself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clothes...I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter collecting some sweatpants and shirt to cloth the woman, you returned to discover her playing with the television mumbled about how odd the device seemed. You completely surprised her when you grabbed the remote and turned it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is magic now accessible to all mortals? Who broke the creed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady, this isn't magic, it's technology. Now here's some clothes. Who the heck are you?\" You tossed her the outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name from my last emergence was Marigold Underwood,\" she replied as she clumsily stretched out the pants to put them on. She didn't take her eyes off the TV, still fascinated by it. If you read the book, then you must know what I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A witch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that was what they called me in Salem. Then again, they called anyone who looked at them funny. Even tried to drown me several times, but where always confused as to why I'd never sink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly realized that you were looking at a creature of the mythical element. Something you didn't even think could exist. \"Then...W-What are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A human, well at a time. I was once a know-nothing girl such as yourself but I stumbled upon...,\" she voice trailed off. \"Anyway that's not important. Thank you for the clothing, young one. I bid thee farewell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd without another word she headed for your apartment door. Your brain was too busy catching up, but you managed to shout out. \"Hold on a second! You're just going to leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you supposed to give me a wish or... Something!? I mean I freed you or something, didn't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarigold paused and bit her lip slightly. \"Yes, I suppose you did free me from the sleep. Though you wouldn't be the first. I don't recall ever rewarding the people who've done it in the past. Most have just looked at me with their mouths agape, too stunned to say anything. You're very unusual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the unusual one! There's was nothing logical about walking out of a book!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I suppose not to you. Very well then, I'll offer my services to you for a time as thanks, but only because you are so brash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Services,\" you asked. \"What can you even do besides trap yourself in books?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her eyes at you and casually snapped her fingers. \"Just this. Behold the powers of Boreas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened for a few seconds but then you noticed that...</span></div></div>",

It was the same sensation you'd get after you ate a full Thanksgiving dinner then stretched. Your moved your hands to your belly and gently patted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's...Happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My gift, or so I've been told. Keep still or you'll miss the best part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to question what she meant when you were suddenly overcome with an even stranger sense in your abdomen. Your stomach was lightly tickling your normally loose shirt. Perplexed, you reached down again only to find your hands met with your shirt far more quickly than usual. Something was out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding your breath, you kept absolutely still as Marigold requested, spreading your fingers around your belly. There was slightly more pudge there than there normally was. You knew you hadn't been working out lately, but this felt like a couple of weeks worth of vegging. There was a resistant to your palms, as a growing force lurched them further away from your center. That's when you came to the most immediate conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm growing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An astute observation, though only the surface. Boreas is the god of the north wind and change. In reality, you're filling up with air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarigold snapped her fingers again and you hiccuped a little. As you did, your stomach surged forward about an inch. \"Air?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, this is his gift to me and it is mine to give to anyone.\" She snapped her fingers once more, adding another inch to your waistline. You now looked like a pregnant girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did want any sane person would do in a situation like this. You panicked. \"Stop it! Turn me back to normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish.\" She snapped again for the last time. In an instant, your belly flattened to its normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathed a heavy sigh of relief, though you couldn't help but feel somewhat disappointed that the sensation had vanished. But you didn't show it and instead grabbed Marigold around the collar. \"Don't you ever use that on me again. I mean, who would want to be blown up like a balloon!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the stomach isn't the only thing I can inflate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarigold closed her eyes in breathed in deeply. As she did, something moved underneath her sweatshirt. Like with your stomach, you saw Marigold begin to grow only it was her belly. It was her chest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer already massive breasts were becoming huge, and the size of basketballs. When she reached an impossible size, she stopped and started handling them. They seemed to bounce unnaturally up and down like they were full of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Air.\" You mumbled, feeling the temptation to touch them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can create air in any part of the body. I can even cause someone to expand to gigantic sizes, though I've never tried making them larger than a building.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were speechless. It took several minutes for your mind to register everything that had transpired. But you could only say one thing when you found your tongue again.</span></div></div>",

As you continue to shovel the cake in your mouth, your body continues to grow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cant stop...uhhh.\" You moan. You have eaten almost half the cake, and your body shows it. Your back is in immense pain trying to contain your EEE Breasts. Your bra has stretched out and there is a gap of jiggly flesh. Your belly has split into 2 folds, the bottom being bigger than the top one. You cant see your expanding belly because it is under the table, but your breasts are restricting your ability to eat. Now the biggest part of you is your ass. You have felt it growing faster and faster than the rest of your body, and you have no idea how the chair is holding the expanse of flesh. Your ass is seeping through the cracks of the chair, and is overflowing the sides of it. You have risen up quite a bit, and you would take up two chairs of there were any around you. Your thighs are ginormous, and your belly is being squeezed by them because they are too big to spread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...I cant keep eating...But its so good. ohhh.\" You groan. It doesn't hurt, but you have always been skinny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cake soon dissipates into your giant fleshy body. You stand up and feel yourself jiggle. Your boobs are now huge GGG, and your belly is now in three folds. You grab your belly and moan in pleasure before looking behind you. You see your huge ass sticking out many feet behind you, and your hips cant fit through normal doorways anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk back up to the chef with some trouble. You are in complete pleasure from your jiggling body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey chef...\" You say looking at your belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you have eaten the cake.\" He said lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was so good chef.\" You say rubbing your belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well do you want another?\" The chef asks with a devious smile.\"   </span></div></div>",

You don't even use a fork, you just stuff your fat face full of the delicious chocolate. After you've finished the first few cakes, your clothes give way to your ever-expanding body, but you couldn't care less. You just keep eating and eating as the chef and the customers look on in awe. Your entire body is growing to unbelievabe proportions. Your arms swell with fat, your face develops multiple chins, your hands gain weight so rapidly that your fingers are left looking like pudgy sausages...Your butt continues to be enormous, and the chair soon collapses, leaving you gaining on the floor. Your legs grow massive, your boobs balloon until they look like giant beach balls, but the most impressive part of your fattening body is your belly. Your belly is absolutely ENORMOUS. Rolls upon rolls of fat continue to grow as your massive belly pushes forward. You nearly take up the entire bakery by the time you're finished all the cakes. You can barely speak because of all the fat on your face, and moving a single part of your body is impossible. You grunt in hopes that the chef will bring you even more cake, but all he can do is stare at you in shock. Finally, one of the customers comes over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you...you're massive...\" he whispers. \"You're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you find his compliment very nice, all you can think of right now is getting more food, and with a body as big as yours, it's no wonder that your appetite is HUGE. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love your body so much...\" he says. \"I'd treat you like a princess, I'd do anything for you.

However, after having finished the entire Muffin you begin to feel quite woozy. Unaware that your entire face has turned a dark blue color. Slowly, you walk over to the chef and thank him for the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill woozy you head for the exit. Just before you reach the door you begin to feel a growing pain in your midsection. You turn and look for the nearest seat. Grudgingly you make your way over to the nearest chair and sit down, grasping at your stomach. After a few seconds of holding onto your gut the pain turns from a tight string to a more refined bloating feeling. Confused, you lift up your shirt to not only see that your gut is very slowly growing outward, but your entire body has turned a dark blue color!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver by the counter, the chef watches as you begin to semi-freak at the realization that you\u2019ve begun inflating. With a giddy tone in his walk and voice he makes his way over to your seat, standing nearly a meter away from the slowly growing girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see you\u2019ve discovered what happens when you eat one of our Blueberry Muffins!\u201d He chips. You turn your head over to the chef who is currently standing over you. A feeling of hatred and regret wash over you as you contemplate what exactly is happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mustn't worry about it too much dear, it\u2019s completely harmless! It will however, take quite some time to wear off so you\u2019d best get comfortable.\u201d He said as he walked over to my other side. Examining my slowly growing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he talks to me I continue to feel my body bloating outward. Going from what must have been around 115 pounds to something like 400 in less than a minute. My blue, inflated body was becoming overbearing as I could feel the chair beneath me creak. I was having trouble simply forcing myself to sit upright in the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another minute I was certain that I was beginning to round out as I could feel my back begin to push outward. The chef seemed to notice this and pulled me upward so that I could stand while I watched my body inflate outward. Slowly I began to move my arms upward as my body began to fully round out. Forming what must have been a form of T. I could also feel my lower section begin to hit the floor as my privates became what held me up rather than my legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before I was truly a large ball, my arms were basically non existent except for a divot which protruded my hand. My legs had done the same as everything had managed to disappear leaving nothing but a small foot protruding from the ocean of blue. All that I could see was whatever I had been looking at while I was expanding along with a large amount of pure blue skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I said before, I hope you\u2019ve gone no plans for the weekend, the deflation process can be quite long depending on how much you\u2019ve inflated. Luckily you\u2019re not the biggest one that I\u2019ve seen so you shouldn\u2019t have to wait too long!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanted to reply, however my cheeks had inflated with the rest of my body, trapping my words within a mouth that wouldn't open. The chef then walked around to my front and began pushing, slowly making my vision rise until I was facing the ceiling, then behind me, and eventually pure darkness while I was facing the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the few moments that I was watching the world spin a slightly muffled scream left my mouth before eventually becoming mute as I was stuck facing the ground.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She then put her skinny finger against the glass pointing at a certain necklace. \"If anything, I would pick that one. I think it'd look good on you.\" You looked at the necklace, and had to agree.  It would look nice on you.  \"So why are you here of all places in the mall? I've never seen you wear anything other than earrings. Are you trying to impress someone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to answer when a girl at the counter walked up to you.  She had a green T-Shirt embedded with the name 'Gwen' on the side, tucked into her tan pants. \"Finding everything alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'd like to buy that necklace over there.\" you replied while pointing to it through the glass, not even looking at the tag that says what it's called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nice choice.\" she commented as she rang it through the register.</span></div></div>",

You take the necklace out of the case and notice that it has two sides to the crystal. One with a darker tone of red, the other being lighter. You think nothing of it as you pull your hair back and put the necklace on, the light side of the gem glowing in the window light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hair falls gently against your shoulders as you take a step back from your desk and strike a few poses, admiring the beautiful gem in your vanity mirror, resting lightly against your shirt between the small lumps you called breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" You grunt to yourself, cupping your chest with your hands. \"thanks a lot Mother Nature. I buy a nice piece of jewelry for myself, and it draws attention to how much you shafted me with puberty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwisting and turning in front of the mirror, you suddenly start to feel terribly queasy, like the floor was just pulled out from underneath you. Your hands cross your flat stomach as you double over from the shock of this strange airy sickness. Staggering unsteadily forward, you lean against your desk for support as you feel another strange occurrence, one that scares you. The hand you have placed on your stomach is sinking in, your firmly toned abs were shrinking! You weakly straighten yourself up, staring slack jawed at your reflection. Flicking your hair out of your face, you see your cheeks becoming sunken and it's overall appearance turning terribly gaunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on?!\" You screech, now frantically pulling up your shirt to better see what's happening to your body. The once flat slab of toned muscle that adorned your front is gone, replaced by a concave hollow that continues to suck further and further in, revealing your ribs and loosening both bra and belt with each passing second. Trying to make sense of your situation, you rush from the bedroom as quickly as you can, startling Bee in the process, who was sprawled lazily on the couch. Down the hall, you head into the bathroom, and quickly step on the scale you have placed in the corner by the shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEighty-nine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEighty-eight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEighty-seven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're quickly losing weight, and seeing as you weren't at all heavy to begin with at a mere 115 pounds, this weight loss is plunging you into anorexic territory, making you anemic and ill. You plod to the sink and turn the cold water on, holding your pants up so you don't trip over them as your hips become to small to hold them up properly. Using your body to hold your pants against the counter, you splash some cold water on your face, noting how slender and wiry your fingers and arms are looking now. Leaning your face over the sink one last time, you feel your new necklace swing forward, colliding with your bony hands as you bring them up over your head to run water through your hair. The ruby necklace rises up with your hands, and as you run the cold water over the back of your head, the necklace hits the ground behind you with a loud 'clunk'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately feel invigorated, that disgusting nauseous feeling simply disappeared when your new necklace hit the ground. You shake the eerie feeling and water from your head and stare disgusted at your emaciated, skin and bones body. What little breasts you had are almost gone, your bra moving freely with barely anything to hold it in place as you carefully bend down to pick up the necklace. Spinning it around in your hand you see the light side of the gem pulsing with a gentle glow, while the darker side remains just as dull as ever. That's when it hits you, and everything just comes together. Ruby of the Plumped Princess, the strange weight loss when you first put it on, and the light side you were wearing was glowing while to opposite side wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A <i>necklace</i> made me this anorexic freak?!\" You shout to Bee, now sitting next to her on the living room couch. She pays your words no mind, simply staring off around the room. \"How is that even possible? Someone's going to hear about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn the necklace over and over again in one hand, while you rub your sickly thin frame with the other, pondering what to do next.</span></div></div>",

Just then you hear the doorbell ringing. Why does someone have to show up at a time like this?!? You ignored it, pretending not to be home. You then heard a loud banging on the door, and the familiar voice of someone you met minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open up! It's Cassandra! Let me in!\" she screamed. She clearly knew you were home. You walked up to the door, not daring to open it. You rest your head against the door to answer her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now's not a good time.\" you replied. \"I'm starting to feel a bit...ill.\" That was an understatment. You looked like you were going to pass out any minute. But you couldn't let Cassandra see you like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, just don't put on that necklace.\" So it was the necklace, but how did Cassandra know anything about it. \"It'll..it has....I don't know! Just don't put it on and let me in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why shouldn't I try it on?\" you asked. You now obviously knew the reason why you shouldn't have tried it on. But you still whated to know why Cassandra knew anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just let me in and I'll explain. Those items, must have had some magic or technology or something in them!\" she cried out. \"I was just going home and I tried the ring on. Nothing happened until this animal ran up towards me and started sniffing the ring. I thought it was weird, but I knelt down to pet it. The animal sniffed it more until it touched it with it's nose and I've been changing ever since.\" You could hear sniffing as if she was crying. \"I didn't know who else to turn to and I didn't want to be stuck out here looking like a freak. Please, just let me in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unlocked the door and began to open it. You knew she wouldn't make fun of you now, considering she going through something similar. Maybe you could figure it out together, or at least go back to the mall to figure it out. You opened the door and were both shocked at what you saw. She could clearly tell you tried on the necklace, given your anorexic shape now. You could tell what exactly the ring she bought could do. As you saw that.....</span></div></div>",

A simple T-shirt, although nice and tight, helping to add emphasis to my slightly below-average breasts...suddenly, I decided I wanted to try out my new necklace with something more...showy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dug into my closet, eventually finding my old prom dress. An elegant sky-blue strapless gown with ruffles and a front split. Ah yes, I fondly remembered how it showed off my shapely, toned legs. I swear I could see some of the guys pop boners as I passed by, much to the chagrin of their dates. Unfortunately, the guy I had gone to the prom with was a bit of a jackass, and I called it off weeks later. That reminds me, I never did let Bryce see me in this dress. Perhaps I should soon....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_man7hp8ssi1rdjgiao1_r1_500.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_man7hp...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly slip out of my t-shirt and jeans, then slide into my old dress. Oooooh, I had forgotten how snugly it fit me, how it silky softness made me feel like such a wild seductress. I zipped up the back, then put on some strappy blue 5-inch heels and dangly earrings to complete the ensemble. I walked back over to my vanity mirror, lifting the hem of my dress with one hand and doing a little twirl. Yes, I would definitely find an excuse to let Bryce see me in this dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut alas, it was time to add the last puzzle piece. I grabbed the necklace off my dresser and put it on, absentmindedly noting the lighter shade or orange was facing out....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once, a wave of vertigo washed over me. My arm lashed out, grabbing my dresser for support with one hand while holding my head with the other. A few seconds later, my vision started to clear, but even without my eyes, I could tell something was very wrong. The hand that grabbed the dresser, it was...level with my head? My vision then cleared, and suddenly everything seemed bigger! My dresser...it was just as tall as me, and seemed to be growing even bigger! I whirled around, taking in how everything else in my room - my vanity desk, my bed, my entertainment center - were getting bigger as well! For some reason, my clothes weren't changing size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe they were! I finally realized what was happening. My room wasn't getting bigger...I WAS SHRINKING! This 'Amber of the Shrinking Giantess'...it wasn't just some marketing ploy of a name! It really was making me shrink! Now I was no taller than my bed. How small would I get?!</span></div></div>",

There had been a nagging little tickle in the back of your brain that told you to come in here, but you couldn't for the life of you remember why. At that moment, a particularly large and glittered covered balloon floated by your face. It read in big blue letters printed on the side 'It's party time!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slapped the top of your head and said out loud. \"Of course, the <i>party</i>!\" Only to blush in realization that Susan was giving you an odd look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...,\" you quickly apologized. \"I just remembered something was all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been invited to party earlier in the week and you had totally forgotten until now. Cassandra, a girl in your class, was having her eighteenth birthday party while her parents were out on vacation for the summer. Even though the two of you never really saw eye to eye- actually, you really hated each other - she went out of her way to invite everyone from your class. Wishful thinking had you hope that Bryce, the guy whose attention you were trying to get, had convinced Cassandra to invite you to the party as well. Cassandra also had her eyes on him as well, giving you a good reason to loathe the girl. That and her self centered airhead attitude that made you want to slit your throat and kill yourself if stuck in a conversation with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party was in two days. It'd probably be an unsupervised drinking fest, you wouldn't get much entertainment out of it other then a few laughs from the stupid things the drunks would be doing (you didn't drink after all). You wouldn't even be interested it if Bryce wasn't going and even then you were only going to prevent Cassandra from getting her hands on him. You liked solitude more than parties, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe catch to going, however, was that everyone had to bring something for the party. It didn't matter what: plates, food, music, balloons. Anything would do. Considering you were in a balloon shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you recommend for a party?\" you asked Susan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A party? Hmmm. Well there is a party pack, it has all the types of balloons you see around the store and then some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"$24.99.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't too bad. Loads cheaper than what you expected you were going to have to pay. Satisfied, you had Susan ring up the bag, which was bigger then you thought it would be, and you quickly brought it home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to rushing out of the mall, you didn't even bother to check to see what sort of balloons were in the giant bag and Susan had been vague with what she meant by 'all the types of balloons'. Curiosity eventually got the best of you so you tore open the plastic wrapping and dumped the balloons on the floor of your room only to discover Susan wasn't being vague at all. There literally were every sort of balloon imaginable inside the bag. Some even appeared to be water balloons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a laugh, you decided to blow one up and see how it looked. You reached down and grabbed...</span></div></div>",

Ignoring the sensation, you fill the balloon to the recommended size, subconsciously noting that your pants feel quite tight for some reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the balloon, you notice that it is shaped like a pear and decide to make it bigger. After a few moments you are having trouble breathing and tie the balloon shut and rest. When that doesn\u2019t help, you stand to get water and gasp as your pants button breaks and fly across the room, immediately relieving you of the pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down and gasp again. Your hips are much wider now, wide enough to give trouble with small aisles, maybe even small doorways. Beneath, your thighs have thickened and rub against each other. But most noticeably is your ass. The small perky feature is no more, replaced with a round, thick shelf of ghetto booty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing what did this, you begin to panic until you notice the \u201cpear\u201d shaped balloon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo. No, no, no. That\u2019s not possible,\u201d you mutter to yourself even as you grab another \u201cpear\u201d balloon to test. Quickly, you fill it up and glance down once you\u2019ve tied it off. Your lower half has ballooned to a greater size, confirming your thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to relax now, closing your eyes and taking deep breathes. Knowing what caused the growth makes you feel much better. Opening your eyes, you look between the packet and the already filled balloons. Would popping them reverse the changes? And do the other balloons cause different changes? What do you do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was just there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sink, you carefully wrapped the balloon around the faucet and turned on the warm water. As you expected, you felt a warm, full feeling in your tummy as the balloon filled. Resisting the urge to look down, you continue to fill the balloon until it is past its point and must be filled with at least two gallons of water. Shutting the water off and tying the balloon, you let it sit in the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down to see what you expected: your belly has swollen outward, appearing twice as large as the balloon. Your shirt no longer covers it and, unlike your booty which seems entirely unaffected by gravity, sags. You poke and watch is jiggle like a water balloon would. You smile.

That's when our full stock comes in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I think I might try them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKat smiles and says, \"Excellent!!

One will only give you a tail, two the ears, so on and so forth. However, be careful not to eat too many at once, and if you do, make sure you quickly put them somewhere where you can't reach them. Around ten or so, you become a full cat, physically, but at a full dozen, you're a cat mentally as well.\" She holds up a fish cracker. \"Fish crackers affect how long the effects last. Eating no crackers will cause reversion to normal in 24 hours from the time the last cracker was eaten. Each cracker exponentially adds more time. One gives an extra day, two gives three, three six, four ten, five fifteen, and so forth. If you eat a full dozen in one serving, like I did, it can make the effects permanent, if you so wish. Well, I guess that's the basics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neat!!

She stood tall and wide, in a somewhat gothic getup. Her long black hair covered part of her chubby face. Black eyeliner covered her eyes, which matched her sundress and fingernails. Her sundress looked like it was barely holding anything in. She must have been 300 pounds at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, nothing's broken. You've come here to see your future self?\" she asked, noticing that you were somewhat starring at her huge frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...yes.\" You watched as she nodded with her double chins and huffed her way to the love seat on the other side of the circular table. Her ass jiggling with each step she was taking. How could anyone let themselves go like that? You wouldn't be caught dead in public if you weighed that much. Debbie looked over and saw that you were standing still, still looking at her. She knew you were taking noticed of her frame, how it intrigued and disturbed you at the same time. But she would fix that in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot embarrassing yourself further, you took the seat across from her.  You watched as she set the bucket of chicken down and began to work her hands around the crystal ball. You began to daze around the swirling fog inside it. \"Now tell me, why do you keep starring at my body?\" she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something about the fog, something that was compelling you to tell her the truth. \"You're so....fat. So...obese. You've been eating like you don't even care. Doesn't it bother you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all.\" Debbie said as her flabby arms continued to perform the magic in the crystal ball. \"I've changed for the better. There were days I blamed myself for being too 'fat'. I had no self confidence at times. But then I embraced it and stopped worrying about it. It's what's on the inside that counts. Do you want to know what that's like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye....ye......yes!\" you said. You did feel down at times, not always wanting to let go and drop into peer pressure. You were expecting her to talk about it more. For her to enlighten you a bit. Little did you know that was far from what was happening.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What would it be like to be as fat as me?\" Debbie said as the fog swirled into the edges. Inside, you were hypnotized by it's image. For inside, you almost thought you saw a fattened version of yourself. \"Do you really want to know?\" You paused, not sure what was going on. It almost felt like you were sluggish and heavy, as if you were the one that was sitting on the love seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're speechless.\" Debbie grinned, noticing that puzzled look on your face. \"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to eat whatever you wanted, whenever you wanted? Imagine it, never worry about dieting or exercising ever again.\" You sat back against the groining chair, hypnotized by her words. Unaware of the powerful magic she was performing. Your flat stomach now starting to push out. Your hips beginning to become a tad fuller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever imagined having the biggest bust in the crowd? Having all the guys stare at you for all the right reasons. Having to wear the extra large clothing just to hold them in.\" Unknown to you, your clothes were changing with you, becoming stretchy and longer. Making room for your own swelling breasts. As the overweight Debbie continues to talk about the positives of her lifestyle, the more your body changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't tell you how happy it's been at this size. Being able to eat all the food I want without giving it a second thought. I've come a long way from gaining when I accepted it. Because that's the only thing that matters. To be accepted and loved for who you truly are.\" You could only hear her words. You couldn't hear the seat struggling under you. Your ass began to thicken and form little bumps of cellulite. Your thighs rubbing together, your legs drooping with fat as your calves thickened nicely. You unknowingly adjusted your shirt, so it wasn't caught and stretched out from under your belly. It jiggled as it was released from the trapped fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the years I spent worrying about my weight. Society has changed. In the ancient greeks, the poor were the thin ones that scurried around the streets while the rich were served food hand and foot. Gluttony was a sign of wealth. Now look at today. The rich are the ones protraying their thin selves with gym memberships and liposuction. The middle class sit around with dollar menus and cheap fattening food everywhere. If you're healthy, why should it matter. It's health, not wealth.\" The unaware fattening was almost complete. Your whole body began to finish all the extra details. Your skin was softening as your hips grew in the chair. Your cheeks got fuller as a double chin began to hang underneath. Your fingers and toes thickening to match the proportions of your new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for taking the time to listen. You looked so thin and lonely when I saw you walk into my shop. I just knew I had to give this experience to you.\" The fog in the crystal ball began to vanish as you slowly closed your eyes and broke out of your daze. You then suddenly tasted something in your mouth. Was that...chicken? Your opened your eyes again and saw yourself holding a half-eaten leg and a bucket of chicken. It was then that your realized that you were now as fat as Debbie. Or to be more clear, <b><i>was</i></b> as fat as Debbie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down as your extra chins pressed against each other. Your breasts, while huge, were just as big as Debbie's used to be. Your belly laid past under the shirt, hanging a bit lower on your thighs and wrapped around in stretch marks. Your tried sitting yourself up on the chair, finding that both of your butt cheeks were wedged in the arm rests. Your arms were wide and doughy, still holding the chicken. Your clothes, that were once loose on you, were now stretched and hugged every roll of your body. You were still dealing with this new body of yours. You were surprized that you were accepting this calmly. But it felt like the more time you sat there, the more it felt like this was what you were like your whole life, like you've always been like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you looked across the table, you saw that Debbie was thin. As thin as you once were. She has to be 115 pounds, just like you once were. She was a twig. Her breasts were small and probably B sized, just like yours used to be. Her skin was smooth and toned down. You looked down at your body again and realized that you gained all the fat that used to be on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more you looked at yourself, the more you felt like that was always meant to be. The more your saw your fat self, the more you starred at your flabby belly, the more hungry you felt and thought about all of food you could be tasting right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked back up to Debbie. The woman who caused all of this to happen. You looked at the small round face you once had and told her................</span></div></div>",

Beginning the short walk home, you start to think of the ever present fantasy you've always had, buried deep in the back of your mind. You're incredibly skeptical as to what this thing can do, creating a whole world at your whim? You aren't stupid, you know technology isn't advanced enough to create completely realistic virtual reality, but still, the thought is intriguing.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening your front door, you're greeting by Bee rushing under your feet. \"Hi, Bee. Did you miss me?\" You coo, gently scratching behind her ears. Bee runs off throughout the house as you close the door and head into your bedroom to try out this new program. You pull out everything from the box, throwing the bag in the trash as you put the disk into your laptop. After it boots the disc you're presented with an elaborately designed logo of it's title. You briefly read the instructions and find that you need to open and create a new scenario to live out. The new window quickly pops up, and the sheer amount of customization is truly surprising. You can input supposed changes to yourself and others, create entirely new people, change the minds of whomever you wish, alter anything about your home, even the world itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you aren't sold yet, you need to see this thing in action, see how it looks, how it feels, etc. You grab the visor sitting by the box and put it onto your head, it looks kind of like a pair of sunglasses that wrap all the way around your head, except that the lens is a solid line of glass stretching fully across your entire range of vision. Clicking the mouse onto the box for setting, you begin to type about the house you'd love to have. You like this house, but seeing the fancy villas and mansions on television sometimes make you jealous. If this thing works the way Fred said it would, you won't be feeling jealous much longer. With your elaborate description finally completed in the box, you scroll to the bottom of the page, seeing a red button with the label, 'Begin Reality Manipulation'. You click it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe visor starts beeping as it turns on, and the lens flares with a searing white light. You close your eyes and shout, almost ripping it off your head and then... silence. You open your eyes, one at a time to see that the white light is gone, and for that matter, the lens in front of your eyes is gone too. Reaching up to feel your head, you find that the whole visor is indeed gone, your hands only serving to mess up your hair. You turn back to your old desk, and are met with quite a surprise. Your old desk is now a massive ornately crafted solid wood construct, it looks absolutely beautiful. You scan the room and see that the descriptions you typed into the computer have come to life around you. Your bed, a monstrous mattress and frame with a canopy looming above, gentle pink drapes fluttering down around it. A hard wood floor exists beneath your feet where carpet once lay, and a walk in closet replaces the shanty one you actually own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the window, and peek your head outside, letting the cool breeze flow through your hair. You're still in your neighborhood, but your house is now a mansion, created simply by typing it into the F.O.R.M.! What shocks you the most about this, is that everything feels so real, like it's actually there. The bed is soft and comfy, the desk has a smooth fine finish, and the floor was cool and spotless beneath your bare feet. This wasn't real though, right? The visor disappeared, you had to still be sitting at your laptop, but there your laptop lay atop the new desk, the chair unoccupied. None of this can be rationally explained, but you don't care, this thing was incredible! You sit back in the chair and open up the file again, exploring the rest of this mansion can wait. After seeing this, you absolutely need to make some more changes, and as you click in the box once again, you start typing out the fantasy that's always been in the back of your mind. </span></div></div>",

Your body was basically a twig, thanks to years of exercise and diets. You enjoyed the life you had with cheerleading and things like that. But in the back of your mind, you wondered what life would be like at a different perspective. You wanted to know what it was like to be fat. The closest thing you've done with it was a bad photoshop of yourself. But with F.O.R.M, it was completely possible. After all, it's only a virtual reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou typed your complete fantasy in the box and entered it in the program. Not a moment later, the doorbell rang and you rushed down the carpet stairs knowing who it was. You opened the door and saw none other than Bryce waiting for you. \"Hey, so are you ready for our date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am.\" You said as he surprisingly carried you in his arms and walked you towards your limo. The driver quickly drove off to your favorite restaurant, where you stepped out and was greeted to the table already set for you. The first thing in front of you was a nice, big, juicy steak. It raised your appetite even higher. You dug into the steak as you soaked in the delicious flavor. You ate the entire thing with massive bites, along with the baked potatoes on the plate with it.  You kept eating plate after plate of satisfying food. You and Bryce talked between each bite, but that didn't stop your dinner. Chips, chicken, pizza, burgers, spaghetti and other delicious meals. All finished with a glass of wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe limo dropped you off after dinner as Bryce walked you back to your mansion. \"I had a great time tonight,\" he said to you, \"Hopefully we could do it again soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love that.\" you said to him. You both kissed good night under the porch light and went back inside. You thought about getting some ice cream out for dessert, but decide to save that for later, maybe back in the real world. You probably had to leave this virtual world, it was getting late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly stepped up the stairs, the creaking echoing through the mansion with each step. You finally made it back to your bedroom and looked at yourself in the vanity mirror. You were huge compared to your real thin body. Your clothes looked strained against your massive body. Your belly was piled into folds of flabs, gravity heavily hanging it down over your thighs. Your legs have been swollen so thick, pushing against each other and holding your wide hips. Your breasts resting at a size you were finally proud of. You must have weighed at least.....</span></div></div>",

You finally make it back to your bedroom and look at yourself in the vanity mirror. You're huge compared to your real, thin body. Your clothes look strained against your massive body. Your belly is piled into folds of flab, gravity heavily hanging it down over your thighs. Your legs are swollen so thick, pushing against each other and holding your wide hips. Your breasts resting at a size you're finally proud of. You must weigh at least 500 pounds, if the F.O.R.M. is as accurate as it's supposed to be, and by the looks of your date with Bryce tonight, it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand in front of the vanity, reflecting on the wonderful fantasy date you just had. You and Bryce were always friends on some level, but the attention he showed you tonight was magnificent. The limo, his love of your fattened form, the kiss goodnight under the porch light, and the food... oh the <i>food</i>. You unconsciously rub your distended stomach, remembering the smorgasbord of wonderful food you crammed into your eager mouth. It was the most liberating thing you've ever done in your life, to finally cast away the stress of watching what you eat, and just gorging on everything in sight, it was so hot. Your chubby fingers slide down the tight fabric of your blouse, undoing each button they come across, first revealing cleavage, then the thick creases of your blubbery belly as you pull it off completely and toss it to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow topless, you smile at your engorged breasts which sag heavily onto your new belly, nobody would call you flat chested with these. Your hands slide under each one and heft them up, tit flesh pushing between your fingers. You start to squeeze and play with them, lifting one up towards your face to lick circles around your stiff nipple. It sends quakes of pleasure throughout your flab that coalesce between your thick thighs, you can feel yourself getting wet from the sensation. Your breasts fall with a meaty slap, blubber on blubber, as you drop them and start to explore lower, your fingertips teasing the delicate moistened skin between each bulging fold of your belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a strained 'pop' your apple bottom jeans come undone, and while you hold your overhanging belly out of the way with one arm, you slowly pull down your pants zipper with the other, your open fly showing off a pink lace thong in the vanity mirror. Smooth rolls of fat yield against your hands, as you clumsily bend over, not quite used to this weight, to slide the skin tight jeans down around your ankles. Now doffed of all but your thong, you marvel at yourself in the mirror, striking poses to take in just how fat 500 pounds really is. You can't even see your thong from the front, as your considerable belly and love handles shroud it from view. You jut one hip forward and twist your left leg back and forth on the ball of your foot, mesmerized by the sexy sway of your pendulous rolls and your cute chubby feet. You can't bear the mounting lust any longer, and take slow heavy steps towards your massive canopy bed, your whole body jiggling with each thunderous footfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour wide ass smothers a portion of your bed as you sit and lean back, spreading yourself out over the plush mattress. On your back, the feeling of your heavy paunch bearing down on your vagina is heavenly. You wobble it from side to side as you fight against your fat, trying to maneuver a hand underneath your belly rolls to reach the dripping crease between your legs. Your fingers reach the sensitive skin of your inner thighs, push your panties aside, and squeeze through fat to enter the plump wet lips of your vagina. Sure, you've masturbated plenty of times before, but those times were nothing compared to doing it at 500 pounds. Your fingers grope and prod inside of you, stimulating not only your vagina, but your whole body as your fat surges in waves with each thrust. You tease and pinch your nipples and play with your rolls as you bring yourself closer and closer to release. You keep thrusting deeply and feel your insides begin to churn, as hot warmth gushes in torrents onto your hand between your fatty thighs. Head thrown back and legs twitching, you scream as you start to cum from an immense orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body goes limp, arms falling at your sides as you lay there, trying to catch your breath. A few minutes later after composing yourself, you stretch your arms and heave yourself upwards into a sitting position, the dresser that holds your laptop resting right in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this has to end sometime.\" You sigh, wanting to continue indulging in your fantasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give your thick love handle a shake, and rise with a heave from the bed, a large wet stain seeping into the sheets where you sat. Taking a seat before the opened F.O.R.M. program, you shiver from the cold wooden seat against your bare skin, as you start reading the computer screen.</span></div></div>",

Finding a free seat on one of the aisles, you settle in to watch the warm up act. The tricks aren't anything spectacular, but the two women performing them are absolutely gorgeous and the sparkly leotards they're wearing <i>really</i> flatter their curvy figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the countdown hits zero, a voice from nowhere cries out \"That's it, time to start. Seal the doors!\" A loud clap echoes through the room, and the doors at the rear of the auditorium slam shut, apparently on their own. As people react to this, there's a bang and a flash and centre stage is engulfed by smoke. You join about half the crowd in applauding the showmanship as a androgynous figure in tuxedo strides out of the smoke. \"Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to a magic show like nothing you've ever seen before!\" The magician's voice, like their figure, is rather ambiguous - you have no clue if they're male or female. \"I am the Amazing Ay, and these are my two lovely assistants Bee and Cee.\" The magician indicates the two leotard clad women with a wave of the hand, but none of them do anything to indicate which is Bee and which is Cee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got a spectacular show for you today, folks! Astounding feats and astonishing transformations, unmatched by anything else on Earth!\" Ay continues their introduction. \"Now, I like to get right into things rather than standing around talking, so without further ado, let's get underway with our first act! We're kicking things off today with that old classic, hypnotic regression! Can I get a volunteer from the audience to take part in the hypnotic regression act, please?!\"</span></div></div>",

Will the young lady on the right hand aisle, the only one to have put her hand up, please come up and join us on the stage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand and walk to the front, where Bee (or possibly Cee) helps you on to the stage with an easy hand and steers you over to stand next to Ay. It's a little intimidating standing up her in front of everyone, especially when you realise there are several people you know in the crowd! Karen is in the front row, looking politely interested and smile and waves when she sees you seeing her. Bryce and Dave are a few rows back, and Bryce gives you a thumbs up, prompting a slight blush. Finally, Cassandra is near the back, sneering at everything in a way that makes you wonder why she's even here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAy smiles and shakes your hand. \"Give a big hand for our first <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">(and hopefully not only)</font> volunteer, everyone!\" She waves at the crowd to clap, and when the polite applause dies down, continues. \"Now, I would ask who you are, but I don't think I need to. This is your card, right?\" She produces a small white card from inside one of your sleeves and shows it to you. Surprised by what you read, you nod in surprise. Everything on the card is right! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" Ay says with a grin. \"Now, let me just blow this up so everyone can see it....\" She half turns and flings the card toward the back of the stage, Somehow it expands as it goes, until it takes up the whole back wall, the words on it plain for all to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">Emily<br>\r\nAge 18<br>\r\nRecent High School Graduate</font></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make an impressed noise, as does much of the crowd.

You need to be dressed for the part! Bee! Cee! Bring the cloth!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two assistants step in form the wings one holding a large multi-coloured sheet, the other holding a bolt of sparkly pink cloth. The one with the sheet hands it off to Ay and takes one end of the bolt and the assistants move towards you, wrapping you from head to toe in sparkling fabric in an instant! Before you and react to this, Ay throws the sheet over your head, plunging you into darkness and cutting off all sound! You can't even see or feel the stage beneath you, and when you cry out your voice seems to be swallowed up by a vast emptiness. After a long moment something taps you on the head and you hear a voice, as though at a great distance, say \"Presto-Changeo!\" The sheet is ripped off your head, and you're back on the stage, the crowd gasping in shock. Looking down, you gasp too, and feel a blush creep across your face as you realise you clothes have been replaced by a sparkly pink leotard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can come up with a reaction to this, Ay starts speaking again. \"Right, now that everything's ready, let's move on to the main event. The hypnosis! Emily, if you would...<i>look into my eyes.</i>\" Ay places a gentle hand on your chin and lifts your gaze to meet theirs. As you look into the magician's bright green eyes, the world seems to swirl around you, and...everything.....falls.........away.............</span></div></div>",

Since you are our first customer we will give you a free serum that allows you to become any of the choices when you like even combinations of them albeit with limitations because well you can't get too disgusting.\" You then inject the serum into your arm and suddenly become overwhelmed with the transformations you can now do by thinking of it. \"This one's on the house!

You see your body swell to that point and you see the kiosk say, \"Due to what you put in you will age far slower to where you will last for 1 thousand centuries and you will stay looking and feeling like a 21 year old for your life have a nice day!\" You exit the place knowing that your children will likely be affected by the transformation serum you injected and strangely the serum makes you able to actually carry the babies inside you without being affected by the typical drawbacks being pregnant has and they too will be affected by the increased lifespan albeit strange that you somehow know all of this.

Unknown to you, things are about to get interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same mall featured in the 'Mall of Transformation,' this particular story deals with a different set of characters to interact with. This interactive involves weight gain, gender change, breast/butt expansion, age change, growth, shrinking, and more transformations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n1) No cameos, greetings, or mentioning of the characters in the first interactive.  This is a new story with new characters!<br>\r\n2) Do not submit one sentence answers, make it at least a detailed paragraph.<br>\r\n3) Characters must not die.<br>\r\n4) If there's an addition there may be a chance that I'll edit it. Mostly just fixing the grammar.<br>\r\n5) No transformation in the story is permanent, it can always be reversed somehow, though it doesn't have to be an option.<br>\r\n6) Do not end the story too soon.<br>\r\n7) Do not post sexual writing that involves Age Changes.<br>\r\n8) Keep an eye on this page for further updates such as rules, additional characters, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecial thanks to gene_clot for helping me use some of his characters.<br>\r\nMain Characters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>You</b> - Height: <i>5'5''</i>     Weight: <i>115 pounds</i>     Age: <i>18</i>     Interests: <i>Bi-Sexual</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are the Protaganist. You are an eighteen year old teenager girl who just got done with high school two weeks ago. You just started having your own place with your friends living in the same neighborhood. Money's not an issue right now with the inheritance from your grandparents. The mall has just been built, so you decide to go check it out for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Karen</b> - Height: <i>5'4''</i>     Weight: <i>110 pounds</i>     Age: <i>18</i>     Interests: <i>Secretly Lesbian</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short, skinny and reserved redhead. Karen is your typical shy girl next door. Started working as a waitress at a local restaurant in hopes of meeting new people, but finds it hard to come out of her shell. Longs for a change in her repetitive life. You've always thought she seemed kind of cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Bryce</b> - Height: <i>5'9</i>     Weight: <i>145 pounds</i>     Age: <i>17</i>     Interests: <i>Straight</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn average, all around good guy. Good looking but not vain about his appearance in any way, likes keeping himself busy. Very kind and incredibly loyal to his friends, Bryce is the 'go to guy' for all of his buddies. Unknown to him, you sort of developed a crush on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Dave</b> - Height: <i>5'11''</i>     Weight: <i>185 pounds</i>     Age: <i>19</i>     Interests: <i>Straight</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA simple name for a simple guy. A natural born slacker with no sense of work ethic, Dave spends more effort avoiding work than he would actually spend doing the work. Graduated from high school with average grades, he lazes around without a care in the world, which has attributed to his chubby frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Cassandra</b> - Height: <i>5'10'</i>     Weight: <i>130 pounds</i>     Age: <i>18</i>     Interests: <i>Straight</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA material girl if ever there was one. Obsessed with social status and flashy things, this woman believes herself to be Queen amongst all other women. Decked out in stiletto heels and tight fitting mini skirts to show off her thin body, she lets people know that she gets what she wants.</td>",
