However for Robin it was getting hard to do things to do as the Queen of Ylisse. At first Robin tried to handle paperwork and such but Chrom explained they already had people who handled paperwork. Robin then decided to try and have Ylisse and Plegia merged into one country as Robin was the heir for Plegia. That didn't take long to accomplish on account of how desperate Plegia was for a ruler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Robin spent time eating, and being with her family. Robin had gained a good amount of weight being somewhat chubby now. Robin was already quite the curvy woman and was the tallest female shepherd. \"Aren't you such a good girl Luci?\" Robin baby talked to the younger Lucina while tickling her a little bit. The younger Lucina was now two years old, according to the older Lucina Morgan was born when she was six. Robin smiled at her little girl and pulled out a cupcake. \"See the cupcake baby girl?\" Lucina tried to reach out for it. \"No no it's for mommy, she's going to make it disappear.\" Robin opened her mouth wide and shoved the cupcake into her mouth and managed to swallow it without chewing. Little Lucina giggled and yawned. Robin smiled at her little girl, she then heard footsteps. Who is it?</span></div></div>",

The gameplay was great, being a touchup and patch of Awakening's already good engine, but......Hoshido was too much in the right. They were presented as the good faction, and Nohr as the bad, despite playing up both as grey*. Both were not given equal amounts of good and bad things the kingdoms had done, what bad things they had done were skipped over, and the worldbuilding......was nonexistent. It's still the only game without a full world map and no name for it's content! And regardless what side you picked, the opposing kingdom saw you as a traitor! Revelations saw you a traitor to both! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo:<br>\r\n- do we want to follow the canon story of Revelations, with stupidity abound?<br>\r\n- give Ryoma and Xander a bit more sense in their heads and listen to Corrin?<br>\r\n- or have Corrin make a break for it with Azura and Jakob before even stepping onto the battlefield?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMake your choice.**<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(*If you read it a certain way, it seems who had a hand in Fates was very pro-Japan......mind you I am of those that prefer Hoshido to Nohr.....so take that as you will.)<br>\r\n(**You'll get your weight gain, don't worry. We have to put effort into these chapter else the author will make them go poof.)</span></div></div>",

Therefore! It's been transformed into this work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you can infer from the title, this is a general Fire Emblem weight gain interactive. It's fetish-based, so if that isn't your deal, it's a good idea to leave. Even though the title is based on Fates, this interactive can feature any game in the franchise and it's (female) characters. Sorry to those who like guys, but it is my interactive! Heh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Put some honest effort into your chapters. I will be forced to delete low-effort chapters that aren't just offering more choices. I am lenient to those, as I know the website has cracked down on letting people make more options per-chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Correct spelling and grammar, please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- While I'm basically going to let you have free reign on what happens, I'm instituting pretty hard mandates on anything underage or of non-consensual nature, these will not be tolerated. Anything else is basically okay, if not exactly to my tastes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Male characters can obviously appear! But they won't be the main subject, nor should they be the subjects gaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- And please, have some understanding of the games and characters! I don't need expertise, but you should know not to make Chrom head off to high school or have Corrin drive an 18-wheeler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Have fun! I'll be putting up my best contributors here on the front page as well as awarding points to them. I'd also love to work in tandem with anyone, so message me if you have any inquiries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
