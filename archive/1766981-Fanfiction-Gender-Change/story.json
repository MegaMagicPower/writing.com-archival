Jorah Mormont followed behind them, trying to keep his eyes away from the Queen backside and on the slaver. He had decided he didn't like the Good Master, something about his attitude displeased him, though the meaning of his words were lost to him. Not that he'd had much love for the slave city and its rulers to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Unsullied have stood here for a day and night without food or water. They will stand until they drop. Such is their obedience,\" the slave girl spoke, as they enter a courtyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRow after row of slaves faced them, standing rigidly to attention in the baking sun, their round shields and spiked caps glinting. Sweat trickled down the bronze skin of their bodies, but behind their helms their eyes stared forward impassively, as if they didn't feel the heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese couldn't be the Unsullied, Jorah thought, confused. They were women. While garbed as soldiers, the bodies beneath were broad-hipped and curvaceous. Though their physiques were muscular and and honed, the heavy breasts that strained against the dark leather armour were clearly ill suited for combat. Many wore their hair long, which fell in long braids from beneath their caps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's been a mistake. We asked for soldiers, not slave women,\" Jorah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[Tell the old man he smells of piss,]\" Kraznys spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe translator hesitated before speaking. \"My master bids tell you that the Unsullied are not women. All these you see here where born as men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one, the ranks of soldiers parted to allow the small group to pass between them. Jorah felt his heart quicken as he walked the narrow corridor, the rows of perfect female specimens stood so close that their huge, leather-clad breasts were pressed against him. Long-lashed, beautiful brown eyes stared out from behind the slits in their helms. \"I know eunuchs when I see them,\" Jorah retorted. \"These aren't eunuchs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKraznys uttered something at length, and the slave girl spoke. \"Each Unsullied was once a slave boy. They begin their training at 5. They are cut and their bodies molded to suit our needs. Every day they drill from dawn to dusk until they have mastered the short sword, shield, and spear. Every night they are drilled until they have mastered the arts of pleasure. The Unsullied are both infantry and whores, unparalleled in both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJorah couldn't help but smile as he looked to Daenerys. Her face was a picture. She seemed almost intimidated by the soldiers, who not only matched her in the flawlessness of their beauty, but also made her chest look like that of a boy in comparison. Folding her arms self-consciously about her inadequate breasts, she asked, \"How is this done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Unsullied drink of two elixirs every day. The Wine of Courage deadens their sensitivity to pain, makes them obedient, strong and fearless in battle. The Wine of Beauty gives them a woman's form, makes their skin soft, their breasts full. It is this that makes them so deadly on the field. Their wanton bodies seduce men to distraction even as they kill them. They are the perfect soldiers. Look good women, they are obedient. They will not, indeed can not, rape or become bloodcrazed. After you conquer a city, they will allow themselves to be fucked for gold, and will give all of it to you. Many owners use them to service and satisfy their other soldiers, even entire armies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This Wine of Beauty sounds like powerful stuff, if it can turn men into these,\" Jorah remarked in wonder. \"I can't help but wonder what effect it would have on women,\" he chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaenerys rolled her eyes. \"It is this Wine of Courage that concerns me more. You say they fear nothing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[Tell this ignorant whore of a westerner to open her eyes and watch,]\" Kraznys said, stepping towards the nearest Unsullied. Drawing it's knife, he cut away the leather straps covering its breasts. The nipples were large, and the Unsullied remained impassive as the slave owner sliced them away, against the objections of the Queen. \"[She's worried about their nipples? Does the dumb bitch not know we already cut off their balls,]\" he chuckled. \"[Tell the Westerosi whore to decide by tomorrow.]\"</span></div></div>",

The Unsullied looked to their master expectantly and at a wave of his hand, they stepped out of their formation one-by-one, moving to the two barrels and pouring themselves a small quantity of the liquid from each barrel. They drank it down as though it was a great gift. Danaerys' interest was piqued. She stepped closer, sniffing the thick, deep purple wine. \"Is it safe to drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thin smile twisted the slaver's lips, and he barked something guteral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.

She had yet to face the possibility that she was barren, but if this wine could make women out of boy slaves perhaps it could make her fertile again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought the cup to her lips, but just as she was about to drink she saw Jorah Mormont watching her expectantly, hungrily.

In the halls above, the feast was being cleared away, the butchered bodies of Robb Stark's bannermen dragged to be burnt or thrown from the ramparts into the river. Endless buckets of water and an army of servants were at work scrubbing the blood from the floor. Walder Frey watched it all gleefully, still in the seat where he had sat throughout the massacre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the dripping wet dungeons beneath the Twins, Roose Bolton had begun work on an abomination. Assuming the Lannisters held to their part of the bargain, he was to be made Warden of the North, and he intended to send a message to the other Houses of the North that they would remember for a long time, one which would strike fear into their hearts at the mere mention of the liege Lord. He would make a mockery of the young wolf's body, decapitating him and sewing the head of his Direwolf in place. There were only two problems...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was a minor trifle, and would resolve itself in time, he had no doubt. The boy, more stubborn even than his father, refused to die, even despite the two arrow wounds that pierced his shoulder from front to back, and the knife in his belly. It was unnatural, but the boy could only have so much blood in him. Laid out on a slab of cold stone, Robb Stark was looking paler even than the leech lord, his chest rising and falling in shallow breaths. Until the young wolf's death, Roose Bolton had decided to rekindle a few of his House's old traditions. His fingers glided over a selection of razor sharp knives, selecting with an expert eye the implement that would draw out the torment, as he flayed the boy alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second, more troubling, problem was that the boy's Direwolf, Grey Wind, had escaped his kennel during the events of the Red Wedding, and was nowhere to be found. If his men could not track it down, perhaps he would have to settle for a regular wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hours wore on, the leech Lord savoring his work. The old ways were truly still the best, and his House had refined them to an art. They could skin a man totally, and still keep him alive long enough for him to see their handiwork. Yet as a miserable dawn began to creep over the Twins, and Robb Stark still refused to succumb to death, Roose began to consider the need for restraints. The ex-King in the North's eyelids fluttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoose looked up as one of his men stepped into the dungeon. He looked wet and tired from a long night of hunting in the storm. \"Have you found the Direwolf?\" Roose asked quietly, and the soldier looked uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite, my lord. We found... <i>a</i> Direwolf. A she-wolf, bigger than any we've ever seen, leading a pack of wolves. It killed four of our men before we could get a spear through it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rare smile <i>almost</i> formed on Roose Bolton's lips, but thought better of it. He had heard the tales of the female Direwolf harassing the Riverlands. His hands assessed the half-flayed body of the King laid out before him. Perhaps a new skin would suit Robb Stark better. \"How large would you say this wolf is?\" he asked. \"As large as a man?\"</span></div></div>",

It's eight teats were heavily swollen. It amused Bolton no end to think that the Young Wolf would soon be wearing those teats, though he doubted if the boy would survive long enough to enjoy them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf had been killed a single, clean spear strike to the back of the head. She was indeed huge, as large as a man and then some, and it took longer than he expected to strip the thick grey fur away from the flesh beneath. He blunted several knives carving through the dense muscles and his pale face was soon sweaty and red, but eventually he pulled the pelt away, whole and almost undamaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Young Wolf. Soon to be the Young Bitch,\" he chuckled mirthlessly to himself as he returned his attentions to Robb Stark. The boy moaned weakly. How the pain alone hadn't killed him yet, Bolton couldn't fathom. His eyes rolled in his head, vacant and pale grey. \"Whatever gods, old or new, that are keeping you from death, I hope they keep doing it long enough for you to see what I've done. If the gods are good, I may even have time to parade you in front of you before your vassals, so that they'll know what happens to those who cross me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe selected a curved blade. Better to castrate the last son of Winterfell now, and put an end to the Stark line?

Stemming the flow of blood from between the boy's legs as best as he cared to, he eagerly set to work robbing the boy-King of the rest of his skin. It would be his greatest work, and he eagerly awaited adding it to the rest, the collection of leatherly skins that hung in the Dreadfort, rumoured to have belonged to ancient Stark kings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Robb was little more than exposed red meat. The direwolf pelt slid easily over his wet flesh, his arms and legs fitting snugly inside the wolf's limbs, though the chest of the fur hung loose about Robb's chest, requiring him to cut much of it away to make it fit. Pushing aside the dark red locks of hair that now littered the stone slab, he pushed Robb's head inside the wolf's head and then, pulling the two halves of the fur together above the white bones of the boy's spine, he stitched the seam together with surgical thread, sealing him inside. Rolling the boy back over, he allowed himself a chuckle at the sight of the two rows of teats running up the front of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolton's arms were thick with blood, from fingers to shoulders. Yet still the boy breathed. It was unnatural. Suddenly feeling exhausted, and aware that it was past midday, he decided to retire to bed.

We ran him through. <i>You</i> ran him through\" Frey exclaimed, pointing a shaking, accusatory finger. \"Don't tell me you didn't have the guts to see it through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't explain it. By all rights, the boy should be dead,\" Bolton admitted. \"He's lost more blood than should be possible, yet when I checked on him, he still breathed and his wounds had begun to heal. Either I am a better healer than I know, or it is magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the last word, Walder Frey paled and sank back into his chair, trembling. \"Wine,\" he stammered weakly. \"Somebody get me wine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a rumour that Lord Beric still roams the Riverlands, though he is known to have been killed several times, all on the prayers of a fire priest,\" Roose Bolton offered calmly. \"Perhaps somebody out there is praying for the Stark boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well what are we to do about it,\" Frey mumbled fearfully. \"You'll have to finish the job. Cut his head off and throw it in the river. Let the gods heal that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's really no need. I've gelded him myself, the Stark line is no more.

Robb Stark still lay exactly where he had been left, his wrists and ankles shackled in iron chains bolted to the slab. Roose stepped forward, pressing his fingers to the castrated King's belly and massaging the fur. Somehow, either through magic or just the congealing of the blood, the direwolf pelt had fastened itself tightly to the flesh beneath, as though Robb had been born in it. Casually he ran a hand down the short, dark fur of the stomach, over the rows of pink teats, then down , sliding his fingers between the soft fur of the King's thighs and into his warm, tight, animal hole. He leaned closer to Robb's face encased in the direwolf's muzzle, feeling the shallow, still living breath of the beast on his cheek. The King in the North smelled like an animal, stinking of blood and sweat and the filth matted in her hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrey crept forward, cautious at first until he saw the chains and the results of Bolton's work.

There was some magic at play to be sure, perhaps some ancient secret in the Stark's blood from their days as wargs, but as long as it continued to work for Roose he didn't care to question it. On the fifth day, they sealed an iron collar about his neck, dragged him out into the kennels, and tied him to a stake with a thick chain. His hands and feet were shackled and chained, and the chains passed through metal loops in the floor. The chains could be pulled on, spreading the King's legs so that the hounds could sniff at his haunch. On a cold morning, they pulled a bucket of water from the river and threw it over him, and he came awake spluttering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing awake was painful. He had been having a wonderful dream. He'd dreamt he was Grey Wolf, running free across the Riverlands, away from the humans and The Twins, away from all the horror of the wedding, which faded in his mind to little more than the memory of a nightmare. Then he awoke to find the nightmare was real, his family, his wife, his men all dead, his war utterly lost, his body butchered and warped to Roose Bolton's sadistic design. Even his humanity had been taken. The freezing water dripped from his matted fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree hunting hounds paced around the walls of the kennel. Robb smelled of Direwolf, and now that he was awake they had backed away, sniffing at him timidly. Yet as the helplessness of the chained creature dawned on the animals, they became bolder. The smallest but boldest of the animals slunk behind Robb. He tried to pull away, a high whimper coming from his throat as he felt the dog's wet nose sniffing against the hole where his manhood had once been. The chains held him there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Frey soldiers watched him through the bars of the kennel, and they howled with laughter as the first dog mounted him, invading him with its hot shaft. His chains rattled as he tried without success to throw the heavy, hairy weight from his back. Robb bit his tongue, not giving his audience the satisfaction of crying out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when one of the larger hounds snapped at the first dog did it disengage itself, though only for the second dog to climb onto his back and claim him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"King in the North! King in the North!\" the men shouted jubilantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog inside him panted happily as it thrust away, its tongue lolling from its mouth, its breath hot on the back of his neck. To his further horror, he felt the shaft swelling painfully inside him, locking them together. Robb hung his head, feeling the dog spasm as its seed filled him. Only after what felt like an eternity did the animal disengage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third dog was small, scrawny and mangy, with loose, hanging fur. It had to stand on tiptoe to enter him, and the bones of its rib cage scraped over his spine as it humped him. The filthy beast seemed to savour the experience, drawing it out for an hour, hopping off the King's back every now and then to eat from a bowl of slop or relieve itself in the corner. The sound of the kennel door being unbarred and opened finally sends it scurrying into the corner.</span></div></div>",

Dogs for war, dogs for hunting, dogs for sniffing out scouts. Hundreds of them. Well we killed your men, King in the North, but not their dogs. We're not monsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dozen dogs were being lead into the kennel, Mormont's dogs from Bear Island, huge and shaggy and black, with loose, slobbering jowls and massive hairy cocks dangling between their legs. They strained at their collars their handlers were red-faced trying to control them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't bring many bitches though. That wasn't very fair, bringing so far from their homes with no bitches to keep them company. Between that and all the fighting, it's sent them all a little crazy. They're straining at their chains just from the smell of you. Half of them would gnaw their front legs of to get inside a fine piece of tail like you. So... we're going to let them have their fun. All of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the handlers releaased his chain, and the first, huge beast of Bear Island mounted his ex-master's King, driving his massive cock between his legs. A moan escaped Robb's lips as the weight of the animal forced the hair from his lungs. The men sniggered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After you've finished fucking the entire camp, you're to be taken back North to the Bolton's new castle, Winterfell. Roose is having a lovely breeding pen made out for you. As soon as we catch your bloody Direwolf, we're going to get you to work popping out a litter or two.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Waking with a yawn, Aladdin sat up in bed. It was always nice to wake up in the palace. Too many years living on the streets made him appreciate the soft mattress and the comfy bedding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning his hand through his hair he discovered it was much longer and softer than he recalled. But that was overshadowed by his discovery of his new sex. The bust was a revelation, the merest touch caused a surprised gasp to escape her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDashing over to the mirror she looked at her reflection. Her beauty was impossible to deny, her lips were full and her mouth formed a natural pout. It gave her look of need, and Aladdin knew what he'd do when presented with a willing mouth like that. The face already had an complete and perfect layer of make-up on it. Aladdin ran the back of her hand across it, hoping to smear the perfection away. To make her less alluring, less perfect, less of a woman...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt resisted her efforts, it was clearly a work of magic, although whether a prank by genie, or if genie had decided he needed to learn a lesson it was unclear. But at least she was pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin blew kisses to her reflection, but that caused confusing feelings and she stopped and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking in her naked body, she knew she'd feel more comfortable being clothed. Her former attire had vanished, and resting on a padded stool beside the bed was a set of clothes suitable for her new body, and the support it would need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCupping the girls in his hands, he enjoyed their warmth, and estimated them as being slightly larger... slightly fuller than Jasmine's own. Her thumbs brushed over the tender flesh, and a warm tingle raced down her spine when they passed over her nipples. The tingle ended in her crotch, and she dropped them in shock and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe temptation to keep caressing and teasing them was immense, but she focused on getting dressed. Once she had put on her clothes she returned to the mirror. Standing further back allowed her to take in the full effect. She looked every inch the princess, not a twin for Jasmine, but very like a sister or a best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning this way and that she admired how she filled her clothes, and the way the revealed and concealed her curves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped her posing when a disturbing thought struck her. Perhaps this is dark magic, and not from Genie... A curse to keep him from his beloved's side... or cast by someone without her best interests at heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe list of villians that he'd fought was now scarier, her current body didn't inspire as much confidence as his old one. Mozenrath and Sadira were both quite familiar with magic, Mirage was certainly capable of changing his entire world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bolted for the door. If this was the change inflicted on her what might Jasmine look like now. Aladdin's mind raced ahead, filling her with dread, and chilling alternatives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she darted through the palace, she found her whole body moved differently. It required more concentration, as she jiggled and shimmied. Her body kept on moving, when she changed directions... It was very unsettling, and humiliating, she raced past the guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made her self-conscious, but at least they didn't shout at her as if she were an intruder. But she felt their eyes boring into her, following her, with a less than professional air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body dictated a certain pace, although it felt like the girls wanted to burst free from the top, they found a steady rhythm, and she found her ass forming a counter-balancing jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left the guest quarters behind and entered the palace's royal suite. Jasmine's door was closed. The large double doors intimidating, as they stretched towards the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin took a second to gather her thoughts, catch her breath and check she was still decently dressed. With a slightly manic giggle, she kept her hysteria at bay. At least the Sultan couldn't object to her entry on grounds of propriety...</span></div></div>",

He/She really was shocked by the whole experience, clearly the Sultan knew <i>her</i>... and just as clearly wouldn't know Aladdin, so she let the old man's talk wash over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine came out of her bedroom, and found the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello sister mine, dearest Daddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a sigh before continuing, \"I suppose this means our little trip will be accompanied by the palace guards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was fantastic for Aladdin to see a friendly face, even is she didn't recognise him. Aladdin was startled to find that Jasmine looked as gorgeous as ever, but he/she didn't feel the same attraction. In fact, she felt sympathetic, she knew what a pain in the neck, and back it was to carry around such large breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course... Of course...\" The sultan babbled, as Jasmine took Aladda in a sisterly embrace. Their breasts smooshed against each other until they broke apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the girls had walked through the palace, they found Razoul and three of his hand-picked guards mounted and waiting in the courtyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls mounted up, Aladda feeling very vulnerable as she swung her female body... her weaker body into the saddle. It was much higher than she was used to, and the horses back felt wider than she preferred as her legs slid down either side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin had worked out that she was a royal princess, and Jasmine's sister, also the magic didn't appear malicious, so she went along with it. But there was a question that she wanted answered, but couldn't just ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas Jasmine her big sister, or little sister? Clearly there wasn't much between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine was in her traditional pale blue outfit, while Aladda wore a simple yellow number. The ride through the city was unsettling too. The admiring looks from the women, the ogling stares from the men, the awestruck little girls, and the preening boys. It all conspired to keep her aware of her new gender and beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://36.media.tumblr.com/93f84997fc44121ac7b5bca17506403d/tumblr_np7tntNUs71u4a69xo4_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://36.media.tumblr.com/93f84997fc441...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://36.media.tumblr.com/aade5da63ee77c7b1378265482d5f89c/tumblr_nkx5r6oP2t1u3wdwxo3_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://36.media.tumblr.com/aade5da63ee77...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting her lower lip, Aladda wondered if her outfit were too revealing. She hadn't planned on leaving the palace like this. Only intending on seeing Jasmine... or genie... and getting some answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped, realising how long it had been since she thought of her big blue friend. With a shudder Aladda wondered if this ... this different reality... was absorbing her. Did she .... did Aladda know Genie here.... Did she know Abu... Her heart raced at the idea of losing those friends... that link to the past... to <b>his </b>past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to increase the pace, encourage everyone to go a little faster. She stopped that very quickly when she realised her outfit wasn't designed for riding. It just made her jiggle and shake even more. It made more of the men stare, and cause a few of the women to shake their heads disapprovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they are free of the city, the guards allow the princess to set a faster pace.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When the princesses and their guard left the city of Agrabah, Aladda kept attempting to get close to Jasmine to speak with her and try to learn a little bit more about his situation but every time he tried she took it was a challenge and raced further ahead making Aladda ride faster to catch up.  And riding face was not a comfortable feeling now with his large hair and even larger breasts.  After a long time riding, Aladda thought he saw the oasis in the distance, but as soon as they got within about a hundred feet of the oasis, a sandstorm appeared out of nowhere as if by magic.  Aladda could only see a few feet in front of her, but luckily he was right behind Jasmine so he was able to keep her within arms reach.  But the relief Aladda felt didn't last as seconds later, before the guards could catch up there was a loud bang from beside the princesses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladda could here the guards shout, \"Ambush!\" before Aladda felt a sharp pain in his slender leg. He looked down to see a flaming hole in the ground beside his horse, and a large burn on the side of the horse and his leg.  Aladda shrieked in pain, and then another explosion set off behind him and Jasmine causing the horses panicked sprinting off.  Neither rider were able to calm down their horses, and it wasn't until minutes and miles later that the sand storm died down, and the horses calmed down along with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladda looked around where he and Jasmine had stopped and they could see nothing but sand.  Jasmine looked worried, \"I don't mean to worry you, but I don't know where we are right now, and I can't see Razoul or the others at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Jasmine, I'll figure out a way out of this, gah!\"  Aladda had tried to get off his horse, but his burned leg was having a hard time taking any weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Aladda!  I'm so sorry I didn't notice, I-I'll go find someone somehow, don't move!\"  Jasmine got up to desperatly find help, but she didn't have to wait long, as seemingly out of nowhere a decrepid old man with a long beard and horrible looking teeth approached the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my princesses, how amazing that I run into you both here, I am ever so humbled!\"  The old man gave a large obnoxious vibe as Aladda gasped, for he knew this old man.  For years ago before he'd ever met genie or had a real conversation with Jasmine, Aladdin had met this old man who took him to the cave of wonders and had trapped him in there to die.  This old man was the evil vizier and sorcerer, Jafar.  Aladda wanted to warn Jasmine but quickly realized that there was nothing he could do even if he told her, for he was an injured woman without so much as a stick to wave, and Jafar had all his evil magics that was probably responsible for the burns on his leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladda stewed while Jafar spoke to the girls.  \"I know of a way out of the endless sand and how to get back from Agrahbah, but I need your help to do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if we should trust this man Jasmine.\"  Aladda said knowingly to Jasmine, but the blue clad princess ignored her fellow princess, \"What can I do sir?  I need to get back as soon as possible to care for my sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to go in there.\"  Jafar pointed behind the girls and erupting out of the sand was the great mouth that opened to the cave of wonders, \"I can not enter there, the Cave only opens for such 'diamonds' as yourselves.  If you go inside of there and fetch me a lamp, I would be eternally greatful.  And don't worry poor girl, your injured sister is safe in my hands.\"  Jafar grinned a horrible grin that sent shivers down Aladda's spine in a way he'd never experienced before.  He recalled Jafar's desire to make Jasmine his bride, and Jafar was looking at him now in the same way he'd looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasmine, I really don't think...\"  But Jasmine cut him off, \"Aladda, I can look after and make choices for myself, you don't have to protect me from everything!  Let me protect you for once!\"  Jasmine said this like she was letting  a huge weight off her chest.  And before Aladda could argue back, Jasmine had sprinted into the cave leaving him alone with Jafar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sat in silence, only sharing looks.  Jafar with looks of lust, and Aladda with looks of hate.  Not a word was spoken before they both heard Jasmine exiting the cave.   It seems that since Abu wasn't in the cave this time there was no cave in.  Aladda tried to get to the lamp to rub it, release Genie and fix everything, but Jafar was much quicker even with an old man's appearance.  Aladda's only hope was that Jasmine had rubbed the lamp first.</span></div></div>",

It's Jafar!\"  But it was too late, in an instant Jafar had lifted his disguise and bounded to Jasmine who had the lamp ripped from her hands.  Jafar gave a moch bow and said in his slimy sarcastic voice, \"Thank you oh so much my princess, but this will be the last time I will ever boy to you or your nosy sister.\"  Jafar eagerly rubbed the lamp and a tower of purple smoke arose surrounding them all.  Finally an intimidating voice that filled the sands erupted, \"At last!  After 10,000 years I'm free!  Time to conquer Earth!\"  The voice turned back to Genie's normal joking tone, \"JK everyone.  No need to panic, now how about we start things off with...\"  Genie was about to get on a joking roll, but was stopped by Jafar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop talking Genie, for my first wish, I wish to be the most powerful sorcerer in the world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, so great.  Much original.\"  Genie said rolling his eyes, but he listened to his master and suddenly Jafar was glowing with a powerful dark red energy that scared both Jasmine and Aladda.  Jafar cackled, \"And now onto the palace.\"  Jafar waved his cape and his glowing snake scepter and suddenly the four of them were back in the palace.  The guards noticed instantly and shouted out, \"Jafar!\"  And charged with with swords in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stood no chance.  Jafar pointed his staff and said, \"You are nothing but a simple thorn in my side.\"  And a beam shot out of the snake's eyes that turned all the guards into roses.  Despite the defeat, Jasmine took this as a good sign, \"No matter what you do or how much power you have, the people will never support you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafar squinted his eyes at Jasmine, \"True, but if I am Sultan they will have no choice, especially with a lovely bride at my side.\"  He glanced slyly between Aladda and Jasmine.  \"Don't worry, whichever of you I choose to marry, I'll let the other on live as our serving girl so you can see each other.  I would hate to break up your little dream team.  Genie I know my second wish, I wish that I was the Sultan and married to the eldest of these two princesses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenie once again looked sour and mouthed, 'Sorry' to Aladda and Jasmine before shooting off another beam of magic.

He knew that if he could get close enough to Jafar he'd be able to pounce on any mistake he made all the quicker.  His mind racing as Jafar put his cold hands over her shoulders Aladda remembered how he'd defeated Jafar the first time he had this much power.  Could it work again?  He'd have to use every tool he had to do it, but it could work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Jasmine had taken the Sultan to the stables Aladda got to work.  With a come hither look on his new face he walked slowly over to Jafar making sure every asset he now had was on display.  Jafar seemed pleased that Aladda was already accepting her role.  He leaned his head in to kiss is new bride, but before their lips could meet Aladda spoke.  \"It's a shame really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafar looked angered that he would be spoken to by his property without having given permission first.  \"What?\"  He said sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a shame that for all the power you have, you are still not the most powerful man in the room.\"  Aladda said slowly turning to Genie who was grimly amusing himself by arranging the guards turned flowers into beautiful arrangements.  It seems without Aladdin to play off of, he was much less fun.  Jafar looked at Aladda angerly, \"That creature is my servant, it has to do what I say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he still has powers that you could never dream of, imagine what it must be like to have all the power in the universe at your fingertips.  You may be powerful, oh husband of mine, but it doesn't even compare.\"  Aladda continued to egg on Jafar, once before he'd tricked Jafar into trapping himself as a genie and he was sure he could do it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to see ultimate power?  I shall show it to you and then you and all the world will bow before me!\"  Jafar had madness in his eyes, \"Genie!  I know my final wish!\"</span></div></div>",

Aladda hoped that even with a new timeline or alternate universe or whatever was happening that had made Aladdin Aladda, that Jafar would still be vain enough to fall for the same trick again.  \"Genie I know my final wish.  You have given me great power, I am the most powerful man on Earth.  And yet my power is nothing compared to yours.  So with my final wish slave, I wish to be an all powerful genie!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenie let out a long sigh, \"Fine.  Whatever you want.  Your wish is my command.\"  And with a lazy point of his big blue finger, Genie zapped Jafar with an empowering energy.  Quickly Jafar's narrow from exploded into a gigantic, red, and muscular form.  Jafar kept growing and growing until he took burst through the ceiling of the palce.  With a hint of glee to his voice Jafar belowed out loud for the whole world to hear, <b><span class=\"cred\">\"THE POWER!  THE ABSOLUTE POWER!\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe explosion of power seemed to cause a wind storm down below, both princesses grabbed a hold of the horse sultan in an effort to not get blown away.  Over the howling wind Aladda could hear Jasmine called out, \"What have you done?\"  To which Aladda replied with the usual response, \"Trust me!\"  And Jasmine did trust her 'sister' the two held each other's hands amits the storm as Aladda waited for the fianl part of the plan to appear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJafar practically above the atmosphere continued to indulge in his power.  <b><span class=\"cred\">\"THE UNIVERSE IS MINE TO COMMAND!  TO CONTROL!\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast Jafar!\"  A soft yet strong femine voice called out.  Jafar looked down to see his bride standing with a smile on her face.  <b><span class=\"cred\">\"OH MY PET, NOTHING CAN STOP ME NOW!\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you forgetting something?\"  Aladda said, \"You want to be a genie, you've got it!\"<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cred\"><br>\r\n\"WHAT!\"</span></b>  Jafar screamed as two gold bracers magically clasped to his wrists.  Aladda continued now holding up a newly formed black lamp, \"And everything that goes with it!  Phenomenal cosmic powers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cred\">\"NO!\"</span></b>  Jafar cried as he spiraled back to the palace and into his new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Itty bitty living space.\"  Aladda said with a smile.  It took a moment for everyone else to figure out what just happened.  Jasmine jumped into Aladda's arms, \"Oh sister I'm sorry for ever doubting you!  You did it!  You saved us all!\"  The two shared a victory hug but Jasmine's mood quickly dampened, \"But...what now.  How can we...fix everything.  Oh father!\"  Jasmine said suddenly running to the sultan who was still a horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenie floated over to Aladda, \"Another example of a wife putting her man in place.  You go girl!\"  Genie said as he snapped his fingers three times.  Aladda smiled, it was the first time Genie had shown any of his old spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine looked to Genie and with tears in her eyes asked, \"Can you fix this?  Make everything go back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I were free I could, but I'm not so I'm bound to the lamp and granting three wishes to whoever holds it.\"  In all the rush of victory Aladda forgot about Genie's lamp, the one thing that could make Aladda, Aladdin again.  Jasmine and Aladda both look for Genie's lamp in order to get wishes with their own motivations.</span></div></div>",

Jasmine walked to Genie and said, \"So I have three wishes was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is indeed correctomundo my dear, but there are a number of rules that you should know about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you fix the awful things Jafar did?  Will that violate any rules?\"  Jasmine asked practically pleading with Genie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenie was a bit startled, perhaps because this would be the first not selfish wish he'd heard...maybe ever.  \"Yeah I could do that but don't you want anything for yourself.\"  Genie said giving Jasmine an out to be selfish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I want you to, no, I wish for you to please fix my father and the guards and everything.\"  Jasmine said with the authority of someone who knows what they want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenie's eyes lit up, \"Mam yes mam!\"  And a series poofs of magic popped up everywhere Jafar had done damage.  The flowers that were now in a beautiful display made my genie turned into the guards standing in a human pyramid that fell apart fairly quickly, and the horse turned back into Jasmine's father including a brand spanking new sultan outfit for a bonus touch that features not one but two fancy feathers on the hat.  The sultan kissed Jasmines hand and then made his way to Aladda and did the same.  \"My beautiful daughters, my brave beautiful daughts.  I am so proud of you both, and I'm sure your mother would be too if she were here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother...\"  Jasmine said sadly.  Genie hearing this quickly tapped her on the shoulder, \"Not to ruin the moment but before you get any ideas in your head just know that one of the rules that I have is not bringing back the dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine smiled, \"It's okay, I wasn't going to wish for that.

Jasmine continued, \" I mean why is she dressed in that wedding outfit that Jafar made her wear when he married her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladda looked down at her hand and sure enough the gold band was still there, in all the magic and chaos of the last few minutes Aladda hadn't even registured that he still was dressed as Jafar's bride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenie pulled at a collar on his neck that magically appeared, \"You see, that wasn't done with Jafar's magic, he wished for that so the only way to change Aladda being married to Jafar is with another wish.  Sorry, I'd undo it myself if I could.\"  Genie looked very sorry towards Aladda who looked at the black lamp that contained Jafar with disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that won't do, Genie, I know what I want for my second wish,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Jasmine!  Don't use a wish on that, just...give me the lamp and I'll use a wish on it myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Aladda I insist, you risked everything for me, let me just give this to you, you deserve happiness and being married to Jafar could never give you that.

Aladda coughed and when the smoke had gone away he was actually happy to see his breasts again in a yellow version of Jasmines usual outfit and a finger that did not have a wedding band magically stuck to it.  \"Thank you.\"  Aladda said hugging Genie and Jasmine.  Genie blushed, \"Oh it's no big deal.  Just doing my job.  I figure if I get to be free of that Jafar jerk then you should be too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Free...Genie I think I heard you say something about freedom earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm tied to that lamp now and forevermore until the end of time and beyond.  But I'm used to it.  Comes with the territory of being a genie and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if someone freed you?\"  Jasmine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenie chuckled, \"It'd be nice, but my master would have to use a wish to do that and...that's not going to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.\"  Jasmine said matter of factually.  Aladda's head turned quickly, Genie was her only chance to get back to normal and if Genie was free it might make it trickier to fix.  But when Aladda looked at Genie's face and his binding bracers Aladda felt a pit drop in her stomach as she realized how selfish she felt.  Sure if she wished everything back to normal Genie would be free anyway but how could he convey to genie what was normal?  What if the wishes just didn't work out and that could leave Genie a slave to the lamp forever.  Aladda knew she couldn't live with that, not after knowing a free Genie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish you were free Genie.\"  Jasmine said holding out the lamp.  Aladda had never felt prouder or more full of love and admiration for Jasmine, although for now it would have to be a sisterly love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...what?\"  Genie said confused not belieing what he'd heard but in seconds the gold bracers fell off and out of the smoke below his waist two blue legs appeared.  \"I'm free?  I'm free!  Yippi yi yo kayay I'm free!\"  He zoomed over to Aladda and Jasmine and gave them a humongous hug.  \"Thank you both so much!  I promise that I'll come back and see you some time, but for now...I'm going to Disneyworld!\"  And with that Genie flew away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's so happy.  I can't wait to see him again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too Jasmine, me too.\"  Aladda said quickly going over his options.  He didn't want to give up being Aladdin just yet, he still had hope.  He knew Genie would be good to his word and come back...someday.  But Aladda knew she could become Aladdin again if he made a very carrfully worded wish with the newly made Jafar genie, but was she really desperate enough to play that deadly game?</span></div></div>",

He calls, \"Yes, Ariel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel walks into his room and says, \"I just wanted to say goodbye before Melody and I leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric smiles as he walks up to his wife.  Today was the 1st day of their monthly vacation in Atlantica.  6 months after the defeat of Morgana, his wife and daughter have always left the castle every month to visit Ariel's home under the sea for a whole week.  Despite the fact Melody chose to live on land with her parents over her grandfather's offer of letting her live in Atlantica as a mermaid, Ariel decided Melody should visit her family under the sea from time to time, since she kept Melody's mermaid heritage a secret for the first 12 years of her life.  Melody happily agreed to the idea since she loves the ocean so much and she loves being a mermaid with her mother.  Eric agreed to the idea since he only wants to see his daughter be happy and the ocean was so much safer now that Morgana was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo for the past year and a half, Ariel and Melody would leave the castle, have King Triton transform them both into mermaids, and they would spend the next week with their underwater family.  Though every time they leave, Eric always finds himself lonely without his family by his side.  His dog, Max, would always be there to cheer him up, but it just isn't the same without his loving wife and his beautiful daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is why this time, when his father-in-law arrives, he'll ask something of him.  Something he isn't sure he'll get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the present, Eric hugs Ariel close to him, and they kiss each other's lips.  They break apart and smile at each other when they hear Melody say, \"Ewww!  Can't you guys do that with the doors closed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric turns to the doorway to see his now 14 year-old daughter standing there.  He breaks apart from his wife and he picks up his daughter, and hugs her close to him.  Melody hugs him back and says, \"I'm gonna miss you, Dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kisses her forehead and says, \"Me too, Mel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel walks over to them and hugs Eric from behind.  She lets go then walks in front of him and smiles.  Eric says, \"I love you girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel says, \"We love you too, Eric.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lets go of his daughter, who runs out the door and toward the dock.  Her parents follow her outside and they walk down to the end of the pier where they find King Triton waiting for them.  Melody hugs her grandfather, who hugs her back and smiles at his daughter.  He gazes at his son-in-law and bows a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriton asks, \"Are you two ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both say yes, and Eric steps back.  Triton points his trident at Ariel and Melody and fires the golden magic at them.  Eric watches as his wife and daughter are lifted into the air in a glowing golden light.  Soon enough, the golden light encases both of them.  As the light fades, he can see their clothes have vanished from their bodies, and their legs have merged together to form their tails.  His daughter Melody has a bright red tail and blue seashells to cover her breasts, while his wife Ariel, as always, has a green tail and a pair of purple shells to cover her own breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light fades away completely, they both dive into the waters and resurface a moment later to wait for Triton.  Eric says, \"Your highness, may I speak to your alone for a moment?  There is something I must ask of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriton raises an eyebrow, but he nods, and turns back to his daughter and grandfather, and says, \"Ariel, Melody, go to the palace and wait there.  I'm going to have a few words with Eric.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey nod their heads, and Ariel blows a kiss in his direction before she dives under the water.  Melody stay behind for a few more moments and says, \"I love you, Daddy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric smiles and says, \"I love you too, Melody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody dives under water and Eric turns his head back to Triton.  His father-in-law says, \"Now Eric, what is it you wanted to ask me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric says, \"First off, what I'm about to ask you is gonna sound weird, and completely out of nowhere.  And it's not meant to be a joke in any way, shape. or form.  This is a very serious question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriton nods and asks, \"Of course, Eric.  Now what are you so serious about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric takes a deep breath, looks straight into his father-in-law's eyes, and says, \"I want you to transform me into a merman.\"</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m gonna be completely honest with you, every time Ariel and Melody leave for Atlantica, I miss them very much.  Those two girls are my life.  One week without them seems like a whole month to me.  I just want to join my wife and daughter beneath the waves.  Plus, I see the way they hug me when they come back.  From what I can see, despite all the fun they have, every time they leave, they miss me very much.  One week without me is probably like an entire year to them.  I know for sure they would enjoy having me by their side.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriton nods and says, \u201cI can understand your point, Eric.  But I don\u2019t think any of those are the main reason, is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric says, \u201cNo it isn\u2019t.  The main reason is I want to see Atlantica for myself.  Ariel has told me many things about her home, but there\u2019s only so much you can learn by just hearing stories.  People learn in many different ways, but experience is the best teacher.  So I have to see her home for myself.  How can I learn more about Ariel if I've never even seen her home?  I\u2019ve shown Ariel my world, but she hasn\u2019t shown me hers.  I feel that as her husband, I deserve the right to know more about her past.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriton smiles, and lays a hand on Eric\u2019s shoulder and says, \u201cEric, I completely understand your reason, and I agree with you.  If a man is to ever truly love a women, he has to know everything about her.  In fact, it seems a little unfair that Ariel hasn\u2019t invited you to Atlantica at all since she and Melody started visiting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric says, \u201cSo, you\u2019re saying\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriton laughs and says, \u201cEric, it would be an honor for you to visit my kingdom, and I would be happy to transform you into a merman!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiles and says, \u201cGreat!  Then fire away!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis father-in-law chuckles and says, \u201cI\u2019m afraid it will have to wait, Eric.  Since you\u2019ll be coming as well, I have to notify the staff at the palace that they should be expecting one extra guest.  It may take a few hours to prepare the palace for your arrival.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric says, \u201cYou know what?  I haven\u2019t told anyone in my palace that I\u2019ll be leaving so that\u2019s fine.  When will you be ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriton says, \u201cExpect me back by night time.  By then I\u2019ll be ready to take you to Atlantica.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric bows and says, \u201cThank you for accepting my request, King Triton.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriton lifts up his chin, and says, \u201cWe\u2019re family, Eric.  We always have been since the day you married my daughter.  I\u2019m not just your wife\u2019s father, I\u2019m your father as well.  So, please, no more of this \u2018highness\u2019 nonsense.  Just call me Father.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric smiles and says, \u201cThank you then Father.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriton turns around to dive back down when Eric asks, \u201cFather, can you do one more thing for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriton says, \u201cSure, what is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric says, \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell Ariel or Melody about this.  I want this to be a surprise for both of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis father-in-law smiles and says, \u201cOf course, Eric.  Your secret is safe with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriton dives under the water and Eric heads back to his palace to inform his staff of his departure.</span></div></div>",

It is now nighttime and a full moon bathes the ocean in light.  Eric gazes down at the water, wondering what it would be like to swim with his wife, and if he had a tail instead of legs.  He smiles since soon, he won\u2019t have to wonder about any of this.  After 10 minutes, King Triton emerges in front of the pier and smiles at Eric.  He says, \u201cThe palace is ready for your arrival, Eric.  And Ariel and Melody have no knowledge of your arrival, just like you asked.  Are you ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric says, \u201cI\u2019ve informed the castle staff of my departure, so yes, I\u2019m ready.\u201d  He holds his hands out to the side in anticipation of his transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe says, \u201cThis isn\u2019t gonna hurt, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriton chuckles and says, \u201cNo.  From what Melody told me, the only thing you\u2019ll feel is your legs tingle.  Also, you should definitely close your eyes, since the light can blind you for a few minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric closes his eyes, lifts his hands into the air by his side, takes a deep breath and says, \u201cAlright, I\u2019m ready, Father.

He feels his feet leave the ground as he is lifted up into the air.  He can feel the magic encase his entire body from head to toe.  During all this, he can\u2019t help but feel giddy.  At long last, he\u2019ll be able to join his family in the ocean!  Suddenly, he feels the magic enter and then transform his very body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Triton said, Eric feels his legs tingle as they are pulled to each other, starting at his thighs.  The feeling continues as his legs fuse into what will be his tail.  While that happens, he feels all of his clothes vanish from his body, leaving him completely naked, though thankfully no one can see his body thanks to the light  He can feel King Triton\u2019s magic course through his body and veins, making him smile.  The magic feels good.  He really wants to see what is happening, but Triton\u2019s warning reverberates in his mind, shutting up his thoughts.  He feels his toes go numb as his feet join together, completing his tail, and he feels his new tail fin grow out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric feels the magic dissipate from around him and he finally opens his eyes and stares down.  Seeing his father-in-law smile at him, he dives into the water and feels the cool water refresh his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking his eyes several times, Eric notices that he is breathing underwater.  Looking down, he smiles when he sees that instead of his human legs, he finds a dark blue fish tail connected to his waist.  He rubs his hand on his tail, noticing how smooth his scales are.  He can feel the magic of the trident flowing through his entire body, making his smile grow bigger as he realizes he is no longer a human, he is now a creature of the sea.  Eric smiles even more as he enjoys his new merman status.  He thinks, \u2018Ariel is going to love this!\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow passes over him and he turns around to find his father-in-law behind him, smiling down at him.  Triton says, \u201cSo what do you think, Eric?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric says, \u201cWell, it feels different having a tail instead of legs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriton swims around his son-in-law and says, \u201cWell, you make a fine merman, Eric!  Ariel will love your new form!  I guarantee it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric says, \u201cThank you again for turning me into a merman, Father.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric yelps as he is grabbed by the sea king and hugged by his father-in-law.  Triton holds his son-in-law against his muscular chest and bellows happily, \u201cI told you before, we\u2019re family, Eric!  And that\u2019s what family does for each other!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric freezes in the bigger merman\u2019s arms, but after a moment, he shrugs and returns the hug.  After a few moments, they break apart and Triton says, \u201cWell, we should leave now.  Follow me, Eric.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric says, \u201cI would if I could, Father, but I don\u2019t actually know how to use this thing.\u201d  He wags his tail and rubs the back of his head embarrassingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriton chuckles, swims back to him and says, \u201cNot to worry, Eric.  I shall teach you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly an hour, Triton finally manages to teach his son-in-law how to swim as a merman.  Eric kicks his tail harder as he rushes to the surface.  He jumps out of the water and smiles as he enjoys his new tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dives back under the water, and sighs as he feels how cool it is.  He turns his head toward his father-in-law, who looks at him with an amused look on his face.  He says, \u201cAre you done yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric rubs his head sheepishly and says, \u201cSorry, I was having too much fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriton says, \u201cUnderstandable.  Melody told me she was like that her first time as well.  Now, didn\u2019t you want to surprise Ariel and Melody?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric swims back to Triton\u2019s side and says, \u201cOf course.  Lead the way, Father.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriton says, \u201cGladly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric follows Triton to Atlantica, kicking his tail as fast as he can.  Eventually, Triton stops when they reach the edge of the city.  Eric stops and floats alongside his father-in-law.  Triton turns his head to Eric, gestures with his trident and says, \u201cEric, welcome to my kingdom, Atlantica!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric gazes at the city and finds himself amazed at the beauty of it.  He says, \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful.  If I had known this is what your city looks like, Father, then I would have come here a lot sooner!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriton smiles and says, \u201cThank you for the compliment, Eric.  Now follow me and I will take you to Ariel\u2019s room in the palace where you\u2019ll be staying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriton and Eric swim towards the palace and Eric marvels at how majestic it looks.  Eventually, Triton opens the door to Ariel\u2019s room and gestures for Eric to swim inside, which he does.  Triton says, \u201cStay here, Eric.  I\u2019ll get Ariel and Melody to come see you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric nods and Triton closes the door, leaving Eric to figure out what he says to his family when they see the new him.</span></div></div>",

Where are we going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grandfather smiles and says, \u201cI have something wonderful to show you and your mother.  Something that I believe you will both enjoy very much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody looks at her mother, who shrugs and continues swimming.  Eventually, they make it to Ariel\u2019s bedroom, and Ariel says, \u201cDaddy, what are we doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriton smiles and says, \u201cJust open the door and you\u2019ll see what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel shrugs and opens the door to her bedroom.  After the door fully opens, Melody and her mother open their eyes wide, and drop their jaws when they see Eric floating in the bedroom with a dark blue fish tail where his legs should be.  He smiles as he finds his family surprised at his presence.  He does a twirl and says, \u201cSo, what do you girls think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody is the first to react as she suddenly swims forward, hugs her father, and exclaims, \u201cDad!  I never thought I\u2019d actually see you here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric hugs his daughter back, and enjoys the moment he shares with her.  As he holds Melody, he looks to his wife to find her still staring at him with her mouth agape.  After a few minutes, they let go of each other, and Melody leans down and grabs the fin of her father\u2019s tail, pulling it close to her face, still believing this to be a dream.  She says, \u201cDad, are you actually a merman?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric smiles and says, \u201cOf course, Mel!  How else would I be here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody lets go of his tail, squees and says, \u201cOh my gosh!  There\u2019s so much I want to show you, Dad!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs his hand and pulls him out of the bedroom, and they swim out of the palace.  Ariel finally asks, \u201cDaddy?  When did Eric become a merman?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel feels a hand on her shoulder and turns around to find her father laying his hand on her shoulder, and smiling at her.  He says, \u201cJust about an hour ago.  After you and Melody left, Eric requested that I transform him into a merman.  So I did.  After that, I took an hour to teach him how to swim with his tail.  He asked that I don\u2019t tell you or Melody.  He wanted it to be a surprise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that she wasn\u2019t complaining about her husband\u2019s merman form, she asks, \u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriton smiles and says, \u201cHe says he wants to spend more time with you and Melody.  Specifically, in the ocean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel slowly starts to smile and she hugs her father, and says, \u201cThank you, Daddy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTriton holds his daughter against his muscular chest and says, \u201cDon\u2019t thank me, thank Eric.  He asked me to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe says, \u201cI mean thank you for giving him a tail.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father says, \u201cI know that you and Melody miss him so much whenever you visit us.  So I knew you would love the surprise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lets go of her and says, \u201cAren\u2019t you gonna follow them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe says, \u201cNo, I\u2019ll let Eric spend some time alone with Melody.  It\u2019s been a while since they did anything special together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few hours, Melody shows her father the entire city of Atlantica.  Eric follows her along and smiles as she shows him all the wonders of the city.  Near the end of the night, Melody starts to grow tired, and starts to drift to the ocean floor.  Eric grabs his daughter in his arms, and Melody squirms a little and says, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Dad.  I can swim back to the palace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling at his daughter\u2019s stubbornness, he says, \u201cNo you can't, Melody.  You\u2019re too tired to swim on your own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody says, \u201cHow would you know?  This is the first time I\u2019ve seen you as a merman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric smiles and says, \u201cBecause I\u2019m your father, and your mother tells me everything about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody shrugs and wraps her arms around her father\u2019s chest, and lays her head against his chest.  Eric takes his daughter back to the palace, and after asking King Triton where her bedroom is, lays her in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody looks up at her father and says, \u201cI\u2019m so happy you\u2019re here, Dad.  What made you want to come here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric brushes his hand through her hair and says, \u201cI wanted to spend more time with you and your mother.  So get some rest.  Good night Melody.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leans down and kisses his daughter\u2019s forehead and says, \u201cI love you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody leans up, hugs her father, kisses him on the cheek and says, \u201cI love you too, Dad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric pulls her covers up and leaves her room.  He enters him and Ariel\u2019s room, and finds his wife fixing the covers to their bed.  Sneaking up behind her, he wraps his arms around her chest, lays his head on her right shoulder and says, \u201cGuess who?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel turns around and smiles at her husband.  He says, \"I put Melody in bed, so it's just you and me now.\"  Leaning forward, they embrace and kiss each other, and after they catch their breath, they gaze into each other\u2019s eyes.  Ariel takes his hand and leads him to the bed, where they lay down on their sides facing each other.  Ariel moves her hand downward towards her husband\u2019s tail, but she pulls it away.  Eric grabs her hand and says, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Ariel.  You can touch it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe resumes moving her hand down, lays it on Eric\u2019s tail, and rubs it up and down his smooth scales.  She says, \u201cI never thought I would actually see you like this, Eric.  I\u2019ve always wondered what you would look like as a merman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe says, \u201cI never heard what your thoughts are on it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel says, \u201cEric, you are the most handsome merman I have ever met.  If this is how I first saw you all those years ago, I still would have fallen in love with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric lays his hand on her cheek, smiles, and says, \u201cSo you love it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel smiles and says, \u201cI love the new you just as much as the old you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric pulls her close, and kisses her.  He rubs his tail against his wife\u2019s tail, pulls away from her lips and says, \u201cI love you, Ariel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel says, \u201cI love you too, Eric.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mercouple falls asleep holding each other, happy to be together.</span></div></div>",

And the heat wave was the only threat that pervaded the Pridelands at the moment. Nothing the Lion Guard could do. In fact, the rest of the guard were off cooling down with their families and friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the lion's den back at Pride Rock was cool and shady enough, Kion thought this little jungle like paradise was just as good and next to a water source to drink and swim in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YAWN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, his body was yearning for some rest and long nap as his eyelids felt heavy. Soon, he fell into a deep slumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until around ten minutes later that something unusual happened. His body glowed in a golden light and he began to shrink! Soon, he was the size of a grub with the world becoming much larger as blades of grass became as tall as trees. After a while, Kion tossed a bit before waking up, stretching and yawning as he got up. He slowly opened his eyes to discover his surroundings had drastically changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to me?!\" he said looking around in panic of the bigger world he was in. Then, he heard a familiar voice as it flew pass him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm late! I'm late! I'm terribly terribly late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zazu?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the red billed hornbill yet as small as he was and didn't seem to notice or care about. He kept repeating about being late but for what? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wait up!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKion called out as he attempt to catch up with the bird before he dove into a meerkat hole at the base of a nearby tree. The lion cub followed suit into the hole before tumbling down into it. After getting up and shaking off some dirt, he found himself at the beginning of a tunnel. Zazu seemed to have went farther ahead into as he couldn't see him anymore down the passage yet could still hear his mantra of being late. After going down some ways, he encountered a three way fork in the road and decided which path to take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich way did he go?</span></div></div>",

After some time, the pathway began to shrink as the corridor became cramped with his mane nearly scrapping the ceiling. How darker it was complicated things further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe I should head back and take a different way.' he thought to himself. However, before he could turn around, his next step made him tumble onto a slide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHOA!\" he cried as he rode down with twists and turns around every corner. The ride took a few minutes before it dropped him into a room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOF!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe landed onto his back after falling a couple feet off the ground. Kion got up and shook off some dirt before taking a look at his surroundings. The room was rather large, like the size of a fully grown tree, made up of clay colored rock like the lion's den but unnaturally near smooth and perfectly square. The floor was a gray slate, also smoothed out. The walls were adorned with some cave drawings of various animals, similar to the ones Rafiki makes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what caught his attention was a smooth flat round rock in the center of the room as tall as he was. On top were two half coconuts, like it was perfectly cut down the middle. As he approached them out of curiosity, he discovered the halves were filled with some kind of liquid, the left blue while the right red. His nose caught a fruity scent from them. What would they taste like?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm late! I'm terribly terribly late!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA familiar voice broke him out of his thoughts as Zazu flew past him, now the size of a beetle, smaller than before. Now where did he come from? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Wait!\" Kion called as he tried to pounce at him only to miss as the bird flew into a door the size of a mouse hole. A feint click was heard afterward, locked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now what?' he thought to himself as he looked around the room, looking for a way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked back to the coconuts again. He was getting a bit thirsty and maybe a drink might help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich coconut did he drink from?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Soon, he guzzled it down in a flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah.\" he sighed, wiping his mouth his paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing seemed to happen at first, but soon he found his surroundings becoming larger as he shrunk down to Zazu's size from earlier. Now he would be able to fit through the door! He ran towards it and with his front paws he tried to push the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! Come on! Open!\" he cried out as the door didn't budge no matter how much force he used, even trying to use his head and zebra kicked it. He noticed the handle and yanked it with his teeth yet still to no avail. The keyhole just below it stared at him and he stared back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe something had to fit in there to open it?' he thought to himself. Looking around the gargantuan room, he spotted the black crude looking key, halfway over the ledge of the stone table. When did he missed that when he drank from the coconut? Still, how was he going to get it with his size dilemma? Just one obstacle after another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile looking around for another solution, he discovered something at the corner of his right eye. East of him was some kind of crude treasure box/chest, reddish brown with gold outlines. Again, things felt like they were popping right out of nowhere and just confusing him even more so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe approached the chest and with a paw flipped the lid right open to see that the chest was full of...</span></div></div>",

No more sexism...\" Amy cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFry tried to ignore the problems with the engine. But there was a vibration. The whole ship was just juddering, just slightly, and to Fry it was just the wrong frequency. As she felt her top rub back and forth across her new, bigger, better, enhanced nips. As the fabric lost it's ability to hide such secrets, she tried to sneak a peek and see if it was suffering the same problems. She just wanted to ease the itch, and have a good guy scratch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, her glance didn't go unobserved, prompting Amy to call to Leela, \"Hey, she's showing her raspberry ripples...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilot chuckled, casting a backwards glance, as Fry tugged her jacket closed, and crossed her arms at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, she can deal with Zapp Brannigan, if we run into him.

Hoping to hide the nipples as they demanded attention. She wasn't used to guessing the size of the girls. Especially <i>her girls</i>, and especially from this angle. The girls were a perky C-cup, more than full enough for the newest female crew member of Planet Express. The jostled and bounced like kittens beneath a blanket, as Fry pulled the zip higher, her cheeks crimson, as she tried and failed to hide her embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't I ...\" her voice trembling and cracking, Fry stopped talking, raising a shaking finger she pointed to the black and white French maid's outfit, in Hermes' outstretched hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have to...\" she swallowed nervously, \"wear that...\"</span></div></div>",

The ruffled layers tickled as she felt them. She almost snatched her hands back in fear, as she turned it around, and saw how capacious, the neckline was on the uniform. In horror she saw a pale red colour blossom on her fingers. Before her eyes, it darkened, becoming more scarlet, and taking on a glossy sheen. Scarlet talons topping fingers that were much slimmer than Fry had ever known, leading to slender wrists, and beneath her jacket to arms that felt positively weak and spindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, she spotted, that her body was still shifting, still becoming more feminine. The zip and T-shirt just framing the cleavage that was straining for freedom. She shifted her balance, stopping, straight away, as she felt the seams of her trousers teasing her pussy with their bristly threads. Even as she tried to avoid picturing that, a snap announced, the beginning of the end for the stitching. Her hands reached around as a sustained <i>purrrr</i>, told of the seat of her trousers surrendering to the inevitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if driving home the contrast, she spotted that her belt was feeling looser, an extra hole or two would need to be added. She ran her hands from her rounded thighs, up to her vanishingly thin waist, up ... up towards the girls. She truly had an hourglass body, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's Stephanie now.\" she muttered in a whisper. Without a mirror, to judge it as an observer, she couldn't tell if she were bustier than Leela. But she had to assume she was curvier than Amy. Already she was tired of the weight pulling on her shoulders, and the way the girls continued to dance and shift after she'd stopped moving. The least thing setting them off, she wanted to shrug... to sigh... to shake her fists at the uncaring universe. But all of those would just set the girls off, their shimmying, jiggling dance, a reminder of her new sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jacket hung differently on Fry now, the narrower shoulders allowing it to bag unattractively, and giving it more space to allow her swelling bust. She knew that she couldn't stay in these clothes, much longer. Looking down she scowled at the maid outfit, and slumped towards the changing room.</span></div></div>",

The antenna atop his head was a distant memory, in it's place, a coppery hemisphere of copper served in the place of hair. But it was the cans that drew and kept his attention. Each like a half a soccer ball stuck to her chest. Their silvery aluminium sheen topped off with coppery nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking across the room, Bender moved differently too. Her hips pistoning, as she jiggled across the room.

Experience the excitement of being really crappy at something else apart from delivery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnzipping her jacket, the girls surged forward. She was undeniably bigger than Amy, and now even bigger than Leela. The T-shirt was next, lifting her bust, just to allow it to drop, as they fell free of the hem of her T-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven that was a revelation, the teasing caress as the soft cotton raced over her nips, exciting them, heating them with a simple brief friction. The trousers were more problematic, clinging like a second skin. But eventually she peeled them off too. The last of the stitching failing to hold in her rounded thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer reflection was confusing, she loved it. But it made her feel insecure too. The girls were high, perfect and full. Not having fought gravity before a few minutes ago. Nervously, she licked her lips. There was a waxy gloss, and leaning closer to the mirror she saw that her lipstick was the same candy apple red as her nail polish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResolutely she wanted to face the world, but the worried girl facing her out of the mirror didn't look convincing.

A moment later the door opened and a man stepped outside.  He appeared a bit disheveled as if he had been awaken from his slumber and his rather rotund form, balding and graying hair and older appearance would make one wonder what the Princess of the Fire Nation was doing here.  \"Darn travellers, just 'cause you got caught in one of my animal traps doesn't mean you can jus--\" he stopped upon noticing the three girls, his eyes narrowing as he saw the manner of dress of the one in the middle.  \"Fire Nation...\" he spat, \"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it that you are the man known as Liang?\" Azula asked rather plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man eyed her and rubbed his long mustache and shorter-yet-pointed beard. \"Perhaps I am and perhaps I ain't.  What business would you three little girls have with Liang anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Mai and Ty Lee moved to either side of the man, flanking him. \"As you are no doubt aware the Fire Nation is currently embroiled in a war of unification, attempting to bring the Earth Kingdom and Northern and Southern Water Tribes under its control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd be right about that girly, even out here in the boonies word travels.\" the man answered. \"But that still doesn't explain what you want with Liang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula smiled a very serpent-esque smile. \"At present, though my nation's march towards conquest moves smoothly a spanner has been thrown into the works.\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Avatar.\" stated the man, \"Yes that piece of information too has reached all the way out here.  A long thought extinct member of the Air Nomads returns and, with a group of friends in tow, has set out to prevent the Fire Nation's global conquest.  A goal that is as foolhardy as it is noble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are surprisingly in the loop.\" Azula commented still wearing her smile, \"Yes, the Avatar has given us some... minor trouble.  But more problematic is that he serves as a symbol and rallying point.  Tabs must be kept on him and he must be hindered and, if need be, eliminated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's where Liang comes in I'm guessing.\" the man said, crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely.\" answered replied Azula. \"Liang was one of the best spies and assassins the Fire Nation had seen until his retirement.  His ability to get close to targets and gather information was unparalleled.  Some say he could even change his appearance using a unique form of bending called Formbending to take on the appearance of another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Formbending eh?  That's a term I haven't heard in at least twenty years.\"  With that, the man looked to his left and right seeing the other two girls flanking him looking ready for combat.  Smiling, he began a small series of movements. \"After not doing this for so long I need to get the spirit energy flowing again.\" he said.  Then with a stomp energy flowed around his body changing it; shrinking it and making it skinnier.  His head gained a full head of brown hair in a long braid, his appearance became younger and more feminine and his clothes changed to a pink midriff exposing outfit.  He had turned himself into Ty Lee!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what's going on?\" Ty Lee stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEYAH!\" Mai shouted throwing a few knives in the copys direction.  The fake Ty Lee, however, ducked out of the way and the knives hit the real Ty Lee's shirt sending her backwards and pinning her against a nearby tree.  As Mai pulled out another half-dozen or so knives the fake Ty Lee quickly lunged in with a quick series of blows to her arms.  The knives dropped from her hands as Mai's arms hung uselssly at her sides and a swift kick to the sternum sent her flying to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point the real Ty Lee had managed to free herself and lunged at her imposter.  The pair of Ty Lees traded blows, neither being able to gain the upper hand until a quick movement by the fake got \"her\" in a position to disable the arms and legs of the real one.  At this time Azula decided to join the fray and quickly sent blasts of blue flame flying in the fake Ty Lee's direction.  The fake, however, used all of Ty Lee's agility and acrobatic ability to effortlessly dodge the blasts getting into a position to disable Azula's arms as well.  Azula, realizing this was who she sought, continued fighting back with kicks but abstained from producing any fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment that the fake Ty Lee spotted the knives that Mai had dropped on the ground.  Reacting quickly, \"she\" dodged Azula's flurry of kicks and spun around behind her.  As she manuevered, a flash of spirit energy caused Ty Lee's form to be replaced by Mai's.  Azula spun around to kick once more but she was too slow as the phony Mai picked up the knives from the ground and tossed them pinning Azula to a tree by her clothes much like Ty Lee had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I concede.\" Azula stated, a statement neither Ty Lee or Mai thought they would ever here.  \"It appears the stories are true and the master spy and assassin really <i>could</i> change into other people.  Isn't that right <i>Liang?</i>\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A gift from when I visited Koh the Facestealer in my younger days.\" Liang replied still Mai's form, \"I had ended up in the Spirit World... well it has been at least four decades so my memory is not what it was being near sixty-years-old and all.  Koh had taken my face but even without a face I fought on and impressed by my tenacity Koh did something he never did: he restored it.\" Liang explained, \"And in the process bestowed upon me a gift: you see all living things give off spiritual energy.  Their appearances, skills, thoughts, personalities... all of it exists as free-flowing spirit energy.  By harnessing this energy I am able to tap into the very essence of a person taking not only their form but everything about them.  I look like them, fight like them, I can think and act just like them.  I <i>am</i> them.  <i>That</i> is what is called Formbending.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula smiled. \"A useful talent and that is why I have come to you Master Liang.\" She explained, \"Though you retired from service twenty years ago your talents are needed now more than ever.  We humbly request your help in using your abilities to spy on the Avatar.  Become his friends, the people he meets along the way, those close to him... everyone.  And if the opportunity presents itself... kill him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiang used one of his pale, dainty hands to stroke one of Mai's long strands of hair.  \"An enticing offer.  Using my abilities again has been exhilarating.  Perhaps I may consider your offer.\"  A smile then crept onto his borrowed face, \"Or perhaps I am enjoying my retirement.  Perhaps I refuse.  What then, hmm?\" he asked.</span></div></div>",

You and your unique form of bending cannot be allowed to fall into the wrong hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fall into the wrong hands... like I'm some kind of weapon, huh?\" Liang asked. \"Besides even if I did refuse how would you hunt me down? I just handled all three of you and if you send for an army, well...\" with that he changed again, this time into Azula, \"I can just become one of your little friends... or you Princess. I could eliminate you here and now and take your place and as the Princess and a military leader I could have your friends here tossed into prison if they don't want to cooperate because who else would know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee gasped in surprise while Mai stood stonefaced. Azula narrowed her eyes while her clone wore a vicious smirk similar to the one Azula had worn earlier. After a tense moment, however, Liang began to laugh and changed back into himself. \"Of course retired or not I am a proud citizen of the Fire Nation first and foremost and if this situation is indeed grave then I shall be more than happy to offer my services.\" he stated while removing Azula from the tree she was currently attached to. \"But first, as it is already early evening, I implore you to stay for the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could use the rest and the food I suppose and then leave for the Capital in the morning.\" Azula stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I would be most honored to have the Princess and her companions stay in my humble home.\" beamed Liang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula smirked. \"Then it is decided.\" she declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was later in the night when Liang, who had been sitting outside in front of the house, heard the familiar creaking of his door opening. Had Azula doublecrossed him, he wondered? Would she attempt to kill him in the dead of night? His paranoia was eased when he heard a perky female voice. \"Man, hopefully some fresh air helps.\" it said. Liang saw the voice's owner come into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it is you acrobat.\" he stated calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a name, you know.\" she replied in an annoyed manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Ty Lee.\" Liang nodded, \"So what brings you out this late?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't sleep.\" Ty Lee sighed, slumping against the wall. \"I've been trying for the last two hours but I just keep turning over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiang looked thoughtful and turned his attention towards her. \"Well perhaps it is your enthusiasm.You seem quite energetic.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you would know that wouldn't you!\" Ty Lee perked up. \"I mean it was a little weird when you were me but that was still cool.\" She shot him a smile, \"Hey, do you think you could show it to me again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shrug Liang stood up and let the glowing spirit energy surround him and in a moment he had shrunk considerably, becoming a 12-year-old girl decked in Earth Kingdom clothing. Her hair was tied into a bun but in the front hung loosely over her face in front of her most prominent features, her white eyes; an indication of blindness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, that's... that's one of the people we're pursuing!\" Ty Lee exclaimed in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Toph Bei Fong, yes.\" Liang replied, \"I remembered seeing her, and all of the Avatar's friends, in your memories when I had become each of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's it like\" asked Ty Lee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being so small is strange yet looks can be deceiving as this girl has quite a bit of power to her.\" Liang answered, with that he gave a quick stomp and caused a small piece of the ground to lift up. \"She's an amazing Earthbender and can do things that perhaps no other Earthbender has been able to do. She's also blind but I can still 'see' due to vibrations travelling through the ground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he changed back into himself. \"You know Ty Lee, I am making some tea as you can see. If you're interested in a cup I have an extract from a plant around here that I can add to your's that should help you sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy Lee's eyes lit up, \"Oh wow, really?  Yeah that'd be nice!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I shall head inside and get it.\" Liang replied. As he walked into the house's kitchen and looked through the cupboards he came across two containers of the extract. One was what he had mentioned to Ty Lee but the other... he had lied about pulling the Avatar and his friends from their memories. A week earlier that group had in fact passed by here on their travels and much like now he had offered them a place to stay for the night. In talking to them he had learned of some of the terrible things the Fire Nation had committed during its war. Some he was aware of but some were new to him. Having retired in disgust twenty years earlier, he had told the group of his history and that he might eventually offer assistance to the resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever he had given his word to the Fire Nation Princess and as an older man did he really desire to spend the rest of his life in hiding and on the run? At the very least honoring his word to the Princess would allow him to meet up with the Avatar again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the burden of the things he had done while in service to the Fire Lord weighed heavily on Liang. He had done terrible things in the name of his nation and lord and for what? Imperialistic desires? He wanted to atone and redeem himself and perhaps... that OTHER container held another, much more potent version of the extract. By slipping it into Ty Lee's tea the girl would be rendered immediately unconscious, an effect that generally lasted for around two days. After knocking her out he would be able to hide her in the shack adjacent to the house and then assume her form effectively BECOMING Ty Lee. As Ty Lee he would be in the Princess' inner circle and as such would be able to feed regular report and inside information to the resistance movement.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Though Liang had given his word to Azula he knew that in good conscience he could not follow it. He had done many terrible things in service to the Fire Nation and knew that if they were to conquer the other nations the world could fall into darkness, living under the tyrannical and oppressive iron-fisted rule of Fire Lord Ozai. With that in mind he sighed and grabbed the more potent extract. It would not kill Ty Lee and by the time she awoke he and the other two girls would be long gone. He hoped that this would prompt Ty Lee into living her life out from under the boot of Azula as she was a bright, happy girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula... Liang walked towards what had been his room, he had allowed the Princess to use it for the night, and peeked in to see her sleeping soundly. As she slept she looked peaceful and, well, like a girl. One wouldn't suspect the type of mind that laid under that appearance though, the one Liang had briefly experienced. Azula was a cold girl, ruthless and driven by the desire to be the best. She was also manipulative and brutal keeping those around her under her control through fear and coercion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that an idea came to Liang, an alternate method of infiltrating the upper ranks of the Fire Nation. Why impersonate one of the Princess' friends when he could just become <i>her</i>? As Azula he would be privy to almost all the secrets and strategies of the Fire Nation, have command over forces and have the support of her two very skilled friends. He would be the perfect mole for the resistance: someone anyone would least expect to sell out their nation. There was, however, one problem...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula was a fierce and vicious girl and also a master in strategy and planning. Unlike with Ty Lee if she came back, and she undoubtedly would, she could cause all kinds of havoc for him seriously endangering himself and his plans. No, unlike with Ty Lee if Liang were to become Azula he would have to find a more permanent solution. He would have to kill her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not something he necessarily wanted to do. He had done his share of killing already during his previous service and this had weighed heavily upon him. However, it would be for the good of everyone: sacrificing his feelings on the matter to help the entire world. Would it be able to make up for the personal toll on his conscience however? Impersonating Azula would be far, far more effective to the \"good guys\" than her ditzy, acrobat friend. But there was also the catch that this would be Liang's most in-depth and most important \"disguise\" yet. He normally disguised only briefly, never more than a couple of days at most; being Azula would most likely be more long term. Sure the same could be said with being Ty Lee but with Azula there was the added burden of pressure, of making sure to do it right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould he be able to do it? To commit one last assassination and to replace his victim, the most important disguise he would ever take. The killing would be easy: put Ty Lee to sleep, knock Azula unconscious and then find a way to quietly dispose of her. But putting it like that sounded so cold. Perhaps knocking out Ty Lee and taking her place was indeed the better option of the two.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steeling himself, Liang made what he thought was the right decision. He grabbed the container of extract and headed outside. \"I have returned, child, with the extract that I prom--\" he was stopped mid-sentence, however, at the sight of Ty Lee, still sitting against the wall. However this time, her head was drooping downwards, her eyes closed and the sound of soft snoring could be heard. She had fallen asleep on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this certainly makes things easier.\" Liang muttered to himself as he headed back into the house. He put the extract back into the cabinet and grabbed the vile of the more potent variety which, compared to the one he had just had, worked almost instantaneously. As he entered the room where Azula slept, he thought to himself that he'd need a way to easily and discreetly get the liquid into Azula's mouth which was agape just ever so slightly. He was then struck by an idea: the extract was a liquid, of course!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcentrating he transformed, hoping the glow from the energy wouldn't wake Azula, into Katara, a girl that had been travelling with the Avatar. As Katara was a waterbender, it was a simple matter of manipulating the liquid extract out of the container and guiding it into Azula's slightly open mouth. The movements were precise and as the liquid made it's way into her, Azula let out a series of soft moans before eventually stopping; the extract had done its job and now Liang needed to finish it. He needed a way to kill Azula as quietly as possible and cursed his fortune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough his formbending was indeed incredibly powerful, it had limits. At first Liang thought that the easiest solution would be to transform into an airbender and use airbending to suck all the air out of Azula's lungs asphyxiating her. However one of the few limits on his ability was that he was only able to transform into a living person and all of the airbenders were dead... all except for Aang. Unfortunately Aang was the Avatar and the second limitation placed on him was that he could not transform into the Avatar. And those rules also ruled out Avatar Yangchen. But they had given him another idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, he transformed into Ty Lee once more and once again steeling himself, he delivered a pair of quick chi blocking strikes to both sides of Azula's throat. This caused her throat muscles to paralyze and after about a minute or so her breathing eventually stopped. He had done it, he realized. He had killed Azula. Looking around the room he found a large enough sack and moved to disrobe Azula; for conveniences sake he would need to keep her clothes around to \"change into\" in order to avoid suspicion. Seeing the now naked Azula was, to Liang's surprise, making him a bit excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at his own body, well Ty Lee's body, and marvelled at how fit and limber it was as well as its two most defining \"features.\" If it was one thing that Liang did not shy away from when using his powers, it was to take the shapes of females and become quite well acquainted with their forms. Perhaps at some point he would have to do so with Ty Lee, Mai, Katara and others in addition to Azula's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking it off, he proceeded to place Azula's now lifeless body into the sack and picking it up due to Ty Lee being stronger than she appeared he carried it outside to the side of the house making sure to grab Azula's robe along the way. He then transformed into Toph and used her earthbending abilities to create a hole in the ground six feet deep, pushing Azula's body into it and then using earthbending to cover it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiang then, finally, transformed into Azula... albeit a nude version of her. He had intended to quickly put the robe on and get back to bed but looking at his new body now... he was surprised at how beautiful it is. There was a sensuality to it that went beyond Azula's teenage years. Shaking his head, Liang picked the robe up and put it on but still his new form called to him. Teased him. Unable to control himself he slipped a hand beneath the fold of the robe and massaged a breast. This caused him to let out a sensual moan in Azula's quite seductive voice. It felt amazing and getting into it, Liang pulled the bottom of the robe up in order to manuever the other hand a little lower...</span></div></div>",

Maiming seemed even worse on such young girls, and he did not want to imprison them either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat back in one of the wooden kitchen chair, slightly damp from the humidity, thinking he could maybe pretend to be mai, but the girl was not keen of being bored and patronized, out of pure spite, she would surely come back to annoy him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut perhaps he had taken the problem by the wrong end, perhaps...</span></div></div>",

That's when he started to experiment with formbending, when instead of shifting himself, he turned a person into another, memories, thoughts and all, however, this technique was very dangerous, first of all, the pain experienced by anyone who transformed must've been unbearable, if his lover were to be trusted, and the energy of said person did not continue to flow in the same way after, point being, after one month, there was no return to their original selves, for apart from some scattered memories and scattered thoughts, they were the person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had been his wake up call, when he had gotten home from a 3-month mission and realized he'd lost his loved ones, now a mediocre shopkeeper family just 3 miles south of where he lived, disgusted with himself, he abandonned his carreer, and only his visit from the avatar a few weeks earlier reconciled him with his bending, now, he was unsure, but his new plan formed gradually into his head, maybe, he could turn one of the girls into someone else, and become this person, if he kept this form, he could return it later, even a thousand years after, he could give the avatar a new ally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut another plan, more convoluted suddenly came to his mind, perhaps he could do just what he was asked, infiltrating team avatar, becoming one of aang's friends, but this time, he'd need an assistant, someone who could infiltrate team avatar with him and feel more \"empathetic\" towards the revolution, of course, he'd have to keep tabs on everyone involved, but if he could get the princess out of the capital...</span></div></div>",

He always had thought the strength of humankind residing in their heart, in their love, in truth, this was precisely why he had chosen katara's form for azula, it would make her experience compassion for the girl, for they were both orphan of their mothers, both striving to be the best, and yet so different, he hoped that in understanding katara, azula would eventually tend to like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should we care if she has heart?\" asked azula defiantly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One trusts one with heart young princess\" countered liang \"And this girl has the trust of all, you will have the power to break that trust, and broken trust is more devastating that any of you can imagine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula then shut up, looking troubled, possibly angry, after all, the girl had her trust broken once, though she did not see it in these regards, he had touched a sore spot, and both of them knew it.

It means i gotta go first, doesn't it?\" The question was rhetorical, of course, and she had put on a pompous air he knew wasn't hers, he also recognized the words as something general iroh, his former superior, and azula's uncle, might've said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, said Liang, as he turned towards Azula, Ty lee, Mai, could you go get us some water? i'll also need the sleep extract i gave you, it's in the red box\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTy lee and mai went to the kitchen with slow, deliberate steps, while he was not looking at them, he could feel glances of curiosity aimed at him.

Azula was gazing at him too, her eyes, though in their calm, defiant look, had gained in size, it was the look of men before hard times, who knew they were going to endure, without breaking eye contact, she asked, her voice seemingly disinterested, though trembling: \"Does it hurts too bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiang tried to plaster a kindly smile on his face, as he answered \"Did you know i studied medecine in the army?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula didn't flinch, she knew the look of men monologuing from the first syllabe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, one day, i learned that some flying creatures, as well as some tpes of hares, have twice as much human nerves as a normal human? quite surprising actually, they must feel things so... <i>differently</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiang tried to mark a dramatic pause, though azula was a bit relieved, she hated dramatic poses, and kept her look on liang as tough as possible<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One really learns interesting things, or meets interesting people, i knew of a water tribe healer, some girl, i tell you, she couldn't heal a scratch, but she made some trick with the nerves and BAM! couldn't feel my arms or legs, glad i wasn't on the other hand of her water\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you tell us that?\" said azula, in a spiteful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse an old man wanting to put on a show princess, but i wanted to show you the worst that can happen, so you'd feel relief when i have to turn you, it's also worthwhile, if i am to fight by your side, to see how all of you react to threats and obstacles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all?\" Asked azula, seeing through his lie<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also like frightening royalty\" smiled liang \"i guess your father never told you of the turtle duck your uncle sent him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzula was about to respond, but Mai and Ty lee had come back, carrying respectively a jar of the rain water he used to shower, and a small radish-colored box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiang then shifted silently into a woman close to his age, her brown skin burnt in the neck, wearing a green earth kingdom man-ish garb, with a matching dome-shaped hat, only a blue and purple collar wrapped around her neck and her sea blue eyes betrayed her water tribe origins. She then sat down cross legged in front of azula, with somewhat of a severe air about her. Liang, walking down on memory lane, observed the last 8 years of the woman known as Kayltanuq, she had gone south, and in doing so had joined the earth colonies resistance, and had perfectioned herself while living in the swamp, however, she deserted it a year before the fall of ba sing se, he knew why: revenge. She was coming for him. At the moment, she was in Yu Dao, negotiating the fare of a boat incognito to ember island. Where he had been living ten years ago. he couldn't help but smile at her determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down princess\" he said with the rough voice of someone who smoked a lot <i>or was buried in a meat smoking cave for a week</i> thought liang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe first took a blob of water from the jar, scooping brutally with her bare hand. She heated it up with the mastery she retained from three other benders, and took the jar from Ty lee's hand in a swift motion. The floating sphere was then troubled by the deep greenish brown of the herbs, she then changed it from steam to water, then to steam, until every drop of useful chemical was extracted. She then divided it into three distinct spheres, and hanged them in front of the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need a straw?\" She asked with what Kayltanuq once called affectionately her<i> Deaf Grandma Voice</i> He'd really have to get back in touch one day, once the whole gonna kill you thing would be sorted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was thinking, the three girls had drank the infusion, and they'd sat as well, their eyelids being more heavy by the minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiang then bent the rest of the jar to lightly cover azula's body, as if it were mucus, leaving only her head and some part of her front untouched by the water, in order not to kill her organs (something that his poor liver hadn't had the luck to do) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of azula seemed to shine brightly, as she was slowly losing control of her body, her head slumping downwards, as Liang approached her withered hand from azula's forehead, she paused inches away, looking at ty lee and mai's dizzy but concerned expression. She opened her palm, and in one swift strike, she hit azula's forehead, pushing her to fall downwards, as her water and azula's body shone as bright as any fire, any color, any light from any star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Katara fell unconscious between Mai and Ty lee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's next?\"</span></div></div>",

Still, she attempted to reel in her temper as she circled her arms, creating a ball of air. She jumped up and got into a sitting position with one leg down. She pointed her toes into the ball of air, and for a moment she remained up on the air scooter. A second later, she slipped off easier than if it had been a ball of ice. With a painful thud, she slammed the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra stood up and breathed out angrily. Flickers of flame darted from between her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think a break is in order,\" Tenzin said. \"We'll start again in ten minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra's hands balled into fists. \"Yes, Master Tenzin,\" she grumbled. She kicked the ground--sending a small stone off into the bay--and stomped off out of the courtyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went down to the beach and sat down on the rocky shore there. \"How do airbenders do that?\" she wondered aloud. \"It's like they can just shut off emotion at a whim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crossed her legs into a meditative pose. Tenzin was patient, but he didn't seem to understand how hard it was for her to keep her temper in control. Avatar Aang might not either, but as the previous avatar he would have a better understanding of the frustrations associated with mastering multiple bending styles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra sat for minutes, trying to calm down enough to enter the meditative state necessary to commune with Aang and the previous avatars. When the shift finally came, she felt her mind leave her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she opened her eyes, she was disturbed to see a different sight than when she usually entered the spirit world. She was in what appeared to be a stone hallway, but the ground beneath her was feet was smooth like marble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aang?\" she called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not here,\" said a squeaky, timid voice behind Korra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra spun around in surprise to see a small, cloaked figure standing there. \"Who are you?\" she asked, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Trigreau,\" the cloaked figure said. \"Welcome, Avatar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra paused. \"Yes. How did you know?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrigreau looked up, and while the hood of the cloak concealed much of its face, Korra was able to see the lower half of a woman's face. \"You have been here before, avatar,\" Trigreau said. \"In a previous life, long ago of course,\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Korra asked. \"Well, uh, it's nice to, I guess, meet you again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrigreau giggled. \"Indeed,\" she said. \"What brings you back to my family's home, Avatar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra looked around. \"I'm not really sure,\" she said. \"I was trying to speak with my past lives and I wound up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" Trigreau said. \"As before. Then perhaps we will have as much fun as before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fun?\" Korra asked. \"What happened last time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your past life took me to see the real world,\" Trigreau said. \"It was so magnificent. I would like to go again and see how it has changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... okay,\" Korra said nervously. \"How do I... take you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this,\" Trigreau said. With that, her form began to glow white. Her form lost definition as she became little more than an aura of light. When the change was complete, the glow of light drifted towards Korra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra stepped back nervously. \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot enter the real world on my own,\" Trigreau said. \"I must have a host.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra's eyes widened. \"Wait! Don't you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra had about turned to run, but Trigreau's light consumed her. Her mouth was forced open, and she could feel the warmth of the light entering her. When Trigreau had entered her completely, the world instantly vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra's real eyes flashed open in shock and she gasped from the sudden change. She looked around hastily, reacquainting herself with her surroundings. \"Trigreau?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I am here,\"</i> came Trigreau's voice. It sounded as if it came from inside Korra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra looked down at her body. \"Uh... so you're not going to... take over my body or anything right?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No, I will not,\"</i> Trigreau said. <i>\"But there is no room in here. The body of the avatar is always so full of spirit.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a hot feeling began to burn in Korra's chest, and she reached up to clench at the feeling. \"OW!!! What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I need room,\"</i> Trigreau said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange feeling welled up in Korra's chest between her breasts. She looked down and her eyes widened in shock. Her breasts were moving apart from each other, stretching her clothes a bit wider than before! And as they moved apart, a pleasurable sensation grew out of the burn and strange sensations in between them. As she watched, a third mound began to form there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" she exclaimed. She grabbed the collar of her shirt and pulled it out to look down. Sure enough, a third breast was growing there, and as it grew so did the sensation of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen finally the third breast attained the size of her original two, the sensation overtook her and surged through her body in one powerful wave. Korra looked up at the sky and had to resist crying out in ecstasy. It was an incredible feeling, and while it only lasted for a few moments, it left her sweating and panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra stood panting for several seconds before she reminded herself of what had just happened. She looked back down to still see the third breast there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I made room,\"</i> Trigreau said.<i> \"I hope you do not mind the good feeling. I did not want you to feel the pain I would have caused.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra stared down for several seconds. She had to do something now, because she had no idea what she was dealing with with. She would have to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Korra shook her head. Looking down at this third breast, she figured this was something she did not want to let others know about. With her past lives at least the knowledge wouldn't go anywhere. Tenzin probably could help, but Trigreau had said she had met one of her past lives. If so, then perhaps that past avatar would know what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra sat down, but even as she did she felt her bra snap. It had already been stressed with the third breast, but sitting down seemed to be the end of its tolerance. Korra fumed as she got into her meditation pose. <i>When this is over with, I'd better put on a new one,</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What are you doing?\"</i> Trigreau asked. <i>I want to see the world.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't go into the city with three breasts,\" Korra replied. \"I need to talk to my past life that met you. Do you remember what his name was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Her name was Anaya,</i> Trigreau said. <i>\"She came from the Earth Kindgom.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra closed her eyes and started to recede into her meditation. <i>Avatar Anaya, I need your advice,</i> she thought as her spirit started to separate from her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the shift came, she opened her eyes. She frowned however when she found she was back in Trigreau's home. \"Again?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We should go,</i> Trigreau said, suddenly sounding fearful but still speaking from within Korra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra looked down to see she still had her third breast. \"How do I get out to find my past lives?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Be quiet!</i> Trigreau said, still scared. <i>They might hear you!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra looked around the hallway she was in. She listened for a few seconds before finally whispering, \"Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>My sisters,</i> Trigreau said. <i>We need to get out. Go to the end of the hall!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra nodded and hurried quietly towards the end. Trigreau's fear infected her as well, and she found she wanted to be away from here as much as Trigreau did. When she reached the end of the hall, she reached for the door in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not that one!</i> Trigreau exclaimed. <i>\"On your left!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra withdrew her hand as if shocked before grabbing the doorknob to her left. She pulled it open, and through it she saw a swamp ahead of her. She stepped out and closed the door behind her carefully so as not to make any noise. \"Can they hear us now?\" Korra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No, we're safe,\"</i> Trigreau said. With that, Korra felt a warmth in her throat and tingling in her third breast.She looked down, but a second later an invisible force pulled her head back and opened her mouth. Light poured out of her mouth and drifted a few feet away from her before reshaping into Trigreau's form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's uncomfortable,\" Korra said as the force let go of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize,\" Trigreau said. \"But now that we are safe from my sisters, I can walk free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so bad about them?\" Korra asked. She glanced down. \"They're-- hey! I've still got a third boob!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrigreau nodded. \"Yes. I left it there so I can go back in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra sighed. \"There's got to be some other way you can come to the physical world,\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need a host,\" Trigreau said. \"Avatar Anaya will tell you the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra looked around. \"Oh yeah, where is she? Actually, where are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are in the spirit world,\" Trigreau said. She smiled. \"It is primal, compared to your city.\" She looked up a bit, as if reminiscing. \"The physical world has changed so much since last I was there. In that short time, I saw the sky-touching towers and the giant balloons. It is so different than it used to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it is,\" Korra said. \"That's how I felt when I came to Republic City after leaving the South Pole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's incredible,\" Trigreau said. She looked back at Korra. \"I think if you call for Avatar Anaya now, she will come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay,\" Korra replied. She looked around. \"Avatar Anaya! I need to speak with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing at first except that the swamp fog seemed to be getting thicker. \"Avatar Anaya!\" she shouted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fog in front of her stirred as if something was in front of her. Korra stepped back automatically when she noticed it. A second later, someone rose up out of the fog like a ghost. The fog rose with the person before finally falling off. Before Korra stood an woman robed in a large, Earth Kingdom-green gown. She had short black hair and a pointed face. She held her arms behind her back, and there was a slight smile at the corners of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra paused for a moment before finally realizing who was in front of her. She put her right fist into her left hand and bowed. \"Avatar Anaya, it's nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Avatar Korra, I feel the same,\" Anaya replied in a soft, ghostlike voice. Her eyes looked past Korra and rested on Trigreau. Her tiny, almost imperceptible smile enlarged into a joyous grin. \"Trigreau! Old friend, it has been so long!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrigreau bowed. \"Avatar Anaya, I am happy to see you once again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnaya nodded her head and looked back at Korra. \"Ah yes, I see you have already taken Trigreau to the physical world.\" Her eyes dropped to Korra's chest for a moment as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra rubbed the back of her head in embarrassment. \"Yes. I wanted to know how you took her without... this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did not,\" Anaya said. She grinned mischievously before bringing her hands out from behind her back. She pressed on her gown at her stomach, flattening the fabric against her skin and tightening it over her chest. Korra's eyes widened to see--though difficult to discern under the poofy clothing--a third bulge on her chest there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You went around like that?!\" Korra asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnaya nodded. \"It is why I began to wear clothes like these,\" she said. \"I enjoyed Trigreau's company far too much to want to return to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra gestured to her own clothing, which clearly defined her body shape. \"That's not going to work with me.\" She put her hands on her hips. \"And I can't be weighed down with large clothing. I can't take Trigreau into the physical world if I have to be like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnaya nodded. \"I understand. It is unnerving to have one's body forcefully changed. For a long while, when I was not adept at entering the spirit world on my own, I was upset about Trigreau's change.\" She looked over at Trigreau. \"Friend, tell Korra about your sisters and why you want to see the physical world so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra looked back at Trigreau. \"What do her sisters have to do with this?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrigreau sighed. \"My sisters are... mischievous... at the best of times. They are little more than poltergeists at their worst. We all share this ability to take another as our host, and like me they can change a body to fit into it. But they do much more than simply make room for themselves; they play with their host's form for their own amusement. Many abominations were made by them... us... when we were free to roam the physical world before Avatar Gorli banished us to the spirit world forever. None of us can leave that place,\" she pointed at the building they had come out of, \"without a host, and since few humans besides the Avatar manage to make it to the spirit world and return to the physical world, you can understand why it's been so long since I left that place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were like them once?\" Korra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrigreau nodded. \"I have missed the beauty of the physical world since my punishment, and I have come to regret my actions for taking me away from it forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra looked back at Avatar Anaya. \"Why did you put her back in there if she's stuck in there?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She asked for it,\" Anaya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sisters escaped when I was with Avatar Anaya,\" Trigreau said. \"They returned to their old ways as soon as they were free. But in order to banish them back here... I had to be returned as well. We are four parts of a whole, and something that affects one of us affects all of us. I have tried to make them see the error of their ways, but instead they have become vengeful. They hurt me and torment me for fun, since there are no humans for them to use their powers on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra frowned. \"Did something stop you from bringing her back out?\" she asked, looking at Anaya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnaya nodded. \"I died two days after banishing them,\" she said. \"I was weakened by the action, and the cult leader, Harscath, took advantage of that to ambush me. I did not survive, and once in the spirit world, that place becomes locked off to me. Avatar Gorli sealed those doors so that only someone from the physical world can pass through them. He did not want any allies of the sisters to free them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorra crossed her arms. \"Okay,\" she said. \"I can see why you want to get out.\" She looked back at Trigreau. \"Is there any way I can host you without having... this?\" She nodded down to her third breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My ability to modify one's form is not limited to that,\" Trigreau replied. \"I chose that because it is what Anaya became used to, but I can do something else. Is there some other change you would prefer?\"</span></div></div>",

Years of bad blood could not be swept away easily, but with the public figures of the avatar and the new fire nation lord Zuko standing as friends, it became easier for amends to be made although tensions still ran high. Zuko himself had been running himself ragged. Having squashed two rebellions, swallowed the anger of the two other tribes and restructuring the political landscapes mostly by himself as almost every other member of his cabinet had at some point worked under his father. The rest of the gaang had noticed his already tired face was drooping even more and although he wouldn't admit it to his friends, he could use a vacation, but every time that thought popped up he felt selfish when there was still so much to do for his country.<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"justify\">Of course, Iroh could see his poor nephew forgetting the importance of a good rest, so he secretly sent a messenger from the Lotus to organize a little surprise with the rest of the Gaang.

Aang and Sokka were hanging out in the rafters, waiting for the signal to spring into action.<br>\r\n\"Hey Sokka.\"<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"Umm... how do I get further with a girl?

We can't make too much noise or Zuko'll bolt us.\" They both looked down, scared they had alerted him, but Zuko was so sleep deprived he barely even noticed the interruption and continued sipping his tea to another wise speech from his uncle.<br>\r\n\"So wait. You mean its been two years and you haven't even done it?\" Aang blushed, embarrassed as he nodded yes.<br>\r\n\"That's why I'm asking you! You and Suki do it all the time!\"<br>\r\n\"Hold on a second. Now we have been discreet and barely make a noi-\"<br>\r\n\"You're both loud and it's just too awkward to talk about. Why do you think Toph brings along a pillow to sleep on? We all hear it, but she can actually feel the vibrations.\"<br>\r\n\"Ill! That's, That's...sigh. Just ask me and let's try not to mess up our kidnapping.\"<br>\r\n\"Well we've been kissing and I've been getting, you know grabby-\"<br>\r\n\"Gross\"<br>\r\n\"-but neither of us know how to make the first move and-\" CRASH<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow them, Zuko was starting to feel drowsy as he looked at his tea.<br>\r\n\"Uncle, I feel a little... odd.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry nephew, this is for your own good. I'll make sure the nation doesn't fall apart in your absence.\"<br>\r\n\"What do youuuuuuu.\" His speech slurred off as he collapsed onto the table, his uncle hoping that wouldn't leave any marks when he woke up. Aang and Sokka swooped down and wrapped him in a large bag before spiriting him away.<br>\r\n\"And don't come back until he rests. Play is just as important as work.

Rachel blushed, sure she'd thought of 'doing things' with Quinn many times but she'd never imagined she'd be this small or occur this early in their relationship. Also Quinn's disturbingly accurate description of what would happen if Santana ever found her and what the big breasted sex crazed woman would do to her sealed the deal, no giant pussy for her anytime soon,,, or at least for now. Rachel looked up at the statuesque form of her girlfriend \"Okay Quinn I'll do it but you need to put me in your cleavage, there's no way I'd fit in a cup\" she yelled. Quinn smiled, picked her up and planted an open mouth kiss on her so soon her face, head and hair to her shoulder were soaked in her spit \" I'm so glad you agreed to this, I'd run out of possibilities, the last one was hide you in my shoe, but that was scrapped. I Don't know what the extent of your 'increased durability is but I'd rather find out it doesn't mean you can be stepped another way\". At this Rachel paled; she wasn't sure of scale but it could've been at least the entire school being dropped on her with every step, sighing in relief at dodging the bullet. \"So let's go\" Quinn said holding Rachel in one.hand and she lifted her shirt with the other revealing her Cherio red bra and pale boobs. She held Rachel just above her cleavage and with two fingers parted her boobs before sliding Rachel inside, held in a firm but gentle embrace by Quinn's mounds. Quinn giddily squeezed her breasts together, Rachel letting out a quiet \"eep\" as she moaned loudly before composing herself, grabbing both of their bags and leaving the room, her tiny passenger unnoticed by the world around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before shoving her foot into her shoe and sealing the diva's fate she had one last thing \"Also because Brittany is sick this week very well behaved girls will get to play in my panties\" she said, enjoying the panicked, jerky movements of Rachel in her sock, a 'reward' like that might see Rachel misbehaving; being used as toe floss and constantly stepped on might appeal more than whatever her fears thought being in Santana's vagina was like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her shoe the Latina stomped and twisted to remind Berry of her new place, before leaving the room happier than when she entered.</span></div></div>",

Kenzi had learnt not to argue at those times, the last time the little Russian tried to stop Bo when she was like this she was nearly suffocated, pressed between the succubus and the wall, her massive tits cutting off the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBo smiled and winked, a gesture Kenzi had seen first hand had women drop their panties when sent in their direction by the succubus as she spoke '' A Fornicar\u00e1s, and they say good things don't come my way.

They'll be eating.. or more you'll be <i>eaten</i> out of the palm of their hands'' Bo says with a chuckle. Kenzi was confused, she thought she was straight ... But everything Bo said and the thought of several women; lusting over her and cumming <b>because</b> of her filled her with desire and phantom pride, even more so when she remembered the size difference. Despite herself she grinned before trying to return o a straight face but Bo had seen it ''See I knew you'd like it, this will be great for both of us'' ''Bo..'' Kenzi began but Bo interrupted '' Let's get this official and then you can get settled in ok?'' not waiting for an answer Bo brought little Kenzi to her lips and enveloped the girls face with in a kiss, Bo's plump lips blinding Kenzi to the blue glow that covered her skin before fading, her tongue ninja like darting out and swiping across her face as Bo moaned ''I know it's probably bad form to cum just from your smell and skin but damn you taste orgasmically good, is this what succubus is for humans?'' she said trying to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n ''Now that's over with I'll need to show you your travel and possible sleeping arrangement, I hope they're big enough for you, they're the best I know of'' Bo said her tone prideful as she lower her into her cleavage . Kenzi having seen this coming immediately began squirming and kicking in hopes of freeing herself from her grasp, even landing a few kicks to her tits, alas her feet slid off the bouncy flesh. It appeared inhaling and ingesting so much Fornicar\u00e1s essence had gotten the succubus hot, leading to wet, slick skin and increase to the already warm temperature within the confines of Kenzi's destination. The sweat did allow her to slid between her tits with ease to her head though, with Bo's index finger doing the last push completely enclosing her in tit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBo couldn't keep the grin off her face; she had every succubae's wet dream between her tits and it was all her's, there was a lot of preparation to do ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater when Kenzi was released ......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Fornicar\u00e1s: Small fairy/pixie sized fae with sex based abilities similar to succubae. They increase arousal <u>only</u> in female fae &amp; humans, gaining sustenance from the released essence. Because of this they usually seek out lesbian couples, which would double the sustenance produced in a single effect. They are sought out by succubae as they affect them stronger then even their own kind do, similar to how their own powers would affect humans or adolescent fae.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Yes Kenzi is now actually one of these, Bo's hasn't just lost the plot from lack of sex or something.]</span></div></div>",

Regina thought after another shitty day, it seemed Snow's made it a life mission to ensure she is never happy. In the forest she ensured this by her 'slip up' leading to Regina's friend and almost lover Daniel being killed and here in Storybrooke; she had turned most of the town against her, poisoned her son with her Black/White morality and even caused her true love to begin to pull away from her (Not that Regina thought she was aware of it, just a byproduct of the other crap she did). The doorbell rang causing her to growl, she didn't need magic to know who it was; Emma 'I'm the bloody Savior' Swan. Since the curse lifted Emma trying to score brownie points and make mommy and daddy love her has done everything they say and agree to their every demand something Snow readily used to irritate the ex mayor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regina, you in?\" Emma called as she opened the door, making it to the stairs before she was unable to move. \"Emma, Emma, Emma\" Regina said as she swayed into the Hall, smiling at her though the noticeable twitch let Emma know the witch was pissed. The last time she had seen it; though it was her fault and didn't mean to nearly kill the tree; the mayor was this close to calling some kind of hit squad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it's days like today I wish I'd killed your mother when I had the chance\" she sighed and stepped closer to the frozen blond \"But you, whether you intend to be or not are as much a problem as Mary Margaret, she uses you as a way to prove her idiocy. Plus when anyone questions her hypocritical bull shit she points at you and says 'my daughter, the savior supports me, I am good and therefore can't be wrong'. I need things to get better, to calm down and for peace to return, and that means shutting up Snow White. It also means, though temporary, you need to <b>disappear</b>\" as she finished her sentence Emma was engulfed in the purple smoke of Regina's magic. When it cleared...</span></div></div>",

''Yes Em I did'' Regina answered calmly as she reached down and picked up the shrunken 'saviour' the blond squirming in her grasp ''Now Emma you understand I need you to go away but that would hurt both of us so I came up with this idea. Besides I know you'll love your new hiding place'' at this the dark witch grinned as she dropped Emma into her blouse, the blonde's struggling meaning instead of dropping directly into her cleavage she bounced off her right breast, and slipped in sideways. Regina felt her aggressive wriggling and smirked imaging her complaining about her 'evil cleavage' (Which she actually was) and headed off to bed with her companion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''<i>Stupid Regina and her stupid paranoia. Damn her stupid, evil, sweaty, hot, sexy cleavage</i>'' Emma grumbled, her every breath filled with the smell of Regina's apple perfume, a smell that now permeates her body as it mixed with Regina's sweat that now coated her. As her confines wiggled she was glad she currently was just breathing trough her nose and fuming, with Regina's movement's if she was even breathing through her mouth she'd have immediately gotten a mouthful of breast; ''Regina's sweet, bouncy breasts.... Hey Stop it'' Emma mentally slapped herself, she was supposed to be mad at her. Soon the bouncing stopped and was replaced by an increased pressure form the surrounding tit flesh. Emma knew despite the size of her chest Regina slept either on her front or against something, most recently her; something Emma greatly enjoyed as the brunnete normally pressed her boobs against her own, her back or if the mayor was having a good week she got a nice faceful of cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma knew she had 2 options; stay with Regina and her breasts till morning or wiggle her way out of her mounds and find someone to help her but she was conflicted. On the one hand she had been shrunk and thrust into Regina's cleavage against her will but on the other there were much worse places she could've been put and the mix of smells of apple and her loves natural scent were making her contently sleepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Emma do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the end Emma slipped into dreamland rather quickly, having such a comfortable place to lay, plus the rhythm of Regina's heartbeat made it quite easy to fall asleep. Emma woke the next morning enveloped in warmth and Regina's scent, her half awake mind assuming she was wrapped up in the sheets curled up against Regina, at least until she noticed the strong apple scent. Since they got together Regina had always given a sprint of an apple scent perfume on her breasts (her own words being 'what's the point of putting it on my neck if you're just going to dive head first in there instead?') Emma loved to watch Regina get ready as she'd part her breasts and squirting into her cleavage before squeezing them together.<br>\r\nHer eyes shot open and finding herself in total darkness the previous night came back to her: Regina calling her over, getting shrunk, being dropped into Regina's cleavage and the woman going to sleep with her still trapped between them. She was still between Regina's breasts, completely enveloped because she was lying on her side. Emma decided to try make her way to Regina's face, get her attention, crawling slowly till her head was peeking out then everything turned on it's side. Regina yawns and stretches, starting to sit up as Emma slides down and grabs the only thing available to her, luckily Regina's breasts were firm and she was able to stop with a handful of each tit in hands though it was a strong pinch to Regina.<br>\r\nHissing in pain Regina's blurry eyes fell onto the small bit of blond in her cleavage 'Hey Gina!' Emma yelled, she'd have waved but she'd rather not slide down and probably through Regina's cleavage especially not now she appeared to notice her. Regina blinked and tilted her head 'Emma Swan sitting in my cleavage, this must be a dream' she said licking her lips hungrily<br>\r\n'Right, I'm down here between jiggle and honk but you're the one who's dreaming' Emma deadpanned 'I hope you don't actually call them that' 'Nope fun pillows, life preservation orbs, The Himatitties, which actually do fit how they look to me right now, but not jiggles or honk' Regina sighed 'Of course you do. Well I'm going to have to get Henry's breakfast ready and once he's gone we can talk. Down you go!'<br>\r\n'Regina there's no way...' Emma starts but Regina sighs and flicks her in the head, Emma slipping into her cleavage though was stopped from going any further by Regina's arm under her bosom. Regina quickly removed her sleepwear, switching arms as needed to keep Emma between her breasts as well and prevent her from falling either into her panties or onto the floor. Once she was nude she collected her clothes for the day and laid them on the bed, releasing her hold on Emma allowing her to fall out and into a bra cup. 'Regina this is insane, first you shrink ...' 'Hush' Regina commands a slight waft of purple covers Emma, once it fades the blond discovers she's mute 'I've already told you we will talk later but just hush' Regina pinches the bridge of her nose before picking up her bra, pushing the cups to her chest quickly before the shock could wear of and Emma could try to escape. A shiver ran down her spine when Emma realised she just couldn't speak as Regina felt her tongue on her skin followed by a small fraction of it being sucked on. Regina slapped her 'stop that' but the nip she received made it obvious this was Emma's attempt at protest. Regina quickly dressed herself impeccably as usual while ignoring as best she could Emma's licking, sucking, biting and oh... Regina had a slightly evil grin 'It seems Ms Swan is enjoying herself as much as I am' she thought, remembering Emma needed to stay up top mainly because she'd drown down below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way down the stairs Regina headed towards the kitchen and started making breakfast for Henry herself and Emma for later, in the end making only a little less than she normally would as even with her diminished size she had a feeling Emma would still eat everything in front of her. She had just finished when Henry bounced down the stairs 'Hey Mom' he yelled as he came into the room and sitting down to eat.<br>\r\nRegina smiled at him but then twitched as Emma started to squirm and wriggle more intensely and erratically, squeezing and groping herself rather strongly in the hope of getting it through Emma's think skull to stop 'Mom?' Regina stopped and tried to hold back an embarrassed blush: due to Emma's 'distraction' she'd forgotten Henry was in the room, accidentally showing him his mother fondling herself. The good news was he was just worried about how quiet she was being, to which she gave a silent sigh of relief.<br>\r\n'Bye mom' Henry called but before he could leave Regina pulled him into a hug, Emma trying not to yell as she was crushed by Regina's boobies. Regina watched their boy go before peering down her shirt 'Are you going to partake in a civilized conversation now?' the blond just glared from her bra before nodding slowly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way back to the bedroom quickly Regina removed Emma from her bra and gently placed her on the bed, before sitting a little away from her 'so, time to talk' 'Damn right it's time, you shrunk me Regina, what the Hell?' Regina sighed and Emma was surprised to see her nervous 'I know, things haven't been going well and I took it out on you. The pressure of keeping this town secret from the world and Snow once again stirring shit...' 'Wait, why didn't you come to me babe, if Mary Margret is doing something wrong?' 'Emma in case you haven't noticed you tend to do what Snow and Charming ask, and I didn't want to cause problems between you and your mother or possibly out you when you don't want to tell her about us' Emma frowned 'Gina you need to let me in, I care about you and don't want you angry, hurt or stressed, plus you tend to lash out as we can see' Regina laughed a little 'So now we've gotten that out of the way you can change me back and then we can put this all behind us' Regina bit her lip, something Emma would usually find sexy but right now just worried her 'You can change me back right?' 'Of course I can, it's just I was angry when I set it up' 'Yeah I noticed that' 'and the spell has a minimum life of a month' 'A month!' 'Yeah, any attempt to reverse it will fail until a month has passed, it like most spells of this nature are semi permanent in that they need a reversal spell to actually end' Emma pinched the bridge of her nose 'So I'm stuck like this for a month' 'at the very least' 'Well this fucking sucks!' Emma grumbled as she flopped down onto her butt before being picked up and brought up to Regina's face 'don't worry Emma everything will be fine, I'll keep you safe and protected until the time limit is over and then you'll be back to normal before you know it' 'But how will we hide my disappearance?' 'Apprenticeship' 'Hmm?' 'We'll say you're out of town learning proper police procedure and stuff like that' 'We can actually do that?' Emma asked surprised 'Sure, we'll just need approval from the mayor's office which will be easy, I hear the current one rather like's you' Regina winked and gave Emma a little kiss (which still cover her whole head) 'So you've got this all figured out?' 'Yep' 'Okay' Emma agrees before kicking back and lying in Regina's hands smiling up at her love 'What now?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well you're the one stuck like this for a month, what do you want to do with it?'</span></div></div>",

Emma made her way across their bed, going around rather than over Regina; despite the urge to walk along Regina's supple ass and slowly made her way out of the bedroom and towards the stairs. The stairs did take some time as each step was quite a drop to her but she did get down eventually. Unfortunately it wasn't until she had reached the door that she realised she couldn't actually leave the house herself. Cursing herself she hid herself behind the plant and took cover, hoping she wouldn't be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#Next Morning#<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Bye Mom I'm heading to school!'' Emma was woken up by Henry yelling and smiled; Henry had habit (One Regina constantly complains to her about, yells at him about and she herself has sometimes) of leaving the front door swinging open when he leaves in the morning, his logic is Regina and herself would also be heading out almost immediately behind him so why bother, and Emma hoped he was still ignoring Regina (he was yesterday) and sneaking a peek around the plant pot she saw Henry open the door, leave and ... leave it open. Thanking her lucky stars Emma makes a break for the doorway and into the garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma made her way to the end of the lawn panting and nearly coughing a lung out when she heard female voice ''What do we have here?''

Emma still tired mildly waved ''Oh dear you're so small, I know just what to do...'' at this the blond picked up Emma who belatedly realised what would happen. She'd be brought back to Regina, after all Regina and Kathryn were friends and there was no way the woman would bring her to Gold (partly because she was a little afraid of the imp). Kathryn entered the house through the still wide open door and called out ''Regina you need to come down here!'' standing at the bottom of the stairs<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a banging noise from upstairs and both blonds were treated to Regina hurrying down the stairs looking twitchy and a little dishevelled, her shirt open exposing her breasts in a coal black bra  ''Morning Kathryn'' Regina greeted her eyes scanning the room ''You haven't seen anything strange when you came in did you?'' Kathryn smiled ''Actually I did, I found her when I was on my way here'' she answered revealing Emma to a panicked Regina ''EM!!'' Regina yelled grabbing the woman and holding her close ''Don't do that again, just because you're unbreakable doesn't mean you should go off on your own'' she then brought Emma up to her face and kiss her; though Emma knew she was still annoyed, mainly because of an effective sucker punch to the face from the witch's tongue. ''Oh you had me so worried'' she then remembered they weren't alone ''Thank you Kathryn, Emma and I were practicing her magic when 'this' happened and I'm working on fixing it. You're not going to tell Snow are you?'' Regina looked pleadingly and Emma wasn't sure what answer she wanted to hear ''Oh Regina you're my friend I'll keep it quiet, I know this would be just the thing to prove Snow's 'witch hunt' true'' both chuckled at the bad joke and Emma felt bad for not noticing her mother's attacks on Regina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying goodbye Regina went back up the stairs Emma in hand ''So I'm indestructible huh?'' Regina sighed ''Yes Emma you are, you think I'd do something that would make you that vulnerable without protection?'' Emma wasn't going to admit she did and expected to have to avoid and anticipate Regina's movements and not piss the brunette (nice work there Emma) till the paranoia wore off. Regina groaned as they returned to their bedroom ''I really didn't want to have to do this, why couldn't you just be content and stay with me? Grr! Strip'' Emma looked up at Regina from her palm with an expression '<i>What!</i>' on her face ''You disobeyed me, you will be punished to show you can't just ignore me, so strip. I'm annoyed and afraid I will not be as gentle as I could'' Regina frown and Emma continued to sit, arms folded. After several minutes of this 'staring contest' Regina gave up and tried to do it herself, Emma struggling as she attempted to remove Emma's blouse. The grinning blond, still wearing the blouse irritated Regina who the face palmed ''Of course'' she muttered and clicked her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma's smug expression faded when she was once again enveloped in purple smoke which wafted away to reveal her completely butt naked with her clothes appearing resized on the bed beside Regina; so no chance of getting them back anytime soon. ''well now that's over with, time for the actual punishment'' Emma looks up to a grinning (and leering) Regina ''This isn't my punishment?'' Regina laughed ''No, this is for me, your punishment is...''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Seeing as Emma is indestructible Regina puts her in her mouth and plays with like she's chewing gum<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Regina spends the day in her study with paperwork, so she has Emma give her a massage starting at her feet and moving up her body as the day progresses</span></div></div>",

You don't have to do....\" But it was too late, he has thrown the switch. You felt like you were spinning. Soon you lost all sense of where you were, or even the feeling of your own body. After a while, it seems to begin to settle, and you again became aware of yourself. As you did though, the more you were aware of, the more wrong things felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last you were able to more, but you almost wished you couldn't. You felt the new weight hanging on your chest, and as you looked down, you could now see that you had breasts. You could also feel very long, thick hair hanging around your head. You heard something to your left, the opposite side from where you were before, and see, well, yourself, standing there with a strange look on, well, 'his' face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou called out, \"You can't do this to us! Change us back!\" Then you paused, \"Wait. If I am in Mary Ann's body, why do I have my male voice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor grinned, \"Because my dear, I need to keep track of the swaps, and to make sure they last. There is a special device connected to the machine. It modulates your voice according to who is on the inside, regardless of the body you are in. If I turned it off, you would sound like the sweet little thing you are.\" He turned to Igor, \"Take them to the dungeon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as a male you could not come close to matching Igor's strength, as a tiny female, you were utterly helpless as he took you down and chained you to a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you were helpless to warn the others. Soon you saw the Skipper and Mrs. Howell brought down. It was hard to tell what sounded more strange. The Skipper's voice coming out of Mrs. Howell's body, or the other way around? They were followed by the body swapped Professor and Mr. Howell, Of course, that left Gilligan and Ginger to be last. Poor, shy, awkward Gilligan had no idea what to do with the gorgeous body she was wearing. She blushed every time her arm brushed one of her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mixed up group was not left alone very long before Igor came back with order to bring the two 'girls'. Unfortunately, that now meant you and Gilligan. He took you both up some steps to a different room where you were each strapped in a chair. There was an animal in a cage next to each with wires coming from it. One had a rabbit next to it, the other a dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begged, \"No! Please don't swap us with animals!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor smiled at you both, \"Now ladies, I would never do that to two such lovely young girls. No, this machine will make sure that you both become my willing servants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilligan was too put off by her body to argue, so it was up to you, \"We will never do what you want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, \"Oh, but you will. What Igor is now connecting to you head is a trait writer. It will take some of the primal characteristics of the animals you are connected to and permanently rewrite your brains to my specifications. The one hooked up to the dog will become a loyal bitch, eventually falling in love with the male she sees first after the treatment, and also eventually going into heat, not satisfied until she is pregnant with his child. A cycle that will repeat when she is not pregnant.\" He grinned, \"The other, connected to the rabbit, will not care what man is there, but will have an insatiable desire for sex of some kind, but also desiring to reproduce as often as possible. I will enjoy breeding both of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he moved toward the switch, you glanced to your side and saw that you were connected to the...</span></div></div>",

We have to get back up to the swapping lab before the Doctor and Igor know we escaped!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stood up, you looked up at your old body. You never realized how incredibly tall you had been! Or how incredibly handsome you were! As he pulled you along, you felt the bouncing of your breasts, only now it felt right instead of strange. Gilligan was being pulled along by whoever was in the Skipper's body, but at the moment, you couldn't remember who that was. And did you care. He was cute too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood there as the Professor began to swap people back. What were you going to do? You wanted to have sex as a female! You wanted to have babies! You didn't want you old body back! You looked around in a panic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only you and Mary Ann and Ginger and Gilligan who were left. You were about to protest returning when suddenly the Doctor and Igor burst into the room. A struggle started, and you saw what looked like a self-destruct button! Just as the others somehow got the Doctor and Igor into one of the booths, you joined the fight, allowing yourself to be thrown backwards, your hand 'accidentally' coming down on the self-destruct button!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor heard the alarms, \"You fools! You have activated the self-destruct! This base will be destroyed in five minutes! Let us out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Ginger pleading, \"But I have to get my body back!\" But there was no time, and no way to do that without freeing the Doctor and Igor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your way out, you saw the dog chase the cat into the other booth, and you made sure to throw the switch as you went past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all made it down to the small boat and pilled in. You had trouble concentrating as you were pressed against the Professor's body. You felt your nipples harden and poke into him. You wondered it he noticed, and you hoped that he did! You were not very far away when the thing exploded. You heard Ginger's body say, \"Wow! That was close!\" Then, \"Hey! I sound like Ginger now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled, \"It's okay. You 'are' Ginger now, like it or not. And with his modulator gone, our bodies sound normal for who we are.\" It was funny for you to hear Mary Ann's voice coming out of 'your' mouth, but you liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long, hard trip back to the island, and you had a hard time not begging one of the men to take you even in that crowded boat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boat made it almost to the shore of the lagoon before sinking. At least the water made cooled you down a little, but not for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed Gilligan staring at the Skipper, then turning away with a blush, then stealing another look. Then you remembered that it was Mrs. Howell in the Skipper's body who had rescued her. His body was the first male that she had seen, and she was fighting the fact that she was falling in love with him. Eventually, she would go into heat and need to have the Skipper's babies, but for now, she was valiantly trying to deny the new feelings in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, that line of thought only strengthened your body's need for a male! You can't help trying to seduce...</span></div></div>",

There were two dresses just like what you were wearing, a couple of different ones, and some skirts and blouses. In a suitcase you found some shorts, slacks, bathing suits, and of course, bras and panties. It was good for the passengers that they were supposed to have been dropped off at an island hotel when the tour was done. Otherwise, who would have brought all of this stuff just on a 3 hour tour? Still, you sighed at how feminine everything was. Of course, poor Gilligan had to wear things not only feminine, but designed to be sexy as well, so maybe you got the better part of that deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you held up one blouse, you found yourself thinking, 'This is the only thing that I will be able to wear for a maternity top.' You felt yourself blush as you wondered where that thought came from? As you looked over at Gilligan/Ginger to see what she was doing, you noticed her just sitting on the edge of her bed staring at the makeup table Ginger used. She didn't look happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked over. \"You are lucky. You got the body of a tall, beautiful movie star. I'll bet using that makeup is fun\" You were just trying to cheer her up, but part of you realized that you did want to look pretty. After all, you wanted to please Gilligan. The male one that is! \"And you will have your choice of males now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up, \"I don't want my choice of males! I want to be Gilligan again! I don't want to wear makeup and dresses and have to sit down to pee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat next to her and hugged her, \"Well, one good thing to think about. Girls stick together. We have to! I am here for you, and I will need you to help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at you, \"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, \"You know why. I am in love with your old body, and I can't help it. Soon I will need to have his baby in my belly. I can feel the need growing already. First, I need you not to be jealous or defensive about me trying to hook up with your old body. And second, if you can do the first part, I need you to help me convince him that I would make him a good wife and we should get married.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared, \"You WANT to marry him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, \"No, not really. I don't 'want' to marry him, I 'need' to marry him, and you know why. Do you think I want my children to be without their father's name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she hugged you as your eyes teared up. \"Don't worry. I am sure Ginger will understand. I will help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed, \"Let's go see how the others are doing.\"</span></div></div>",

I am getting hungry, what is for supper girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinger/Gilligan looked shocked, \"You expect US to do the cooking now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes fell on Gilligan/Ginger and your heart went pitter-patter. This was the 60's. While in large urban areas, the roles of women had been starting to change, in areas like where you, and the original Mary Ann came from, women's roles were quite traditional. You so wanted to please Gilligan/Ginger that you said, \"Of course. We are the girls now Ginger. Come on, we can do this!\" As you grabbed her arm and drug her away, you were thrilled to see Gilligan smile!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were alone, she protested, \"But I don't know how to make anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned, \"That is because Ginger never did either. It was all Mary Ann, and the transfer left a lot of her knowledge in me. All you need to do is what the original Ginger did, and follow my instructions.\" She did, and you were surprised to find just how much you did enjoy cooking now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as 'the girls', when it was ready, the two of you also had to serve the food, then afterwards, clean up and do the dishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCooking and cleaning up after the meals became routine, as did doing everyone's wash. Ginger/Gilligan complained about her new lot in life, but you were not only enjoying it, but you were enjoying being female more and more. Even when your period started, you didn't mind for some reason<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was during this time that Ginger/Gilligan talked to her old body and explained what was happening with you. Soon after that, Gilligan/Ginger came walking up to you. \"Mary Ann, I heard was was done to you. I need to tell you that...\"</span></div></div>",

Then he looked at you and said, \"Mary Ann, I heard what was done to you in that mad doctor's lab. I really understand what it is like to be a female on this island full of single men, but what was done to you was worse. It took the choices away from you. I need to tell you that I fully understand how you feel, and if you want to, I think we should get married so that you....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was interrupted by you throwing your arms around him and kissing him passionately! You loved the feeling of your breasts pressing into his chest, not to mention the contact of your lips as your tongues intertwined! When you broke the kiss, you said, \"Thank you Gilligan! Thank you! I promise I will make you a good wife!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed you back just a little, \"Please, slow down Mary Ann. You do realize that this love you feel for me is artificial. What if it wears off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled shyly at him, \"It might be artificial, but it is all to real for me. Besides, there are other things to consider, and you need to be sure that you can accept them.\" He had no idea how hard it was for you to be saying this! \"First, you need to know that I view marriage as being forever. Love or no love, once we are married, I am your wife until death do us part.\" You let that sink in, then added, \"Second, if what that maniac said was true, I will soon, well, go into heat. I am not sure exactly what that means while it is happening, but it would go away until I know I am pregnant. And after I give birth, at some point it will happen again, and again, and again. I don't know for how long. Are you able to accept having a large family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled at you, \"I think you will make a great mother.\" He kissed you gently, then said, \"When do you want to get married?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one answer, \"Are you kidding me? If we can, right now! As soon as possible if we can't. Especially since I don't know when I might go into heat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe agreed to call everyone together and make the announcement. There were nothing but congratulations for us, and to my total shock, Mrs. Howell donated a beautiful diamond ring to you for a wedding ring! You had no concern about a fancy wedding of course, and how fancy could you get on this island anyhow. So the biggest question was how to shift around the living arrangements. The easiest, short term arrangement, was for the Professor to move in with the skipper and your old body. His hut was somewhat isolated to give the newlyweds a bit of privacy. After that, you would need pick a location for your own hut to be built.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, three hours after Gilligan/Ginger asked you, you were standing in front of the Skipper saying \"I do.\" You felt a strange, new tingle in your pussy as Gilligan kissed you and you became Mrs. Mary Ann Grant. (Gilligan/Ginger insisted on keeping his last name.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt thrilled, even overwhelmed, through the whole thing, but when Gilligan picked you up and carried you through the threshold, for the first time you began to feel both fear and guilt. When he put you down inside, Gilligan could tell that something was wrong. \"What's wrong Mary Ann? I thought you would be thrilled right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled shyly, \"It's, well, I feel guilty in a way. I guess I deserve what happened to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilligan looked confused, \"Deserved?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart thumped as you made a confession, \"Yes. Well, you see, before all this happened. Well, I knew Mary Ann was a virgin, and I had a lot of fantasies about being the one to get her to spread her legs while I took her virginity. And now, well, here I am, only I am the one who will be spreading my legs for you.\" You felt your face burning red with humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at you. \"You should be ashamed.\" You were crushed! But then he added, \"For telling me you had fantasies about Mary Ann when I think I had the sexier body back then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up and he was grinning, \"Well, I didn't say that I didn't have some fantasies about Ginger did I? I had as many for that body or more. It's just that I am in Mary Ann's body now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilligan pulled you close, \"So don't be afraid, or ashamed. You are my wife now, and I only want to love you.\" He began to kiss you, and as he did, he started to rub your breasts. Your pulse quickened as your nipples became stiff. And then you felt Gilligan pulling the zipper down on the back of your dress. Maybe it was because he had been female himself for a long time, but Gilligan was adept at undoing your bra with one hand also. As your dress fell off of you, and your bra joined it, you felt a growing tingle and wetness between your legs. Gilligan whispered, \"And don't worry about new feelings. I have them too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked you up and laid you on the bed. You watched as Gilligan began to undress, and as he did, you pulled your panties off and threw them aside. As he joined you on the bed, you could not believe the feelings you were experiencing. Part of you was feeling incredibly vulnerable, knowing that you had no choice but to be on the receiving end, but another part of you desperately wanted that vulnerability. You gasped as Gilligan began to kiss and lick your nipples, while at the same time allowing a hand to slip up your thigh, and then, for the first time, feeling your pussy being penetrated as he slid a finger inside of you. He knew a female body all too well, and soon had you moaning and squirming with incredible pleasure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you wanted more. You wanted him inside of you completely! You begged, \"Please take me now!' You spread your legs as wide as you could to leave no doubt about what you were begging for! Gilligan didn't disappoint you as he positioned himself over you. You gasped deeper as you felt the head of his penis begin to push into you. It was so wonderful! There was a moment of resistance, then a sharp pain, then he was deep inside of you! You loved it! This was a far more wonderful feeling than you ever had with sex as a male!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your body working toward an orgasm, but all too soon Gilligan held up the tradition of husbands throughout history, and you felt his hot seed being pumped into your body before you were ready. Even so, it was huge thrill! You wanted that! When he was done, he pulled out of you and lay beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid your head on his sweaty chest. \"Thank you my love!\" And even though you were not yet in heat, you found yourself rooting for his sperm now swimming deep inside your body, hoping that you would become pregnant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night though, you made love again, and Gilligan used all of his skill to make sure you experienced a true and full orgasm as a woman. It never crossed your mind to wonder if the rest of the people on the island could hear your screams of pleasure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

You started to struggle, but stopped very quickly. Not only was it pointless to try to overcome Igor's strength, but in your struggle, you felt things that you shouldn't have! As a lock of brown hair fell in front of your eyes, you could see that you were wearing a dress! It was the dress that Mary Ann had been wearing! And it was her smooth, feminine legs that were sticking out from under the skirt. You could also not only see, but feel the breasts on your chest. You realized that you were in Mary Ann's body! The doctor must have swapped you while you were unconscious!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cried out, \"Let me go! Put me back in my own body!\" But it was pointless. Igor ignored you as he took you to the dungeon and chained your small wrists to a strange cage. You saw most of your companions there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Howell looked at you and said, \"Mary Ann? Are you okay?\" But it was not Mrs. Howell's voice that came out of her mouth, but the Skipper's!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am okay.\" You answered, only now realizing that you had your own voice in this petite, feminine body. \"But I'm not Mary Ann, I am Ken.\" Then you said, \"But why do I have my voice in Mary Ann's body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Ginger who answered with the Professor's voice, \"The good doctor has some kind of voice modulator. It helps him keep track of the swaps. If it was turned off, you would sound just as you look, like Mary Ann.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that answered some questions. As Igor returned with your still unconscious body, who was now Mary Ann in your body, you realized that you were far from alone. Apparently the Skipper had been swapped with Mrs. Howell, and the Professor with Ginger. You noticed that Gilligan and Mr. Howell were missing, you could only assume that they were being swapped even now. It didn't take long for that to be confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Igor had locked up Gilligan and Mr. Howell, he lingered. He went first to the Professor and began to feel and smell her hair. To the Professor's horror, Igor then began to paw at her breasts and grope her. She was helpless to stop him. When he finally stopped, he started moving toward you! Soon, the horrid man was doing the same to you! You couldn't stop him as he squeezed your breasts, your rear, then reached under the skirt to stroke you pussy! It was humiliating beyond belief! And like the Professor, you could only cry and beg him to stop! After what seemed like an eternity, he did stop. He even repeated the process with the Skipper, though for only a brief time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was gone, and the women were able to regain control of themselves, you heard the Skipper say, \"We might have one chance for escape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGilligan said, \"Really? That's great!\" Then a puzzled look came over his Mr. Howell face. \"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Skipper said, \"I don't like saying this, but I think Igor is interested in the females. I think one of the girls might be able to seduce him and get him to unlock them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only did you and the Professor protest the thought of one of you trying to seduce the gross man, but Mary Ann and Ginger were opposed to having their bodies used in such a way! Unfortunately, after the truth sank in, there was no denying that it was their only hope. The Skipper said, \"So who will it be. He seemed more interested in the younger girls, but I will try if they won't.\"</span></div></div>",

You must have gotten zapped harder than they thought.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcGee responded, \"Why are you calling me...\" But then he looked down. He didn't have to look under the blanket to realize that he no had breasts! A hand did go under the blanket and fly to his crotch! He didn't find what he was expecting to say the least. His crotch felt empty until his fingers his something new. \"What is going on? How am I a female?!?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe, well, now she, sat up, and looking at Tony, she said, \"Tony. I am McGee!

Even though both Tim and Ziva were willing to try another jolt, the first had almost killed them. There was no way to know if repeating the circumstance would reverse the swap or just kill them both this time. The doctors were fairly certain it would be more likely to kill them. So they were stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two weeks of testing, psych evaluations, and, well, gender re-orientation training, The swapped team members were released from the hospital.There would be some on-going therapy, but they were released for duty. To keep things a bit easier, they kept the first name of their new body, but their original last names. So their ID's now read Ziva McGee and Timothy David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChanging genders did not change McGee's penchant for being early. She was sitting at her desk when Tony walked in. He stared at her sitting at what seemed like was the wrong desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed him and said, \"Do you have a problem Tony?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head, \"Um, no. No! I was just thinking, it is going to be hard for me to call you McGeek anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe huffed, \"Well, I am still a 'geek' Tony. I can hack your bank account if you want me to prove it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony quickly retreated to his desk. \"No need to be a Queen McB there sweetheart. It is just going to take some getting used to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcGee growled, \"Don't call me sweetheart. And you think this is going to take 'you' a while to get used to? You're not the one who is stuck sitting down to pee for the rest of their life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA familiar voice chimed in, coming from the direction of the entrance, \"Well, better that than a gross appendage that keeps finding its way to uncomfortable positions!\" Tony and McGee looked up to see the new David walk in and sit at 'his' desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they could exchange too many more barbs, Gibbs walked in, \"Okay, we have a case. Dead sailor on a destroyer\" He handed Tim David an evidence bag. \"You. Take this down to Abby. Have her see if she can get any DNA off if it. Wait for the result and let me know as soon as she has something.\" He then turned, \"Tony, Ziva. You two grab your bags and head out to the ship. There is a helicopter waiting for you at Norfolk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcGee looked at Gibbs almost in fear, \"Um, Boss. Maybe, um, Tim, could go with Tony?\" The last time she was on a destroyer with Tony, they were forced to share quarters since living space is so limited. She did not like the idea of doing that as a female with Tony DiNozzo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGibbs didn't look up as he sat at his desk. \"You have your assignments people. Let's go!

And even though there were women on board, she knew that a lot of the guys there would be as horny as hell, and they were! She could feel the eyes everywhere they went. If the men didn't stare at her breasts, they watched her ass. Of course, Tony did the same thing, but for some strange reason, that did not bother her as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point, she was waiting at a hatch when a hand squeezed her ass. She spun around, but there was no way to know which of four sailors had done it. However, when it happened a second time, the body memory of the original Ziva took over. She spun around with lighting speed, and in a flash, her one hand caught the offending sailor's arm. In moments, she had a hold on his hand that had him writhing on his knees in pain. She look down at him with an evil grin, \"The next sailor that grabs my ass won't be able to use his hand ever again. Spread the word for me please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZiva was glad she was able to do that. Not because of the humiliation of being sexually assaulted, but because she had started feeling her body react to it in a way she didn't like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she went with Tony to 'their' state-room, Ziva's worst fears were realized when they saw that there was only one bed. McGee said, \"Oh great! I knew they would to this to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony sighed, \"Hey! Don't get your panties in a bunch McNun. I will find someplace else to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcGee moved quickly to block Tony from leaving, and as a result, she found herself pinned between the door and Tony. Until she looked up at him from this position, she didn't realize how tall he looked now, nor how handsome. \"Just a minute. That is not what I said. And what was that McNun comment about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of Ziva McGree's breasts pressing into his chest were was almost more than Tony could stand. \"Well, if you don't get out of my way, we might end up making sure that part isn't true. Now please excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving Tony pressing her breasts, and being able to feel his cock pressing into her abdomen was affecting Ziva too. \"And if you are not careful, you might find out my panties are not bunched.\" She couldn't seem to stop her nipples from getting hard. She wondered if Tony could feel it. As she felt a stirring in the lump pressed into her abdomen, she began to feel a tingle in her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony half panted as he said, \"McGee. I am not sure that his is a good idea. Please move before we both do something we might regret.\"</span></div></div>",

Sure, it's great if you're Jake Sully, with your strong, healthy Avatar body and beautiful indigenous lover, but if you're a human whose Avatar died in the battle, or who never had one to begin with, life has become a struggle to survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after the fight, Eywa has continued her hostility, the alien ecosystem swallowing up the human settlements with a speed that was scary. The larger bases, such as Hell's Gate, were torn apart by hammerhead titanotheres after just a few days, the machinery trampled beneath their feet. Outlying structures were merely swallowed up by aggressive plant growth, and most can barely be found, let alone salvaged from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oxygen cylinders needed to replenish the exopacks are a dwindling resource, though you rounded up as many as you could. The equipment to filter breathable air from the toxic atmosphere is destroyed, once the stockpile of clean oxygen runs out. that's it - the remaining humans will die choking. At your most optimistic estimate, you've got little more than a week of oxygen left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat really leaves an unpleasant taste in your mouth is that many of the Na'vi refuse to help search for the valuable exopack canisters. They're grateful for the help the humans gave in the battle, sure, yet they still don't trust them. You suspect most of them are simply content to wait for the remaining humans to run out of air, and remove their taint from Pandora for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only you hadn't gone and got your Avatar killed, you could have transferred into it permanently, like Jake and the other Avatar pilots have done.

It's not been a successful search. Though you located a half-dozen of the outlying research stations, it took hours of backbreaking work trying to force your way through the tendril-like roots that now enveloped them, and in the end only one of them contained anything still salvageable. You came away with enough exopack canisters to last another day at best, but all the research stations you know of have now been thoroughly ransacked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Na'vi slink away from the aircraft as it touches down in the clearing. They've seen enough of the human machines to last a lifetime. Fuel is getting low too. Only a few more trips and you'll be flying on empty, and you make a mental note to keep a close eye on the gauge in the coming days - the last thing you want is to get stranded out there in the wilderness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sling a canister over each shoulder and jump down from the aircraft, slogging through the soft Pandoran dirt towards the huddle of tents. A tall, gangly blue figure waves as you approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Norm, good haul?\" Jake call, forced optimism in his voice. You can tell he's worried for you and the other humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I start taking small breaths now, I might still be here next week,\" you reply with a brave smile. As you get closer, you notice a dry trickle of blood running down the blue skin of his chest, and the bandages of leaves wrapped about his upper chest. \"Are you okay? Did you hurt yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waves your concern away airily. \"Ah, it's nothing. Just a little leadership dispute. A few of the others... Don't worry about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the dust has settled, the other males of the clan must have started making shows of aggression, challenging his authority as leader with the intent or either deposing him outright or simple to establish themselves in the new hierarchy, securing territory and mating rights over a number of the females. Eytukan's reign had been long and strong, each male kept firmly in line by his physical and social might. They had chaffed under his rule for many years, and Jake is in for a hard time until his authority is established.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, me and Neytiri have been thinking,\" he grins. \"We think we might have found you a solution...\"</span></div></div>",

You need bodies to upload into, right? Native bodies that can breathe this atmosphere. Except they need to be half-human, or at least part human like the Avatars, so that you can upload into them, so that you're compatible, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. The Na'vi cells require the insertion of human DNA to produce viable host bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake grins lustfully. \"Oh, I've been inserting human DNA alright. Inserting it all night long, if you catch my drift. Neytiri's pregnant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're stunned. \"Jake, that's great news! Congratulations. I can't believe it! Honestly, I can't believe it, that should be impossible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it took a lot of trying,\" he chuckles. \"So what do you think? How do you want to be my son?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. Waaait, you can't mean... you want me to use... You want me to transfer my mind into your child? That's abominable! I won't do it! And besides, what of all the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugs. \"What about them? I'm making more than enough host bodies to go around. One of the perks of being clan leader. The females have been lining up to play my blue flute. Peryal, over here!\" he calls sharply, summoning a female Na'vi from the group. She is tall and strong looking, with the proud stance of a capable hunter. He bends her over, pulls aside her loincloth, and you avert your eyes as he mounts her. The two grind away for a few short minutes before he pushes her away, evidently finished. She slinks away, tail slung low between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake, are you sure being clan leader isn't going to your head?\" you ask cautiously. It seems very unlike Jake to be going around mating with anybody other than Neytiri. Perhaps being permanently, fully inside his half Na'vi body is having an effect on his mind, especially with male aggression and hormones so high at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks taken aback by your suggestion. \"Norm, I'm fine.

Only the faintest of light illuminates the stubby-fingered hands curled in front of your face. Your lungs no longer burn, though you still can't breath since you're submerged completely in fluid. A dark cord waves back and forth in the dimness, possibly your tail, possibly your queue, possibly an umbilical cord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He actually did it then</i>, you think with unease. You're grateful to be alive, though the cost doesn't bear thinking of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear Neytiri's heartbeat all around you, mingling with the distant, faint chant of the ceremony. You wonder if the other humans will be given similar new bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a long time you just float and think. There is little else to do. You count the developing fingers on your hands. Four of them on each hand, including the thumb, like a true Na'vi, rather than the five-fingered Avatars. You suppose you're only a quarter human now, being only half-Avatar. You're just grateful to have two hands and two feet. You could have been a hideous mutant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think you sleep, though it's very hard to tell. You can sense very little from the world outside. Every now and then you think you feel Neytiri stroking her belly, so you do your best to kick back. You try some basic morse code, though there is no reply. Evidently your mother doesn't know morse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>At least Na'vi gestation is short</i>, you think, settling in for a long wait. For the most part, it's quite relaxing, though at one point you feel a surge of acceleration, a series of swoops, turns, and dives. <i>Please don't tell me she's flying! In her condition?! What about the baby!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, you feel a rather rhythmic disturbance in the fluid, and the ever present heartbeat quickens. An unpleasant realisation sets in. <i>Jake! Not now! I'm in here!</i> You squirm in discomfort as a series of lustful moans filter down to you. Evidently all it takes is a few high-speed aerial maneuvers to get Neytiri in the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the days turn to weeks, turn to months, until finally it happens. The waters stir and a series of contractions force your from your pleasant home, out into the painful, bright, cold air. Bawling your head of in discomfort, you look up into the face of your grandmother, Mo'at. She cradles you in her arms, scrutinising you carefully before passing you into the arms of a sweaty, smiling Neytiri.</span></div></div>",

It hit her and sent her sailing through the air! He lost sight of her in the thickness of the leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then realized that the other off-worlders had flown off in their air machine, leaving the girl behind!

How can you ask me to spend time teaching a female how to be a, a, female?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chief stepped in here, \u201cYou will obey! If Eywa has chosen you, there must be a reason. Until we understand that reason, you will help this creature learn our ways!\u201d That was the end of that discussion!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Awkey took you into Home Tree! There he put you in the care of females around your age, who began to teach you how to prepare meals for the tribe. It was hard work! After the meal, Awkey showed you to a sleeping pod. You soon drifted, then found yourself back in your own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the lid is mostly opened, Grace is drilling you! \u201cWhat the hell happened out there? Where did you go? What happened to your avatar?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe listened, as dumbfounded as the rest as you told about how you were almost killed, and then how you awoke near Home Tree, then was taken in. She shook her head, \u201cWhy weren\u2019t you automatically returned here? The safe guards should have done that the moment you were unconscious!\u201d She scratched her head, \u201cAnd what sign were they talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook you head, \u201cI don\u2019t know. It must have happened while I was unconscious. One thing is for sure though. I seem to be getting that home-maker training we discussed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace just walked away shaking her head.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning you met with Grace. She grinned at you. \u201cDo you know what the Na\u2019vi meaning of your name is by the way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look confused. You had not thought about meanings. When you said no, she grinned, \u201cRoughly, it means \u2018child bearer\u2019. In one way it could mean you are loved of children, which seems to be true from what you said.\u201d But she couldn\u2019t help smirking, \u201cOf course, you can be glad the avatars are sterile, since the other meaning for it could also mean you are a female who will give birth to many children!\u201d She got a great laugh out of that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you were ready, you had to go back in for more training. Part of the day is humiliating to you as you help to cook, take care of children, and make jewelry. However, you also have language lessons with Awkey, and after a few days, he begins to teach you survival skills. On the language and culture, you are way ahead of Jake, who has also somehow been accepted as you have, driving Grace even more crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the survival skills, you were slower, but what was beginning to move you was that somehow, you were sensing, even seeing, connections between the living things around you. To your further surprise, Awkey did not seem to be as aware as you were on that level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings progressed well over the weeks that followed, but you kept some things to yourself. First off, you knew you could not betray these people. You were beginning to love them, especially the children. And not only were you feeling more and more like one of them, but you were feeling more and more like your female Na\u2019vi body was your \u2018right\u2019 body, and your human male body was wrong. You really kept that to yourself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis all presented a dilemma for you. Grace had read your papers about calling the Na\u2019vi animals of course. What she did not know was that you were being paid to not only say that but prove it, true or not. You had sold out for a lot of money. You could never go through with that now! However, if you let it be known how you feel, you might be pulled out by the company. It was not the money you cared about. The truth was, you did not want to stop being Lai-di. The part that was hardest of all for you to admit was that you were falling in love with Awkey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, the priestess came up to you. \u201cLai-di, you have shown yourself a great addition to the women of our tribe. You now must choose. Do you wish to become one of the People?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou understood very well what this would mean. On the one hand it would give you many rights and freedoms that you did not currently have. On the other hand, as a single female of the tribe, and of the proper age, if you became one of the People, you could be chosen by any eligible male. That would not be bad if it was Awkey, but there was no guarantee, and in a conflict, the older male had first choice, and Awkey was your age. Could you risk becoming any males mate? Could you risk not becoming one of the People?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You saw no choice, if you said no, you would have to leave. You looked at her and said, \"Yes. I wish to become one of the People.\" And that really expressed your deepest desire! To remain Lai-di!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake was not around when the ceremony happened, and you were glad, because after the celebration settled down, and you were with a smaller group, Awkey came up to you, and gently said, \"I see you Lai-di.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou replied, \"I see you Awkey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou caught your breath as he went though the ritual. When he was done, he said, \"I claim Lai-di for my mate. Does anyone challenge my claim on her?\" You held your breath. This was a critical point, but no challenge came. Awkey smiled, \"Come.\" You took the hand he held out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took you to a secluded spot under the sacred tree. There you made love to him, your legs wrapping around him as he held you up and lowered you onto his member. You gasped in pleasure at the feeling of being penetrated. Na'vi did not have orgasms the way humans did, but for you, it was like hours of constant pleasure. When it was over, and Awkey was asleep, you cried. You could not bring yourself to tell him what a terrible mate he had selected. How could you tell him you were sterile? It was not a condition that existed among the Na'vi! You felt terrible! On the one hand, as an eligible female, you had no right to refuse his choice, but on the other hand, you knew now that you loved Awkey, and it killed you to know you could never bear him the children he had the right to expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you persuaded Awkey and the leaders to keep your mating secret from Jake and Grace at this time. You had to figure out what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe days that passed were the most wonderful you have experienced in your entire life. The Na'vi were similar to humans in one way. Newlyweds seemed to have sex as often as possible! However, you found time to learn and grow as a woman of the People. The jobs that you had once considered demeaning, probably because in your mind you considered them \"women's work\", you now understood the need for. Yes, there everyone had a role to some extent, but there was no such thing as demeaning work, because there was no such thing as 'trivial' work. Every single thing contributed in some way to the physical, mental, or spiritual well-being of the tribe. And it was not uncommon for a male to come in and help the women when need arose, or for the women to take part in a hunt at some level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was another thing you began to realize, there were no bullies in the Na'vi. All were of equal worth. Even the Chief and the Priestess. Their positions gave them honor, but their voice was no louder in tribal councils, nor did the youngest female, you, have less voice than they.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself feeling happier every day, and even joyous. Even when there was no reason to. And if possible, you came to love the children of the tribe even more! At the evening meal one night, you commented on this to the Priestess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at you, \"Of course. That is normal for a female who has been blessed by Eywa. Especially one so young.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at her. You knew what she meant. For a woman to be blessed by Eywa meant that she was pregnant! But that was not possible! Avatars were intentionally rendered sterile! You finally recovered, \"Forgive me blessed mother, but are you sure?\" You hesitated and tried to choose your words in this language that was still new to you. \"Dream walkers are not supposed to be, capable, of such a blessing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, \"My child, whatever the off worlders intended for you as a dream walker, Eywa has chosen differently for you. I can see the new life within you. You would see it and feel it yourself, but your mind is still filled with the joys of your mating with Awkey. He will be pleased that you have been blessed so soon, and that you bear his son. Eywa must be pleased with you indeed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you recover from shock, you say, \"Thank you blessed mother. Awkey will indeed be pleased.\" You pause, \"But the off-worlders would not be. We must keep this from the other dream walkers for now.\" You sigh, \"If only I did not have to leave this body. What they think would have no meaning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at you, \"This can be done Lai-di. However, if it becomes so, your off-world body will die. There will be no going back to your old people. Would this still be your desire?\"</span></div></div>",

If such a thing could happen, if my dreams were only of this world and not a nightmare of another world for me, it would be the most wonderful thing! To know I could not be taken from my People would be worth any risk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, \"We shall begin preparations tomorrow Lai-di.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a bundle of nerves the next day. It was joyous to tell Awkey of the news of your pregnancy. The two of you celebrated as newlyweds often do! You were afraid to tell him the next part, for fear of his reaction. When you did though, he held you close, \"Truly I have chosen well! That you would leave your old world for the People, and for me. It will be a blessing to not need fear that tomorrow you may not wake again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thrill at your decision cemented your decision all the more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tribe was called to around the sacred tree. The Priestess instructed you to lay at the base of the tree. As she and the tribe chanted, you felt yourself being drawn out of yourself. You could see your body, and a tread of energy going from it, off into the distance. It looked solid, and in your mind, you reached out and pulled on it. It gave, and the amount you pulled in seemed to blend into your body. You pulled more, more of the same. You began to steadily pull on it as a rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the lab, alarms began to sound. The module holding your male body sounded alarms as your vital signs began to slip. Lab personnel began to follow emergency procedures!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled faster and faster, and all that you pulled in slipped into your Na'vi body. For a time, there was resistance. At one point, there was a pulling in the other direction! You mustered your strength, gathered your will, and pulled as hard as you could. You felt a snap, as a rope tearing, and you quickly hauled in all that was left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the lab, the team fought to save your life. At least, that is the way they saw it. They could find no reason for your body dying, but it was. Then it was over. Your body was dead. The team was in shock. They had no idea why this happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last of the rope of energy sank into your body, you felt yourself sinking back as well. You slept, then you awoke as Lai-di. As you sat up, the Priestess examined you. She stood up and looking at you, \"You tie to your old world is gone.\" She helped you up and raised your hand, \"Lai-di is no longer a dream walker! Eywa has made her truly one of the people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople laughed as you danced and danced through the tribe! You felt free! You were Lai-di! Mate of Awkey and blessed by Eywa! And there was nothing the off-worlders could do about it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so wonderful to sleep a real sleep at last! The next day, it was decided to keep your new life secret from the dream walkers for now. It might not be well for their leaders to know that one of their own chose of her own free will to become Na'vi, for that is what you were now.</span></div></div>",

On top of all of that, you love sex as a female, and your love of Awkey increases each day! And now that every waking minute of your day is spent with the Na'vi, your language and social skills grow very rapidly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll was going wonderfully until the day that Jake and Grace came to the tribe with a warning. From a distance, and out of their sight, you listened to what they had to say. You watched as they were arrested and tied up. You found yourself terrified when, not long after, the chief and priestess come looking for you! You fall on your face before them, \"No! Please! I am not one of them! Please do not harm me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe priestess smiles and speaks calmly, \"Fear no Lai-di, for we know your heart. We have come to you for what you know of these dream walkers and the off-worlders. Does Jake-sulley speak the truth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still tremble as you stand, \"It is hard to explain in our terms. When I was an off worlder, my chief was not their chief.\" You paused, \"But I did meet their chief. He was a man who will stop at nothing to get what he wants, and he wants what is in the ground under our Home Tree.\" You plead, \"I do not know more than this of their chief, but two things I do know. Jake and Grace love the Na'vi. They took great risk by coming to warn you. The other thing I know is that the off worlders are used to war, and have powerful weapons that you have not yet seen used. Take their warnings seriously.\" You hesitate, \"I know we must fight, but please, let me take the children now, and go to the sacred tree.\" You hesitated, \"And, if you believe me, please, free Jake and Grace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are grateful they allowed you to evacuate the children in light of the coming battle. They chastised you about pleading for Jake and Grace. As a Na'vi female, and not being a hunter or warrior, you have no choice but to let it drop. They are your leaders now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gather what other females as you can, and round up the children. When you are almost at the sacred tree, you hear the sounds of the many aircraft go bye. Not too long after that, you hear the terrible sounds of battle, and you know it will not go well for your People. You act strong for the children, but the other adult females can tell of your fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour worst fears are confirmed and then some as, after a while, many of your tribe come straggling in. You cry with the rest at the loss of life, and worse, the death of the Home Tree! You are also the first to pull yourself together as you begin to organize a hospital to treat the many burned and wounded! It is during this time that it is revealed to you, and everyone, that for some reason you have a unique and strong power. You are able to direct the flow of living energy all around you, and turn it into a healing power that totally restores lesser wounds, and does great healing even on the worst of injuries. It does wear you down though, and you collapse with the effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you awake, you find that you are now known as The Healer. The chief and priestess have given you a new title, and granted their authority to you in all matters of healing, though they bid you to pace yourself for the sake of the child you carry. You smile as you are grateful that your new found power gives you the ability to know that your unborn child is still healthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were saddened to hear of the exile of Jake and Grace. Even your new leadership status is not enough to overcome the blame given them for the attack. However, when Jake shows up riding a Last Shadow, he becomes leader of not only the tribe, but all of the People. As he begins preparations for war, you begin preparations for dealing with the wounded.</span></div></div>",

Syndrome was gloating, \u201cYou see? Technology can do more incredible things than you could hope to. But supers do have their uses. That is why I came up with this.\u201d He patted a device that was in front of Mr. Incredible, and between him and some kind of table. \u201cAnd now is the time to show you how it works.\u201d He turned, \u201cIt is time my dear Mirage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis incredibly sexy assistant, Mirage, got an evil, very satisfied look on her face as she hopped up onto the table. As she lay there, restraints came out and fastened around her wrists and ankles. The table then slanted up so that she was facing Mr. Incredible with the device behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyndrome crowed, \u201cNow watch as we write a new chapter in your history.\u201d He activated the device. A beam struck Mr. Incredible on the forehead. At the same time, another beam struck Mirage on the forehead. Mr. Incredible felt like he was literally being sucked out of his body, then things wen black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to come to with someone slapping his face gently. \u201cHello? Mr. Not-so-incredible?\u201d His eyes fluttered open to see Syndrome\u2019s face inches from his. He felt very strange. And the more aware he felt, the stranger it got. His perspective seemed off too. Syndrome gloated, \u201cLet me introduce you to someone.\u201d He stepped aside. As he did, Mr. Incredible gasped. What he saw was himself! Well, his body, free from the energy restraints and smiling. He realized that the gasp he had let out sounded odd, even feminine. He looked down to see two small breasts. He was wearing a dress, and platinum blonde hair was on the corner of his vision! He was in the body of Mirage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyndrome laughed, \u201cYes, you realize your position now. But not fully yet. You see, that little device you experienced is a body swapping device. And it worked perfectly.\u201d He turned to Mirage, in Mr. Incredible\u2019s body. \u201cReady?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirage laughed, \u201cReady! I have been waiting for this!\u201d With that he picked up the body switching device and began to smash it until it was a small lump of crushed metal and circuitry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Incredible let out a very feminine scream of, \u201cNO!!!\u201d, as \u2018she\u2019 struggled in vain to free herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyndrome looked at Mirage, \u201cYou know the next step. Enjoy!\u201d He grinned and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyndrome walked up to Mr. Incredible, who he now towered over. \u201cYou might be wondering where he is going?\u201d He leaned front and kissed Mr. Incredible on the lips, holding is head in place as he did so. \u201cYou see, he is going to take your place in every way. He will have a new job working for one of my companies. When I have need of his strength, it will work for me.\u201d He massaged the breasts that now pushed out from Mr. Incredible\u2019s chest, \u201cAnd in the mean time, he is going to get to know your wife very, very well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Incredible struggled, \u201cShe will know it is not me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyndrome laughed, \u201cWhy should she? And Mirage has been studying you for months in fine detail. His goal is not only to pass as you, but to see if he can double the size of your family before you are swapped back.\u201d He let that sink in as she stubbled again, \u201cOh yes, there is a way back. To your body and to your family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped struggling, \u201cHow is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, \u201cIt is just a device I made. I can make another. But in order to do so, you are going to have to learn how to be a humble, submissive woman. From this moment on, your name is Miss Isabel Marie Shapely. You will learn to answer only to that name. You will learn how to be feminine and you will server me in whatever capacity I require. The sooner you are my perfect, feminine assistant, as Mirage was, the sooner I will consider building a new swapping device.\u201d He slid a hand under her skirt and along the panty-covered slit in her crotch, \u201cAnd the sooner you can stop Mirage from doing this to your wife.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed a button that let her loose. She immediately jumped at him, intending to smash him. Instead, he blocked her, grabbed her arm, twisted her around, and then held her tight as he gave her a passionate kiss!. She kicked and punched, but it was like a child to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed, \u201cDo you see how helpless you are now Miss Shapely? If you ever want to stand up to pee again, follow me.\u201d He followed him in defeat as he lead the way. They entered some feminine looking quarters. \u201cHere you will find a wide range of clothing. You will find books and recordings on how to become what you need to be, a feminine woman. I suggest you get started.\u201d He left her inside.</span></div></div>",

She explores the room and finds that, while everything from outer clothes to underwear vary in degrees of femininity, there is nothing that does not scream female in her mind. However, she finds a pair of jeans, plain white panties, a plain white bra, and a t-shirt. With some socks and plain sneakers, she feels ready to go look for escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her best efforts are pointless. The patio leads to a sheer cliff that has no way down. She searches the door for a way to override the lock. There is only a small hole for voice recognition. No panel, no doorknob, not even a significant crack!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter three hours of combing every inch of the room, she realized that few jail cells could have been as effective! As she collapsed on the couch, a video phone on the coffee table in front of her came on. Syndrome smiled and said, \u201cAh, my dear Miss Shapely! You look like you realize you are not in control anymore! I will be bye in an hour to take you to dinner. Please dress appropriately!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did nothing except intentionally muss her hair. When she went into the bathroom to pee, it was humiliating for her to have to sit down to pee! She had no choice though, and learned why women have to wipe when they were done. No wonder Mirage wanted out of this body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Syndrome showed up, he laughed at her attempt to displease him. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand Miss Shapely. I am in no hurry! The longer it takes you to learn how to dress and behave, the longer I have the pleasure of your company, and the more time Mirage has to make babies with your wife.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned beat red, but new it was pointless to attack him while she had this weak body! She was given a menu to choose from, but found she could only eat a fraction of what she was brought! When he took her back to her room, he grabbed her and kissed her passionately as she struggled to stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay after day she dressed as masculine as her choices allowed. Syndrome said nothing more. After a few days, on the return to her room, she ceased struggling and just let him kiss her. It was going to happen anyhow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething snapped in her mind when she started cramping, and then remembering the notes she read from Mirage, she put a pad in her panties just in time to catch the blood as her period started. She cried. She could not deny being female anymore. It would not work. It had been three weeks, and she had only confirmed that escape was hopeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could not bring herself to make a lot of changes, but a jean skirt seemed appropriate with the rest of her outfit. She even made a very small attempt at doing her hair and did poor job of putting on lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyndrome smiled when he came to pick her up, \u201cHmmm\u2026 better. Tell me your name girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned red, but said quietly, \u201cMiss Shapely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, \u201cYour full name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hesitated and then said, \u201cMiss Isabel Marie Shapely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed, \u201cWonderful Isabel!\u201d He hugged her, and from now on, you all address me as Mr. Pine.\u201d He waited, \u201cIt is customary for my assistant to respond. In this case, the right response is \u2018Yes Mr. Pine.\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at him, sighed, and said, \u201cYes Mr. Pine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed, \u201cExcellent! You are learning Isabel!\u201d They had dinner, and ended the evening with the traditional kiss. It was different this time though. Her period had changed things. This evening she was not a man trying to fight his way out of a woman\u2019s body. This time, she could not deny her femininity. And even though she did not cooperate with the kiss, it was different. She was a woman being kissed by a man.</span></div></div>",

She even gave in to what Mirage had told her in a note, and started to wear only skirts and dresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time her next period began, she was well versed in walking in high heels and tight skirts. Her makeup was flawless. But that was not all. Maybe it was the way she was dressing, maybe it was the regularity of it, or maybe it was her slow but steady surrender to her new gender, but while she did not kiss Syndrome back, there was no sign at all of not only resistance, but distaste. The truth was, she could not even remember what being a male felt like, or even peeing into a urinal. It was even an alien thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo perhaps, with the start of her second period and the reminder of her womanhood, it was only natural that things started stirring in her body when Syndrome kissed her.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Maybe it was something like the Stockholm syndrome, or maybe it was being trapped in the body of an adult, sexy female with hormones she did not grow up with flowing through her body and brain. Whatever the case, the next evening when Syndrome kissed her, she was aware of what she was doing when she kissed him back. Somehow, since she felt so weak and helpless now, being in his strong arms felt good. And she had to admit, not once did he treat her roughly or even without respect. If it had not been for being locked in her room all the time, she would not even feel like a prisoner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a couple of days later that Syndrome showed up at her door early in the morning. He smiled and said, \u201cAh, Miss Shapely! I am glad to see you up and dressed! I have decided to give you some real work, if you would be willing to help me with some secretarial duties during working hours of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was thrilled! Something to do besides read fashion magazines and feminine instructional books and videos! \u201cOh yes Mr. Pine. That would be wonderful!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked in and used a remote to open a panel on the wall that created a doorway to what looked like an executive office. He smiled as he took out some papers and placed them on her desk. \u201cYou will understand that I am not ready to grant you computer access yet Miss Shapely. However, as you do good work and earn my trust, you will be granted more responsibility.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, \u201cThank you Mr. Pine. And I do understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was leaving, He turned, \u201cMiss Shapely. At work we do need to keep things formal. However, at dinner, I would like you addressed me as Buddy, if you don\u2019t mind of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe actually blushed, \u201cUh, no! Of course not Mr. Pine! I would be honored!\u201d It did something inside of her to think that he would allow her to call him by his first name at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did make her feel better to have real work to do. She found it gave her a sense of worth that she had been missing for a long time now. She did not care if it was just secretarial work, it was work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo show her appreciation, when Syndrome came to take her to dinner, she made sure to dress in one of her sexiest dresses and tried a new hair style. He smiled when he saw her, \u201cYou look very lovely tonight Isabel. It is a pleasure to have a lovely woman like you for my dinner partner.\u201d She felt a glow inside! For the first time, he allowed her to have a couple of glasses of wine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he took her back, he took her in his arms and kissed her passionately for a very long time, and she returned the kiss every moment. When she was back in her room, she realized that she was breathing heavily, and more. Her nipples were hard, and there was a strange tingle between her legs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDays went on, and Syndrome trusted her with more and more work, including limited computer access. She came to appreciate the chance to work, and showed it as best as she could each night. She was thrilled when he started grabbing her rear and squeezing as he kissed her each night!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time her third period ended, Miss Shapely had been promoted to Secretary 2. Her door was never locked now, unless she locked it from the inside. She had some limited access around the base, and she found that she enjoyed the lustful looks of the men around her. Other than being a flirt at times, she poured herself into her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also began reading about the feminine side of sex, and often masturbated after her goodnight kiss from Buddy. She shocked herself one night, after bringing herself to her first female orgasm, that she thought of Helen, but only in terms of wondering if it ever felt that good for her? It was hard to think of ever making love to Helen. She would feel like a lesbian now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time of her fifth period, she had been promoted several times. She had access to all areas of the base except for some security areas and transportation areas. She managed all the base operations and was extending into corporate operations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyndrome watched her carefully, but she made no attempt to escape, send a secret communications, or compromise security. He smiled as he watched her undressing one night using one of his many hidden cameras. It was time to move her to the next phase of his plan.</span></div></div>",

The next night, he not only spent more time kissing her, but also moved one hand from her ass to her breast and began to massage it. She did not resist at all. He whispered into her ear, \u201cYou are the sexiest woman I know Isabel. It is hard for me to keep my hands off of you. I am sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moaned, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to keep your hands off of me if you don\u2019t want to Buddy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled as he picked her up and carried her into her own bedroom. Once there, he began to unzip her dress as he kissed her. Soon, she was naked. For her, she had concluded that this one the one, true power she had left in this powerless body. If she could please her boss even more in bed as she could at work, life might be easier. Not only that, but she had some to desperately desire to know what it felt like to have sex as a female? Now, she was going to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her mind, it was symbolic of her new position in life to be laid on her back and spread her legs. As she submitted to him and, gasping, felt herself penetrated for the first time, she was pleased to find that it felt wonderful and greatly enjoyed sex as a female! She even had a fantastic orgasm! It was so wonderful, she thanked Syndrome over and over, and they repeated the performance later that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, sex with Syndrome became a regular thing that she looked forward to. And when he took her along to his appointments in other countries, she was his confidential assistant in the day, and shared his bed at night. It was hard to believe, but she felt like she was falling in love with him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe responded so well, Syndrome decided to move to the next step. One day when she walked into Syndrome\u2019s office, there sat her old body, Mr. Incredible!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One morning, she walked into Syndrome's office and was stunned! There sat her old body, Mr. Incredible! He smiled and stood up, \"Miss Shapely! It is wonderful to see you doing so well!\" He took her hand and shook it while she was still in shock!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at him. He was huge, and so strong of course! She realized that she even considered him handsome and kind of cute. She also realized that she could not remember what it felt like to have that body. Being this close to him just reinforced how weak and tiny she now was. He was total power, she was totally helpless. She shook her head and managed a weak smile, \"Hello Mr. Incredible. I hope you are doing well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt his eyes rove her body, \"I am, and I can see you are doing very well also.\" She knew what he meant. She had abandoned exercising for strength month ago, and instead did exercises that kept her slim and enhanced her figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to ignore him and focus on why she was there, \"Here are the reports you asked for Mr. Pine. And these documents require your signature.\" She was so glad to get out of that office when he was done! She felt bad enough around Syndrome's superiority. She shank to insignificance around Mr. Incredible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyndrome smiled to watch her leave. He turned to Mr. Incredible. \"As you can see, her conditioning is almost complete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Incredible smiled, \"Do you think she knows she is never going to get this body back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyndrome shook his head, \"If I read her correctly, she no longer thinks about it. She is trapped in the feminine persona I have built for her.\" He grinned, \"It is such satisfying revenge to have the powerful hero who spurned me beg me to take her when we are in bed.\" He grinned, \"Two more steps and I will have my full revenge.\" They concluded their meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Miss Shapely returned, alone with Syndrome, she said, \"Mr. Pine, I was wondering.\" She blushed at being so forward and speaking out of turn, \"If, well, if I may. I have a, a, um, a request.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, \"What is it Miss Shapely?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed, \"May I, could I, well, is there any way that I might not have to, well, meet with Mr. Incredible again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked upset, \"Miss Shapely! How dare you make such a request after all that I have done for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe trembled, \"I, I, I am sorry Mr. Pine! It won't happen again! I promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe frowned, \"But it did happen my dear.\" He walked up and caressed her face, \"You are my most beautiful flower my dear, and just seeing you stirs my need. If we were not in the office, I would have you spread your beautiful petals for me and earn my forgiveness.\" Talk like that made her horny! He went on, \"Since you have stirred both my need and my anger though, you will learn a new skill.\" He reached to her shoulders and forced her to her knees. \"You can make up for your impudence by satisfying my need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes went wide! She knew what he wanted, and seen it done on her training tapes, but she did not think she would need to bare that kind of humiliation. She did not ask him not to though. She knew his answer. This was just more proof of the lowliness of being a woman. She began to undo his belt and pants, and as she began to massage his cock, he added, \"And remember Isabel, this rug and my clothes are very expensive. Don't you dare let one drop escape to make a mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was humiliating as she serviced him. When the time came, she made herself swallow every drop. She did not know which was worse. The fact of what she did, or that she actually enjoyed it all! It did not matter. From that day on, she knew what to do to help him relieve stress when she could not make love to him, and he wanted stress relief often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this, she began to get access to more confidential files. In fact, Syndrome was so confident of the completeness of her conditioning that he granted her all of the access that the original Mirage once had. She was ready for the final step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of months, he had her arrange a party for employees, but her handled the guest list. When the party started, he had her behind a mirrored wall as the guests began to arrive. She gasped when she saw Mr. Incredible arrive, but her jaw dropped when she saw his wife Hellen was with him! Even worse, while still in the early stages, it was obvious that she was pregnant! Her belly was not too noticeable in her maternity top yet, but Miss Shapely could tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was very hard to meet her as if she had not known her before. It was even harder to congratulate her on her pregnancy, and see her be happy about it! Of course, she did not know that her husband was a different person. Not once did she want to try to tell her the truth. How could she admit to Hellen that she had become this insignificant girl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, after the party, when she was alone and waiting for Buddy, she found herself looking in the mirror and wondering what it would be like to become pregnant? To be a mother? She found her heart racing at the thought of getting pregnant with Buddy's child! Perhaps that would give her some worth? That night, when she made love to Buddy, she wished to get pregnant! Her maternal desires were astronomical! But she dare not ask Buddy for such a privilege!</span></div></div>",

He had even teased her with the idea, getting her hopes up, and then showing up with a different woman on his arm!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight though, things were about to change. They went through one of their many long, sessions before actually doing anything. Miss Shapely waited until she was so horny that she could hardly think, and focused wholly on her desire to become pregnant, before she pushed a secret button near the bed. Rays hit their heads from above. When Miss Shapely came too, she smiled, or he did, because he was no longer Miss Shapely, he was now Buddy Pine. It had worked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited until the lovely woman in his bed began to wake up. He smiled as her eyes fluttered, as he saw the look of confusion on her face, then saw her eyes open wide in terror as she saw him and realized the truth of what had happened! He laughed, \"Yes, it is true. You are now Miss Shapely. And in your case, it is truly permanent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to fight, \"I am not! I am Miss Shapely! I mean, I am Miss Isabel Marie Shapely! I am a girl! I mean, I was born female!\" She realized the futility, \"How did you do this? I did not build a new machine! And whatever you did to me, the original did not do this, this, extra!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, \"That is right my flower. After I had the right access, and discovered where the plans were, I used that lovely body you now have to seduce your top engineer. He not only built it for me, but added some extra touches and advancements. Some of them your own from other inventions. You see, it did not just put you in that body, it locked you there as Miss Shapely. Not only will no such device ever be able to swap you again, it also locked in the personality and conditioning that you so lovingly applied. You will not be able to identify yourself as anyone else. You will walk, talk, and act like Miss Shapely without even realizing it. You also have her needs and desires.\" He rubbed her breasts, then her stomach, and finally her pussy, \"Wouldn't you love to feel my baby growing in your womb?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, \"No! No!\" However, she returned his kiss. Soon they were making love again. At the peak, he asked her again. This time she cried out, \"Yes! Yes! Please give me your baby! Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled as she begged. The sex had locked in the conditioning that had been meant for him. He smiled, \"Oh, by the way Miss Shapely. How would you...\" He asked her a very technical question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at him confused, then panicked as she struggled, \"What did you do to me? I should know that! I know I should!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, \"Yes. I now have your knowledge and you have the knowledge of my lovely assistant. You are not capable of thinking at the level you once did. That will ensure you do not find a way out of this. Now. If you are a good girl, I will make your life easier, and if you are very, very good, I might even marry you and let you have children with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was shocked, but she also knew she wanted that! She could not help it! She was trapped by what she had done to this body!</span></div></div>",

Ready to have your baby yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new Syndrome grinned, \"Ask her yourself.\" He called her in and watched her turn deep red as she confessed her desires to Mr. Incredible. After she left though, he said, \"And now for the next step. I am sure you like your promotion?\" He indicated he did. \"Well, I decided to promote you even higher.\" He activated the device. With his old, super strong body back, he recovered first. He packed up the portable device and set the release. In moments, all of the data showing how Syndrome, and his accomplice, Miss Shapely, had conspired to murder over two-dozen super heroes was released to every government agency that applied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the person in Buddy Pine's body woke up, he found as Miss Shapely had, that he was locked in that body, that he could tell nobody that he was, or ever had been, anyone but Buddy Pine, less the technical expertise, and that he was in charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Incredible smiled, \"You are in charge now.

It had not been easy to tell him the truth when the time came. It was even harder to convince him to swap bodies. She felt a tad guilty that she had initiated the swap without permission, but she knew the feeling of power of that body, and that her 'wife' would soon love it too much to want to leave it. She did put a few suggestions in the swap that helped him adjust quickly too. Thanks to Syndrome, she could never been happy spending the rest of her life as a male. Even as the now 'richest man on earth'. So now she was a woman again, and it felt right. She would be happy to give him as many children as he wanted to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were dressed, they went out to breakfast. It was their daughter who greeted them first, \"Mom! Come on! Change us back! Please! Sitting down to pee is gross! And I don't like having boobies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir son chimed in, \"We learned our lesson mom! Really! We will behave. Please put me back in my body before tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, \"No. It is for your own good.

While mom might not have intended for it to happen that way, Violet very quickly found that he preferred being male.

So he had worked on a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was impressed with how pretty he had been as Violet, and how nice she looked at she shyly left for the dance with Tony. When mom and dad left him with a babysitter who did not know about his speed powers, he made use of that speed. He had already used his ability to speed read to find what he was looking for in Syndrome's old records. Fortunately, they now lived close to the corporate research headquarters, so Violet was able to use his speed to get inside, grab what he wanted, and get out in teh blink of an eye!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Dash came home, Violet hid behind some bushes and watched in shock as Dash shyly allowed Tony to kiss her! Well, that made what he had planned easier! He was going to feel guilty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, after mom and dad came home, Dash begged them, \"Please swap us back. I don't like being a stupid girl! There is nothing good about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet saw their reaction, and fed into it, \"Better than being a yucky boy! You just don't like it because boys have it better than girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash took the bait, \"You have to be kidding! Tony would have done anything for me just because I am a girl! Girls have it much better!\" And soon they were in and argument!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen intervened, \"Well, obviously it is going to take the two of you a good bit longer to learn your lessons! Maybe after a couple of weeks or so as each other will help you appreciate the differences.\" The kids whined and complained, but on the inside, Violet was triumphant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled as, back in what was now 'his' room, he held the device he had stolen. It was an advanced version of a mind programming device. Small, and only needed to be laid on the forehead. He planned how he was going to use it to remain Dash forever.</span></div></div>",

An hour later, he removed it and was back in his room in seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, he saw Dash secretly fussing with her hair. Later, he also saw her catching peaks at picture of Tony. He smiled. It was working. He knew if she changed suddenly, it would look suspicious. So she started him off slowly, and would give him a little each night. For now, she gave him a love for long hair, and reinforced the pleasurable memory of last night's kiss with Tony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a test, later that day he mussed Dash's hair. She cried out, \"Violet! Stop that! I just got done brushing my hair out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled. He purposefully selected things she would be secretive about for the future too. That night, he gave her a love of wearing panties, and started her on a journey to liking boys instead of girls, and especially Tony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they got ready for school the next day, it was funny to peak in and see Dash having trouble deciding which panties she wanted to wear! It was even funnier to see her shyly talking to Tony after school!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next night, it was a love of wearing a bra and having boobs for Dash, and notching up her love of boys and Tony just a bit more. The third night, it was a little different. While the he still gave her an increase in liking boys and Tony, he helped her not to miss what she 'used' to have between her legs, and not mind what was there now. Not to like it, just to accept it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned at the way Dash would complain about some things, but he could see it working in her. Her after-school conversations with Tony were less shy each day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that happening, there was an insurance policy he needed to take care of.</span></div></div>",

By the end of the week, Violet had Dash to the point where she did not 'mind' being female, and was her happiest when she was around Tony, though she would not yet admit how much she was starting to like him. But it was not fast enough! A little more than a week and their parents might swap them back! Dash had to WANT to extend their time in these bodies, and she was not there yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is when he decided on the next step. Friday night, after giving Dash a distinct preference for girl's clothing, and the beginnings of a physical attraction for Tony, Violet zipped into Tony's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew it would not take a lot of pushing, but he reinforced Tony's attraction to 'Violet', and over the weekend, strengthened his resolve to ask her to be his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then returned to Dash, and started planting the idea of love in her mind, very subtly, and a feeling of what he called 'pleasant confusion' when around Tony, and a desire to please him. He also made sure that she started to feel pleasure when Tony called her Violet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school on Monday, Violet saw his plan succeeding even better than he hoped! Not only did he witness, from behind some bushes, Tony asking Dash to be his girlfriend and Dash accepting, but Tony kissed Dash, and she returned the kiss willingly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet kept the treatments going for Dash, giving her a greater and greater acceptance of being female, and of course, a growing love of Tony. By the end of the week, it was a very contrite Dash who came up to Violet and asked him, \"Um, Dash. I, well, I mean, Violet, Um, may I take to you about something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet looked at her blankly, \"Well, you are. What did you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed, \"Well, um, I, um, was wondering, well, um, if there was any, well, um, any chance that you might, um, consider, well, um, staying me for a while longer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up at her, \"You mean you would like to stay like this a while longer? Sure! If you don't mind being a girl, I don't mind being so fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and hugged him! \"Oh thank you!\" Then she realized that she was acting a bit to please, \"I mean, um, thanks! I don't mind being a girl at all. I am getting, um, used to it.\"</span></div></div>",

You are too young for that, but you are not too young to get pregnant if you do!\" She knelt down in front of what looked like an empty dress standing here. \"Honey, if you really want to be a girl, and even stay a girl, I am okay with that. I will let you in on a family secret, and it must stay just between us girls. Do you promise?\" Violet reappeared and nodded. Helen continued, \"I used to be your dad. Your mom and I swapped bodies permanently.\" She then when on to tell Violet/Dash of how Syndrome had swapped her with Mirage, and how she had gotten to prefer being female so much that when she was back in her male body, she no longer wanted it. Her mom happily agreed to letting him be the mother and housewife, and both of them were much happier that way than ever in their lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you see honey, I am not against you, but I want you to understand all of what that means.\" With that, she entered a code into a keypad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA beam hit them both, and the next thing Violet/Dash knew, she was standing there looking at what had been her body.

She wasn't sure she liked the feeling of helplessness as she hung there, but she was far too proud of her daughter's growing confidence and ability with her forcefields to complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet concentrated and made a twisting gesture with her hands. Her mother's body twisted around in the air until she was face down with her back to Violet. Violet adeptly adjusted her psychic grip onto her mother's shapely bubble butt, teasing it higher and pulling it closer until it was suspended just infront of Violet's navel. The rest of her body hung loose, her fingtips just about touching the kitchen floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you up to, Violet?\" Helen asked in amusement, craning her elastic neck to see. Her eyes went wide as her daughter lifted Helen's skirt, placed a hand either side of her exposed rump and pushed her cheeks apart. \"What arnnGGHHAAH!\" she groaned, as a spherical forcefield blossomed inside her ass, swelling with unrelenting force. Her elastic flesh yielded to it, but the speed and strength with which it grew was a shock even to her. Her panties and skirt were ripped to shreds by her ballooning ass. Her mind was swamped as the invasive forcefield distended her anus until it was a wide and gaping hole big enough for...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt Violet's naked foot slide inside her ass, the little toes wriggling as it was pushed down through her intestinal tract. Her arm swelled with the shape of the foot that forced its way down past her elbow, through her wrist, and finally fit snugly inside her once dainty hand, the toes squirming to fit inside each one of her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet pushed her left foot down into her mother's left arm, and stepped fully into her. Helen seemed to resist her, contracting her body in an attempt to expel this unwelcome visitor, but all that did was make her a tighter fit. Helen's upper body clung like leggings around her daughter's young, athletic legs. Her head between her thighs, still only able to utter animal noises from the pain inside her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Violet pushed her arms inside her mother's leg, stretching out the toes as she wormed her fingers into each one. Finally wearing her fully, it was an awkward fit, but with a judicious application of forcefields she was soon able to craft Helen into something resembling a unitard. She released her force grip on her distended ass, letting it contract around her neck. Helen let out a final, long moan.</span></div></div>",

She stroked her breasts and squeezed her ass, feeling herself getting hot and wet inside the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen, whose head still dangled between her daughter's thighs, twisted her elastic head around and managed to free her lips from the psychic grasp. \"Violet, you take me off right way! I am not some item of clothing to be-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet extended her hand into the air, silencing her mother as a spherical ball of force formed around Helen's head. Casually she closed her fist, and the sphere began to shrink. Helens features were squashed like a face pressed against glass, her features become flatter as her head became smaller and smaller under the psychic pressure. Violet continued to crush her down until her head was only an unrecognisable fleshy-coloured ball a few inche long, though a pair of lips protruded commically from the surface, still moving in silent protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held her there until she was sure Helen's elasticity was exhausted. It was a thing she had discovered recently - if Helen was stretched or crushed to her limit and held there for two long, her powers would fatigue and she'd be trapped in that shape until somebody released her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe released her grip. The fleshy lump between her thighs waggled a bit but showed no sign of reforming into her mother's angry, shouting head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would hardly do to have an unsightly bulge hanging between her legs however. There were already rumours circulating in the school about her powers - the last thing she needed was people thinking she was a tranny. But how to dispose of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping the rubbery lump, she spread her legs a little and pushed it firmly inside her, inverting it into her pussy. Not difficult. It was only a few inches after all - she'd experienced far bigger on the boys at school. She gave a shiver as the imprompu dildo squirmed inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wave of her hand, her school uniforms floated into the air and settled about her body.

There, Bob saw all kinds of chemicals, tubes, testing facilities, and so much stuff. He was led to a top secret room in the lab. There, Edna showed him his greatest invention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Behold, the Human Transformiger\", said Edna. \"It can alter the human body for its likings and even give them special superpowers. Been working on it for quite lately yet pretty untested. Do not worry. It is safe, but are you willing to try it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob thought for a moment, he replied:</span></div></div>",

Helen was his life, but it was so nice for her to enhance her ass or give her titties some extra bounce or heft. Helen had only set the limit of not changing her face. But Bob couldn't imagine even asking her to do that, it'd feel like cheating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow if he had that super-flexibility he was sure he could surprise her and satisfy her in ways she could never imagine.

Without warning a lightning bolt shot through him, outlining him in a violet-purple glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdna's manic smiling face was pressed against the glass.

The two humans race for the cockpit, hastily firing up the engines and throttling the ship up and away from the arid, red Genosis desert. The gunfire and the roar of the turbulence rattles the outside, but soon that drops away as they break through the atmosphere, up into low orbit. The hum of the artificial gravity generator kicks in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think we're being followed,\" Padme says, her hands tight on the yoke as she guides the ship towards an opening in the the ring of clustered rocks that circles the planet. \"We'll have to clear these rocks before we can jump to hyperspace, but I think we're out of danger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ship begins to weave itself through the drifting chunks of rock, the droids linger in the cockpit. R2D2 trills and beeps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree, Artoo. It <i>is</i> most uncaring of Master Anakin to leave us in this state,\" C3PO replies prissily to the ship at large. \"Ever since that production line, you have been positively filthy. You are covered in dust and oil, and my access ports are dripping with lubricant. Though I hardly expect the Master to have noticed. I daresay he'll leave us like this for the entire journey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beep boop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Artoo, I expect they *will* have to replace your shell, because that the only way they'll be able to remove the dirt once it dries!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnakin rolls his eyes.

Don't you dare touch that slut!\" Padme shrieks, but the cockpit door has already slid closed behind her lover, the articulated dustbin and the pleasure droid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three walk down to the repair bay. Picking up the cleanest rag he can find, Anakin sets to work wiping away some of the grime that had accumulated on R2 during his time in the foundries. The oil had mixed with the desert sand, producing a thick brown-red residue that gummed up the joints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere,\" Skywalker mutters, prying a lump of desert sand from the holographic projector. After much scrubbing, he eventually steps back from the now shiny, spotless droid, which trills happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that will <i>have</i> to do,\" C3PO sighs, pessimistic as always, as Artoo rolls across the repair bay and interfaces with the wall socket, powering down as he recharges his battery. Anakin approaches him, brandishing the oily rag. The young Jedi raises his hand and, with a quick twist of his fingers and a minute application of force power, the lacy bra is torn away from the droid's chest. His heavy, synthetic tits spill out, his pink nipples becoming erect in the presence of his master, as his programming dictates. \"Oh my,\" C3PO gasps, as Anakin grips him around the waist and pulls him closer, rubbing the greasy rag over the soft flesh of his new body. </span></div></div>",

Padme is piloting the ship, she'll be unable to leave the cockpit until they clear the asteroid belt. He figures he has time to give his old droid a quick run through her new utilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is good news!\" C3PO chirrups, barging past Anakin towards the cockpit. \"As a Companion Droid, my function is to chaperone important delegates and VIPs on interstellar voyages. It stands to reason that they would give me piloting abilities, don't you think!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... that wasn't really the programming I had in mind...\" Anakin sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPadme shoots them an angry look as they enter. \"What is <i>she</i> doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wants to try flying the ship,\" Anakin explains.

The wonderful scent of oil and engine grease in her hair evokes fond memories of his childhood in Watto's junkshop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship lurches the moment C3PO touches the yoke, veering of course and spinning erratically through the asteroid belt.

Her lush ass seemed to flow as the steered the craft this way and that. A smooth set of curves between the various hazards of the belt. He steadied her hands and arms when necessary, allowing himself to hold her as well. His fingers squeezing the firm sides of her breasts when she leant over too far in some manouevres. There was an answering frisson from her when his fingers were roaming her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door hissed open, and he looked back to his wife. She stood in the doorway a platter of sandwiches, beautifully prepared and presented. But he barely paid it any attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPadm''s outfit took all his attention. The outfit had never been worn like that before. She was in a plain pilot's jumpsuit, a size or so too small. It hugged her curves, accentuating her tiny waist and the lush thighs.

It was an abomination. \"Jedi? Are you sure?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should think so,\" Obi-Wan replied dryly. \"I'm staring at a whole batch of Miss Secura. Come quickly, Anakin, I'm...

The droid idled away along the gleaming ceramic walkway that ran though the vast cloning facility beneath the waves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were day's when Obi-Wan's vows of celibacy were tried harder than others. This was one of these days. He stood, staring upwards at the clone production line, a long rail of liquid-filled, glass capsules, each filled with the sleeping form of the Jedi Twi'lek, Aayla Secura, each as naked as the day she would soon be born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe encapsulated clones slid past his eyes, a factory of nude, blue flesh. He had known Miss Secura well at the academy. There had been times when it had taken all his Jedi mind training not to stare at those luscious tits bulging out her leather clothing, and there had been other days when he had allowed himself the briefest of glances, a gift to himself after a hard mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow to have her thrust upon him so, a thousand-fold, naked and helpless. It was more than he could stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slowly moving capsules shuddered briefly to a halt as a minor error was detected in the batch further along the production line, setting the water sloshing inside the tanks. The clones shifted in their sleep. The one closest to him was curled into the feotal position, her limbs drifting slowly in the pearly liquid, one thumb in her mouth. Her expression was placid, sleeping, and he could sense no mind inside her body. That would be added later. One of her fleshy head-tentacles was clenched tight between her thighs and her skin squeaked against the close confines of the capsule, her body pressing against the glass, displaying itself as if seeking his approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the production line resumed, a hundred of more clones passed his eyes. It was easier to see the defects in the cloning procedure with the Twi'lek than it had been with the human, Jango Fett. Some of the Aayla's were darker or lighter shades of blue, a few even had skin of green and red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything to your liking?\" the Kaminoan at his side, a high-ranking male named Kala Ra, spoke up. Its air was polite and accommodating, though he could sense it was annoyed at him for discovering this place. \"Would you like to see more? The decanting process perhaps? The imprinting champers? Or perhaps you would like a little time alone with one of the clones for your... appraisal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I certainly would not,\" Obi-Wan replied primly, disliking the cloning technician's tone. \"This factory is an abomination. It must be shut down. In the name of the Jedi council, I demand you halt production immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kaminoan's had been placid and emotionless up until now, but this one looks shocked. \"Halt production? I'm afraid that is entirely out of the question. Many of these clones are only half-gestated, to halt now would kill them! Not to mention, you have no authority here. This project was authorized by the Galactic Senate itself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hardly think that likely,\" Obi-Wan scoffed. He glanced around, his eyes settling on a large, spherical room in the distance, into which many of the rails of clones were being fed. \"Ah hah! This must be the central processing core. Very well, if you won't shut this down, I shall,\" he stated, marching purposefully towards the central room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kaminoan was at his heels, its words unheeded. \"No, you can't! Don't go in there, that's-\"</span></div></div>",

They had been decanted from their maturation vessels, and hung from restraints about their ankles and wrists, their limp bodies dripping with amniotic fluids. He spotted the line of Aayla Secura's, but there were others too, all powerful Jedi, some even with seats on the Jedi High Council. There were Stass Allie, her vivid violet eyes staring soullessly at the room as the medical droids poked and pried her unresisting bodies. The horned Agen Kolar. The vibrant red-white-and-blue Togrutan, Shaak Ti. Kit Fisto, Barriss Offee, Serra Keto. To his horror, he saw batch after batch of the diminutive, wrinkled, green bodies - they were even cloning Master Yoda. Or, perhaps, Yaddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the purpose of all this? How did you acquire the genetic material from so many high ranking Jedi?\" he demanded angrily of his guide. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kaminoan inclined his head politely. \"We do not ask such questions. The client provides the raw materials, we provide the finished product to the quantity requested. As for how the cells could be obtained, well... we require only a single hair or flake of skin, easily obtained by even the most rudimentary of cleaning droids. You yourself, during your short time here, have shed enough material to produce a billion batches during your time here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObi-Wan bristled. \"There had better not be clones of me here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKala Ra was notable tight lipped on the matter. Before Obi-Wan could force an answer from him, a klaxon began to sound and the rack of Aayla Secura shuddered to a halt. \"Excuse me for a moment,\" Kala Ra said, walking serenely to a control panel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>[DEFECT DETECTED (BATCH AS53) - SKIN PIGMENTATION MISMATCH<br>\r\nDISCARD/CORRECT?]</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Discard or correct? What does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKala Ra gestured with one elongated hand at the Secura currently under examination by the medical droids. Their many spindly limps were exploring her body, squeezing, poking, probing, scanning. Unlike the others, this clones skin was a bright lime green. \"This is where the batches undergo quality control. A clone must be perfect before it can be allowed to go onto the next stage. Defects must be rooted out. It must exactly match the rest of its batch, or it becomes a weak link in the unit as a whole, an unpredictable variable and a unique target for the enemy to focus on once these clones enter combat. Since each clone is an investment, minor defects can be corrected...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Kaminoan's long finger selected 'CORRECT', and the medical droids went to work at once. The Secura clone spasmed in pain as a dozen syringes pierced its body all over, injecting an inky substance that spread out through her lime green skin, turning it to the same dark blue as the original.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happens to the ones that are discarded?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you will see soon enough,\" Kala Ra said with the faintest hint of a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObi-Wan brushed the Kaminoan aside and approached the control panel. There must be a way to shut the system down from here, though as he examined the interface he could find only controls to speed up or reverse the production lines, and accept or reject the clones passing through quality control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp pain pierced his back suddenly. He turned, his movements already sluggish, to find the Kaminoan holding a delicate silver pistol. His numb fingers reached behind him, feeling the tranquilizer dart embedded in his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the first time in a long time that anybody had gotten the drop on him. With most races, he would have sensed their hostile intent before they acted, a sudden spike in aggression. The Kaminoans were different. They had very little emotion, genetically excised from their population long ago. The Kaminoan had pulled the gun and shot him with cold, calculated intent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObi-Wan slumped against the control panel, his limbs like jelly. Desperately, he tried to reach out with the force, tried to pull the holstered lightsaber at his waist into his hand, not that he had the strength to lift it anyway. The lightsaber wiggled weakly out of its holster, but Kala Ra snatched it with his long fingers and tossed it far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObi-Wan was surprised at the strength belied by the long, spindle limbs, as the Kaminoan gripped him by the ankle and began to drag his limp body across the floor. He fought weakly, but in no time the Kaminoan was lifting him. He felt manacles snap closed around his wrists and ankles. He was being placed in the production line!

Its cutting tool had carved deeply around Han's Solo's manhood, severing it cleanly from the rest of the block in a crude carbonite cube.

With her ass poking out behind her, she shot Jabba a mute question, and received only a smile as an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, she jiggled her hips from side to side, her arse dancing for the crowd, until it slipped around her curves and fit snugly into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[Now the rest.]\" Jabba's eyes resting meaningfully on the bikini top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill defiant, she flipped the obese gangster the bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJabba's neck fat rolled slowly as he shook his head in disapproval.

She found her own hands straying towards them. Worse than that, she found her bust swelling eagerly towards her questing fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't happy looking down at the cleavage she had, and the fact it was expanding terrified her in ways she literally couldn't express.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[You'll just have to tie it looser.]\" Jabba told his prisoner. \"[That's two sizes bigger.

The leering look of approval on Bib's face was unpleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, Han refused to break her dance routine, and risk another punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/32/08/d1/3208d1aff846c9508eb7f03e504f10f4.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/32/08/d1/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished with a graceful bow, showing a canyon of cleavage to Jabba. The applause from Jabba's sycophantic court encouraged Han to give them a deep bow too.

With a trembling hand, she felt between her legs, sliding her fingers between her smooth thighs to confirm what she already knew. For once, the smuggler was silent. She could only look at the Hutt in shocked disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you done to me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaba gave a gurgling belly laugh, which was taken up by the assembled servants, slaves, and lackeys. A chorus of mocking jeers assaulted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[No more of your funny little quips, Solo]?\" Jaba gloated. \"[No matter, you will find other ways to amuse me I'm sure.]\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rusted R2 unit trundled across the floor. It stopped in front of Solo and a nozzle emerged, squirting her naked body with sticky scented oil. Most of it went on the floor though it managed to aim some of the pungent liquid between her legs and over her breasts. The crowds erupted in howls of laughter as she slid away from the droid on her backside. She struggled to her feet but fell hard. Much of the muscle of her legs had been sliced away to make her new body - it would be a while before she could walk, let alone run. For the time, she would have to crawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice trembled as she spoke, \"Hey, Jaba... L-look Jaba, I was just on my way to pay you back... I got a little sidetracked, it's not my fault!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahaha. [She has a silver tongue. Perhaps I will cut it out],\" he cackled. \"[It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but now you're my pet.\" The vast sluglike alien patted the fleshy, stinking folds of his belly. \"Take your place, my pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, gee, that's a really great offer, Jaba, really it is,\" Solo gulped, crawling backward as far as from the repulsive alien as she could get. \"Would love to take you up on that but, uh, I'm afraid there's somewhere I gotta be... think I left the engines on on the falcon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came up against something hard and metallic. As she turned, the medical droid behind her seized her head in metallic claws, pining it tight. Struggle though she might she couldn't free herself from its vice-like grip. A hatch flipped open on its shell right in front of her eyes. A tiny robotic limb tipped with a medical drill. It whirred into life. Her eyes watched it helplessly as it articulated towards her skull. Agony stabbed through her as it whined into her temple with a  splatter of blood and the acrid smell of burning bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[In case you intend to crawl your way free, my pet, this droid is installing a chip into your brain. Any attempt to escape, and it'll blow you up!] Ahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drill finished boring through her skull and halted. A second limb placed the chip insidde her head, while a third sealed the wound. As the arms freed her, she collapsed to the floor, bio-bakta oozing from the shrinking hole in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaba patted himself once more. Solo shuddered inside, knowing there was no fight left in her. Her butchered body needed time to heal. Slowly, weakly...</span></div></div>",

Bringing her hands calmly to her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped up to the protocol droid, and presented her neck for collaring. Han was damned if she was going to be collared against her will.

They could break through the enchantment quite easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTony looked at the musclebound figure and winced. He knew electrical engineers with more wizardiness than this norse warrior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have done as you asked, yet you still seem troubled, my friend,\" Thor declared with a frown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? Troubled?\" Stark scoffed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThor nodded. \"Perhaps it is your involvement in the creation of Ultron, culminating in the destruction of a large slavic settlement, that weighs upon you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just had to bring that up...\" Stark grumbled. \"Okay, fine, yeah, it is starting to piss me off a little. Not just Ultron. The Iron Legion, War Machine, Obadiah Stane-bot... Last year I helped build helicarriers for Hydra. Everything I build always ends up being used to hurt people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your inventions do have a way of getting away from you,\" Thor nodded.  \"Quite literally in fact!\" he boomed, chuckling to himself. Jane Foster had been teaching him the nuances of modern earth humour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStark sighed. \"Some days it's like we're still in the weapon business. I thought a little Asgardian security mumbo jumbo might help me sleep at night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ah! Robots may not be my strong suit but that I can certainly aid you with! A stout ale or two always helps me sleep.\" He slapped Stark hard on the back, booming, \"Come! This night you will drink in the halls of my father!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStark's eyebrows raised. \"You're inviting me to Asgard? The realm of the gods? Wow...\"</span></div></div>",

The sensor sweep remained silent when no explosives were detected, although the Norse God let loose a short burst of laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTricks were always his favourite form of vengeance, and he did rather have a score to settle with this particular Avenger. The parcel lay unattended, ignored and inert for the entire morning. Tony was in his lab following up on an new wrinkle for the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mark Fifty would be a revolution, lighter, stronger, and faster to wear. But hunger finally drove him from the lab, that and the fact that he'd hit a snag. A break was in order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he headed towards the kitchen his eyes were drawn to the parcel. Wrapped in metallic red gift paper, and with a golden ribbon an inch wide around it, topped with a pink bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring it, he headed to the kitchen and made a simple snack, as he finished of a beer. Snagging a second bottle he headed back to the lab. However, he couldn't walk past the parcel. It intrigued him, so carefully wrapped, and the pink bow suggested that it was from a female admirer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully he opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA spray of pink and silver confetti exploded in his face. He was laughing as he stumbled backwards. As the confetti fluttered down, cute tiny helium balloons letters floated out of the box. They wafted and drifted in the air, their movement was a little unnatural, and as that revelation struck. They formed a word - <i>s u r p r i s e</i> -.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit\", Tony thought, \"I hate magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was his last thought, as the balloons burst in a pink and white blinding light, knocking Tony backwards over the sofa. His head bounced with a heavy wet smack off a table knocking him unconscious.</span></div></div>",

His head hurt, and he was unsure what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the HUD lights of his suit, lit up his face, and with a groan, he recognised, the ceiling of his lab. Mentally he did a check on himself. He didn't feel terribly bruised or bashed, although his body did feel a little off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to his feet, he spotted his reflection in the panoramic windows. It looked a little off, too. The dark red almost looked metallic pink... squinting, didn't make it disappear. The gold was rather pale too, in fact to his eyes, it looked more silver than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short hop of a flight, and he stood two feet away from the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt merely confirmed what he suspected. The suit was pink and silver. Inside the suit, he couldn't feel the texture of the metal. But with a huff of released air the suit opened, and the face plate slipped up and away. The fingers, and then the glove retracted into the arm of the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of the texture of the suit faded quickly, testing to see if it was a layer of paint was history. Tony turned the hand back and forth in front of his face. It didn't fit, it was slim like a woman's hand, and the nails too. The nails, were oval, and painted a glossy crimson, the thumb was a glittering gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must have been a hell of a party...\" Tony said, shaking his head, trying to recall some memory of what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the shaking just ensured a long lock of raven hair fell across his face. Instinctively, unbidden, his hand reached up, and took it. It was soft, silken, and after a sharp tug, undeniably his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving the mental command, he felt the suit retract, and his body exposed to the chill air of the lab.</span></div></div>",

It was like his old suit but even better, made of a strange advanced material that was stretchy and light, but also tough as steel and filled with all sorts of gizmos to augment his already awesome suite of spider powers. He couldn't wait to try them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolled the rubbery suit up his bare chest and wiggled his arms into the arms of the suit. \"Let me just say again Mister Stark I really appreciate this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You earned it, kid, after your help at the airport. Couldn't have done... whatever we did without you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We kinda lost, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we couldn't have done it without you,\" Stark said with a half-smile.

You want one of these?\" He poured himself a large whiskey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a teenager, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... no? Alright, fine. I'll have yours.\" Drinks in hand, he came and sat on the couch as Peter wormed the mask up over his head. \"How's the fit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly? It's a little loose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a feature; you're a growing boy. What am I gonna do, make you a new suit every two weeks?\" Stark smirked. \"Kidding. That's one of the things I added. Watch this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStark rolled up his sleeve to unveil the wrist-mounted remote. He tapped the interface once. Immediately the zipper at the back of the suit sealed and vanished. With a hiss, the suit pressurized, forcing out the air, clinging to Parker's skin far tighter than even the last Stark suit had. Parker felt his face redden as he glanced down to see the bulge of his manhood displayed in perfect detail on the hermetically sealed suit. Stark coughed on his whiskey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely didn't build <i>that</i> feature into the suit, Stark chuckled. \"Hold on a sec, I got some presets. You're gonna love this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a touch of another button, the suit inflated slightly, the ribbed fabric reshaping about his body. Parker gaped at himself. The suit had given him the illusion of massive muscles underneath, and his manhood was a rather more family-friendly bulge. \"I call that the superhero physique setting. Good, huh. We think it's really going to poll well with the public.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As cool as this is, I'm just here to help people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStark shook his head. He was a little drunk. \"Nope. You've got an image problem, kid. All this stuff they've been printing about you in the... the... damn, what are they called.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Newspapers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Those old things. All that stuff about you being a danger, this is really going to help with people's perceptions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter marvelled at his new physique. \"I can't argue with that, Mister Stark.\"</span></div></div>",

Maybe it was his make-up... his... make-up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sickening lurch, it hit him. He recoiled from the reflection of the female program. How had he not noticed this body was not his?

Just play by the rules of the game and you'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet nowhere in his memories of his father's bedside tales or Gem's memories of life in The Grid could he find any suggestion on how to escape. There was one program however, named Castor, who was the most knowledgeable man Gem knew. If there was a way out of the Grid or if his father was still alive, Castor would know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would need to get to the End of Line club, but that was far across the city.

It contracts, narrowing, the four wheels merging together to form two.

It's hard to tell even if you strain your neck, but you're certain you can see textured padding forming over your buttocks and lower back, closely resembling that which upholstered the seat in the car.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe data disk slips out of your grasp and fuses with the front wheel with a flash of light. The creamy latex of your suit's gloves flows into the white plastic of the hubcaps, pinning your hands to either side of the front wheel. Behind you, your high heels merge with the back wheel, which now sits between your slightly spread legs. Looking at you now, it would be hard to say where your body ends and the light cycle begins, as you become integrated into the machinery piece by piece.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe engine block nuzzles up into your crotch, forcing your body to flex to make room for it, bending at the hips and arcing the spine, so that your upholstery clad buttocks jut up even further, forming a cushioned backrest for the driving seat that your lower back has become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth is forced wide as something long, hard and smooth rezzes between your teeth. It is a metal bar wrapped in a spiralling strip of dark leather, which sits uncomfortably in your teeth, pinning your tongue so that only muffled noises escape your lips.

It extends out of both sides of your mouth, curling around to your ears. Handlebars, you think.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little something of my own design, darling!\" Zuse had crowed as he'd downloaded the blueprint into Gem's disk. \"A gift from Zusey, a light cycle, custom made, just like you always wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGem's memory is vivid. She had been furious the first time she had tried the \"gift\" only to discover that it made the user more ridden than rider, incorporating them into the body of the lightcycle. It was so typical of Zuse, the self-proclaimed master manipulator, to turn a person into a thing that he could control and use. She had hidden her anger well from her employer however, and had been incapable of venting in any event, and Zuse had released her after two days anyway, once his mercurial nature tired of riding her around The Grid.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere isn't a millimetre of wiggle room inside the confines of the cycle, except in the head and buttocks, the latter of which only causes your seat to wiggle invitingly to the passers by. It envelops you totally. You try to reach for the data disk, but your hands are immobile. The rain patters down against your paintwork as you sit at the side of the road, military and civilian vehicles roaring past through the puddles.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere must be a way of making this thing go at least.\u00a0</span></div></div>",

The walls were creamy marble, the floor pearly glass, while the furniture sparse and utilitarian, made of dark wood and well worn leather. The room itself was small, a simple box containing everything she owned, with a single large window taking up one wall that looked out over the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only luxury was her wardrobe. A sagging rail of clothing took pride of place along one of the wall and outfits festooned the furniture, some less... modest than others. She tried not to pry too far into the memories of the dead dancer's lifestyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body strained against the tightness of the suit. Her fingers moved on instinct, finding the seam concealed within the back of the collar. A gasp of release escaped her lips as the suit split open down her spine, the constriction easing. She gripped the front of the suit, peeling the cups away from her breasts, before worming her arms out and sliding the suit down around her hips. She unbuckled and kicked off the boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suit circuitry dulled as she wriggled it down her legs to stand naked. As her fingers explored the toned curves of her new body, she found the circuitry was still there, pulsing with a living glow just under the surface of her skin like blood vessels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm never going to get used to this,\" she murmured, his hands hovering around her liberated tits. \"Though I think I could learn to enjoy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the transport craft roared down the street beyond the window, rattling the room and everything in it, a searchlight illuminating her nakedness. She stood, frozen, like a deer in headlights, only daring move again once the beam finally slid away and the machine buzzed on down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like these guys aren't big on personal privacy,\" Sam grouched, searching around for something to cover her nudity. Unfortunately the clothing choices available seemed designed only to display or accentuate her abundant womanhood, and she settled for pulling the velvet quilt from off the bed and draping it over her shoulders. She slid into one of the chairs. The cold leather molded itself to her, though something hard dug into her backside. She dug out what looked like a television remote from under her, pressing one of the buttons. A holographic screen sprung into existence in front of the chair, a familiar face staring down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad?! she shrieked, instinctively covering her nudity with the blanket. \"Dad, you're alive!\" It was a news broadcast, her father's face looking warmly at the camera as he gave an impassioned speech. Sam could hardly believe it. He was alive, and hardly seemed to have aged a day! Excitedly, she turned up the volume, on the edge of her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet as she listened raptly to her father's words, her joy gradually turned to confusion. Then dismay. And finally anger. Why was he calling himself Clu? And why was he proudly announcing to the cameras how successfully the state was being at rounding up and murdering undesirables? Gleefully, he gleefully listed off the names of political activists who had died fighting each other in the gladiatorial combat known as The Games, explaining how their deaths benefited the stability of the system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't the wide-eyed idealist she remembered her father as being, yet Gem's memories confirmed it - this man wasn't just backing the regime, he was its founder and ruler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad her father really abandoned his son and family for this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe speech ended. She flicked through some of the channels, but there were only a handful, all with the air of government propaganda around them. Unwilling to watch any more, she turned it off. Troubled and weary, she held the blanket close around her. Tomorrow, she intended to find her father, this Clu, and demand answers. For now, she needed sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay in bed for a long while, tossing and turning, but finally her eyes closed and her body's glow faded as she drifted into sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was awoken in the night by the sound of the door slamming. She opened her eyes. A figure stood at the foot of her bed, the room illuminated by the......</span></div></div>",

To Richie, watching through the viewfinder of his video camera, it was a metal cage on a conveyor belt feeding into a large metal box, out of which came a second conveyor belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Professor continued his demonstration, ranting excitedly as though selling this thing to their shareholders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Useless garbage is broken down into its basic molecular components and then recombined to form a whole range of useful new items - from bedpans to bowling balls! Need a new bedpan? I know I do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe typed 'BEDPAN' into the molecular reorganiser computer and pressed enter, activating the conveyor belt with a whir. The cage, filled with 15 pounds of yesterday's garbage, was fed into the machine and Keenbean took up position at the output collector. The machine growled and hissed as the garbage was taken apart and reassembled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's quick, it's easy, and IN NO TIME AT ALL, we've taken 15 pounds of yesterday's garbage and transformed it into a brand new bedp- Bowling balls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf a dozen bowling balls rolled down the output chute. The Professor hit the emergency stop button and hefted a bowling ball sadly. It was a perfect bowling ball - nobody would have been able to tell 5 seconds ago it had been a pile of stinking garbage. But it wasn't a bedpan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRichie lowered the camera. \"It's still not working, is it Professor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still a few kinks need ironing out,\" Keenbean sighed. \"Still, not to worry!

It seems she resented him enjoying the use of her body for sex when she was younger, then disappearing without a trace later. She did have the pendant that he was looking for though. Finally he said, \"Marion, come on! Let me just take a look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey struggled over it, and somewhere in the process, the stone in the center glowed brilliantly! There was a sudden burst of energy, and Indy felt himself frozen. Then things began to blur and spin till he had no sense of himself. When it finally stopped, something was not right. He could tell right away. As things came back into focus, he saw the confused look on his face. The problem was, he was not looking into a mirror. As his senses returned, he felt breasts, and a distinct absence between his legs. He looked down and he knew. Somehow, he, or, well, she, was in Marion's body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face, coming to the same conclusion from the other side, smiled and said, \"Well, well. It seems we have an interesting development now. The artifact you want seems to have some power of it's own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped, \"There was nothing in any text that even hinted at this!\" As she breathed deeply to try to control herself, Indy felt her breasts rise and fall. Hearing Marion's voice come out of her mouth as she spoke was freaking her out though. \"Quick! Grab the amulet again! We need to swap back!\" She had to beg him, but he did as she asked. Nothing changed though. After studying some notes and the amulet, she said, \"Damn! it needs to be recharged!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarion smiled, \"Okay, so how do we do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndy shook her head, \"It is tied to the Ark. The only thing that can recharge it is the Ark itself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, \"Which we don't even know where it is? So this is permanent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe panicked, \"No! Not permanent! At least, not if we find the Ark!\" She went through some notes, \"It looks like we need to go to Egypt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarion grinned, \"We? A moment ago you were refusing to take me out of here! Now you expect me to go with you? What if I choose to stay now? I can keep this place open and have a lot more respect now that you are the one who has to sit down to pee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed his hand, \"You have to go with me! That way we can fix this as soon as it is charged again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, \"I will, as long as you agree to one thing. Until we swap back, you are my girlfriend, and you will behave that way.\" Indy did not like it, but she reluctantly agreed. Marion smiled, \"Good. I will make myself comfortable here while you go back down and be a good waitress. I know you speak the lingo. When the bar is closed, lock up and come back up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had little choice. She soon found out what it was like being a single woman in this country She was grabbed, groped and fondled multiple times. Protesting was of no use, so she did not complain. She knew to do that would only escalate the problem! She had no idea before tonight, just how hard it was for a woman in this area. What she did not know is that she still had a lot to learn! It turned out that it was customary for the men there to stuff the tips inside of her blouse, lingering as their hand was against her breasts. This did not count the wad of money in a pouch inside her slacks or the small money belt she had on.</span></div></div>",

Tomorrow, she would leave the village with Marion and be that much closer to being male again. The door opened and some European men walked in. She recognized the Nazi emblem one of them was wearing. She was too tired to server more men, even if they acted more civilized toward her than the locals. \"I'm sorry. We are closed for tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strangest looking of them smiled and said, \"You don't understand Fraulein, we are not here to drink. We are looking for something that you have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings went down hill when she denied knowing what they were talking about. Soon she found herself pressed against the bar, his arm pressing into her breasts, and even worse, his crotch pressing into hers. She tried to struggle, but not only was she much weaker, but she was not used to dealing with that weakness, or the differences in height either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarion heard the disturbance, and in the fighting that ensued, Indy almost lost the amulet. Then there was a fire, and as the bar went up in flames, Marion was able to save the amulet. The Nazi's were dead or run off. She looked at Marion, \"Now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around, \"I don't know. My place is going up in flames, along with my clothes and belongings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndy sighed, \"We will have to go to where I, um, where you are staying. The family will help us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Indy was protesting what Marion had brought her, \"You don't really expect me to wear this? Don't you know what this dress says in this culture?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, \"Of course I do.\" He tossed it back to her, \"We have a long trip by foot, donkey, camel or whatever we can find. You know full well it will take us thee weeks to get to a place that has a train. You also know what can happen to a single woman on the way. Sooner or later, someone will want to kill me to take you.\" He grinned, \"Or buy you from me. That might be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned, \"Okay, that is true. But if I travel as your wife, they will also expect me to share your bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, \"You did that before and didn't seem to mind.\" He loved the way she blushed at that. Then he added, \"Besides, do you have a better idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just grabbed the dress that, in this country said she was a married woman, and went in and changed. This was humiliating. Not only did she have to squat to pee in this area without proper toilets, now she had to take on the dress of a married woman to protect her from rape or worse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she came out, Marion tried to console her a little, \"Hey! Look. I know very well how hard this must be for you. But look, when we get back to civilization, its not so bad to be a woman. Hell, its 1936! Women can vote now! They are getting real jobs, like secretaries. Who knows what is next for women?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glared at him, \"I just want to get to Egypt. Then you can tell me about the wonderful opportunities for women, when you have this body back!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On the way back, Indy got a very big lesson in what Marion had to deal with as a woman. Stopping just to take a pee was no small thing sometimes. It was hard for her to get used to being called Marion, but she knew she had to get used to it, and better when there were few around who spoke English to catch when they made a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe managed to fend Marion off each night, until one day after a slave trader inquired about wanting to buy her! The slave trader had heard, from others in the caravan, that this couple did not 'act' like they were married. The meaning of that was clear. In small tents placed closely together each night, the sounds of couples going at it was common. So out of necessity, Marion got his way. Indy did not want to admit it, but making love to Marion felt great! Of course, Marion knew exactly where to touch and how to touch it! When the time came, though the feeling of being penetrated for the first time was strange to say the least, she soon could not stop from moaning in pleasure as he drove deep inside of her! To her surprise, she enjoyed the whole thing immensely! The only drawback was Marion's cum leaking out of her afterward!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next two nights, she was the one who initiated sex. It was the one and only thing that she had found to be pleasant about a woman's body! It was Marion who slowed that down after comments from the men about how passionate his wife turned out to be. Apparently, the whole camp heard Indy when they made love!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she began to get cramps the second week, it became really  rough. She almost freaked out again when Marion told her that she was about to start her period! To say that was gross was an under statement. The only good part was that, because of her 'condition', she was allowed to ride a donkey while it lasted. She was thankful that it ended the day they arrived in a town with a hotel. She never wanted a bath more in her life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince they were still traveling as husband and wife, they were still sharing a room. That was less of a problem to her than it had been. However, when she came out from her bath, she found a European style woman's dress with a silky slip waiting for her in place of the dress she had traveled in. There were also a pair of shoes, which to her dismay, had high heels! She did not like the fact that the dress was pretty, and only accentuated her femininity, but since Marion did not leave anything else for her, she had no choice but to wear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would never admit it to Marion, but she was getting used to this. She traveled wearing a dress the last three weeks, so she did not mind the feeling of the skirt swishing around her legs, or even the bounce of her breasts, as she met him in the lobby. Learning how to walk in high heels was another story though!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarion stood up, \"Wow! I knew that dress would look good on you, but you are gorgeous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndy acted upset, \"I don't want to be gorgeous. I want to...\" She dropped her voice, \"I want to get my body back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarion grinned, \"Agreed. But while you are in that one, forgive me for appreciating your beauty.\" He was please to not a mild blush and knew that Indy was not really offended when he talked like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen wearing that kind of dress, Marion had to teach Indy to get into the habit of crossing her legs properly. She resisted that at first. That changed when Marion pointed out to her that, \"See those guys over there? They have been looking up your skirt, and as I remember, I wasn't able to find any panties for you when I bought the dress.\" She turned a deep red, and after that learned how to sit like a proper lady!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finally got to a port and boarded a ship to Egypt, Indy found new obstacles. No matter what she said, nor how intelligently she said it, nobody took her seriously. While men were very polite toward her, they would just stare at her a moment, then ignore her and continue their conversation if she tried to contribute to a discussion about science or politics. Then there was the time she was looking for Marion, but was forbidden to enter the Men's smoking lounge! The steward kept trying to direct her to the 'Ladies Tea Room' instead. It was as though, to the men, a woman was barely capable of intelligent thought!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did not know what to expect in Egypt, but the misplaced European chivalry was driving her insane! She was glad when they finally arrived.</span></div></div>",

It was hard for Indy to pretend not to know him, and worse when she was treated as less than a second class citizen. This was a muslim country, and while they tolerated the way she was dressed because she was 'European', they made her feel worse than back on the trail, and even had her wishing for the British snobbishness toward women! Some men would not even look at her so much as talk to her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were going well when they found out about the Nazi's having the wrong measurements. Against advice, she insisted on going along to one of the meetings. It was a big mistake. They were attacked, and in her female form she soon found that the methods she was used to using to fight relied on strength she no longer had. She ended up running and hiding, but in hiding in a basket, she found herself trapped and kidnapped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was roughly handled until at last she was tied to a pole in someone's tent. She was there for a while when in walked Dr. Rene' Belloq! It was a good thing she was gagged, because she had to remind herself that Marion would never have met him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knelt next to her, \"Hello Miss Ravenwood. My name is Dr. Belloq, but you may call me Rene'.\" He stroked her hair, \"I can see why Dr. Jones brought you along. It is cold in this land at night.\" He lifted her chin, \"I wish to release you from these bonds, but first, I need to tell you something. The effort to kidnap both you and Dr. Jones ended in a major failure. You see, in the effort, Dr. Jones was killed I am sorry to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had no idea of the level of shock that was behind her eyes as he told her this. Not only did that mean that Marion was dead, but that she was trapped in this body permanently! Her tears were very real as she reacted to that news! Of course, she had no idea he was lying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let that sink in a while. \"I will leave you with that thought, but I want you to understand. It was not my orders or my desire. I needed information that Dr. Jones had. I very much wanted him alive.\" He paused, \"However, you were with him for a long while now. It is possible that you have the information I need.\" He began to stroke her breast, \"If you cooperate, I could make life very pleasant for you indeed Miss Ravenwood.\" She grinned, then frowned, \"Of course, my German partners in this are not so kind. And they might choose, um, courser methods.\" With those words he stroked her pussy. As she struggled to escape this humiliation, he added, \"I must go to my work. But tonight, I will make you an offer. Give it much thought, because the Germans are only unclear on whether it would be better to make you a whore for their troops, or to sell you as a slave to the local sheik, and they say he would love to breed a white woman. And that would only be after the Germans have done whatever they feel needed to extract the information from you. Cooperate with me, and I promise a life of ease for you my dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he left, Indy was in tears. What was she to do now? With Marion dead, she would never be male again. She was forever Marion Ravenwood! And worse yet, could she even hope to endure the kind of torture commonly visited on women? She knew the Nazi's. She new that what Belloq said was not an idle threat from the Germans. What would Belloq offer though? Did it matter? As a woman, her options were very limited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Belloq did return, he did free her as promised, after showing her the men guarding the exit of course. She stood there nursing feeling back into her hands. When he saw she was somewhat recovered, he offered her a very lovely dress to wear. She did not want to put it on, just to please his eyes, but she needed to play along. If she could not take his terms, maybe she could play along until some opening presented itself. She realized that from now on, her body was the greatest weapon she had, so she put the dress on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelloq looked at Indy as she walked out. He offered her food, and she ate as gracefully as she could, managing to cover a knife that she hoped she could take later. She was thankful that Marion had a high tolerance for alcohol as Belloq made his offer later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, \"My dear Marion. There are two things you can do to prevent our German partners from having their way with you. The first of course it to tell us all you know of what Dr. Jones knew about the ark.\" He paused as he poured more liquor. \"The other is...\"</span></div></div>",

They usually had passenger cabins for some extra money.

She begged them to see her safely onto the freighter to escape the fate of a woman captured by such brutes! It was amazing to Indy how effective a woman's tears could be!

Besides, I don't mind sitting to pee anymore. Or even these.\" She touched her breasts. \"It's funny how I hardly notice them any more. Except when you are touching them of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, they noticed a distinct change in the sound of the ships engines. Before they could dress, someone was knocking on the door. \"Mrs. Belloq! Mrs. Belloq! A German sub has ordered us to stop and they are sending a boarding party!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then went away, but Marion grabbed Indy by the shoulders, holding her firmly, \"Did I hear him right? Did you call you MRS. BELLOQ!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndy began to cry, \"Yes! Yes! They told me you were dead! I thought you were dead! I only agreed to marry him so that I wouldn't be tortured by the Germans, and so that I would be close enough to him to kill him when I had the chance!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore more could be said, there was a knock again, \"Mrs. Belloq!

German soldiers came, not giving Indy a chance to dress, and took her down on deck in her slip!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got down to the deck, there was Belloq. She smiled at him, \"Rene'! You came after me!\" She tried to act happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, \"No my dear, though I would have.

And yet, now that we have the ark, it is no longer of use to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Indy could react, Belloq flicked his wrist and the medallion went flying overboard! Indy screamed and cried, \"NO!!!\" But it was too late. The splash told her that it was on its way to the bottom of the Mediterranean sea. The realization that she was now trapped forever in Marion's body was too much for her. She collapsed on the deck, and then quickly got up again, running to the rail as she lost control of the nausea that seemed to nag her constantly now, and she bent over the rail and threw up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelloq had her transferred to the sub, and she wondered where Marion was and if he knew what had just happened? She saw no point in fighting with Belloq as he made love her her on the trip. She was legally his wife after all. But when they got to the island that was their destination, she was upset that he made her come along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was flattered that Marrion, well, he was Indy now for good, came and tried to rescue her, but when she tried to run to him and everything fell apart, she found herself tied to a stone with him as Belloq and the Germans opened the ark. They kept their eyes closed, and it as good they did. There were screams, and wind and sand and it seemed terrible. When it was over, they were the only ones left alive, and their bonds were freed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the Germans that were still alive on the island realized what had happened, they were more than happy to turn the dangerous thing over to Mrs. Belloq! She got a copy of the casualty list to show that her husband was killed by an 'accident' on the island, and a death certificate from a German doctor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was when they were loading the boat that she took Indy aside and told him about what Belloq had done.

Anyhow, he smiled at her, \"I know that your mother was not there when you grew up. Maybe you would have understood some things better if she was, but maybe not since most men don't pay attention to the concerns of women.\" He stroked her hair, \"You haven't had your period since we left the mountains, but you should have had two by now. And then there is the sensitivity of your breasts you talked about when we made love, and your nausea.\" He held her arms and said, \"Marion, did you realize that you are pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face went pale and Indy had to hold her up to keep her from falling, \"I, well, are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new Indy smiled, \"Very sure. I knew it would probably happen the way we made love so often, but I was looking at it like an insurance policy for me.\" He sighed, \"I really did expect to swap back with you. I did not want to spend the next few years of my life struggling like I did, so I did not say anything. I figured that, after we were back in our right bodies, that you would offer to marry me when you knew I was pregnant from you. I figured that your time as a woman would make you a more understanding husband.\" He almost cried, \"I really never expected this. But I want you to know, I really do love you Marion, and I really want to marry you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a lot for the new Marion to take in. She felt she had to agree though. Not only was she going to be giving birth to a baby that, in a sense, she was both mother and father to, but she sure did not want to be alone as a single mother! There was the issue of being a widow to Belloq though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a port in Greece, they agreed that Marion would go settle the estate in France while Indy made cargo arrangements for the ark. She was quite surprised at what she found out! She was now a Countess, and controlled two large estates in southern France! Belloq had been as successful as he was unscrupulous, and she was now worth millions after liquidating most of the assets. She kept the estates, but had the bulk of the funds transferred to a bank in the United States. She almost didn't, but she had a bad feeling about this new leader in Germany and what it might mean for Europe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she met Indy in England, they took a ship back. They asked the captain to marry them, and it was not until they were legally married that Marion told Indy about her fortune and title. She could have easily afforded to live without him now, but she wanted him to be a father to her children. Besides, she had to admit that she really did love him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen back in the States, they bought a normal house. It was quite large, and of course had historic importance, but a house, not a mansion. The truth was, Marion was happy as a woman now, and she was glad things happened the way they did. With her wealth, she was able to acquire quite a collection of artifacts. Most of all, she realized that, for the first time in her life, she was truly happy.</span></div></div>",

Her short hair tumbled down her back, growing far beyond her swelling ass, almost to the floor, becoming a rich, golden blonde as it did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A body to match your new purpose, Miss Anderson.\" The voice on the phone was smug.</span></div></div>",

She'd never realised that nipples could be so vulnerable to pain. She covered them with her hands, even though she doubted it would provide a barrier.

She was still an incredible beauty. Her body lush and promising sex. Neo's hands went to her new tiny waist, and ran down and out to her wide hips. Sliding backwards she felt how round and full her new ass was. She'd always admired how Trinity's ass had filled her latex outfits, but now it didn't feel as alluring from the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer own bust was bigger than Trinity's too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe harshest pain came when she looked at her face. In the mirror the traces of Trinity were still clear. She was haunted by her eyes, the nose was a little smaller... a little cuter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheekbones were higher ... more defined...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, Neo thought she looked a little more feline.... more sexual...

She straightened her dress. \"This is new, but I will learn to control it. Then I will be back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still in the form of Persephone until she left the club. She felt the changes happening that were becoming familiar. A quick look in a window showed that she was back to her 'sister' look. She needed to think? She stopped in the first bar she came to. Normally, this might not have been a bad thing, but now, it was a major mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat there drinking, trying to think of what to do next, a guy came up to her. \"Hello honey.

She felt some changing, but it was only her dress turning into a tight mini-dress that showed lots of cleavage and lots of leg, with matching high heels! She said, \"Waiting for someone like you sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did not change her looks, but this guy did not want to change her into someone else, he wanted to get laid! Neo tried to fight the growing need between her legs, but this guy wanted her body, and she was getting more horny by the second! She tried to fight it, but that did not seem to matter as she walked with him to his house and went inside. Soon she was naked, and try as she might, she said what he wanted to hear and did what he wanted done without thinking. She gasped as she felt herself being penetrated for the first time, and was shocked at loosing her virginity and how tight she was. Not doubt this is what the man wanted. When it was done, she could not believe she actually had a guy's cum leaking from her pussy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was glad for the chance to go into the bathroom to go clean up. Breaking the physical contact was the only way she got some control back. When she came back out, he had dozed off, so she was able to dress and slip out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to find the Oracle and figure out what was going on! It was not easy! On the way, she bumped into a horny teenager and turned into his ideal girlfriend. It was crazy loosing her virginity a second time! After getting way from him, she almost made it, but ended up becoming another guy's Japanese girlfriend! While she was with him she loved him so much that she gladly gave him a blow-job!. It took a while to get free of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe learned that, the longer she was in one form, the more she tend to stay in that form unless enough time passed or she touched another male. So it was as a petite Japanese girl that she knocked on the Oracle's door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the Oracle opened up, she cried, \"Please!

And then you can have some control over your movements.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo got what she was saying, \"Yes, quickly with little effort, but what if that is in a direction that you don't want to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, \"You go into the river at a place above your destination. Then the river will work for you instead of against you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo looked perplexed as the Oracle walked into another room and picked up a crying baby. She said, \"How do I do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Oracle smiled, \"A step at a time. Embrace the changes.\" She handed the crying baby to Neo. Who had by now changed back to her 'sister' form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo looked confused, \"I don't get...\" As she spoke, she felt her breasts filling with milk. He mind began to focus on the need to feed this baby!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Oracle smiled, \"That's right. It is a baby boy. And he has on need on his mind now. Just don't fight it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo knew what she was telling her. Internally, she sighed, and without saying another word, she opened her blouse and undid the nursing bra she was now wearing. It felt good to feel the baby latch on and begin to suckle her breast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Oracle said, \"That is it. Allow it. Allow yourself to enjoy it, even embrace it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo did, and after a few minutes, she looked up, \"Wow! He is a hungry one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Oracle laughed, \"Yes, he is! Do you see though? You are able to talk to me now. You are not fighting the need to feed that baby, but having allowed it, you are able to focus your attention on me for now.\" She smiled, \"It will not be easy. And it will take time, but as you see, it can be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo groaned, \"So I have to go with the flow and be a slut?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Oracle frowned at her now, \"No. That may happen at times, but there are alternatives. You can find males that need help and comfort that is not sexual, or when it is, it is in love and with caring. Let yourself love them as you are letting yourself love this baby, and eventually, you will have control from the moment you change. You don't stop the feelings, you direct them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo had to think about that. When the baby was done eating and soundly asleep, she put him back down. \"Thank you. I hope I can do what you are asking.\"</span></div></div>",

Her legs were covered by fishnet stockings, and she was wearing spike heals. She could feel the thick makeup on her face, then her skin turned dark black.She looked up at the man as she was already getting horny for him! \"Notanymore!\" She slurred as she felt drunk. She tried to fight it, but she wrapped her arms around him, \"Wanna go shumware?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took her to his filthy apartment. Again, she tried to resist, but could not stop herself from stripping her clothes off quickly! After some wild sex, she lay under him, both of them panting. She was finally able to think. She focused. Don't fight it. You are a black woman. You are his girlfriend. She sighed and said, \"Sugar, I think I am sober enough to make us something to eat now. What would you like?\" She put on his large shirt like a bathrobe, and with his cum leaking from her pussy, she made them some lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were done eating, she washed the dishes and got cleaned up. He hugged and kissed him and said, \"I gotta run some errands. Keep the motor running for me!\" With that she left. She left! By not fighting who she was, she had gotten control! It worked! She walked to a different block, and she saw a guy who looked like a lonely geek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked up to him and allowed herself to rub against him. She changed again. This time to a small, mousy girl, with small breasts and thick glasses and hair tied back. She looked up at him, \"Hi! Do you like video games?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey guy was deathly shy, but she was able to get him to take her home. They had a great time playing games. Finally he kissed her, and he did fondle her breasts a little, but that was it. She thanked him for the good time and left. It was hard wearing the thick glasses, but this body was perfect! Nobody, even guys, paid much attention to her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found a place to be alone, and with some practice, she found that she could switch between all of the bodies that she had worn so far.

The truth was, she hoped Trinity would like it, but if she didn't, it would be worth it to see her reaction anyhow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when something unexpected happened. A young, dark-skinned woman was wandering around looking very lost. She was not watching where she was going as she seemed to be trying to take in what appeared to be strange sights. Neo was looking for her team, and especially Trinity, so she was not watching where she was going as well as she might. When Neo bumped into the young woman, she felt like she was being sucked out of her skin. Her head was spinning, and when it stopped, her vision cleared to see a tall, redheaded woman who seemed to be apologizing for bumping into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo things occurred to Neo as she watched the redheaded woman walk away and disappear into the crowd. First, that had been her body a few moments ago. Second, she could not understand what she was saying. She looked around. She could not read any of the signs or any writing around her! She saw two people talking and intentionally wandered close. She did not know what language they were speaking, but she could not understand a word!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, she found her way to a phone. She dialed the number to call in for an extraction. She said, \"This is Neo. I need to get out!\" But what came out was, \"Ella es Maria. \u00a1Necesito salir!\" (Note: My apologies if the translation is not accurate. I don't speak Spanish, so I used Google Translate.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a male voice on the other side, but had no idea what he was saying! She tried again, \"\u00a1Ella es Maria! Algo est\u00e1 muy mal ! S\u00e1came de aqu\u00ed ahora !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other end, the operator shook his head, \"Some girl named Maria. I don't know what she is saying, but it must be a wrong number.\" He hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo had no idea what to do now! She could not communicate with the operator! And every time she tried to say her name, it came out as Maria! As she stood on the street, a man grabbed her arm and said, \"Come on Maria! I warned you not to wander away! If you are not careful, the immigration officials with arrest you and send you back to Columbia! Now come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo was stunned! First she was able to understand the man. And sent back to Columbia? Apparently she now was speaking Spanish, and did not seem to be able to understand or read English. She was too stunned and weak to resist the man dragging her along. They got to a crowded van, where he stuffed her in with about a dozen other young women and closed the doors. She felt the van begin to move. Now what?</span></div></div>",

Even though, she knew it wouldn't help, she looked despairingly at the mobile phone in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt held a lot more hope than anything else, she had access to. Her occupation, such as it was, was clear to anyone with eyes. She wore a trench coat. On a guy, she'd have thought of it as something only a flasher would wear. At that moment it slipped off her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realised just how busty her new body was. The panel door opened with a shriek of protesting metal to reveal a leering pimp, and a couple of heavies. Or from their point of view, a bunch of new arrivals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Neo could react, one of the thugs snatched the phone from her hand. Threw it to the sidewalk, and stamped on the fragments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're here to work.\" He said, his gaze never leaving her amply exposed bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sultry and dusky is good.\" he said, his gaze sweeping over the rest of the girls. \"But a blonde will always attract.\" His coarse hands dragging through Neo's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://66.media.tumblr.com/3068792655c2fc5269afb34efbf81332/tumblr_o72ke4hb8M1u3wdwxo3_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://66.media.tumblr.com/3068792655c2f...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You probably still have them to pay off.\" he observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily, she got out the van, holding his hand like a mock-gentleman. He offered the same courtesy to the other girls, guiding them with a firm hand caressing a plump thigh, or rounded arse, until the van was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls were hugging themselves, against both the cold, and the eyes that poured over their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo tried to think of escape, if she found the right 'John', an English speaker, she could steal his phone and escape. But she was only distantly aware that she was thinking, listening and talking in Spanish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pimp was clear from his gaudy jewellery. The rings big enough to be knuckle-dusters, and the chain that was expensive enough to pawn and pay for a lawyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"200 bucks each, a night. And don't think about disappointing me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs motivational speeches went, it cut to the core. Even here, the pounding beat of the music could be felt in their bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeo looks around, this is not a good part of town. This is not a good night-club, and you don't expect anything from the police. Or at least, nothing good, beyond a demand for freebies, or the threat of a night in jail.</span></div></div>",

A featureless void, in every direction. He spared himself a smile, as his residual body image looked the same as ever. He was in plain black jeans with a long leather coat, and a pistol holstered on each hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind himself, he felt a silent explosion, and looked over his shoulder to see Trinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to her, a wave of dizziness swept over him.

The girls shifted, and bounced at the impact, drawing the man's view to her sumptuous and well-displayed bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut thankfully she merely stumbled, as much adjusting for her new curvy body, as the impact. He reached out a hand to steady her. Everything felt overwhelming, she fought to calm herself, to centre herself. The swaying of her hair was distracting, brushing against her back in a teasing, an very alien fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaming it on her new form, she dismissed the man's attempts at conversation, at concern, and tried to dismiss the lecherous git. She wasn't in the mood for this... this particular humiliation. Although, the idea of herself as the 'Woman In Red', his particular fantasy was unsettling. Especially, as she was battling her own urges, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gaze lingered, on his taut ass, as he walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cursed the high-heels of women, before looking down to see that she was wearing something more akin to sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrambling through her memories, she found her fighting skills, her instincts were gone. Desperately, she tried to take a pose in preparation for combatting agents, or just to handle any fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://66.media.tumblr.com/d1d13a13d7f2efbfeadde06c13433733/tumblr_njdx4qJh731u2k71go2_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://66.media.tumblr.com/d1d13a13d7f2e...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pose she struck, was a tease. Relaxing back into a more natural stance, she hurried over to a seat at the nearby outdoor caf\u00e9. Automatically, she swept the dress as she sat down. Only once she'd waved to the waiter, did she start to feel concerned about her feminine mannerism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just another battle.\" she told herself, \"A different style of fighting.\" she assured herself, a form of combat to be mastered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't stop her nervously chewing on the leg of her glasses as she waited for the waiter to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you recommend?\" she cooed when he walked up. His tight trousers, suggesting he was a sizeable fellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a cappuccino.\" she blurted nervously, as he opened his mouth to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter scribbled her order down, and left with the hint of a smile. He'd caught her furtive glance, and those coloured cheeks suggested she appreciated it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her head, Neo's brain was racing. Should she fight these urges, or should she find the right outlet, and the waiter would provide a tempting outlet. She certainly had the body to deliver, and her imagination raced through scenarios that suggested she'd picked up a range of implanted skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthletic skills, although their use beyond the bedroom was unlikely. She found them intriguing, arousing, and unsettling. She fought for calm, and objective reasoning. But ended up thinking of ways how this body was superior to Trinity's, in the sack, if not in a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA throaty, purr slipped loose, as she found the idea of sharing this with Trin, was making her rather wet. She squirmed in her seat, as her imagination completed the scenario. Trinity licking away at her sopping pussy, her tongue tickling, teasing, inspiring her to return the favour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found her phone in her hands, as she fought her hormones. She wasn't sure if she would call the operator for assistance, or invite Trinity to join her for a more satisfying encounter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://66.media.tumblr.com/9ba53de279e8dc897d6921a0d323ee86/tumblr_njdx4qJh731u2k71go9_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://66.media.tumblr.com/9ba53de279e8d...</a></span></div></div>",

It is so great to see you!\" Marty noticed that the professor's family was dressed in 'normal' clothing for the visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they all greeted each other, Marty looked a bit concerned, \"Uh, look Doc. It's not that I'm not glad to see you, cause I am, but, what brings you here? The last time you showed up, there was trouble in the future. Is there a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doc and his wife were looking concerned. \"I wish this was a purely social call Marty, but you are right. There is a new problem.\" He pulled out a flat tablet-looking thing, and after activating it, a three-dimensional hologram was projected showing a bunch of lines, \"You see Marty, here is where we were in the time-line when we were in the 19th century.\" He pointed, \"Now this line is the original timeline. These,\" He pointed again, \"are variations that were caused by us and Biff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty shook his head, \"It all looks like spaghetti to me Doc. Just cut to the chase. What is this telling you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doc continued. \"This is a change-wave, moving through the time line. By predicting the movement, we can see that there is a major change again in the 50's. I think you caused it by interacting with your great-great grandparents. If you don't change things soon, it will be locked in the time line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty shook his head, \"Woe! Wait Doc! What are you telling me? What does this mean to me? There is a reason you are here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoc nodded, \"According to this, Biff does something to scare off your father from pursuing the relationship with your mother. If we don't undo it, George will give up, and Biff marries your mother. That will either mean that you are never born, or you could become one of their children.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty almost fainted into a chair, \"It would be better to not exist than become a child of Biff! What does he do? How can we undo it? Do I have to travel back in time again Doc? You original machine was smashed you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoc shook his head, \"Yes, you need to go back, but not in a machine. Not like before. It is too dangerous. Every time we introduce a future person into the past, just their presence alters the time line.Biff had some kind of picture of your father that he used to blackmail him. We need to send you back to get that picture and destroy it and the negative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty's mind was blown, \"Doc! You aren't making any sense! How can I go back and undo things if I don't go back in time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doc did something with what looked like a wristwatch on his wrist, and the next thing Marty knew, he dissolved and the next thing he knew, he was standing in a very futuristic room with the Doc and his family. \"What the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoc smiled, \"Welcome to our home Marty.\" The Doc then walked over to a strange looking pod. \"This is how we send you back Marty. Using this device, we can send you back at just the right time, but instead of sending you back physically, we will be sending you back meta-physically.in a way. Not accurate, but in short, we will send you back to occupy the body of your father. You have to either get that photo, or just make sure that the wedding happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty was walking around, flailing his arms, and freaking out! \"What!?!?! You want to send me back and have me 'be' my father? And what if I fail? They got married the summer out of high school! That is not long from where we left them!\" He paused, \"And how am I supposed to act like my dad? I don't think I can pull that off! Least of all with my mom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doc nodded, \"Yes you can Marty. You won't be able to help it actually. When you are in someone's body, you will find yourself unable to vary too far from their fixed actions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty was still freaked out, \"So, how can you be sure who you are putting me in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doc said, \"Well, it can be tricky, but in this case, we lock in on DNA and we can't miss.\" He went on, \"And I will be there to help you. I can project myself to in in a hologram and interact with you.\"  (*** My apologies to Quantum Leap, but it just works for this. ***)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty said, \"Okay. So I go back, and when I have the picture and negative destroyed, you can pull me back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doc shook his head, \"Well, no. It gets into the machine and the nature of time, but we need to preset the times to make sure. In this case, our calculations say we can't pull you out until Nov 17th.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty really freaked, \"What!?!? That is four months after my parents anniversary! I gotta be my dad that long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoc said, \"Yes Marty! And you need to do it soon if you don't want Biff for dad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat choice did Marty have. \"Okay Doc. You win. I don't like it, but you are right.\" The Doc started to say something, \"Yeah, yeah. I know. Don't change the time line, just fix it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Marty was in the pod. There was a count-down, and Marty felt himself being pulled from his own body. When he was aware of being in a body again, he was in a darkened room. His arms were wrapped around someone and they were kissing. Of course, this must be his parents on a date. Since he couldn't stop it, he let himself enjoy it for a bit.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>About the same time as Marty opened his eyes, he realized that he was feeling a strange sensation on his chest. He looked, and what he saw was George McFly! How could that be? And that sensation on his chest was making him have a strange tingle between his legs. Suddenly, his confused mind put things together. He was not in the body of George McFly. He was in the body of Lorraine Baines! He was in his mother's body! Worse yet, that wonderful feeling on his chest was George rubbing his breast, and now he could tell that tingle he felt between his legs was coming from his pussy! He gasped, breaking the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge looked concerned, \"Lorraine? Did I hurt you? I didn't mean to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty realized that he was breathing heavily. There were all kinds of strange sensations flowing through his body. He felt the long hair on his head and shoulders, breasts pressed into George, with sensitive nipples pushing out, and the cool air on his legs was from wearing a skirt. Worse, the pleasant feeling between his legs was coming from having a pussy! It took Marty a few moments of heavy breathing to compose himself enough to answer George, \"Um, no. You didn't hurt me George. It's just, well, it's just that....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge pulled back and took his hand, \"I'm sorry Lorraine. You have no idea how much I want you right now. It's not easy for a man you know.\" He squeezed Marty's hand, \"Especially when he is in love with a girl like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty's head was spinning! He was supposed to be George! Not Lorraine! But now that he was in her body, he was feeling the compulsions that the Doc had mentioned. He was very, very attracted to George. And Marty could guess how much George wanted him, based on the huge lump in his crotch that had been pressed against him. What should he do? He didn't dare drive George away, but the last thing in the world that he wanted to do was make out with his own dad in his mom's body! He could tell that Lorraine's thoughts were conflicted as well. It was from them that he finally answered, \"George, it's just that, well, I want our wedding night to be special. I want to save myself for you. For that night.\" Marty felt a deep blush as he said, \"I'm not sure I can do that if we keep going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge kissed Marty with some passion, then said, \"I will respect that Lorraine. I want it to be special too. Maybe we should go for a walk to cool off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty smiled, \"I would like that. Um, just let me use the little-girl's room before we go.\" He couldn't believe that he just talked like that! It felt odd hurrying up the stairs, feeling his breast bounce and the skirt swish. In the bathroom, he hissed as quietly as he could, \"Doc! Doc! Are you there? We have a big problem!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image of the doc materialized before him and started talking, \"What's the prob... uh-oh. Marty? Why are you in Lorraine's body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty was stunned, \"YOU are asking ME? What did you do? I can't stay in this body! Bring me back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoc shook his head, \"I told you, we can't just bring you back. That time is already set. You need to complete the mission too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty was upset, \"How? If Biff blackmails George to leave Lorraine alone, I can't stop him now. As George I could have refused, but that can't happen now. What am I supposed to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doc was flustered too, \"I don't know Marty, but you will have to think of something. The wedding to you father must go on.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was so odd being in his mother's body as a teenager. And what made it worse was that damn adaptation thing Doc had told Marty about. Initially, Marty tried very hard to 'not' look at his mother's breasts and pussy. But the need for normal things like going to the bathroom and bathing quickly made that impossible. At first that was embarrassing, but what bothered Marty was that, after a while, it was starting to just be 'normal', as was wearing dresses and skirts. One thing he learned for sure. His mother really did love George. The bad part was that now, being in her body, he felt those tingles and butterflies when he was with George too! Maybe the worst of all was that he dare not fight those feelings. The last thing he wanted was for his mom to fall 'out-of-love' with George!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Marty kicked back and coasted, and tried to enjoy the ride as a female. He as also amazed as he learned other things, such as how vulnerable he felt as a girl, knowing that almost every guy around him wanted to get into his panties and make use of the pussy that he had between his legs. And being so small and weak, there would be little he could do to stop them from raping him. And while his mom really did not think beyond getting married and having a family, he witnessed many of his 'girl' friends who were laughed at for saying they wanted to be a lawyer or a math teacher. It made Marty feel very inferior as a female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty had been in Lorraine's body for just over two weeks when it happened. He had just finished doing his hair, making himself look his best for George, when there was a know on the door, and it was George. He knew this was bad. George was very punctual, but this was way early for their date. George looked concerned as he asked Marty/Lorraine to join him on the porch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty looked up at George, \"George? What is wrong? You look upset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge only briefly looked Marty in the eye, but never made eye contact after that. He said, \"I, I, well, its just that, I mean, well...\" He took a deep breath, then blurted out, \"I can't see you anymore Lorraine. This was all a big mistake. I am breaking up with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty knew this was coming. That is why he was here of course. But somehow, hearing those words through Lorraine's ears, and feeling the impact of them with her heart, was more than he could bear. He began to cry, trying to think of something to say that might get him to stop this nonsense, \"What do you mean by 'wrong'? I love you! We belong together! Don't say such things George!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge had tears in his eyes, \"I am sorry Lorraine. It is over. I can't help it. Goodbye.\" He started to walk away, then added, \"Y-y-y-you... you should, should, go out with Biff. H-h-h-he is, is, man enough for, well, for a girl like you.\" Then he ran way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty was stunned! Not only did George break up with him, but he told him to date Biff!?!?!? What the hell did Biff have on him???<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContinued attempts to talk to George after that were rejected. He would run if he saw her coming, and never answer the phone, or hang up if he heard her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty knew that he had to find out what Biff had on George, but with George being unwilling to even talk, Marty knew that there was only one way to find out. Unfortunately, he now had the body to do it. He braced himself, and then made sure to hang-out at the soda shop. He tried to pretend not to notice when Biff came in. He knew the fly would come to the honey, and Biff did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slid onto the stool next to Marty and said, \"Hey cutie. I hear that you were dumped by that idiot George McFly. That means you are available. How about I show you what dating a real man is like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty didn't want to give in too easily. It might make Biff suspicious, \"Get lost Biff. I am not in the mood right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty try not to gag as Biff reached out a hand and rubbed his back, paying special attention to the bra straps, \"Come on Lorraine. You know that you are too much woman for a guy like McFly. Once you taste the Biff, you will know the truth. Say. How about I just take you to the movie tonight? Then we will come back here for burgers and shakes afterward?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty really didn't want to, but had to. Still, he needed to play hard-to-get, \"I don't know Biff. I know that you can be nice. And you 'are' a strong, handsome man. But I don't know if I am ready yet.\" Marty wanted to throw-up saying that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiff, being himself, ignored what he didn't want to hear, \"See? You know that I am the man for you! I will pick you up at five, so be ready.\" With that he walked away with his friends, not giving Marty a chance to say 'no'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty walked home, desperately trying to thing of another way. Was there any other way to find out how Biff was blackmailing George? Any way to NOT date Biff? To NOT, and this made a shudder go up his spine, but to NOT become Biff's girlfriend? There just HAD to be another way!</span></div></div>",

George would have asked. Biff basically ordered Marty that he was going to go on the date, as if, being female, he had no choice. Then, to add to that, Biff was late, but didn't care. As Biff took his arm and walked him to the car, Marty felt very tiny and weak next to Biff, and couldn't help being afraid of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were in the theater, Biff further displayed his opinion of females. He 'took' Marty to the very back, forcing others out, and as soon as they sat down, Biff put an arm around Marty and held him tightly. Shortly after the lights went down, Biff slid a hand to Marty's breast and began to squeeze it. Marty wanted to jump up, slap Biff face, and storm out, but he couldn't do that. The only way to find the blackmail photo was to get into Biff's house, and the only way Marty could do that as Lorraine was to become Biff's girlfriend, as disgusting an option as that was.Soon, Biff was leaning over, obviously expecting to kiss. Marty reluctantly began to kiss Biff, and soon he felt a hand on his knee, which eventually slid up under his skirt.Biff must have had a lot of practice, because in spite of the feelings Marty had for Biff, the way Biff was touching 'her', 'she' was finding herself feeling pleasure. It was not like when she was with George though. This was a building sexual tension, and it felt very, very good! Before Marty knew what was happening, Biff was stroking her pussy! Marty had tried to hold onto his male self in all of this, but he couldn't do that and allow what was happening to happen, and she gasped as new sensations and pleasures coursed through her body! Sensations she never could have imagined as a male! She quietly moaned and whimpered in pleasure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long time like this, and now kissing Biff with real passion, Biff broke the kiss and said, \"Tell me that you will be my girl. Say it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty was only partly aware of what she was doing when she whispered breathlessly, \"Yes Biff, I am your girl.\" Biff rewarded her by continuing to pleasure her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the movie, Marty was humiliated at how easily Biff had manipulated her! But she was in all the way now, as Biff's girlfriend! Her face was red as they walked out and went to eat. Partly because she was embarrassed to be seen in public holding Biff's hand, announcing to the world that they were a couple, but also because of what Biff did to her. She didn't want to admit it, but she was horny! He pussy was very wet! How could this happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating, Biff did not take Marty home. Instead, he drove out to an isolated field and stopped the car. Then he looked at Marty and said, \"Okay honey. I made you feel good at the movie, and now that you are my girl, it is your turn to make me feel good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty was shocked, \"Biff! I can't! I am not that kind of girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiff slid over, \"The hell you aren't! Maybe you weren't, but you are now!\" And with that he grabbed her hair and forced her to slide onto her knees in the car, then he guided her head to be just in front of his crotch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty screamed, and said, \"No! I won'.....\" But that was all she got out before a hard hand smacked her head so hard she saw stars!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiff growled, \"You will do what I say you little bitch! You are my girl now, and my girl obeys or gets punished!\" He smacked her again, \"Now get started, and you better make it good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty was terrified! What else could she do? She began to undo his belt and pants. It was disgusting to touch his cock with her petite hands, and far more disgusting to touch her lips to it. Somehow, after a while, she was sucking at it the way Biff told her to, and he held her head in place to make sure. She felt him begin to spasm, and wanted to get away from what was coming, but he would not let her. He held her head in place as his cum shot into her mouth and poured down her throat! She cried as she swallowed his cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiff made it clear that this was her job every night, and sometimes more. Sometimes he would make her horny, but most of the time, it was all about his pleasure. She was just glad that he had not raped her. The thought of becoming pregnant with Biff's child was horrible beyond imagining. Well, except for some of those times when he had her so horny that, if he had asked her, she might have begged to have his baby!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst part was the humiliation of everyone else knowing that she was Biff's girl, and many knew exactly what that meant. Her reputation was ruined. That was not the worst part of it though. The worst part was seeing the look on the face of George McFly when he saw her with Biff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doc didn't like all of this, but Marty just replied, \"Then give me an alternative Doc! Tell me what else I can do to hope and find the photos.\" But the Doc had no better ideas.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Marty was having yet another argument with the Doc, or at least his hologram, \"You need to find another way Marty! What has happened is bad enough, but if you end up having sex with Biff, rape or otherwise, the chances of you correcting your future is almost zero!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty was frustrated, \"Do you think I don't know that Doc? Do you think I want to be, to be, be doing what I have to do for him? I hate it, but so far, I haven't been able to find where he has them hidden. Hell! I don't even know what I am looking for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoc was chastised, \"I am sorry Marty. It is just that I am worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty could hear Biff's car pulling up, \"Not as worried as I am Doc. I want my wedding day to be with George, not Biff! I gotta go for now though. Biff is here. Bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she went downstairs, rushing out to Biff, there was more that was scaring her. What made her the most frightened was that she seemed to be growing used to Biff's abuses, and little by little, she was turning into 'that kind of girl'. While she would never admit it, she was starting to enjoy giving Biff blowjobs. She was feeling secure around Biff in spite of the way he treated her or spoke to her. She had no idea why, but it was happening. Even right now, she did not need to rush to Biff. Oh, it was true that Biff did not like it when she kept him waiting, but that was not why she was rushing. She was rushing because she 'wanted' to be in his arms! She was getting worried about that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night was one of the nights that Biff got drunk with his buddies, then, taking Marty home, he wondered why the house was dark. Marty had to admit to him that her parents were away for the night. Biff smiled as he grabbed a couple of bottles of whiskey, \"Great! Let's you and I have a good time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe were soon cuddling on the couch, and Biff was doing marvelous things to Marty's body again. Being alone, Marty was moaning loudly, which pleased and excited Biff all the more as he guzzled more whiskey. He had Marty to a fever pitch, and then Marty, well trained by now, slid to her knees. But this time, Biff pulled her up, and after teasing her more, he said, \"You want me. Don't you Lorraine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moaned, \"Mmmmm.... yes Biff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, \"The whole way? You want to spread your legs for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty's pussy was soaked, and she was as horny as she could be, \"Oh yes Biff! The whole way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiff picked her up and carried her up to her bed. When he put her down, the kissed and fondled each other as they undressed each other! Marty know she can't do this, she must NOT do this! But she also couldn't stop herself! They kissed naked, in bed together, when suddenly, Marty noticed that Biff was not kissing her back anymore. In fact, he was doing nothing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty pulled back and realized that Biff had passed out! It was a testimony of how far gone she was when she desperately tried to wake him up! He wouldn't wake up for anything though! Now what was she to do? He as leaning on her, but not too much, which was lucky for her. She was able to push him on his back. If he had been on top of her, she might have been stuck like that all night. She saw his naked cock, and considered giving him a blowjob. As she was getting more calmed down though, she thought to herself, \"Isn't this just great. I finally am ready to give him my virginity, and he passes out on MY bed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something struck her. My bed. MY bed! MY BED! This is my room! Suddenly inspired, she spent the next fifteen minutes trying to wake Biff, but he was out cold! She hurried to put on her robe, and ran downstairs praying for something. Sure enough, her dad had left his camera and a roll of film! She loaded the film and hurried back upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next two hours, she managed to dress Biff in bra and panties, with and without makeup. Even in a skirt, and a half-slip and camisole. Taking pictures the whole time! When she was done, she cleaned him up and put things away. Then she got dressed and braced herself for what she hoped would be a good performance. If she was a good enough actress, this would work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slapped Biff around and when he was beginning to become aware, the threw a cold glass of water into his face, He bubbled angrily, \"What the hell? You trying to drown me girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty looked terrified, \"Oh Biff! Wake up! My parents came home early! If he catches you in my room, he will shoot you fore sure!\" She shook him, \"Hurry! you gotta get out of here before the come into the house! Quick! Take the back steps!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiff was still confused, which was good, but he understood enough to know it would be bad to be caught by Lorraine's dad in her bedroom. He fumbled with his pants enough to get them on to where he could walk in them, and grabbing the rest of his clothes, he stumbled out the back way in a hurry. Marty turned on lights to make it look like her parents came home, but she didn't breath easier until she heard the rumble of Biff's car pulling away. Part of her hoped he would be okay, but another part hoped that he would run into a light pole<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next part of her plan was to run to George's house with the film from the camera. She knocked on the door, praying that he was home. At last, the door opened....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Unfortunately for Marty, in the fifties, it was not unusual for it to take a week to get back pictures from the photo store. In that time, to avoid loosing her virginity, she became a very adept cock-sucker for Biff. Worse than that, she could no longer deny enjoying it! Thankfully, when the photos did come back, they were everything she had hoped for!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and George used those photos to blackmail Biff into handing over all copies, and the negatives, of the pictures he had been using to blackmail George. It turned out that they were photos of him being a peeping tom, up in the tree, using binoculars to watch Lorraine undress. They kept some of the photos of Biff as insurance, but otherwise, that was the last they had to do with Biff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lorraine, Marty soon got the couple back on track to get married. Soon, she was in love with George, and unlike what had happened before, she frequently gave him blow jobs. Why not? She had come to enjoy doing it for Biff, so why not do it for the man she loved?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they graduated from high school, George asked her to marry him, and she gleefully accepted. Marty learned how complicated it could get for a girl to plan her wedding, but she enjoyed that too. Before long, she was feeling strange as she was walking down the isle of their church, in a wedding dress, in her mother's body, and marrying her own dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, as a reward for all of her months of effort, she got to experience the honeymoon, and found sex as a female absolutely incredible! Of course, she had nothing to compare it too, since, before all of this time- travel stuff had happened, she had been hoping to loose her virginity, as Marty of course, to Jennifer. However, sex with George was great! And soon, she was pregnant with her oldest brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the time she was forced to spend in her mothers body was up, and she would not need to go through the whole pregnancy. (Though she loved getting there!) One morning, she felt herself being pulled from her body, and soon, she was back in 1985!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty looked down at himself. He was surprised that his own body now felt odd. He had grown so used to being female that he actually missed his breasts, and having a cock seemed, well, a bit strange at best. He hoped these feelings would fade soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doc looked at him. \"The time-line has been restored! You did it Marty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty sighed, \"I hope so Doc. I have had enough time travel to last me for the rest of my life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doc agreed. \"It is odd how much of a focal point in history the events around your family are in that time period.\" Then the Doc looked at something and gasped, \"Oh my!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty groaned, \"NOW WHAT? Don't tell me that there is a new problem!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doc shook his head, \"No! In fact, the opposite. Whatever you did, it caused an increase in the peace index, and mankind makes some incredible advances in science that were not there before. This time-sync viewer is showing many improvements in the time line. Incredible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty smiled, \"Great Doc. Now I think that I will go get some rest.\" He stood up and started walking, but stumbled and had to catch himself. Something felt off with his feet. He looked down, and not only were his feet much, much smaller, but he was wearing pink sneakers! He said, \"Um.... Doc!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoc looked down and gasped, \"Great Caesar's ghost! How did you feet shrink?\" The Doc went to his equipment and began checking many things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the Doc was done, Marty's lower legs had become much thinner and very smooth, as though they had been shaved. Marty was getting scared, \"What is going on Doc?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doc shook his head, \"Well Marty, it seems that, in the process of making sure that you got married when you were your mom, you also changed her sexual habits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty pointed down, \"So what does that have to do with THIS?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doc looked nervous, \"Well, um, you see Marty, I believe that, because she did some things differently...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty was getting mad, \"Spit it out Doc!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoc sighed, \"Historically, you were still conceived, but it seems that, because of the change in your parents sexual activities, it was a different sperm that fertilized the egg.\" He paused, but the look on Marty's face made him continue, \"It is the male's sperm that determines the gender of the child. So in this time line....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty finished his sentence, \"I was born a girl?\" The changes had moved up his thighs, and he noticed that he was already much shorter than the the Doc. More than even before. \"What can we do?\"</span></div></div>",

The best we can do is for me to start researching for a potential solution. Until then, you will have to live as a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty sighed as he felt his manhood disappear and his hips flare out, \"Wow! I just got 'back' to being male. Doc, I had forgotten what it was like! I haven't even had a chance to try standing up to pee again! You gotta fix this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doc put his hand on 'her' shoulder, \"I promise you that I will Marty. Try to be patient. As soon as the change is complete, we will see what all has changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't take very long. Soon, where Marty had been, was not a downright beautiful teenage girl, about 5'1\" tall with long hair to the middle of her back. She looked up at Doc, \"Now what do I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doc looked around, and then seemed to see what he was looking for, \"There! That purse must be yours. Look through it and see what it tells us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty did so. The first thing that she found was a wallet with her driver's license. \"Linda Karen Mc Fly? How can I be Linda? That is my sister!\" He opened the wallet and found a family picture and gasped, Instead of having a brother and a sister, she now had two older brothers! And the second brother looked a lot like the male Marty, but not exactly. He was taller, and probably a bit sexier. \"What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doc said, \"It is like I said, Different sperm. So your sister was born a boy and you were born a girl. So they named you Linda and him Marty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda/Marty rolled her eyes, \"Just great! Not only am I a girl, but I am the only girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoc looked at Linda/Marty, \"Look, you might as well go home for now. You can learn about who you are now and what has changed. I will call you when I know something more. There is nothing you can do here for now anyhow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda/Marty looked annoyed, but she knew that what he was saying was true. \"Okay, you are right. I should start getting ready to..... SHIT!\" She saw the shocked look on the Doc's face, \"Don't you dare say a young lady should talk like that or I will hit you! Doc! I was supposed to go on a camping trip with the gang this weekend! With Jennifer! What about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doc shrugged, \"There is no reason to assume that you are still not going. Perhaps not with Jennifer, unless you are lesbians of course, but if not, then a girl as attractive as you must have a boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda/Marty looked shocked, \"A lesbian? A boyfriend? I don't know if I could handle either right now Doc!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe patted her shoulder, \"You will be fine no matter what. You are very resourceful. Now please go home so I can focus on getting Marty back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't argue with that! So she left Doc's house. She was frustrated that, walking as a girl didn't feel odd at all. In truth, being male for the brief time that she was is what had felt odd. If it wasn't for the fact that she knew she wasn't supposed to be female, she might have not even worried about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, when she got home, her brother 'Marty' was there. He smiled at her and said, \"Hey Squirt!\" I thought that you would be getting ready for camping this weekend? Where were you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged, \"I am about to. I was at the Doc's\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, \"The two of you don't have something going do you? Paul might get jealous you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe punched him and it almost hurt her hand!  \"Don't say things like that! The Doc is a nice man! Better than my brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe backed off, \"Just kidding Sis. You know that. So, are you nervous about spending the weekend in a tent with Paul?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda/Marty was stunned. Paul? That was, um, had been one of Marty's best friends. So that answered that question. Apparently she was not gay, and Paul was now her boyfriend. She blushed deeply, but didn't answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new Marty said, \"Sorry again Sis. It is none of my business. If he does anything to you though, remember, your big brothers will take care of him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda/Marty blushed, \"Don't worry Bro. I can take care of myself.\" With that, she rushed to what was now 'her' room. Indeed, it was feminine, with a makeup table and vanity. Then, while going through everything, she made a discovery that gave her a lot to think about. Apparently, she was on the pill. Mary, her new brother, even seemed to assume that she was going on the trip for sex anyhow. Hell, as Marty, that is what she had hoped would happen with Jennifer! But could she really make love to her friend Paul?</span></div></div>",

As he hopped off, he found it was an ocarina lying on the ground, similar in colour to the one he received from Saria. However, this one seemed to give off a faint glow, as if by magic. He picked it up and wiped the mouthpiece on his tunic to clean it off. It seemed in good condition, so he wondered why someone would just leave it there. He decided to play a song to try it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Link know, when he played a song on that ocarina, it would transform his body into whoever he thought of when he played a song.

Link felt her organs changing and try to hold on to his penis but it disappears leaving only a shaved virgin vagina. Link grabs and feel her new part and moans but Her voice is new a very feminine voice and suddenly a flood of female hormones flow through his entire body and brain. Her hips then widens and curve up and her butt starts getting bigger jiggly to match her big hips. Then she loses all her body hair and her thighs start getting bigger to match her big butt Which made her tunic rise up a little higher.. Her legs get longer slim and curve up and her tunic to raise up with it now being so short that you can see all of her thighs and almost see her butt. her feet get more feminine but don\u2019t really decrease in size that much. His bottom half of his body was completely female. And he was now 5\u20191 foot tall and now her waists start contracting and your torso got very curvy until your now an hourglass figure and the skin on your torso and bottom half is very soft. Then link starts growing boobs they kept growing until she had huge  H cup Breasts. Link\u2019s new nipples were hard and pointed through his tunic (as link didn\u2019t wear any underwear including obviously  a bra) and lucky they fit in his tunic even tho it was stretched and all her buttons were popped out   On her chest showing of her cleavage a bit and showing off her new belly. Link reached inside and rubbed and pinched his new nipples and he let out and very girly and feminine moan and all he could manage to say is \u201cso soft\u201d. Then his arms and hand got very smooth slender and soft and any muscles link had from before was gone and her Frame got smaller and her shoulder got smaller . Finally his head got a bit smaller and lips got bigger and her eyes got a whole lot cuter and bigger and her eyelashes got longer. Her skin was flawless, smooth and soft. Then her hair got longer not as long as Zelda was came down to her shoulders and it pushed of her hood but before she could pick it up a headband grow oh her head and a little bit of her hair came through covering one of her eyes and the hood came back on to her head. After the Flood of hormones Link felt so weird and off balance and curvy and he looked into the puddle and he sees this reflection (not 100% Accurate) <br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4c/12/28/4c12281c2c9af13bb5bd18cbaa7404e8.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4c/12/28/...</a><br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/8f370868-f9b7-409a-9d8a-b88e5e86df0b/daxipi6-f5781ca0-55c3-4d34-a124-1799ee4cb752.jpg/v1/fill/w_1024,h_1229,q_75,strp/female_link__legend_of_zelda__by_lukeschillart666_daxipi6-fullview.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7ImhlaWdodCI6Ijw9MTIyOSIsInBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcLzhmMzcwODY4LWY5YjctNDA5YS05ZDhhLWI4OGU1ZTg2ZGYwYlwvZGF4aXBpNi1mNTc4MWNhMC01NWMzLTRkMzQtYTEyNC0xNzk5ZWU0Y2I3NTIuanBnIiwid2lkdGgiOiI8PTEwMjQifV1dLCJhdWQiOlsidXJuOnNlcnZpY2U6aW1hZ2Uub3BlcmF0aW9ucyJdfQ.SW47upR2NNbQTdWs2ZndUNedPRySq-5-tIRkeapBpDg\" target=\"_blank\">https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773...</a> <br>\r\nLink is horrified and majora laughs attack him and say \u201cwell don\u2019t you Just look great I think I will keep you that way\u201d he say as he floats off.

Infiltratiting Gerudo bases was beyond difficult, with their strict regiment and watchful eyes. But still.

He let out a scream as his body contorted into new, unfamiliar territory. Dekus and Zoras were at least close to the size he was familiar with and while transforming into a Goron was wildly different, he still wasn't prepared for this. Hips burst outward, waists concave, and mounds of flesh jutted forward. The other changes went by too quickly for Link to catalog them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dizziness passed and Link took stock. He was tall, but not as tall as a Goron. His tanned skin was soft and smooth. Not as smooth as a Zora, but naturally smooth. Yet there was muscle there, suggesting years of Gerudo training. The clothes were flimsier than what he was used to, yet supported his new body. He'd never had a body this thin and.. Well, not with parts like these. His new cleavage heaved naturally from its support. His hair was longer and redder now than ever, tied into a ponytail with what used to be his hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was a Gerudo woman.

The moon grinned down at them from high in the sky as Link walked through Termina field towards Romani Ranch, his fairy buzzing about his head. She pestered him constantly with questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we going, Link? Aren't we done with the ranch? We already rescued your horse, didn't we? Link, are you even listening to me?! We have to go rescue my brother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink ignored her. He didn't <i>have</i> to do anything, and if he did he certainly didn't have to do it now. There was no rush. The world would always be there, waiting to be saved. Even if it was destroyed. He had already failed once, even been killed several times, but every time the world of Termina reset and he found himself stepping out from the wooden doors of the clock tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had decided to take this cycle off. To enjoy himself. He had earned it. He'd spent more cycles than he could remember running hither and thither, risking life and limb for the citizens of Termina, and for what? No matter how many he helped or how many times he helped them, they never remembered and indeed it was almost as though he had never helped them at all once time reset itself. All he had to show for his efforts were the contents of the bomber's journal. It was rather demoralising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would spend the cycle enjoying himself. The beauty of the situation, he had realised, was that he could do anything, anything at all, no matter how wild or destructive or depraved, and it would be consequence free. All he need do is play his ocarina and it would never have happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust one cycle. The skullkid would wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some thinking, he had chosen to spend his time on Romani Ranch, concealed beneath the Romani Mask, given the five star treatment beneath the soft, caring hands of the beautiful Cremia and her sister. As he neared the edge of the Ranch, his excitement grew. Eagerly he pulled the cow head mask over his own.</span></div></div>",

AAAAAH!\", which echoed around the quiet, early morning ranch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thighs and biceps were expanding before his eyes, tearing the green tunic as they grew. His spine and hips cracked and shifted, forcing him from his two-legged gait onto his hands and knees like an animal. His ears grew into large, floppy bovine ears, knocking his hat from his head. Watching through the pain, he saw his fingers shortening and merging into one another, the fingernails spreading over the surface to form a tough hoof. His skin was thickening into a tough hide and becoming mottled with splotches of white and black. A sharp pain in his ass announced the arrival of a long cow's tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arggh!.... Ngghmmmuh! Muuuh muuooooh!\" he bellowed as his face grew out into a short snout, short white hair bristling from his skin. Looking down the length of his nose, he saw an iron nose ring appear out of thin air, piercing his septum. A heavy iron bell formed about his neck with a soft jingle-jangle while his tattered clothing evaporated from his body like morning dew. \"MOO!\" he bellowed in alarm as the legendary Master Sword and the Ocarina of Time vanished from existence, along with every other piece of his equipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a strange warmth in his member. It shifted on his body, sliding upwards onto his belly. He felt a wave of pleasure as his testicles ballooned into an udder heavy and swollen with milk, while his shaft split into four soft pink teats aching for the release of the milkmaid's touch. A cow vagina sprang into being beneath his tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis transformation finished by filling out the rest of his physique into the muscular form of a healthy dairy cow. He took a tentative step forward. The soft earth squelched delightfully beneath his hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTatl buzzed about his nose in panic. \"Link! What are you doing! We need to rescue my brothaaarrrggh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy spasmed, her magical glow snuffing out in an instant as she was caught in the magic of the mask. A large, hairy, black stable fly sat on his nose in her place, buzzing its wings angrily. Link huffed, flicking his head to dislodge the annoying ex-fairy from his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe insect orbited around his head as he plodded his way towards the Ranch. For the next three days, he was looking forward to five-star treatment without a care in the world. He could barely contain his excitement at the thought of Cremia's hands on his teats.</span></div></div>",

It was the first time his companion had been included as part of one of the masks' transformations but it made a pleasant change from her hiding under his hat, whispering useless advice into his ear. He flicked his cow tail at her as she passed by his meaty flanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis new bovine body was slow and cumbersome, but he felt in no rush as he plodded across the field towards the ranch. The grass smelled sweet and fresh in his nostrils. In the distance, the Ranch door opened and Cremia stepped out, whistling a tune to herself as she walked to the barn, a metal pail in her hand. It was milking time. Link had a feeling he would enjoy that. His udders were painfully full to bursting, so swollen that they rubbed against his calves with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis bell jingle-jangled as he walked. Reaching the barn, he could smell the strong, earthy smell of the other cows, comforting to him somehow. He nuzzled open the barn door and stepped through. Inside was warm with the heat of the other animals. There was fresh golden straw on the floor and a stall standing empty for him. Luxury!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCremia was sat on a small wooden stool, milking one of the cows. Her lustrous red hair shone in the morning sun streaming through the skylight. She glanced up as Link entered, her brow furrowing. \"Now how did you get out?\" she tutted to herself. She rose and crossed over to him, running her hands gently down his flanks. \"How odd. I don't recognize you but you're certainly a Romani-bred cow. And quite a specimen too,\" she mussed, caressing the cow's strong muscles. \"Oh, you poor thing! You haven't been milked in days!\" she exclaimed upon seeing his udder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking him firmly by the nose ring, Link found himself being lead into the empty stall. Taking a length of rope, she tied the nose ring to the wall. Any alarm he might have felt at being restrained in such a manner was instantly washed away as she began to milk him. Link mood in delight as her experienced fingers gripped his teats, squeezing and pulling on them rhythmically, sending squirts of milk into the bucket beneath him and tingles of orgasmic pleasure through him with every tug. The ache in his udders subsided while his euphoria built.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt a little seedy to be using the farm girl in this way but he felt he had earned such a break, having saved her and her farm on more than one occasion, even if the timeline had since reset. Besides, what happens in a timeline, stays in a timeline. In a few days, the cycle would reset and he would go back to his old body and his heroic human life, and resume the quest to save Termina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCremia squeezed the last drop from him and lifted the overflowing bucket filled with his milk. Slopping much of it onto the floor, she lugged it with both arms to the door. Link felt strangely proud at having produced so much, yet now that she had stopped he felt empty and a little frustrated. Her ministrations had brought him close but never completely to orgasm. Furthermore, he was still tied to the wall. Soon Cremia returned and moved on to the other cows, milking each in turn, before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time dragged on, his boredom rose. The stall was too small for him to move around in and the rope tying him to the wall was too short for him to even sit down. He huffed in annoyance through his large nostrils. Tatl settled on the stall wall, watching him with her multi-faceted eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard the barn door cream. Cremia had returned. He twisted his head and was curious to see her leading the largest bull he had ever seen towards his stall. It was as tall as a man, obscenely muscled and covered with black-green hair, with a ridge of red-brown hair running down its spine. A huge pair of vicious horns adorned its skull. In many ways it reminded Link of Ganondorf's animal form, which he had fought atop the ruins of his castle. A terrifying thought filled him - there were many people in Termina who were the counterparts of people in the Hyrule, though often altered in some way. It stood to reason that Ganondorf might have a doppelganger here too. Could this huge bull be the Termina counterpart to his arch nemesis?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bull was being lead closer, the monstrous penis swinging back and forth between its legs with every heavy hoofbeat. It snorted loudly, breathing in his scent. Link trembled, staring in horror as the giant dick began to rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Triforce give me courage,</i> he shuddered, as the bull reared onto his back, its terrible weight pressing on him, the giant animal penetrating his virgin pussy. He mooed in dismay as his helpless body stretched about the massive member. This couldn't be happening. After everything he had done, all his heroism, all the people he had saved, to now be reduced to a breeding heifer, a mate for a filthy animal. The shame of it. The bull began to thrust into him, bellowing in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Three days and this never happened,</i> Link thought to himself, repeating it. <i>Three days and this will never have happened.</i> Yet Tatl would remember. The fly still sat on the wall, watching in amusement as the bull disgorged a large load of hot semen into his hole. Link moaned as the warmth filled him.</span></div></div>",

Link entered the castle, and went to Zelda's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Link!\" Zelda said as Link entered the room. She was holding what looked to be an ancient book in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Link replied. \"What's that book you're holding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a spell book. Apparently, this has hundreds of old magic spells in it, and I just found the spell that Cole used to separate my spirit from my body. I'm gonna try it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? That sounds kinda dangerous, especially what happened after Cole had used that spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. I'm just gonna test it out for a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Link could say another word, Zelda recited the spell from the book. After she said it, however, a dark purple orb flew out of the book and started bouncing around the room. Before they could react, however, the orb hit Link and pushed what appeared to be his spirit out of his body, and then it flew back from impact straight into Zelda, knocking her unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Link woke up. \"Urgh...\" Link placed his palm on his now aching head as he started to get off of the ground. However, he realized that groan he just let out didn't sound like him, but like Zelda. As soon as he noticed this, he saw long, blonde hair in front of his face. Link jumped back in shock, but lost his balance due to what appeared to be heels he was wearing on his feet as he then fell onto the ground, where managed to fall on his behind and sat down. Link looked down at himself, and noticed he was wearing Zelda's dress, and had what appeared to be breasts on his chest. Looking forward, he saw his own body lying on the ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please, PLEASE no!\" Link worried as he got up and walked towards a mirror hanging on the wall. As he stared at it, he saw Zelda staring back at him, copying all of his movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I possessed Zelda...?\" Link was (rightfully) confused, wondering what exactly happened when Zelda used that spell that sent him into her body. Whatever happened, this was the result. Link immediately wanted to find a way to turn back to normal, but thought about what it could be like ruling over Hyrule, even if it were for a little while. He had a nice body to go with it, too. Zelda's body would definitely look nice in whatever outfit he would wear while in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill Link try to find a way to turn back to normal, or will he stay in Zelda's body for a while?</span></div></div>",

Her mind was cast back to summer days, with stick in hand, playing out the role of a brave hero among the castle grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zelda!\" Impa's bark brought her back to horrible reality.

A tiny speck of green caught her eye as they raced over the moat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe forest boy! It was just like in her dream. Well, not <i>exactly</i> like in her dream. In her dream, she hadn't been a man. But close enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuick as a flash, she twisted in the saddle, hurling the Ocarina. The priceless antique flew through the rain, sailed over the fairy boy's head, and landed with a plop in the castle moat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still throw like a girl,\" Zelda said sadly, turning back in her saddle and resting her head glumly on Impa's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind that,\" Ima replied. \"Let us just hope he retrieves it and uses it to enter the Temple of Time before Ganondorf does.\" Her gaze remained fixed ahead on the collection of buildings on the horizon towards which they galloped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if he doesn't?\" Zelda asked sadly. \"What if Ganondorf gets there first, like in my dream?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you may have to wear your disguise a little longer than planned,\" Impa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat brightened the once-Princess a little. She was enjoying her new body, hoping to get a chance to test the strength in her new muscles. Although if she had one complaint, her new body was not a natural born rider. Try as she might, it sat in the saddle like a sack of potatos, cumbersome and awkward, lacking the infinite poise and balance she had found came so easy as a Princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse laboured on through the thick mud that Hyrule field was rapidly becoming, tiring quickly. Zelda wrapped her arms around Impa as the exhausted stallion almost threw her from the stallion. Her hands searched for purchase on the warrior's rain-slick metal breastplate, eventually finding it on her magnificent, jutting breasts. Shivering, she slid closer in the saddle, hoping her embrace offered Impa some of the same comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpa gasped a little as the cold, wet Princess pressed herself closer, obviously seeking the warmth of her body. She felt the Princess' new crotch, aroused by the rhythmic sway of the horse, pressing hard against her backside, squeezing into her arsecrack. When they dismounted, they were going to have a<i> very</i> long talk.</span></div></div>",

Recovering after a blazing, eruptive battle with Blaine, the Cinnabar gym leader, Misty and Brock are relaxing with their pokemon in the sun. But Ash has other plans in mind!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on guys! Let's get going to Viridian City!\" Ash whines, still dressed in his sneakers, signature blue jeans, jacket, and trademark Pokemon League baseball cap. His shadow looms over Misty, who tips her sunglasses down the bridge of her nose and frowns at the boy interrupting her tan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the rush, Ash? We can't leave the island today anyways. The next ship destined for Viridian doesn't leave until tomorrow!\" She replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aspiring pokemon master groans. \"Awww! How am I supposed to train out here on the beach with all these tourists around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty sits up and straightens out her red hair, which she untied to let roll down past her shoulders for once. The occasional sea spray keeping her hair damp and full. She is wearing her favourite bikini today, a two-piece number she bought while shopping in Celadon City. Sifting through her backpack lying next to her beach chair, she offers, \"You can train with Starmie if you'd like. With your Squirtle, they make a pretty good sparring duo!\" She giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's more like it!\" Ash cries, twisting his baseball cap backwards and reaching into his belt for a miniaturized pokeball. \"Go, Squirtle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, the red light emanating from the pokeball materializes into Squirtle, the baby blue turtle pokemon. Misty sends her Starmie out, and they begin trading punches (or kicks, depending on your view of Starmie's starfish-like appendages) in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right! How about you, Brock?\" Ash looks over to an empty beach chair next to Misty, its towel rustled up and slightly sandy. \"Brock?\" Scanning the horizon for signs of their other friend, they eventually locate the young man. Gobsmacked over an Officer Jenny patrolling the boardwalk nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeartshapes dancing around Brock's octagonal head, he blushes a brighter red than a Magikarp and drools at Jenny. \"Ooooh! Are you the Jenny of Cinnabar Island?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes I am!\" Officer Jenny replies matter-of-factly, not paying much attention to Brock as she keeps her eyes on the beachgoers. She is straddling her motorcycle at the moment, with Brock standing in her way. She adjusts her cap and replies, \"How did you know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock slobbers, \"Oh, I've seen the Jenny in Lavender Town and you're way way WAY prettier than her by far! There's no comparison whatsoever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny's lips curve into a faint smile, trying not to let Brock's compliment go to her head too much. \"Aww, thank you! She's my cousin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Brock can say any more, he lurches backward and yelps in pain. Misty is pinching his ears and begins dragging him back to his beach chair. \"Can't you see they're all the same! Stupid boys...\" She grumbles, not listening to Brock's pleading of how this Jenny is so much different and better than the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Officer Jenny!\" Ash approaches and waves at her. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chaaa!\" Pikachu, always by Ash's side, pit-pats over and bobs its ears up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cute little thing!\" Jenny says, dismounting from her motorcycle to kneel down and pet Pikachu on the head. \"It's always good to see trainers here on Cinnabar! Your Pikachu looks pretty strong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pi-kachu pi pi...\" Pikachu closes its eyes as it enjoys being petted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh laughs. \"Yep! But it was my Charizard who helped me win this!\" He shows Jenny the inside of his jacket. Sown on the inside hem are seven gym badges, the newest one being the ruby-red Volcanobadge gleaming in the hot sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a Volcanobadge!\" Jenny exclaims and congratulates Ash. She rubs her chin with a gloved hand. \"You know, I can't be everywhere on the island at once. I'm sure you wouldn't mind looking out for suspicious activity, would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suspicious activity?\" Probes Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. We're on high alert for suspicious individuals we've heard are prowling around the island. Eyewitnesses say they're members of the notorious gang Team Rocket! There are three of them, so be on the lookout!\" Jenny explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three of them,\" Repeats Ash. His eyes flash in a moment of clarity. \"Would one of them happen to be a Meowth by chance? And the other two about this tall,\" He raises his hands above his head, \"And the man has purple-ish hair, the woman has long maroon hair?\" Ash imitating his long-time rivals from Team Rocket. Jessie, James, and the English-speaking pokemon, Meowth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny places her hands on her hips. \"Well, I'm impressed! How do you know so much about these individuals?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh laughs, \"Oh, them? They've been trying to steal Pikachu for months! They're complete losers, you'll have no trouble stopping them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles, getting back onto her motorcycle and revving the engine. \"Thanks for the tip, kid! In the mean time, let me know if you see them!\" She notices a skateboarder passing her recklessly on the road. Crying out, \"Hey! Walking only on the boardwalk! Come back here!\" Jenny speeds away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's not easy living for everybody!\" Ash chuckles, placing his hands behind his head in typical anime-pose and walking back to the beach. \"Maybe a few hours at the beach won't hurt. Plus, I think we've earned it after winning that badge! Whattya say, Pikachu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pika-Chu!\" Pikachu chirps, now wearing mini-sunglasses and holding a tiny glass of orange soda with a straw and a plastic umbrella.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

On the wall behind him are portraits of the previous five owners of the Cinnabar Laboratory, a rich, plexiglass facility overlooking the island bluffs on the sleepy, northern side of the island. Not having expected guests, Professor Westwood was caught completely by surprise when a Weezing burst through the glass doors and flooded the room with noxious gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gas having dissipated, he refocused his bifocals on a trio standing before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who... who... who are you people?\" He stammers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I 'tink 'dat's our cue!\" The smallest of them, a feline-looking pokemon, snickered. Suddenly, a dramatic fanfare started playing from seemingly nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one, a woman with long, magenta hair flared out at the end into a small spiral, thrust out her chest revealing the prominent red \"R\" on the top of her uniform. She lifted one booted heel into the air in a coquettish fashion and flicked a 'peace' sign. \"Prepare for trouble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second one clasped a rose in his hand and flashed a menacing grin, smoothing his lavender hair which parted into a fringe in the center. \"Make it double!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To protect the world from devastation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To unite all peoples within our nation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To denounce the evils of truth and love!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To extend our reach to the stars above...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessie!\" Proclaimed the magenta-haired woman. Her eyes sparkling in a brilliant and evil sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"James.\" Rejoined the lavender-haired man. Gazing over at the frightened professor with an uncaring glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Team Rocket, blast off at the speed of light!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surrender now, or prepare to fight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the pokemon, a common Meowth with an uncommonly nefarious demeanor, its charm flashing as it points a clawed paw toward the professor, sprung forward between its two human compatriots. The Brooklynite accent immediately noticeable about the Meowth's amazing human-like cadence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmeowth, 'dat's right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor Westwood dives beneath his desk and waves a white flag of surrender. \"Please! Don't hurt me! I'm too young to die!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly old fool, we're gangsters not murderers!\" Jessie snorts indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who does he think we are, anyway?\" Asks James.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares?\" Interjects Meowth. \"He's gunna give up without a fight! Heh! Dis is too easy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you whatever you want, just leave me in peace...\" Westwood mumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what we like to hear.\" Jessie says, then striding forward to place her fists on his desk, she adds, \"We're not interested in your crummy pokemon! You don't have anything rare that we want anyways. But... we want to access your invention room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-you can't do that!\" Stammers Westwood. \"All of my proprietary technology is in there! Most of it is still in the testing phase! Why, if I let just anyone take whatever was in there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can... and you will.\" Jessie replies. \"Unless you want another mouthful of smog from Weezing, you'll give us what we want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWestwood realises that he is outnumbered and outgunned. Reluctantly, he shows Team Rocket his invention room. They gag and tie him up, before making off with a large sack full of whatever pieces of technology they could apply their five-finger discount towards. Laughing to themselves at all the expensive gadgetry they made off with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiding inside a drainage pipe below the laboratory, Team Rocket sifts through their stolen goods with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at all these doohickeys, ooooh! How complicated.\" James laughs, rotating and tilting what looks like a remote controller in front of his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what this 'ting does, but it's so shiny I love it!\" Meowth's paws roam around a golden disc about as large as a milk saucer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gimme those!\" Jessie snatches the items out of her comrades' clutches. \"Who knows what you boneheads would do with these things!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do with them? I thought we were going to sell them?\" James asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You idiot! <i>Of course</i> we'll sell them... but first I wanna see what these things can do.\" Answers Jessie. \"Maybe we can use them to boost our pokemon's powers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then my Weezing will be the scourge of environmentalists everywhere!\" James beamed, his starry-eyed vision of a Godzilla-sized Weezing rampaging through Cinnabar Island playing through his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And my Arbok will finally capture Ash's Pikachu!\" Says Jessie, envisioning Giovanni, the boss of all Rockets, bestowing upon her lavish praise and rewards as she hands over a hog-tied Pikachu. Receiving all the credit, of course, as her Arbok then captures the rest of those pesky twerps' pokemon one by one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what are we waiting for? Let's try dese out!\" Suggests Meowth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho should we follow next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The pokechange was snatched. A fist the size of his head slammed his body, splattering him against the wall of the lab, spraying him over the tables of equipment.

He craned his head back as far as his quadrupedal stance and bulb would allow him, but could still only barely look the giant Venusaur in the eye. He shivered slightly in the deep shadow cast upon him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVenusaur glowered down at him. It sniffed the air. A thick vine emerged from its humongous flower and prodded the Ivysaur roughly.

With a shrug, he threw the pokeball down and a swirl of red energy coalesced into the form of a Nidoking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was large for its species and an imposing presence in the limited confines of the lab. A purple slab of armoured muscle rippling with thick spikes, sharp teeth, and finished on top with a foot-long spike of bone that protruded from its skull. It's barrel chest swelled with bands of muscle that bunched as it turned, slowly, to stare at Ash. It's tail, Oak noted with some intimidation, was as thick around at its base as her own torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nidoking looked Ash up and down, before giving a dismissive snort from its nostrils.

Oak looked down at himself. His body was a picture of soft female flesh - a considerable rack; smooth, bare midriff and waist leading down into wide hips wrapped in the smallest pair of shorts; and long, shapely legs inside knee-high blue boots. His dainty female fingers were clothed in thick aviator-style gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTopping it off, everything from the neck up was all silvery-haired, unshaven Oak.

That Squirtle you saw was in fact my grandson and your good friend, Gary.

As you can see, the transformation was perfect enough to fool even you,\" he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh gaped at the flopping, spasming Magicarp that had been a squirtle and before that, his long time rival Gary Oak. It didn't suprise him that Gary would go to such lengths to beat him, though it astonished him that he'd had no incling that it had been anything other than a squirtle. His open mouth of astonishment matched the magicarps gesperate gasping fish mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That reminds me!\" Oak said suddenly, flicking a switch. A robotic arm extended, lifted the suffocating fish between metal fingers, and deposited it in a waiting tank of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, as I said before, would you like to try it out?\" Oak inquired.</span></div></div>",

Finally he was ready and with an order of 'Ditto, use morph!' the process began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ditto moved quicker than he anticapated, almost making him jump as it leapt forward, wrapping itself around his ankles. Tendrils of warm purple goo coiled around his legs, worming their way upwards over his thighs. He laughed at the tickling sensation as the ditto's body slid under his hands, around his crotch, up over his torso. Explorative offshoots of goop quickly gained purchase by wrapping over his shoulders and under his armpits, allowing the ditto to shift its mass upwards, rapidly enveloping his upper torso and head.

His fingers, toes, arms, legs, and head were all smushed into his torso, while the tendrils inside him pierced his organs and worked to break down his organs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt as if the ditto was shrinking him too, draining away his mass and some part of his identity as it worked. He remembered being Ash, pokemon trainer, but no longer remembered with crystal clarity what it had been like to own arms and legs. He felt very... ditto-ish. Indeed, as the ditto slipped from his body, the first word that escaped his lips was 'ditto'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blinked in the bright light. the cage around him loomed over him.

However since this is merely a demonstration, I'll transform you back now. Ditto, use morph!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh gave a terrified yelp of 'ditto' as the larger ditto flowed over him, engulfing him. Inside the belly of the beast, he felt the weight of it pressing down on him much more than before, and felt a fear he had never felt before - that this creature might choose to simply absorb him into itself. He was sure it was possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't be silly, he assured himself. In a few moments I'll be Ash, pokemon trainer, once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time he felt relief as the ditto tendril poked testingly against his ditto ips, now the only orifice he had left, and he willingly opened his mouth wide to allow the ditto inside him, to further the transformation back to human. The tendril pushed his mouth apart as it flowed inside his semi-liquid body. It seemed to grow thicker and thicker as more of the professor's ditto forced itself into his body. To his alarm, he felt his body distending to accomodate the amount of the other ditto's body inside him. And still it flowed inside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to close his mouth to halt the flow of gunk into him, but the other ditto was stronger. Soon, Ash could feel more of the ditto inside him than was outside him. His body felt bloated and pained by the pokemon moving around inside. He tried to make a noise but his mouth was full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the tables were turned. The last of the other ditto slipped between his ditto mouth, leaving Ash as the liquid skin held taut over the other's body. Oak, watching all this occuring between the two dittos and unable to perceive the difference between the two, saw none of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh, now completely filled with the other ditto, opened his mouth to ask what was going on. He was unable to speak, not even ditto words. Something forced its way out of his mouth. He watched, horrified, as a human hand emerged from inside him. At the same time, he felt the liquid ditto inside him solidifying into a solid body around which his ditto self was forced to conform. Elbows, knees, a dick - all poked him from within. Another arm emerged from his mouth, followed by a head...<i> his</i> head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doppelganger of Ash Kethum emerged fully from the warm pile of slime that had once been the real thing. It looked down at the puddle of purple goo around its ankles in disgust, before plucking Ash's beloved hat from where it lay on the floor of the cage and settling it onto its thick, black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was great, Professor!\" it exclaimed, a dark glint going unnoticed in its - or rather his- eye, as he stepped out of the cage. \"Although I think it tired your ditto out,\" he added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's odd, it usually has no problems transforming,\" Oak muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the other ditto leave the cage in his body, Ash felt too exhausted to even keep his body together let alone move. He felt drained, quite literally -  the other ditto had stolen even more of his mass in its transformation into his human body, and the experience of being stretched out had left Ash as a thin pool of gunk on the cage floor. But he managed to extend one thin tendril from his body, groping with it desperately towards the door of the cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doppelganger ditto quickly slammed the cage door closed on the tendril. \"I think it's trying to escape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it does that often,\" Oak nodded. \"It <i>is</i> a very clever ditto. Some day it might even succeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ditto smiled its human lips as it pulled on human clothes.</span></div></div>",

The ball snapped shut and began to shake violently back-and-forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA droplet of sweat trickled down the ditto's forehead as the pokeball wobbled and thrashed. Would the device hold? Pokeballs had never been designed to hold humans, albeit ones transformed so perfectly into pokemon as to fool even a pokedex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe need not have worried. The struggles of the trainer within grew less and less as the ball's programming took effect, sapping the will to fight from the entity within, turning it into little more than an animal enslaved to its master's command. The ditto shuddered as he remembered how he himself had fought against the conditioning, how it had taken all his willpower to avoid succumbing completely to Professor Oak's command. But it had been worth it, now that he was a free human! As he pulled on his pants, his new fingers toyed over the pokeballs embedded in the belt. <i>His</i> pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOak seemed puzzled as he moved to recover the captured Ash but shrughed as he scooped up and minimized the ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has a lot of fight in it, Professor,\" the ditto said, heaving a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. A very talented creature, but hard to tame.

You drive it into the flesh of your left arm; near instantly the skin of your hand and arm begins to swell into hideous red blisters. To your horror, the blisters burst, releasing not puss, but wasps. Deformed red wasps swarm out of the holes in your skin and scurry over your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door slides open and a splicer charges at you, screaming and drooling like a mad dog. She vaults the desk with her butcher's knife already swinging down at your head. You fall back, dodging it, automatically raising your left hand to protect yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wasps fly from your hand in a dark swarm. The woman's screams become choked gasps as the insects flow into her mouth and burrow into her eyes, ears, and nose. She stops screaming. Her arms and legs sag as the muscle beneath is consumed. Her body folds in on itself, as the half-eaten bones snap like brittle twigs. Soon the woman is just a pile of skin. The empty shell undulates grotesquely as the bloated wasps crawl from her openings and dying within seconds upon the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told yer it wouldn't be pretty,\" Atlas remarks. \"That plasmid makes skinsuits. Makes 'em out of people. Go ahead, put her on. If yer lucky the other splicers'll leave you alone. If not... well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwatching a woman being eaten alive you feel ready to be sick. But the empty skinsuit has been made; nothing will undo that. and it would be a waste not to use it.</span></div></div>",

It's heavier than you expect; still coated in a layer of blood and perspiration, you note nauseously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGingerly you place your hands inside her mouth. To your suprise, the inside is not bloody, wet and raw. It has been sealed by some sort of fast-drying fluid secreted from the wasps mouths, giving the inside a dry and soft, but still wierdly organic internal lining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull the mouth a little wider; the skin stretches with remarkably little resistance. Sliding one naked leg into the opening and down into the leg, the skinsuit seems to cling tightly to your thigh. Still warm. Gross. It's like sitting on a warm toilet seat. Taken up to eleven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlide in the other leg. You pause to examine your body below the waist; shapely, feminine if not exactly slim. It seems the wasps left the subcutaneous fat around the thighs and ass relatively untouched and the extra padding masks your male contours. The tattered bloody remains of a nylon stocking still clings to one of the skinsuit legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's the sound of breaking glass outside and shuffling footsteps. Hurriedly you pull the skin up over your torso, sliding your hands into the skinsuits hands, and finally stretching the gaping mouth up over the back of your head. Her facial features slide smoothly into yours like a mask. You peer out through her empty eye sockets, breathe through her lips. The shuffling grows closer. You can be squicked out later, but for now...</span></div></div>",

The nozzle leapt out of his hands, planting itself firmly inside Peach's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to scream as the powerful suction sucked her in from the inside-out, but her lungs were the first to go, followed swiftly by her organs, bones, and muscle - all pulled down the pipe and squashed into the storage backpack of the Poltergust 3000, a mangled mess of still-conscious body parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess!\" Luigi gasped, as the Princess, what was left of her anyway, collapsed like a deflated balloon inside her clothes. He hit the off switch on the now-heavy Poltergust. Hurrying to the intert pile of fabric and flesh, he pulled the empty skinsuit of Peach out from the folds of her dress.</span></div></div>",

If it could work once, it could work again right? The skin could (heaven forbid) serve as a costume until he had the time to sort things out and fix it all. He just had to fool Mario until he had time alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuigi had to move fast, Mario would be here any moment. Wasting no time for second thoughts, the green plumber stripped down and tossed his clothes under the princess's bed. He reached for the Peach skin and choked a sob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh a-Princess...Please forgive me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no zipper or hole in the back, meaning the only way to put on the skin was the same way all Peach's insides came out. Through the mouth. Thankfully, by some sick fortune, the skin was stretchy and flexible like elastic. Luigi had no trouble prying open Peach's gaping maw so that he could fit both his legs inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom an outsider's perspective, the scene would have almost been comical. A flattened eyeless Peach would have appeared to be swallowing up poor Luigi whole. Luigi had no time to think of such thoughts, however. He began to pull up the skin so that it began to cover most of his awkward form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it didn't quite fit over his body, he couldn't help but enjoy the soft creamy feeling of Peach's skin as it clamped down tightly against his. He was a bit taller than Peach and had a heavier frame, though not quite as heavy as his brother's. And by the time he pulled the face of the suit over his own- golden hair still attached to it like a wig -he looked like a naked Peach who had lost all of her womanly assets and binged on cake for the last few months. It was going to have to do, Luigi only prayed Mario couldn't tell the difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA door came at the door. \"Princess? Are you a-in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuigi cleared his throat, trying to do his best Peach impression as possible though it came out somewhat hoarse. \"Just a minute Mario, I'm changing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'ma mia.\" Replied Mario, blushing on the other side of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting the dress on wasn't that difficult after putting on the suit, Luigi had plenty of experience with it already. He even put on the lacy gloves, stockings, and underwear though most of it was too small for him. Placing the tiara on top of his head, Luigi got a look at himself in the mirror. Peach's pretty face was there, except she had a large bulbous nose instead much like his own. Good as it was going to get. With a heavy sigh, Luigi opened the door and prayed Mario wouldn't notice.</span></div></div>",

Bowser, king of all Koopas, was sulking on his throne, a full month after his last defeat and foiling of kidnapping Princess Peach. It had been an elaborate plan as well, Bowser had pulled out all the stops. A distraction in the Mushroom Kingdom's Castle, raiding the magical stars, reviving the painting worlds before enlisting the help of many of his other allies. But once again the red plumber had smashed his way through all obstacles, grabbed Bowser by the tail, and sent the Koopa King flying off into a lava lake once more. And here Bowser sat, scowling and alone, the lava burns slowly healing. Just like the last time. And the time before that. And the time before that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery. Single. Time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear to Bowser he was going about it the wrong way. The blunt force method was no longer an option, they either saw him coming and got too prepared for it to work, or Mario just smashed his way to the Princess. No, it was time for a different way. Stealthier. Sneakier. A way that got him into the Mushroom Kingdom and close to Peach with anyone realizing it. But Bowser was, admitingly, a rather large reptile. The ground shook when he walked and his brightly colored scales and shell made him stand out like a Yellow Yoshi in Donut Land. There was no way that Bowser would ever be able to able to pull off a stealthy infiltration as he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was why, in the last week after pulling himself out of the lava, gone about finding the smartest Koopas in his kingdom and tasking them to finding a way to make him look different. It had taken some time, but results were expected today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if summoned by his thoughts, the massive red doors at the far end of Bowser's throne room swung open, and a single Koopa Troopa in a white lab coat came hustling in as fast as it's little legs could carry it. After crossing the huge throne room, the Koopa finally stopped before Bowser's throne, where the turtle collapsed out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Bowser growled, refusing to give the underling a chance to rest. There would be no rest while Peach remained in her castle and Bowser remained alone. \"Have you done what I asked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guh\" The Koopa Troopa gasped as it pushed itself up off the floor, \"Y-yes, sire. Puh-Please follow me!\" The lab-coated turtle then turned and headed back the way it had entered. Bowser glared at the Troopa's backside for a moment before rising out of his throne and stomping along behind it, just close enough to intimidate the much smaller creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of silent walking through the halls of his castle, the lab Koopa and Bowser entered the small laboratory that held the newly formed 'Koopa Kingdom Research and Development Division', essentially a spare dungeon that had been rapidly converted for scientific purposes. On one of the three tables were various items; one was entirely mechanical, strange devices that lay in a pile of loose parts. Another was a maze of glass and vials of glowing liquid, while another was covered in a variety of magical items from across the world. Not that he trusted these Koopas to figure out anything that his sorcerer, Kaemk, hadn't already failed to discover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord Bowser\" The lab Koopa intoned, pointing to each table with a stubby clawed hand, \"Each of these tables contains a multitude of items that will aide in your quest to infiltrate the Mushroom Kingdom. They will change you from your current, majestic form to sometihng that would arose less suspicion. They await your choosing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser merely swatted the lab Koopa out of the way as he lurched further into the room, staring at each of the three tables intensely as he made his choice.</span></div></div>",

Upon reaching the table and gesturing to the entire assembly, the Koopa said \"Please keep in mind that, because of the short time table, these potions have yet to be fully tested. There may be some adverse effects\"\" The Koopa Troopa picked up a rack of green potions, holding them out to Bowser, \"These potions will change your form, disguising you a native of the Mushroom Kingdom!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Koopa set the green rack down before picking up a rack of red potions. \"These will change you into an object.

Once out of impatience, the other because the potion itself tasted like bitter, sweaty Chomp Chomp breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UGH!\" Bowser groaned, but then he felt the power flowing through him as his body began to tingle, the changes beginning.</span></div></div>",

He turned and began stomping towards the chamber exit before suddenly his entire body felt as if it was catching on fire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAHROAAAAAAAAR\" Bowser, well, roared, spewing a wall of fire out as he fell to his knees in agony, eyes clenched shut in pain. He felt something inside him move, then something else, and something else! The pain was simply too much and Bowser, king of all Koopas, passed out. The lab-Koopa, it's cowardly instincts kicking in, tossed it's clipboard into the air and scuttled out of the room as fast as it could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't conscious for any of the changes. His skeleton shrinking as it lost mass, his scales draping over his body like a tent for mere seconds before it too began to change. The muscles began to constrict around his smaller skeleton, most of the muscles mass fading away into soft fat that pooled on his chest and rear. The scales covering his body began to merge with one another as his formerly colorful body began to turn lighter. His face reshaped itself as it lost it's saurian features, becoming more mammalian. His eye sockets cracked and shifted as they shrank in size, tears pouring out of his eyes as they shrank as well, their internal structure snapping apart and forming back together as their color changed to deep blue pools. His much smaller head extended away as his neck grew in length, narrowing as his voicebox shifted and contorted. His shoulders slimmed and rounded as his back curved outward, then inward dramatically, shoving the twin masses of fat on Bowser's chest outward. The massive spiked shell shimmered as it too morphed, shrinking and curving until it fit perfectly against Bowser's new spine structure as the spikes shrank lengthwise but grew in width, now only a handful covering the new shell. His hands, once incredibly large shrank down, slimming as his fingers split apart into five smaller ones as his claws thinned and narrowed. His powerful legs slimmed as well, leaving two powerful yet delicate looking legs as his feet shrank and reformed into those of a human. His tail, once short, club-like and powerful grew outwards, shrinking in overall width as it gained length and dexterity, twitching on it's own accord as the nerve endings running through it fired off uncontrollably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser's mane of fiery red hair at it exploded in length, running everywhere as it doubled in length and size as it became fuller, lusher, brighter as blonde hair chased the red to the very tips of his new luscious locks. His horns shrank and repositioned themselves as well, losing most of their curve as they shrank to just above Bowser's new hair. Last but not least, Bowser's male anatomy melted away as a very feminine slit appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the changes ceased, all that was left of Bowser was a large breasted Koopa version of Princess Peach, laying unconscious on the cold stones of Bowser's castle, draped in large, spike covered leather bands that lay comically over the /very/ female body he now possessed. Several minutes passed before the coldness of the stone floor seeped far enough into Bowser's changed body to rouse him back to consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAHHH\" Bowser screamed, jerking himself upwards and finding himself horribly tangled in the spiky bindings he had worn just a few moments ago. \"AAAAAHHH!\" Bowser screamed again, confused by the high pitched sound of his own voice and how weak he felt, staring down at how changed his body was. He had expected to to look different, but to /feel/ so different scared the Koopa King. After a moment of being comically tangled, the newly female Bowser managed to extricate himself from the ruins of his wardrobe and pull himself to his feet, admiring at how complete the process was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...It worked!\" He, she screamed in triumph, and then covered her much smaller ears in pain as her new voice echoed off the high walls and ceiling of her castle. After the echo faded away, she released her ears slowly, feeling them out with her new, much smaller fingers before sliding them through her voluminous hair, before running them across the mountainous breasts that now dominated her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing!\" She whispered to herself, but just as she was about to call her plan a complete success, she felt a painful twinge in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...NOOOOOO!\" She screamed as the pain returned in full as her body began to swell and change, her breasts caving in as fat was redistributed into muscle, the burning pain as her skeleton began to lengthen once more, the intense itchiness as her fair, unmarred skin began to devolve back into individual scales. It was too much, and Bowser feel to her knees once more as the pain overtook her brain and forced it to sleep as the massive reversion to her body commenced in full. Bowser's sex reverted as his male genitalia sprouted from the female slit, his fingers and feet swelling as bones merged back together. His skull cracking apart frighteningly as it grew once more into a saurian snarl as the shell on his back swelled to it's former deadly prominence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the reversion was complete, and Bowser lay there, sprawled on the castle floor for nearly an hour before a wandering Goomba bumped into him, causing his eyes to snap open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GRAROOOOOAAAARRR!\" Bowser once again roared, rearing up and letting loose a column of fire, the Goomba wisely waddling away as fast as it could of it's two stubby feet as Bowser slowly picked himself up off the floor of the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...It worked! But it needs to be longer!\" Bowser snarled, gazing back down at his natural body in disgust.\"What's the use of changing bodies if it doesn't last more than a few minutes!? And the pain! The unacceptable pain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser stomped back over to the potions, the lab-Koopa nowhere to be seen as the various chemicals bubbled and sizzled away in their vials. Bowser ignored most of them, searching and finding the flask that held the glowing green potion that he had ingested earlier, prompting his change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...\" he growled, picking the entire flask up and swirling it's contents, small crackles of magical energy popping from the liquid's surface within, \"How can we make you work...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could go to his court sorcerer Kamek. Perhaps some additional magic would make the potion work? Or maybe the dose he drank simply wasn't enough, perhaps Bowser had to consume the entire potion in order to make it last longer. Or maybe if he combined the potion with another one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser was, admittingly, not much of a scientist, but he was prepared to take the chance in order to defeat MArio once and for all.</span></div></div>",

He could easily down the remaining potion, or try his hand at alchemy himself, but the Koopa king knew better than to risk it. He was a ruler, a fighter, he did not have the scientific knowledge to try his hand at changing the spell to make it last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he knew someone who could. Cradling the large flask in both of his huge claw tipped hands, Bowser made his way out of the lab and through the castle, Goombas and Koopa Troopas scattering before him for their own safety. Eventually Bowser made it to the tower where the Koopa Court's sorcerer, Kamek, resided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll fix the potion. Or else\" Bowser growled as he pushed open the heavy wooden door and made his way up the long, spiral set of steps, eventually stepping up into the magical reptile's study, which was adorned with all manner of strange items and novelties. Kamek himself was asleep on a hammock that was held aloft by two of his numerous floating broomsticks, his large blue cap pulled down over his eyes and beak as he snored loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHEM!\" Bowser said loudly, and tried not to chuckle too heartily as the much smaller Koopa jerked upright in surprise, unbalancing the floating hammock and tumbling to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who dares!?\" KAmek snarled as he extricated himself from the floor, but his angry demeanour changed the instant he saw Bowser looming over him. \"Oh! Oh, my lord Bowser! What a pleasant surprise! I was...um, just testing out a new type of broomstick when I must have, uh, accidentally cast a sleep spell on myself!\" Kamek dusted off his blue robe and straightened his cap before shuffling over to a massively overcrowded desk and grabbing his magical wand. \"What can I do for you today, my lord?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser rolled his eyes as he carefully set the glowing green potion on the tower floor. Kamek immediately waddled over and peered into it's contents, the flask reflecting off the Magikoopa's goggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This potion will allow me to transform into a disguise that I will use to infiltrate the Mushroom Kingdom and finally defeat it and that cursed plumber once and for all!\" Bowser boomed, his voice shaking the small chamber of novelties and magical items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why have you not consumed it and gone about your plan?\" Kamek asked, giving the flask a gentle shake and analyzing the sparks of magic that frothed within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it only lasts for a few moments before I change back into my glorious self!\" Bowser flexed an enormous arm for Kamek, who seemed unimpressed. Bowser frowned and ceased flexing, crossing his arms together and staring at the magikoopa, \"So I command you to make the potion last longer. Forever, if need be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forever, my lord? Surely you jest\" Kamek scoffed, frowning up at Bowser, \"But when would you change back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's plenty of other potions, plus the new lab-Koopas can make more of this, if need be. You can help them\" Bowser growled, losing his patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose I could most likely create the effect you desire...But I'd have to brew up a entire new potion from scratch. Those lab-Koopas you brought on, they're unskilled in the magic arts, I'm surprised it worked at all! I will need a week, at best, to make what you need\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Bowser roared as he reached forward and grabbed Kamek by the scruff of his robe, \"NO MORE WAITING. FIX IT OW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! At once my lord!\" The much smaller Koopa screamed, trying his best to sink into his robe and shell, \"Just don't stomp me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser dropped his sorcerer to the floor and grinned, \"That's more like it. So, how do you plan on fixing it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamek coughed and dusted himself off once more as he regained his composure, tapping his goggles with his wand as he struggled to come up with an idea to please his master. Re-creating the potion was the safest bet, but that would take time, and Bowser lacked the patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" Kamek said, pacing around his study. Tanooki suit leaves hung dryly on the wall, a frog suit folded up in the corner, different Koopa sheels in various stages of dissection, a go-kart engine floating on a small cloud of magical geometric shapes. He stopped to admire a Super Mushroom, one that he was planning on trying to fuse with a super star to combine the ffects of both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCombine the effects of both...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHA!\" Kamek yelped, grabbing the mushroom and racing back over to the potion flask, \"My lord, what does the potion turn you into?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser felt his cheeks grow red as he remembered the feeling of massive breasts swinging from his chest. He couldn't tell Kamek what it did. \"It, um, changes me into a human!\" The Koopa King muttered, but that was all Kamek needed to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Well, if we combine the semi-permanent effects of a super mushroom...\" Kamek took the large mushroom, whose eyes almost appeared to be eyeing the potion nervously, \"And combine them with the potion...\" Kamek ripped the super mushroom's stem off and tossed it into the potion, cackling with glee as the stem melted away instantly, turning the potion yellow before shuffling off towards a collection of random items with the mushroom cap. After a moment of sifting through the collection of what Bowser took to be junk, Kamek pulled out a small golden crown, with eyes of it's own staring blank ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if we combine this with the crown\" Kamek shoved the mushroom cap into the crown's interior and waved his wand at it, a low WOOP WOOP WOOP resonating through the chamber as he fused the two items together. \"Ahh, perfect! Now all we have to do is...\" Kamek raced back to Bowser and the flask, trying comically to lift the glass container despite the fact it was almost as large as the mage himself. After a moment of furious grunting, Kamek staggered back and pointed at the flask with a dull claw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, if you would help, my lord?\" The magikoopa asked, giving Bowser a sheepish looked. Bowser merely rolled his eyes and picked the flask up, staring at Kamek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, good good!\" Kamek squealed, setting the fused crown on the floor of the chamber, \"Now my lord, please pour the potion onto the crown!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this will make it do what I want?\" Bowser grumbled, tipping the flask over so that the potion began pouring out. The two Koopas stepped back to avoid any splashes, but the crown seemed to absorb the yellow liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! You see my lord, potions are edible, they fade through the body as your body processes it. But as we all know, costume items only fade when they are removed via blunt force. So by combining the super mushroom with the crown, we made it a costume, and by letting the mushroom absorb the potion, the effects of the potion will now last forever! Or until something hits you hard enough. But yes, FOREVER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remnants of the potion trickled from the empty flask an onto the crown, which began to glow for a moment before turning inanimate once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there you have it, my lord Bowser, your disguise is ready! A rather ingenious solution, if I do say so mysel-\" Kamek boasted, but was interrupted as Bowser let loose a roar of triumph and swiped the crown from the floor, knocking the magikoopa backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FINALLY! MY MASTER PLAN IS FUFILLED!\" Bowser roared, and placed the crown on top of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POOF*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there, in a matter of painless seconds, stood the incredibly buxom beauty that Bowser had been before, massive breasts swaying gently, magnificent rear and tail sticking out from beneath an elegant form fitting shell, red tipped golden locks flowing almost to the floor, and slim fingers sliding up and down their new body with ease. The only difference was that now, Bowser was fully clothed, a long black dress, a dark reflection of Princess Peach's, flowed outwards as heavy blue gems accented the outfit, Bowser's signature spiked leather bindings and chokers fitting securely around his slender neck and wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My...My lord!?\" Kamek said, before fainting from surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowser...or rather, Bowsette grinned, a single fanged tooth sliding over supple lips as he...she felt the power of her new form course through her, this time for good.</span></div></div>",

She fired portal after portal into the walls, but none took purchase and even if they had, they would only lead her back into the cube. She was trapped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon it became impossible to stand. She found herself forced into a crouch, then a huddled ball as the walls closed in on all sides.

The operational end of the portal device dug painfully into her flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was light as a laser beam cut a perfectly heart=shaped chunk from the centre of each wall,  giving her a moment's breath before they were all plugged with heart-shaped pieces of rose-tinted glass. The laser arms sealed the glass to the metal and then scoured down the edges of her tiny cube prison, melting the metal together, sealing her in for good.

He could barely open his eyes; they refused to focus on the stark white roof overhead. He was laid out; though he could barely feel the table beneath him. Arms were too weak to lift their own weight; legs... he couldn't feel his legs at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to take a breath; it gurgled in his burnt lungs like a death rattle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My God, Miranda, I think he's waking up,\" a man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit, Wilson. He's not ready yet! Give him the sedative.\" A woman entered his vision. She stared down at him with sympathy. \"Shepard, don't try to move. Just try to stay calm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not ready <i>yet</i>?\" the man scoffed. \"There's no way we can repair <i>this</i> sort of damage. Heart-rate's still climbing. Stat's are pushing into the red zone. It's not working!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another sedative! Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an almighty effort, Shepard was finally able to will movement into his body.

No, instead staring back at him was the woman he had seen when he woke before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis Alliance special forces training took over and he grabbed the black Onyx Armor with orange stripes from the locker - only to realize it was a woman's model.<br>\r\nAnd suddenly a horrifying realization ran through his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...\" Shepard brought out puzzled, just to realize it was not his voice either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly he looked down and saw two globes of flesh sitting on his, or rather her, chest.<br>\r\n\"No time to explain, suit up. Now!\" Shepard heard the man's voice barking an order at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so he, or rather she, did. Luckily, men and women's battle armor were designed equally, so Shepard had no trouble getting it on, except from the unused feeling of the weights on her chest getting pressed into the armor's front cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pistol lay beneath the armour. She grabbed it. After all the confusion it seemed reassuring to hold. Only...<br>\r\n\"This pistol misses something!\" she said as she found out that part of it was gone.<br>\r\n\"Crap... You need to find and insert a thermal clip into it. But not now, get into cover, those canisters in front of the door are going to explode!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA canister near the door was venting gas. Shepard dived behind an upturned table just as it exploded. The door slid open. Vaulting over the table, Shepard sprinted through the smoke and out the door. A thermal clip lay discarded on the floor. Slamming it into the pistol, she felt it come alive again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fire. Death. Blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were the first thoughts on Shepard's mind as he awoke. He remembered the Normandy crashing, an unknown foe having attacked. But...he wasn't dead. He looked around, as realized he was in a lab. There were scientists are around him, looking at him. A woman in a tight white jumpsuit came up to him, frowning. She was curves in all the right places, and if he was in a different situation, Shepard might have been interested in learning more about her. \"Hello, Commander Shepard. Can you hear me?\" Her voice had a light Australian accent to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he didn't feel so tired, the commander would have rolled his eyes to the comment. \"Yes, I can. My hearing works fine.\" Something seemed off about his voice, but he couldn't quite tell what it was. His whole body was numb. He gave a look around the room, and noticed that everyone was shocked, staring at him. Shepard scowled and asked the gorgeous woman closed to him, \"Why are you all looking at me like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat time, Shepard was sure his voice sounded different. Higher pitched, maybe. The woman was the only one looking him in the eyes, and she answered with, \"Commander, what is the last thing you remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hurt to think about, but Shepard replied anyway. \"The Normandy was attacked by an unknown ship, and...I thought I had died trying to get everyone out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You almost did,\" she said. \"Your body was damaged beyond repair, and we were frankly amazed to find that you still had a faint pulse. We tried to keep you in stabilized condition, to heal you. But even the most advanced medical minds in the galaxy were at their wit's end. Then your body started to succumb to it's wounds, and we were left with only one choice: Operation Jericho.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat set off alarm bells for Shepard. \"What is that? What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of answering, all the woman said was, \"You should be able to walk, so you should stand up and look into that mirror on the wall. It's better if you saw for yourself, rather than having us explain it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard was scared, but he still complied with her request. Standing was difficult, but he managed it anyway. Trying his best to fight through the numbness engulfing his body, Shepard walked over to the mirror, one slow step at a time, and froze when he saw his reflection. Instead of the tall, muscular man he'd always seen before, the mirror showed him a tall asari. Her skin was a teal that was more green than blue, and the hospital gown she wore did little cover her athletic build and large breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat...was him. He turned to stare at the woman he'd been talking to, anger coursing through his body. \"What did you do to me?!\" It was only now that he noticed somewhere in the back of his mind that this was why his voice had sounded different: it was the breathy contralto of an asari maiden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman in the jumpsuit seemed unphased by his rage. \"Operation Jericho was a worst case scenario. As your own body was damaged beyond repair, we managed to copy your mind and transfer it into a new one. The lifespan, natural biotics, and galactic reputation of the asari made it the best choice for a new body. I do not know much about the brain-dead asari we used, but we made sure to get one whose height was as close as possible to your own, so minimize difficulties when transitioning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than anything else in the world, Shepard wanted to lash out. To use his biotics to destroy this place, attack these people. They had violated every sanctity he had, and yet she stood there like it was nothing. Instead, Shepard did his best to put aside his anger and be more rational about this. \"Could I please get your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question seemed to surprise her. \"Miranda Lawson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the name of this organization?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cerberus, but you must know...\" Shepard raised an open palm, and Miranda stopped talking. He didn't have the patience to debate ethics on this right now, he would save that for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only had one more question for her. \"Are you in charge here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda shook her head. \"No. We have a unique communication device in the next room, out that door, and it is linked with Cerberus's leader. You can talk with hi-\" before she had finished talking, Shepard stood up and walked out the room, not even glancing back at the scientists still standing there. The next room was small, and circular. As Shepard stepped into the circle, a hologram of a man smoking a cigarette appeared, and he turned to look Shepard in the eyes. Cerberus's leader had robotic blue eyes, and the look of a man nearing the end of his prime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hint of a smile played across the man's lips, and he said, \"I assume you have some questions for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly one, Shepard thought. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question seemed to confuse the man. \"Commander, you were humanity's best and brightest. Sure, you didn't always play nice with us, but we have a bad reputation. The Reapers are coming, and we both know that. The ship that destroyed the Normandy was a Collector vessel, and we have reason to think they work for the Reapers. Your old squad survived, but they've moved on without you. This base is on Illium, and whatever you do from here is up to you. I have official Alliance documents saying that you are in fact Commander Shepard, and that the change in body was due to a mysterious biotic event, possibly related to the Collector ship. You already have you Spectre status back. I'm called the Illusive Man, and you will not hear from me again. Good day, Commander.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hologram disappeared, and Shepard heard the sound of a door opening behind him. It was Miranda, obviously wondering what to do now. He turned to her and told her, \"Get me some clothes, I have to go see...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the car sped towards the area where Liara's business was, Shepard had time to think. His body had lost that numbing quality, and now he was really struck by how different his body was. He'd always had short hair, so the new cartilage fringes weren't that much of a change, but everything else...His chest felt a lot heavier, and it was even clearer now just how voluptuous his new body was. He felt about as strong as before, yet sitting in the car allowed him to feel how soft his butt was now. And his genitals...from what he was aware an Asari's sex organs were almost identical to a human female's, but while it wasn't alien in that way, it was still very alien to him, a previous man. He'd even briefly wondered if he should change pronouns, as he now looked much more like a woman than a man. Then again, Liara had always made a point to tell him that Asari were a monogendered race, so really either pronoun could apply to him. Considering he'd grown up a man, he felt that the male pronouns still worked just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he knew it, he was standing outside of the information broking firm that Liara ran. He steeled himself, then entered. He'd been given a hotel room by Cerberus, as well as a new ship. Out of his new set of clothes, Shepard had chose to meat Liara in Asari battle armor. He'd always been the most comfortable when in armor. Liara sat at a desk, and briefly looked up from her omni-tool's hologram long enough to meet his eyes. \"Hello, how my I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took nearly an hour, but Shepard managed to convince her he was telling the truth. He'd had to show her all the evidence Cerberus had forged, but eventually she relented. There was tension between them: before the mission on Ilos, the two had slept together. It had been a moment of passion, driven by the fear of their imminent deaths. Afterwards, they hadn't mentioned it. It had become a one-night stand. \"Shepard, I'm sorry I was so stubborn but...well, you must admit this all seems ridiculous!\" she said. \"Still, I can't tell you how happy I am that you're back now.\" Her eyes flickered over his body, something they had done many times during their talk. Now, though, there was something more in the gaze. \"I must say, of all the bodies to be stuck in, you've ended up being even more attractive than before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard blushed, something he'd never done before. \"Oh, really? I don't recall being quite THAT ugly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-that isn't what I meant!\" Liara stammered. It was only then that she saw the smile on Shepard's face, and realized he had been joking. \"Really though, John, I was wondering...I've been lonely since you've been gone. Would it be okay if you...came over to my apartment tonight? I know it's sudden, but...\" She tried to reach for an excuse before giving up. \"Goddess, John, I just really need you right now.\"</span></div></div>",

But once the front door opened, and they stepped inside, the talking stopped. Sheppard pushed Liara against a wall immediately, kissing her passionately. Sheppard absently noted as they made out that his new body's lips were softer than he was used to, and it made the activity all the more pleasurable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the kissing became steamier and steamier, they eventually forced themselves to break away, and move up to her bed. Liara quickly stripped out of her business clothes, and Sheppard took a moment to soak it in. He's seen her naked breasts before, the exotic color giving them a unique majesty of sorts. But before he could revel in it too much, her hands were disrobing him. As his breastplate fell to the floor, Liara reached a hand up to grope his large, green breasts. Sheppard had never felt anything like it in his life, as the pleasure shot through him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara pushed him onto the bed, and started to pull off the armor on his lower body. He let her, instead taking the time to watch her, see the hunger in her eyes, the same hunger he was starting to feel. Sheppard had never felt this horny in his life. His desire for sex was more than desire, it was a necessity. Did asari often feel this way? If so, Sheppard had no idea how they managed to function normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow completely undressed, Sheppard's anticipation was finally abated as Liara pounced on him, and the two began to kiss frantically, their hands roving over eachother's bodies. Sheppard had never felt pleasure like this, and it was downright intoxicating. Just as he felt himself getting closer and closer towards a climax, he looked into Liara's eyes and, on instinct, said, \"Embrace eternity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meld began, and for several seconds Sheppard knew everything there was to know about Liara. The two of them were truly one, and he could feel the pleasure she was experiencing as well as his own bodies pleasure as they continued to writhe their bodies against eachother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything after that was a blank, but some time later Sheppard awoke and looked over at his lover to find her...</span></div></div>",

I need a break after that ordeal with the Collectors so maybe I could use this to have a little fun messing with people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked, he used the device to change again, this time into a copy of that nosy reporter Khalisah al-Jilani. \"Man, she's a bitch but she's got a pretty nice little body...\" a grin suddenly spread on the fake al-Jilani's face, \"I bet Liara'd like to have fun with it.

Mercilessly, the hands quickly stretched him out, showing the commander the fierce pouting lips of Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? This all y' got?\" Jack glared over towards her annoyed 'team mate' who looked more and more pissed by the second, both unable to hear their commanders cries as Jacks probing fingers forcefully fiddled with him. \"Come on lap-dog, give me something that doesn't have the same crappy pattern as your fuckin' boobs\" Jack sneered, tossing the violated Captain back at Miranda.<br>\r\n\"The commander want's us to play nice, I don't have to like it. Your lucky I'm giving you anything\" The commander whimpered on the floor as Miranda bent down to pick him up,<br>\r\n\"Figures, once a lap dog, always a lap dog\" Jack sneered, smiling as she noted Miranda's grip tightening, unaware the commander was trapped inside the enhanced grasp of his well endowed crew member. \"I've worn through my only pair of 'panties', and I doubt anyone not on a leash will give me a pair.\" Jack smirked, enjoying getting under her crew-mates skin.<br>\r\n\"Only pair? How long... never-mind\" Miranda and the commander paled slightly, Miranda recovered first. \"Just... take it or leave it\" her hand outstretched with the balled up panties at hand, her expression frozen and about to crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commander silently gulped, hoping for one of them to snap, a fight to break out, something that will get him out of this.

Each footfall jammed the commander closer to her smelly body, enforcing hell without effort as she casually 'did her thing'. The only company for the commander was Jack and a torn piece of string emanating the worst stench imaginable. With a scared gasp, the perverted leader realised it was Jacks last pair of panties turned g-string, his mind reeled as he gave an unheard scream for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before the commander was blinded by light and cast to the floor by Jacks uncaring hand. Her annoyed eyes brutally looked over her old g-string before tossing it away,<br>\r\n\"This had better last longer\" The psychopath smirked, thinking about the look on Miranda's face when she showed the Cerberus pet her 'new' g-string. Gazing evilly downwards at the perfectly 'normal' pair of underwear, Jack couldn't even hear your futile cries as she wiggled her toes into you, leaning over from her hard bed casually to grab the two straps that would lead the panties to true hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to think or comprehend the horrible sweaty feet, Shepard quickly realized it was going to get much worse as he was jammed upwards along Jacks slick body. He realized he needed to do something quick before he was reduced to a chew toy for his powerful crew members cheeks. His mind worked fast but continued to draw blanks as Jack hopped up to jam him all the way up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapping her commander upon her rear end Jack smiled,<br>\r\n\"Hey, these are pretty comfortable\" Her hands rested on her hips as she wiggled from side to side, feeling her cheeks and thighs uncomfortable stick and slide. With a shrug towards the shower room Jack shrugged, quickly yanking her new possession inbetween her cheeks to absorb some sweat while she put off her general hygiene for training. Rubbing her commander with wiggle she smirked,<br>\r\n\"Please make this stop\" The commander begged, unable to do anything about the trousers coming up to cover him. The smell and the ever rising heat drove him into panic as Jack accidentally kneed  his twisted body against her unwashed mess.

Normally they would be fighting right now, but the commanders words kept playing through her head. <br>\r\n\"What's wrong? Leash too tight?\" Jack frowned, before shrugging it off, letting her grudge slip slightly \"Whatever lap-dog, I'll 'borrow' someone else's. I knew you were a Cerberus lap-dog, but the Commanders bitch too? Ha\" Jack snarled, storming out. The commander and Miranda let out a collective sigh,<br>\r\n\"You owe me one Shepard...\" Miranda muttered indirectly to the panties, \"EDI, lock my door please, I'm in need of a shower.\" Shepard couldn't help but grin as Miranda collected clothes to head to the showers with, keeping hold of her own Shepard panties for convenience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'This... was not what I had in mind...' Shepard thought sadly as he was forced to wait outside. Miranda had dropped him under a handful of clothes, leaving his world filled with filtered light and the sound of water. After what seemed like eternity, the clothes were removed letting the commander see once more. Lustfully, the commander watched his co-worker chatting with Kelly on occasion, but mostly focusing on getting on with the day. The time finally arose for the commander as he was thrust to the ground, yet things were not like h expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, these are too small\" Miranda sighed through gritted teeth, the day really getting to her, \"This is the third time I've had to stretch these panties out\" Shepard let out a silent groan as he was slowly stretched over the enormous ass.<br>\r\n\"You stretch them? Why not buy a new pair?\" Kelly questioned,<br>\r\n\"They're made out of the same material as my suit, they'll stretch out after some wear\" Miranda spoke matter of factly, picking out her skin tight wedgie before wiggling into her normal suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commander was in turmoil, his brain struggling to adapt to the flexing glutes.

Not suprisingly, less than a half-dozen scans of female Krogan individuals existed in the Omni-change, all of them dated around the time of the development of the genophage. No doubt these were scans taken from Mordin's research. Perhaps stored on here were the only fertile,  genophage-free Krogan in the Galaxy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard retreated to his quarters to make the change. Slipping out of his clothing, he set the device for self-change and activated the selected scan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first changes were minor and radiated out from the left arm holding the omni-change to cover the rest of his body. His skin mottled a yellow-green colour, thickening like old leather. His body hardened into a block of tough and sinewy muscle, gradually losing its human proportions and developing the Krogan's hunched stance to accomodate the muscular hump swelled on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther changes were more uncomfortable. Two fingers of each hand withered before his eyes into nothing. Claws sprang from the toenails and remaining fingernails, forcing out the originals. The thickening skin on his arms, head, and chest crusted over further to form stony crests that enveloped his hair and genitals. He gruntled a little as redundant organs sprouted within his chest, and his nervous and circulatory system underwent a massive overhaul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the changes slowed, she examined herself skeptically. She didn't <i>feel</i> female, nor did she particularly look it. Rather, se felt like seven feet of powerful muscle contained within an armoured shell, with the potential to destroy something with the slightest movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a cautious step towards the elevator on legs that felt put on backwards, staggering into her display of model ships and scattering them over the room in a shower of broken glass. Grunting in annoyance, Shepard made it the rest of the way to the lift and with the aliens fingers of her hand, keyed the elevator for engineering.</span></div></div>",

His stance was confused, unsure whether to fight this intruder or... something else.

What's more, she found herself marvelling at the aesthetic appeal of his body, which took her by surprise. Before he had just been a crude wall of muscle.

He'd known Grunt for literally all of his life and it had always bugged him how the 'perfect' Krogan never showed any sign of humility, vulnerability, and (for lack of a better word) humanity.  But the way Grunt was looking at Shepard's naked female Krogan body showed Shepard that Grunt wasn't just a killing machine, he did indeed actually seemed to have a capacity for not being a stubborn hardass.  Having accomplished everything he wanted to do Shepard waved goodbye and went back to the elevator and pushed the button to go back to his cabin so he could change back and plan his next action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as the elevator reached the half way point Shepard noticed something was a bit off.  There was a very loud rumbling going on just outside of the elevator, Shepard only had to wonder for a few seconds what it was before his Krogan nose told him the answer.  \"Grunt.\"  Shepard said as he smelled Grunt's male pharamones going crazy and they seemed to be going through the rarely used ladder-ways and duct work.  And Shepard knew that Grunt could probably smell him and was going to meet him wherever the elevator stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap.\"  Shepard said as he tried to use the modified Omni-Tool to change back but he cursed himself, \"Damn damn, I forgot, I left it back in my room.  Why did I decide I had to be naked for this?\"  Finally after what felt like forever the elevator stopped at Shepard's room.  Shepard didn't wait for the doors to open and used his Krogan strength to rip them open and charge into his room.</span></div></div>",

Colonists go missing, Shepard returns and then the attacks stop.  That's not a coincidence and as a reporter it's my job to get to the bottom of stories like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A reporter... I could say things about that.\" said Liara, a hint of contempt on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Khalisah\" shook her head.  \"You may object to my methods and views but I still AM a reporter.  That's why I contacted you... well the Shadow Broker but imagine my surprise when that turned out to be you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?  The Shadow Broker?  Ms. al-Jilani you flatter me but overestimate my abilities.  I am merely an agent and not the Shadow Broker him or herself.\" replied Liara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, I see.\" \"Khalisah\" said, a knowing smirk on her face.  \"But anyway, down to brass tacks I suppose.  I contacted you because I needed more information on a group known as Cerberus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara was a bit taken aback by that.  \"Cerberus?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fake reporter nodded, \"Yes, no doubt as an... agent... of the Shadow Broker you've heard of them.  I feel it's important for both me and Citadel Space at large to know about them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Ms. al-Jilani, your views are...\" Liara started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pro-human?\" answered \"Khalisah\" finishing her thought, \"Yes, well I feel that their views are a bit too extreme.  I've read reports buried deep within Alliance databases about the experiments they've done in the Maroon Sea, among other things.  They need to be exposed to the galaxy at large.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is... rather surprising.\" Liara stated, \"I wouldn't have expected such a moral stance on the subject from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Khalisah\" smiled at Liara, \"Yes well as a reporter my job is to bring the truth to the people, only now do I realize that the truth is more important than an agenda.  My experiences, both with Shepard and more recent ones, have shown me that I may have been somewhat wrong about non-humans... you asari especially.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reporter walked towards Liara smiling.  She took her arms and draped them over Liara's shoulders, looking into her eyes.  \"So beautiful, you asari.  Your lovely blue skin, your gorgeous eyes, you're beautiful souls...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Ms. al-Jilani, I don't know...\" Liara started.  She was, however, cut off by the lovely Middle Eastern reporter bringing her mouth up to Liara's and kissing her.  The asari resisted at first but pleasure overcame her and she relented.  Something about the way Khalisah kissed her felt so safe and familiar.  So right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard, in his mind, smiled.  He was enjoying the feel of Khalisah's body and impersonating her in order to fool Liara was fun.  But while he was enjoying being her, he also wanted to try a couple other forms on Liara; Gabby was cute and would be fun to try, Jack was rough and lithe and combined with her biotics would make for an interesting time, Tali... well before contacting Liara Shepard asked Mordin what would happen if he turned into a quarian.  Would he inherit their weak immune systems?  Mordin had said most likely not so that might be fun to try.  And so many lovely asari...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Shepard was enjoying being Khalisah.  Impersonating her, acting like her, the feel of her body... especially now as it was pressed against Liara's gorgeous form.  She was a smart girl, perhaps he should let Liara figure things out on her own.</span></div></div>",

The terrified animal part of its brain urged it to jump, knowing it would probably survive the fall, but the human part saw the distance as nothing more than a suicidal cliff dive. Unwillingly it backed away from the edge of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smug snake smile still remained on Jack's face. Ever since she'd heard of Miranda's genetically-engineered heritage she had been secretly resentful. While she had earned her powers through pain and suffering and endless, horrible experimentation, Miranda had been given her gifts at birth - a perfect body, brain, and biotic powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow those gifts were hers, and it was Miranda's turn to suffer.</span></div></div>",

Checking around her terminal and seeing Kenith and Gabby were elsewhere her hands slid up to her breasts: rubbing and squeezing them against <i>the commander</i>, moaning as she groped herself. \"Oh Shepard!\" Tali gasped as she came, pinching her hard nipples, she shakily stood straight and made her way to the elevator and with that Shepard's quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard himself wasn't paying attention to the sounds around him, enjoying the relative calm as her breasts gently bounced in time with Tali's breathing.

He was brought back to reality by Tali's sudden focus on her breasts and more so her breasts through him. When he heard her moaning his name he knew his time was up and she'd be turning him back now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering her commander's room Tali immediately activated the sterilization feature before she began to strip off her suit. She left her torso till last hoping to drag this moment on as long as she could. Now completely nude the quarian picked up the Omnichange and aiming it at her chest plate. It became her commander again in a flash of light and Tali instantly jumped into his arms, her mouth trying to devour his. They separated, gasping for air when Shepard spoke \"Tali could I ...\" 'Shepard you've held up my breasts for the past few hours of course you can touch me\" Shepard smiled and resumed kissing her, his hands roaming; one finding it's way to one of her tits, the other heading lower, cupping her large round arse, enjoying the surprised squeak that escaped her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like forever they separated, Tali making her way over to the omnichange and smiling \"Well Shepard, you got to transform yourself, now I get a turn to change YOU\" she points the device at him and ......</span></div></div>",

He was shocked; at their current scale he was a bug and her a mighty goddess, why was she asking him? As if reading his mind Tali answered '' I'll enjoy your presence wherever I place you but I wouldn't want to put you somewhere you don't want to go or if you'd prefer somewhere else'' once again Shepard was shocked and awed by Tali's thoughtfulness, even with complete control over him she still wanted them both to be happy rather than just squeeze him into wherever she pleases like anyone else would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind was soon made up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He's made his decision and tells Tali it. The Quarian smiles and Shepard is reminded of why her mouth isn't an option. Dangling him with her right hand she slightly parts her breast and lowers him between them until only his head is showing, then she removes her finger so her flesh 'holds' him before putting her thumb on his head and gently pressing down entombing him within her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard was in heaven; the soft embrace of Tali's boobs pressed against even inch of his body, the warmth caused by her 'insulation', the heady scent that was uniquely Tali, he didn't know where to start. Probably lucky then that he did get the choice. The pressure increased as Tali smashed her breasts together, the malleable fat moulding around ever millimetre of his tiny body so she could feel his hard cock and his tongue lightly lapping, she moans and moves her breast up and down feeling him rub against her with ever twitch. When Tali began to play with her tits, her breast pressed up against his cock causing Shepard to moan, rewarding him with a mouth full of purple boobies. He enthusiastically licked and sucked on any available piece of tit he was up against, loving the noises he drew from his giantess lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali could feel she was nearing the edge, crossing her arms over her breasts to stop their jiggling she sighed; she needed to get back into her suit, not play with her shrunken commander, nude in his quarters. Her time in a human ship was making her selfish, forgetting that Quarians always work for the fleet not themselves..... but it was so hard and she was so wet, she didn't think she could come down without cumming down.</span></div></div>",

His time with her breasts had pushed them up in terms of things he liked about Tali (much better than the little nubs that were there before) but his shrunken body being rubbed against her massive ass cheek allowed it to come from behind as his favourite again, meaning there was no contest of where he was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he gave his answer Tali laughed \"I knew you were an ass man Shepard. I thought I saw you staring a few times on Normandy 1\" \"Of course I was, there was little else to see\" Shepard commented, the increased pressure from Tali's fist telling him she didn't appreciate his joke \"Well ass man, time to get what you want, now don't move\" she ordered, placing him on his desk. For a moment Shepard was worried she'd lied about choice, as he sat there online with her vagina until she turned and literally bounced onto him; trapping him deep in her ass crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard opened his eyes relieved he was alive and surprised to see himself surrounded by purple flesh. Him and his space was bounced around by what he assumed was Tali standing up and then heard her voice \"So what do you think Shepard?\" He trier answering but was met by Tali's laughter \"I don't know what that was but it felt funny, we're going to need some kind of system to communicate; seeing as your back there how about you rub my ass for yes and thump it for no, sound good?\" Shepard rubbed her ass cheek, enjoying how soft her skin felt to the touch \"yeah this should work fine. So enjoying yourself back there?\" Shepard again firmly rubbed, even groping the cheek in front of him to get his point across \"I knew you would, anyway I'm putting my suit back on so things may get very cold or very hot where you are; Quarians have a lower body temperature than humans, but you're in a 'heavily insulated' area so like I said, I don't know\" with that she began to retrieve her suit, each movement bouncing Shepard against alternate cheeks, as well as deeper into her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she squirmed her way into the lower half of her suit her cheeks were pressed together and the temperature within skyrocketed. Not that this bothered Shepard, he liked the increased amount of Tali pressed against him, running his facial cheek against hers a gave the enormous orb a kiss and affectionate lick. Her skin was sweet not salty as he expected it to be. He heard the quarian moan, combined with the ripples in her flesh from the double spank he knew she felt both actions and his hard on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tali reattached her helmet she felt the movement of her tiny commander as he continued to play in her ass; feeling pride as she felt his cock's constant pressure on her cheek. \"<i>Keep this up and we'll both cum soon</i>\" she thought as she grabbed her cheeks and rubbed them, trying to get him to squirm deeper, where she could completely envelop him. She soon headed towards the lift, skipping along for her benefit as much as his.</span></div></div>",

With a little more wriggling, Tali was satisfied with the fit of the new shoe, and she jumped to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Shepard knew he had made a mistake. Well, not right then. The intense pain and overwhelming pressure as he hit the floor obliterated all thought, and for a moment he was nothing but an ordinary shoe; unthinking, uncomprehending of anything except the sensation of being crushed beneath the weight of a massive foot, which was the entirety of his world. For the briefest of moments he had no idea who he was, the memory of the spectre John Shepard gone, and he was just a assembly of fabric and circuitry, desperately firing off alerts to the suit's central management software.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Tali mused, as the suit's damage and pressure alerts lit up red on her helmet's HUD. Slowly Shepard's mind reasserted itself, just as Tali gave another tentative step, obliterating him once more in a wave of agony. \"That's odd,\" she said, as the new suit piece began to bleat once again its electronic cries of distress. \"Pressure is clearly within tolerable limits. I sure hope it isn't faulty.\" Swiftly she recalibrated the suit software, blocking the shoe's protests from reaching her attention. \"That's better,\" she said happilly, setting off walking, her gel-coated foot slamming into her Commander with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Shepard, only one thought existed in the moment of consciousness that existed between steps. <i>Eight hours.

Links up with databases in Citadel, Omega, Alliance, merc groups and others.  Copies appearance and genetic information from databases into device.

His fingers elongated, fusing together until their was three and his legs bent backwards at the shins in a way that was alien to him.

Jeff Moreau, more commonly called Joker, stopped in surprise as he entered the room, seeing Shepard hugging Miranda.  \"I'm, uh, not interrupting anything am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what?  Joker?!\" Shepard said confused, pulling away from Miranda-Mordin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Joker!  Yes, was hoping to see you.  Time for biweekly check up.  See Vrolik's Syndrome has progressed either in good or bad way, find out if there is new useful data for me to use, other assorted things.\" Mordin stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker just looked wide-eyed.  \"Miranda?  What are you talking about?\" he asked in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, pardon me.\" replied Mordin, \"Forgot I still looked like this.\" activating the device, he changed back into himself. \"There we go, much better.  Operative Lawson's form quite appealing if I were non-salarian.  Advantages as well but difficult to adjust to... certain elements.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I am now officially freaked out.\" Joker stated.  \"I get relieved thinkin' everything's gonna be normal but noooo, I find the Commander getting all touchy feely with Miranda except it's not Miranda but Mordin.  Maybe I'm going crazy, suffering a little PTSD.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joker, calm down.  You're not going crazy.\" Shepard said with a small laugh, \"It's this device Mordin invented.  Here, we'll give you a demonstration.\"  Shepard turned to Mordin and whispered something to the scientist.  He then turned back towards Joker and smiled.  An omni-tool then appeared on Mordin's arm who aimed it at Shepard.  Shepard was hit with a bright flash and then Joker watched, amazed, as Shepard's form changed.  \"It allows you to change yourself or someone else into another person.  Or asari, or turian or anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-Shepard?\" Joker asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard shook his head, \"No Joker, it's Tali.  Physically at least.\"  Shepard walked up to Joker and ran a hand down his face, \"You know, you're kind of cute Joker.\" Shepard said in Tali's accented voice, \"Since I lack her weak immune system perhaps I could show you what's under Tali's helmet.  I've been wondering about that myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker took a step back in surprise.  \"Whoa, Commander I don't know... what's gotten into you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a quarian babe, Joker.\" Shepard replied running his Tali hands over his Tali hips, \"It can be fun to act out a bit as someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard, I don't know...\" Joker said, unsure of what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at Joker, Shepard then turned his head back to Mordin.  \"Mordin, perhaps you should let Joker in on the action.  Turn him into... I don't know, Jack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa now, Commander I don't know--\" before he could finish Joker was struck by the same flash and in short order, his body had changed.  He looked down to see that he was wearing practically nothing but some straps up top and that his torso and arms were heavily tattooed while his chest was on the small side.  He reached up, feeling the very small amount of fuzz on his shaved head.  \"Holy shit it... I...\" Joker started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do you feel Joker?\" Shepard asked in an amused tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well outside of being a girl which is, you know, WEIRD AS HELL, I feel great!\" Joker exclaimed, \"I feel normal too!  Not all crippled and made of glass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a great device isn't it?\" asked Shepard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker could only nod in agreement.  \"I gotta admit, it is pretty cool.  Uh, since I'm relieved of my piloting duties for a few hours could I, ya know, take that thing?  Mess around with it?  I got this chance to be normal for a bit and I am NOT passin' it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might not be such a good idea Shepard given importance of Joker's position on ship.\" Mordin cautioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has a point, Joker.\" Shepard said.  \"What if something comes up and we need you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh c'mon, really?!\" Joker protested, \"Look at you, you're just gonna wander around looking like Tali like it's nothing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tali's a sweet girl, I'm sure I could do something to put any weird feelings she has to rest if she sees her double.\" Shepard explained, \"But say we get the alert and you come out looking like Miranda or Jack or Samara.  Do you REALLY want to find out what could happen if they saw someone impersonating them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoker frowned, an expression that wouldn't be out of place on Jack's face if it were a frown of anger instead of disappointment.  \"C'mon Commander!  Look, okay since you said it earlier how about you bring the device with you, we go up to your cabin, have a little bit of Tali/Jack sexy time aaaaand then you give the thing to me for a bit.  Sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could always give you a little bit of solo sexy time as Jack.\" Shepard said amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, Commander, you're gonna do this to me?\" Joker whined, an odd thing coming from what was physically a dangerous and violent criminal, \"Interspecies girl-on-girl for some alone time with the thing.  Whaddaya say?  You know you want to accept it.\"</span></div></div>",

Whatever it was becoming, it wasn't casual wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the constriction began to loosen Shepard couldn't help but sigh in relief. Except that it wasn't loosening in a uniform fashion, only about his waist and shoulders. That was when he realized that the clothing wasn't loosening; he was shrinking. And in very familiar proportion. His shoulders became very narrow as he continually lost muscle mass, a process that was repeated throughout his body. In fact, the only place he didn't seem to be shrinking was in his...ass?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard concluded that Tali's surprise was ruined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nContrary to the rest of his form, his buttocks, hips, and thighs were actually growing, until he was sure every muscle and contour was clearly displayed even through the suit, a sight that must have been all the more striking compared to his much shrunken body. Grimacing in pain, he was reminded that that wasn't the only thing that was exposed. Shepard's testicles and member were valiantly resisting the smooth, organo-synthetic fabric of his new suit; whose vice like grip forced him to will the rebel extremities to just give up. They complied, though dealt a parting blow to his ego by way of the disturbing slurping sensation of them sliding inside his body. The feeling was so sudden he began to teeter...only to find himself unable to catch his balance and collapse onto his bed. His feet were positioned wrong. They felt too long, yet simultaneously seemed to hang in the air, affording very little contact to the floor. And the huge distance from which his thighs now projected from his hips, combined with the new spacing of his legs; was simply too much for him to overcome. He landed on his new ass, whose width and corpulent softness cushioned the fall comfortably, spreading out across his mattress like...well, a mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrinking had stopped, as had (finally) the growth of his hips. Shepard felt the prickling of his hands and feet falling asleep for a brief moment, and flexed them as they achieved a familiar, tridactyl configuration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when he thought it was over, he felt a pressure in his chest heralding a sudden bout of expansion...albeit in a far more specific manner than the general contraction of his torso and waste earlier. Erupting from his pecs, too mounds forced their way outward like twin erupting volcanoes, triggering a complementary explosion of sensation when his newly hyper-sensitive nipples began rubbing against the plastic smoothness of his suit. He heard himself gasp in unwanted pleasure. A very light, girlish gasp. And then...it was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard lay in silence for a time, until prompted by Tali's soft voice. \"You can open your eyes now.\" Her tone was dripping in guilt. Shepard opened his eyes to find Tali's face nearly pressed against his, her concern visible through her mask. One identical to the one Shepard was wearing. In fact, both their masks were clearer than it seemed to Shepard they should be. There was no purple haze tinting the light that penetrated their helmets. The Quarians' visible spectrum must have been slightly different from a human's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John? Are you okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made himself smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. Tali.\" Her eyes widened at the sound of Shepard's soft, accented voice; yet he saw her mouth curve into a smile. One that he knew was a precise mirror of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali leapt at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard again found himself unable to breathe. Tali's arms fit around him in a way they never could before, and the strength of her hug was like a vice. It was worse than the suit had been when he was still transforming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'msorryI'msorryI'msorry! Oh, keelah! What was I thinking just zapping you like that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It' ... <b>*hack*</b>...ok, Tali. Please. Have to...breathe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" Tali bounced off of him. Shepard ignored the reciprocal bouncing that had settled in his breasts as he caught his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard rose from the bed and regarded Tali again. It was so strange, seeing her at eye level. \"So. I'm you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Tali blushed. God, he could actually see her <i>blush</i>. It was going to be hard going back to human eyesight after this. \"Is this ok? I mean, did it make things weird or anything? I mean of course it's weird but is it making you uncomfortable or-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. Really.\" Shepard hugged her, though he broke it off quickly, perturbed by the feeling of their breasts squashing together. If Tali was likewise disturbed, she didn't show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" She whispered. \"I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too. So...now what? It's not like I have a problem with your body, but why did you want a twin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. A couple of reasons really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such as?\" Shepard prompted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I got the idea when Mordin accidentally told me that you'd uh...experimented, I guess? With my body I mean. I was a little mad, but I couldn't help but be curious. See what it would be like, you know?\" She paused. \"Is that really what I sound like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and it's adorable. Now stop dodging the question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Sorry. Okay. I also wanted to see if, well...Mordin said that using the omni-change to fix my immune system might not have worked because of some problem with the device being used to turn a person into themselves. I'd hoped that maybe, if I made you me instead, that maybe it would work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...but how does that help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali somehow appeared even more flustered. \"I'll get to that, alright?!\" She took a deep breath. \"But first, let's talk about how it helps you.\" She clasped Shepard's hand, a bizarre feeling when they each only had three fingers, and drew him to the small mirror in his quarters. \"We've never been able to properly see each other. I don't just mean without my mask. I mean without the suit...or anything. It may seem strange to a human, but for a Quarian to be naked with someone is kind of a big deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard couldn't help but chuckle, although it sounded more like a giggle. \"Actually seeing someone naked is kind of a big deal on Earth, too.\" Tali responded with a playful poke in his chest. Which felt strangely good. Something else new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm being serious! I know it's not the same...but wouldn't you like to see me? I mean all of me? With nothing separating us from each other? This way we could do that. And if you get sick, we can just change you back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard's mouth had gone unaccountably dry. \"Of course I want to see you. But like you said, it's not the same...\" He regarded his...her...<i>their</i> faces in the mirror. \"...but I think I'll give it a shot anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you! Thank you!\" Tali was already fumbling with his helmet. \" But there was one other thing...\"</span></div></div>",

He put a hand on what felt like a wooden floor and struggled to rise to his feet, hearing the groans and mumbles of others as he did so. It was only once he was standing at his full height that he realized that said full height was nowhere near what it had once been. How did an experiment with a Prothean artifact affect his height? That was about when his eyes started to focus on the others around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey each resembled a member of his crew in some way, but aside from a few humans he'd never seen anything like them. Several of the people in front of him were taller than him but shorter than the humans, with pointed ears and thin faces. Others looked to be around his height, quite short and stout. A few others towered above everyone with thick, bulging muscles, curled horns growing out of their temples, and cloven feet. Shepard also began to take notice of their surroundings: a ship. Not a spaceship, as he was so often used to being on, but instead a wooden boat on an open ocean, with no land in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the people, a human man with a slim build, a shaved head, and wearing white robes with an orange trim, asked him, \"Commander, is that you? From what my new sensory input is telling me, I can deduce that we are in a completely different spacetime from out own, and that our physical forms have been altered to match our new reality.\" So then, that was probably EDI.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman with pointed ears and tight clothes scratched her head. \"Spacetime? Mind saying that again in english, <i>chica</i>?\" That was...James?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means we're in an alternate dimension, you dolt,\" came the rumbling basso of a man the same height as Shepard with a long black beard and white leather armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard was getting annoyed with this very quickly. \"Look, everyone, let's stop for a moment and introduce ourselves, just so everyone is on the same page as far as who is who.\" It was only as he spoke that Shepard heard his own voice and noticed that it was slightly higher in pitch than normal, and looked down to see behind the black platemail armor he wore to the large breasts underneath. He raised an eyebrow and looked at his crew. \"Anyone mind telling me why no one said that I was a woman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall human with shoulder-length black hair and purple robe smirked at him, one hand on his hip. \"We all changed genders, Shepard. Or did you think I always looked like this under my suit?\" With the words came a fascinating accent that Shepard knew well: that was Tali.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the exceptionally tall horned people, a woman in sailing clothes, spoke up. \"Yeah, Commander, you're not the only one dealing with extra weight on their chests.\" There was a short pause before she added, \"Oh, I'm Joker, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother horned person, the word 'Qun' suddenly appeared in Shepard's mind as the name of the race, this one a man in blue-green robes, chimed in. \"As an ex-Asari, I must admit that suddenly belonging to a species with gender is quite odd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grunt came from an Elvin girl. \"I find this new form ridiculous. It resembles the human species too closely, and is too small and brittle for true battle.\" Those words, combined with her bright red battle armor, clearly proclaimed to everyone that she was Javik.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dwarven man who had spoken earlier only opened his mouth again to say, \"Miranda.\" Next to him was a human girl in blue leather armor, with a quiver and box strapped to her back. She merely nodded tersely, her face stoically blank, but just from that Shepard knew that she was Garrus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Shepard knew that, it was fairly clear who the other three here were. The tall Qun in rich clothing was Diana, the other Dwarven girl in armor was Kaidan, and the only male Elf there was Samantha. Commander Shepard looked at Joker, eyebrow raised, and asked her, \"Can you steer a ship?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Commander, I can thread the needle with a kilometer long starship, I think steering a boat won't stress my skills,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I think everyone else should explore the ship. Make sure to stay with at least one other crew member, and be careful. We don't know much, if anything, about this new world.\"</span></div></div>",

Sitting up stiffly he realised he was lying at the edge of a forest along with a number of other people all of whom were in various stanges of awakening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Welcome back Commander'' Shepard turned and found Miranda standing beside him, dressed in a tight white what he beleived to be leather armor, which in turn caused him to examine his own as she helped him up; strong but heavy mix of uknown metal and leather ''We're some of the lucky ones to stillbe humanafter this mess'' ''Though some of us didn't get to keep their original faces'' Shepard turned in the direction of Kaiden's voice and couldn't find him, but he did find 2 more humans; a thin man with red hair and a tall leggy blond. Both were wearing much lighter armour than he was, much closer to Miranda's  outfit. ''True but it feels so strange to be ... alive'' the blond commented telling Shepard just who it was. ''Kaiden? EDI?'' ''Correct'' EDI replied while Kaiden nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''They're lucky to get to be in a body they recognise'' another female voice added from somewhere past Miranda. Shapard turned expecting to find someone but didn't ''A little lower Commander'' she repeated and he obeyed, spying the shorter girl with a cute face and the biggest blue eyes he'd ver seen ''Godess this is strange'' she said aloud, telling Shepard this girl was Liara ''You took your time,  the others are still getting used to their new bodies, though I'm the only one in a body with a strange gender. Well being a guy would be stranger but still'' she stopped talking and lead Shepard to a clearing  a little way in. Here he saw a few more of the shorter people Liara was,  more human sized but willowy people and tall, well built horned entites, one with backward pointing horns looked like he could take on a Krogan singled handedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda took charge almost imediately ''Okay, now everyone's up and waling around let's start off by introducing yourselves and ten we can figure out what Liara's device did to us'' this got a loud HEY from the smaller girl. A guy in blue leather armour, blue facial tatoos and a large crossbow stepped forward ''I think you can guess who I am Shepard'' he smirked ''Well nobody wears as much blue as you do, so I hope it's you Garrus'' Shepard joked, as he saw the second elf step forward a litle nervously ''Specialist Traynor reporting for duty Commander'' she pushed her dark hair out of her eyes and Shepard noticed the  spiral tatoos on her face too, though they were pale green. ''Well one interesting thing came out of this'' boomed one of the behemoths ''I didn't think I could any more ripped than I already was, eh Loco'' he laughed and Shepard rolled his eyes, that was obviously James, leaving the other 2. ''Well I can't top that'' said the other female dwarf ''Hey commander, it's Diana and I hope nobody minds this being broadcast all it's own if/when we get back to the ship'' ''That will be difficult from our position in a liniar, non culmonating section of space-time'' EDI stated ''It makes sense...'' began the gruff voice of the dwarf with the thick red beard ''... as this was most likely an escape attempt by my people to get away from the Reapers, most likely by becoming their counterparts in another reality''  ''If these are this world's versions of us, then our world me got screwed over severely'' the other horned male stated ''Oh and I'm Joker by the way'' he said suprising most of them, the wall of mucle jumped though when he felt  Edi's arms circle around one of his own ''I think I'll like this world Jeff, but we'll need to be sure'' she purred and the rest of them learnt the  Kossith (aka Qunari) can blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn't matter to Shepard, what did was the last member of their group who was still silent; the woman with snow white hair and spiral horns, who's suprisingly thin fingers findled amongst themselves, wrapped in deep purple robes that implied a stunning figure. When he was standing directly in front of her he spoke ''Tali?'' he asked and she inclined her head, revealing purple/blue tinged eyes and silver lines (which were more likely some kind of paint than tatoo) that came down her cheeks starting at her lower eyelids ''Yes John, it's me'' she said quietly, though Shepard smiled at the fact she somehow manged to keep her accent ''What's wrong?'' ''I'm exposed, I don't know what I am and I have this energy burning up inside me that makes me feel like am about to explode'' Tali yelled as she stood to her full height, Shepard finding out she was taller than James and Joker but was less of a wall than the guys, he only came up to the large breasts of her new body though. Shepard took her hands in his own and smiled up at her ''Don't worry love we'll sort this out together, everything even down to your magic'' he said trying to comfort his girlfriend ''Um Shepard, how do you know about magic?'' Miranda asked with quirked eyebows ''Well Javik said these were esentiall this reality's version of us, maybe we gain knowledge of this world simply from being them'' Shepard put forward with a shrug ''It ecplains why I now know how to use these'' Kaiden put forward, pulling open the coat section of his armour to reveal 2 daggers on his hips ''And why I know the best way to use that axe, and that you're wearing dragonhide'' James added pointing to the huge axe and ten Miranda ''How do you know that?'' Liara sked curiously ''Smell'' Tali answered still embracing John, his head side-on to prevent sufocation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Well that should make integrating much easier, we just need to figure out what to do now we're here''Mirada said trying to return things back on topic, but was interupted by a laugh from the Protean turned dwarf ''Stupid primitives, you can't even tell when you're surrounded'' Javic actally laughed slightly ''What matters isn't what we do now, it's what we do when they're finished with us''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo who are ''they''? (This also helps determine when in the Dragon Age timeline/universe they are)<br>\r\n[By the way EDI and Kaiden resemble their voice actors, and James &amp; Sam are the races they are due to who they are in DA:I, James being voiced by the same person as Bull, and Traynor's voice actor being the default for female elves and humans]</span></div></div>",

A red headed dwarf, apparently the leader stepped out from behind them ''Okay, you have to the count of 5 to explain... Bull?'' the dwarf began to threaten but was confused to see James' counterpart ''You know her?'' Shepard asked ''Don't know Loco, things are still fuzzy. Same for the rest of us I presume?'' James/Bull answered, getting nods from most of the group<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So?'' the dwarf was still standing there looking for answers ''Sorry...'' Bull laughs and snaps his fingers ''Harding! Damn knew I'd remember it. Sorry, bout that, I was just meeting up with the crew I used to run with, but there was a bit of a magical issue, practically scrambled most of our brains.'' he explained, Harding raised eyebrows but otherwise didn't react much ''And I presume these guys were from before the Chargers?'' ''Yep, learnt everything from Shep here, then I left and built my own band myself: skilled team, not too big, kicks all the ass'' Bull grinned and so did Harding<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''So, this Shep'' Scout Harding began ''That would be me, and it's Shepard'' Shepard said as he stepped forward ''Well Shepard, think you'd be up for helping the Inquisition?'' Harding asked, Shepard looked curious ''Bull, you're the one with experience with this group, thoughts?'' ''Go for it Loco, the Boss may be a crazy bitch, and don't let her know I said that but the Inquisition is doing what it can to help everyone, plus kick that Cory.... never gonna get that fuckers name right, the bastard hat tore open the sky's ass from here to the black throne'' Shepard nodded and took it into consideration ''Alright, anyone have a problem with us working with this Inquisition?'' Everyone shook their heads in the negative ''Okay Harding, we'll take the job'' the dwarf looked happy at his answer before frowning ''Actually I can't officially hire you, but I can lead you to our current headquarters, it's not a secret or anything, Hell it's practically a pilgrimage. The Inquisitor can decide if she wants you or not, then you'll just need to work out your pay with Ambassador Montilyet. I'm sure once his head stops spinning Bull can tell you that the Inquisition pays very well'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group were brought to Sky hold, where one of their number's counterpart was familiar to this world's Inquisitor<br>\r\nSo what's the Inquisitor's race/species/class (which then will decide the character they recognise)?</span></div></div>",

It was a fairly insufficient apology, considering that himself, Vetra, and Liam were all stripped of their weapons and armor, bound in shackles, and standing in an experimental kett facility, facing The Cardinal through a pane of glass. \"If I'd known she would do this to us, I'd probably have killed her last time. Or blown this place up. My bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her annoyance, Vetra just rolled her snakelike Turian eyes. \"Don't stress about it, Ryder. You couldn't have seen it coming that someone was going to get us captured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiam's face blushed a shade or two, and he fired back indignantly. \"Listen, my plan would have worked if they hadn't been expecting it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, the hum of the mechanisms around them coming to live ended their conversation,and their imminent transformation into Kett hit them.

Like, I was really excited about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the situation, Vetra found herself smiling at the moron, and let out a happy sigh. \"Me too, Ryder. Me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly on a roll, Ryder turned to his other squadmate. \"Liam, I have something to tell you too: you're pretty hot and a bang would've been cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man let out an awkward cough, and looked away from the Pathfinder. \"Um, I'm flattered, but I don't swing that way, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" was all Ryder was able to say before the machine activated.</span></div></div>",

Finally she reached the key part of the new Kett mechanism: the power generator and the receptacle for Archon DNA. Apparently this bit of wizardry could exalt people en masse. Sabotaging either part would've been okay...for an amateur. But Peebee knew she wasn't one of those. With a few clicks on her omni-tool she set the generator to overload, and then she reached over and removed the Archon DNA, not taking notice of a sharp bit of wire near it, which cut her enough to make her blood start dripping from the wound. \"Shit!\" Peebee looked at the wound, then at the DNA, then shrugged. \"Oh well, it's disabled, who cared. 'Peebee, I'm sorry we didn't have space sex before, let's have it now.' 'Sure Ryder, if you insist.'\" She then began making kissing and other more vulgar sounds as she exited the base, not realizing her own DNA from her blood had entered the receptacle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone knew immediately something was wrong with the device, because instead of just the prisoners rising into the air, everyone in the building did. Ryder watched, confused, but wasn't able to focus on that as the changes begun. He watched, and did not see bone armor rise out of his skin, but instead as it turned a dark blue color. His entire body lost its layer of ripped muscle, replaced with softer, more curvy features. His waist cinched in tighter, while his hips expanded out, giving him an hourglass figure. Ryder noticed something odd on his shoulders suddenly, and checked to see his hair had fallen out, and reached up to find it had all been replace with a familiar tentacle-shapped nest of cartilage. He watched as his under-armor tank top became a valley of cleavage, as large blue breasts swelled out of his flat chest, and felt his pants get tighter over a thicker, softer ass. The last change came with his genitals, which withdrew inside of him, leaving him with the Asari's equivalent of a vagina. As the changes ended, Ryder looked himself over and was forced to admit he had become an Asari, one with a deep blue skin tone and one of the largest chests he'd ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked to where his squadmates had been standing, and saw two other Asari there. The one that had been where Vetra was had a purple skin tone, an expression that bordered between confused and annoyed, and the largest, most succulent ass Ryder had ever seen in his life. Liam had become a green Asari, and while she still had a fairly good figure, it was clear she was the least buxom or bodacious of the three. Then Ryder's eyes moved past them to the crowd outside the chamber...all the Kett were now Asari too.</span></div></div>",

Late afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClad in your skin hugging infiltration suit, you lay flat on your belly on a rocky outcrop jutting from a mesa, high above the TR facility below. The sun is setting on the desert continent, and a brisk, dry wind whistles down the high-walled ravine. Shuffling over the red dust to the edge of the outcrop, you lift the sights of the V10, the high-velocity plasma rifle, to your eye, scanning the facility below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nanite swarm crawls over your skin like liquid, encasing you, warping the light around your body. The new cloak nanites are performing well, though they sure do itch. Anybody looking at you would see only the faintest shimmer in the shape of a man, lost in the wavering columns of hot air that rise from the sun-baked stone as the evening cools.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe facility is quiet. The rifle sight moves from empty door to empty door, searching out movement. A terran heavy tank sits idle in the road that runs between the facility, its cockpit open and empty. The side is pitted with impact damage, and a gout of black smoke flows from the holes in the thick armour plating. You wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMovement in one of the doors. An engineer emerges from a building, walking unhurried towards the tank. She crouches down beside the dented plating, lifting her nano-armour kit to the damage. A flicker of white energy shines from the tool, and the rent armour starts to heal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou line up the rifle on her head, slowing your breathing, squeezing the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you do, you hear the deep thrum of a Galaxy dropship engine. growing closer. With a sudden roar, the vast ship soars above the mesa, the turbulence of its passing shaking the rock under you. It flies with a slow elegance, like a whale swimming, banking sluggishly. Its vast belly is covered with floodlights which scour the land beneath it. Darklight floodlights. You press yourself back against the rock, but it is too late - the nanites on your skin fizz and pop as they try to bend the darklight, burning themselves out in the process. Your once-invisible form is outlined in sparks of purple and green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn it.</i> You climb to your feet, slinging the rifle over your back, and start to scramble across the rock. The floodlights follow you. At the same time, you hear a new roar over the sound of the Galaxy engines. You look down to see the heavy tank is repaired, its massive turret pivoting up to point directly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May the will of Vanu protect-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a rush of sound and light and a brief jolt of agony, you awaken inside a rebirthing tube inside the warp gate. You step out of the tube. An information analyst steps forward, a data pad in her hands as she prepares to take your intel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Place of death, Broken Arch Road. Cause of death, tank,\" you mutter, rubbing your sore limbs. Rebirthing never got any easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything useful to report?\" she asks dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, your damn cloak doesn't work anymore,\" you snap back angrily, tearing the cloaking device from your armour and tossing it far away. \"Their darklight sees straight through it, I might as well be wearing lumifier out there for all the good it does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you have a problem with the tech, you're perfectly free to choose another class,\" she bites back. \"Alternatively the armoury are trialing new prototypes in the field that should circumvent the issue with darklight. If you wish, I can download the specifications to your terminal now, though you'll be expected to file a thorough report on its use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugs, tapping a button on the data pad before walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou appraoch a terminal, loading up your loadout display.

The technical specifications of the prototype move across your HUD, while the recorded voice of command begins to speak in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for opting in to the TXF47 prototype beta. The field data you collect will be invaluable to the perfection of this crucial piece of technology, which we believe will grant us the advantage in infiltration and reconnaissance, and allow us to bring this war to a swift end. You are now being instant actioned into battle. Best of luck, soldier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body begins to fade away as nanites consume it from within. \"Wait a sec-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-cond.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second time in five minutes, you are rebirthed mid-sentence again. This time you find yourself strapped into a metal frame. Thick plates of metal slide into place, sealing you in a pitch black, tiny tube. You're being orbital dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe G-force hits as the drop pod is released. The seat shakes violently as you plummet towards the ground below. At the last moment, the rockets kick in, braking the pod just as it slams into the earth. The pod opens like a blossoming flower, disgorging you into the heat of battle. Tracer fire whizzes overhead, and tank shells explode mere metres from your location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut in the open, exposed, you suddenly wish you had your cloak back again. You sprint for the nearest cover, a stunted, alien bush growing in the shadow of a boulder, diving beneath the dense foliage just as your drop pod is blasted into shrapnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you peer out from your hiding place, your stomach drops. They haven't dropped you into friendly territory, or even into a Vanu battle. TR infantry clash with NC. Hundreds of tanks race across open ground, exchanging fire, with you stuck right slap bang in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost jump out of your spandex as the voice of command speaks in your ear once more, \"Prototype TXF47 is the latest in chameleon camouflage, utilizing reconstructive nanite technology to disguise soldiers in battle. The effects are undetectable to both darklight and all known forms of scanning equipment, and will allow infiltrators to walk in the very midst of our enemies without detection. To adopt a disguise, the prototype must be activated while in contact with an object.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA camouflage kit? Neat. You press yourself into the yellow-red auraxium dirt and activate the device by touching your hand to the slot in your chest. Instantly you feel a prickly wave of nanites swarm out from your chest to envelop your body. Your tight-fitting bodysuit is broken down to its elemental components and reformed, and as the nanite swarm retreats your find yourself clothed not in spandex and metal, but in rock and dirt. From head to foot, your skin has the exact colour and texture of the yellow-red dirt beneath you. There are even scraps of vegetation growing from your rock encrusted body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay there for a while, admiring how your body blends perfectly into the landscape, until you hear the rumble of tank treads. You scramble out from beneath the bush just in time. An NC Vanguard rolls over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere goes your cover. Now you're stuck out in the open, momentarily hidden by the cloud of dust kicked up by the Vanguard. Better hope this camo works. You lie flat, not daring to move, as the bulky blue-and-yellow forms of NC infantry storm past, their heavy boots thudding inches from your face. Yet none of them see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is fantastic. This is even better than optic camo. I could - hrggh.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA steel-shod boot thuds into your ribs and an NC medic trips over your prone form, falling hard in the dirt, swearing. \"God damnit,\" she snarls, brushing red dust from her armour as she picks herself up. \"Those suits better cut me <i>two</i> bonus cheques for this. Stupid rock,\" she growls, kicking the offending \"rock\" hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bite your tongue to quench the yell of pain...</span></div></div>",

Shit, she sees you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leap up, barreling into her chest, knocking the gun from her hand and her feet out from under her. On top of her, you whip the force blade from your hip and drive it towards her chest. She grabs your wrist, the blade halting inches from her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-rock monster!\" she screams. \"Wait, Vanu?! The hell? This isn't even your fight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it,\" you reply through your mask. She is strong but your position is better, and you overpower her, driving the knife into her chest. She looks more annoyed than afraid, as blood spurts across her uniform. She grabs your shoulder in a death grip, pulling you closer, burbling through a mouth filling with blood, \"I'm coming back for you, Vanu. Very soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last of her life slips away, she thumps you weakly on the chest. The prototype flickers into life, disgorging its payload of reconstructive nanites before you can stop it. They swarm over you, and over the thing you're touching - the dead body of the NC woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel the painful sting of the nanites over every part of your skin. Not only are they eating away at your armour and helmet, they're seem to be stripping away the upper layer of your skin. You feel stabs of pain across your chest as nanite tendrils worm into your flesh. Your helmet disintegrates from around your head, and you feel the nanites inside your lungs as you suck in air. They're inside your organs, tearing you apart into your base molecules. A high scream of pain escapes your lips, and you fall back on to the desert floor, limbs spasming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the nanites halt and flow back into the prototype device, which falls from your chest into the sand. Weakly, you sit up. Your body feels... off... Alien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on Auraxis...\" You stare at your hands. The spandex is gone. Your hands are wrapped in brown leather gloves. Dirty, loose-fitting khaki material covers your arms, and a bulky blue shield generator rests awkwardly on your upper chest over a crude ballistic vest. It sits awkwardly, its weight cumbersome. Khaki combat fatigues and steel-shod boots cover your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA glance at the insignia on the shoulder pads confirms it. The camo device has given you an NC uniform, mimicked from the soldier you killed. Not bad. Not bad at all. A thick, sun-visor obscures your vision, and you lift your new helmet away from your head. As you thought, the red and white symbol of the medic adorns the helmet, just like the woman lying dead at your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cold noon wind blows through your hair, and a few strands of long, brown hair blow in front of your eyes. You grab them between your gloved fingers. This isn't right. You have blonde hair, not brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart begins to beat faster. Surely it couldn't have... You tear away the gloves. The skin of your hands is deep brown, far from the pallid complexion developed from months inside your full-body suit. You grab the chestpiece, worming the cumbersome armour over your head, and tearing open the ballistic vest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour bare breasts greet the chill desert wind. Stunned, your hands reach inside the combat fatigues, finding only a warm slit where your male member should be. You're a black New Conglomerate female medic, identical in all ways to the woman bleeding out in the sand, save for the mortal wound, thank Vanu. The nanites have been thorough. Not only is your armour and appearance hers, your weapons too. The recon device at your hip is now a medical applicator. Neither has your coms device been spared. Gone are the reassuring, grandfatherly tones of Vanu command. Instead the orders and war cries of trigger happy NC fill your ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReplacing the helmet, the HUD reappears in your vision. The radar draws your attention - five NC signatures are closing in on your position. Their footfalls grow closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour radio crackles into life. \"Sara, do you read me? Are you okay? The team is coming to you, stay where you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit. In about ten seconds, they're going to crest the hill and see you standing over the body of their fallen comrade. NC uniform or not, you're going to have a hard time explaining the situation, and why you so perfectly resemble the dead woman. You have no fear of death, not anymore, not after so many rebirths, but what worries you is that if they capture you, the existence of the TXF47 prototype will be exposed. That is something you can't allow to happen.</span></div></div>",

Oh how Josephine enjoyed that it was literally 'magic' with light flashes and everything, but what made her night perfect was the amount of love and joy in Mallie's deep purple eyes.<br>\r\nStreaching to get the kink out of her back it was only as she opened her eyes to check on her lover her eyes widened and a quiet 'oh shit' escaped her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMal was still soundlessly asleep beside her (how Josie didn't know, maybe a Qunari thing) that wasn't the problem the problem was the now imense size difference between Josephine and the Inquisitor (not that there wasn't already one) but everything else as well. She had shrunk.<br>\r\nJosie's gaze kept returning to Adaar, only the flaring of her nostrils and rise and fall of her now hill sized breasts revealing she was even alive. Josephine looked on in awe, when Mal was first announced as the Herald the mage's pale skin and curled horns peaked Josephine's intrest, with her quirky smile (and large breasts) keeping her coming back. <br>\r\nInquisitor Addar was a large a mysterious entity from the start,  but now to Josepheine she appeared larger than the statues of Andraste in most Chantrys and if at scale was powerful enough to destroy a city as large as Val Royoux without magic, Hell if it had been her that grew rather than Josie having shrunk she beleived the powerful Qunari could take Coryphyus out all by herself.<br>\r\nThe ambassidor's problem was how to deal with being shrunken, lost and unknown on her new lover's bed; should she try get her attention or wait for Mal to notice her and if she tried, how would she do so?</span></div></div>",

Robin was starting to wake up his eyes blinked a bit and he looked up and saw a giant Tharja looming over him. \"Hello dear.\" Tharja said grinning. \"Okay, this is a dream, I'm just gonna close my eyes and when I open them there won't be a giant Tharja in front of me.\" Robin said slowly and he closed his eyes and then opens them still seeing the giant Tharja looming over him and Robin looked more afraid then he has ever in his life which Is saying a lot. \"Okay this isn't a dream and I'm going to start freaking out now.\" Robin said slowly then he started screaming like crazy calling for help. Tharja quickly grabbed the timid tactician and stuffed him into her cleavage pressing her breasts together to prevent him from calling for help which he wasn't going to get. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja got to her tent and pulled out Robin who was ..crying? \"Do want you want with me there's nobody who's coming to save me and I'm left at your mercy and nobody would get suspicious if I disappeared.\" This was true as because he was so timid and shy despite being the tactician of chroms army he didn't really have any friends as he was always to intimidated by everyone else as as all of the sheperads with the exceptions of Ricken and nowi were taller than him. \"Don't be like that darling, I would never hurt you and admit it you like this do you?\" Tharja asked stroking the small tactician calming him down a bit. \"Actually I have to admit but you are actually the most beautiful woman I have ever seen and I actually have always had a thing for taller and older women.\" He said blushing a bit. \"Older!? Are you implying I'm old?\" Tharja hissed and Robin raised his hands defensively. \"No quite the opposite, I may not remember much but I'm only seventeen.\" \"Seventeen?\" \"Yeah why do you think I'm so short and young looking?\" \"Genetics?\" \"Well that's part of the reason but I guess I can take advantage of spending time with a sexy giantess, so what do you want to do?\" Robin asked with a little bit of confidence.</span></div></div>",

Tharja paled ''Shit, I need to hide you'' she quickly slide Robin back between her large breasts before turning around as an annoyed Lucina enters her tent. ''Tharja, where is Robin?'' the dark mage's eyes widen in surprise before answering ''I don't know princess, he asked for one day a week where I don't act as his shadow, it's part of my attempt to be 'normal' '' the bluenette scowls ''Well when you do find him, tell him father is looking for him'' ''Is it important?'' Tharja asked, curious as to whether to bring her tiny love to them or not (probably not) ''I don't know, father just asked me in passing to find him, and I assumed you'd know where he is as usual. Apparently not'' Lucina then turned and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n ''What's her problem?'' Robin asks as he peeks out of Tharja's cleavage ''Beats me, maybe she has a crush on you. Or maybe she just hates our kids'' Tharja answers, before her eyes bulge and she turns beet red ''Sorry about that, that was blunt and forward even for me'' ''It's okay Tharja, I know what you mean Lucina's from the future so she knows us from the future, such as any kids we eventually have. It might also explain why she always looked at me weird, she didn't know I was normal sized at anytime as I was probably this size in the future'' Tharja blinks in surprise ''You mean you want to stay this size?'' ''Honestly I kind of do, at first it was rather intimidating, particularly how huge you are, but I'm starting to get used to it, particularly those soft breasts of yours I feel so safe snuggling up to them'' Tharja grins ''Oh you're such a sweet talker, no wonder I'm keeping you forever'' Robin smiled and nuzzled her chest happily, both moan as Tharja squeezes her breasts around his tiny body . ''So what you want to do little cutie?'' Tharja asks as she sits on her bed, Robin is silent for a few minutes while he thinks about his options before answering...</span></div></div>",

Tharja laughed ''Well I was thinking boyfriend but if you prefer plaything...'' ''No, boyfriend is fine, great actually'' Robin stuttered as his face turned bright red. Robin was surprised, he was sure when Tharja shrunk him it was to be her little pleasure toy, something to be hidden away until she felt the need before being crushed against her huge tits, soft rear or even in... Robin blushed harder and tries to burrow himself further into her cleavage... but to think she wants him as a boyfriend, him timid little Robin, the boy with no past, it makes his heart soar that such a beautiful woman could desire him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey Tharja?'' ''Yes love'' ''Seeing as you've claimed me as your boyfriend, can I give you a kiss?'' Robin's answer came in the form of a squee, as Tharja's overjoyed he's come around so quickly (she was sure she needed another day and more boob squishing before he was actually participating) and plucked him from her cleavage and brought him up to her face. ''Well here I am lover'' she singsonged with a smile, Robin smiling too as he stepped close enough to her mouth to put a hand on each side before kissing her pouty lips. Tharja held herself still, letting her little man have his fun until she felt him lick her upper lip, after which she internally smirked and parted her lips just as she jostled Robin so he fell 'into' her mouth, shutting it behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was happily losing himself in the pleasure of kissing the goddess before him, Tharja tasting like a treat he would want forever when the 'wall' in front of him gave way and he plopped into dark and wet. ''Tharja!'' Robin yelled before he found himself being bounced around rather violently, her tongue flipping him from one side of her mouth to the other like some hard candy she'd stolen from Gaius. Once she was a little less crazy about it Robin actually started to enjoy it, covered in her saliva and being swirled around inside her mouth. The only slight problem was that her mouth was filling up as she wasn't swallowing, which in of itself was a good thing as Robin didn't want to find out if he was digestible or not yet (Spoiler: he would be just fine). Once the 'water' level rose beyond what he could swim in he began to yell for help, hoping Tharja would here him over her own near orgasmic moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTharja was in heaven, Robin had such a sweet taste with the slight tang that usually filled the air around magic users, the perfect taste in the dark mage's opinion. She was moaned and groaned as he was swirled around in her mouth, enjoying the feeling of him against her tongue and the roof of her mouth, until she heard him calling to be let out. She pouted but also thought back to what Robin intially thought was her reason for shrinking him: if he was her plaything she'd have no reason to care, in fact she could use this moment to remind him he still exists because he's hers and she decides his fate from now on. Hell she could just swallow him, remind him of just who owns him by making him spend the night in her belly, her hands subconsciously rubbing her flat stomach. But no, that wasn't her reason, she shrunk him because she loved him and wanted him to be hers, she didn't want him to be hurt, Grima be damned she used the potion that made the target invulnerable just to be sure, not just because of all the things she'd like to do to him that under normal circumstances would probably kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slight frown, Tharja tilts her head down and spits Robin out, the tactician falling and bouncing slightly when he reached the ground. When his vision returns he notices he's between Tharja's pale feet, the woman herself standing directly over him with her hands on her hips, grinning cheekily as she licks her lips of what remains of Robin's flavour ''Oh dearie, you feel so good, I'm never letting you go, ever'' Tharja moans, her long fingers ghosting over her breasts</span></div></div>",

He didn't like where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing extra careful to not let Robin's skin touch her's, Tharja took hold of Robin's sleeves, his arms dangling uselessly. Robin desperately tried to say something, anything, to get Tharja to stop, but what little sound he managed to make was incomprehensible. Even if he could have said something, he doubted Tharja would have listened. Slowly and carefully, Tharja raised Robin's arms closer and closer to her chest, until the moment they finally made contact with her exposed breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't exactly fondling, as much as Tharja would have loved that, as Robin's limp hands couldn't really get a grip, but Tharja still moaned as his hands pressed against her chest. Robin, of course, found no such pleasure in this action, and instead found his face turning bright red out of embarrassment. \"Any minute now,\" Tharja mumbled in bliss, not even looking at Robin's hands anymore. Robin was, though, and let out a gurgled shout as he saw what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, his hands were not only pressing up against Tharja's breasts, they were sinking inside! Desperately, he struggled to pull away, but the paralysis Tharja had inflicted was too strong. He could do nothing but watch as his hands were consumed by Tharja's supple flesh. Tharja seemed to be enjoying every minute of it, the hex being strangely pleasurable on her end. Eventually, Robin simply couldn't take it anymore, and by the time his hands had completely vanished up to his wrists, he passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know how much time had passed, but when he awoke, he could immediately tell something was very wrong.

It had once been Mia's personal office, and due to what had occurred in the room, Phoenix had been avoiding it for several years. But after taking care of all the lingering things holding Mia to his Earth, Phoenix felt like he was able to clean it out and start using the room again. Most of what he'd found so far was case files, but now he was digging through a box labeled \"Kurain\". Most of it was old robes and magatamas and stuff like that, but at the very bottom was an ancient parchment scroll with a piece of printed paper right next to it. Phoenix grabbed the scroll, feeling a warmth pass from it to him for a moment, then read the letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found this scroll back at home, hidden in a secret compartment in the Fey family home. I felt as though it passed something onto me as a touched it, and I spent years finding the language it was written in. It was Khura'inese, confirming an old suspicion I'd had that my family had immigrated to Japan from the rarely heard of Asian nation. The scroll offers a powerful ability to all who touch it, regardless of their spiritual ability. They can channel the dead, like any Fey medium, but not completely. They gain the body of the target, but it's incomplete somehow. I don't think anyone should know this exists, but maybe I'm wrong. Phoenix, if you read this, try it out, see for yourself. At the very least, it should thumb the nose at those village elders.\"</span></div></div>",

His immediate instinct was to doubt that this could be true, but the scroll had given him that feeling when he touched it, and this was Mia's writing style. But what did she mean by 'incomplete'? Should he really give this a try? What he didn't realize was, as he was thinking all of this, he was picturing Mia a lot in his mind, and his body began changing without him noticing. A new pair of breasts, a new set of genitalia, and a beauty mark on one cheek. In less than a minute, Phoenix had completely transformed into Mia Fey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until, looking down at the letter again, he noticed the cleavage that was barely contained by his now baggy suit. Looking over the rest of his body, his mind began racing, and he stood up and ran over to a mirror on the wall and saw Mia's body, wearing his blue suit and with his spiky hair, staring back at him. He realized what had happened...he'd channeled his late mentor! But that couldn't be, he was still thinking like himself...was that what she meant by 'incomplete'? Just the body, but no memories? Feeling a little uncomfortable in a <i>very</i> feminine body, Phoenix concentrated on his old body, on turning back, but when he opened his eyes nothing had changed. Letting out a breathy sigh, Phoenix realized that until further notice he was stuck like this. Looking back to the mirror, he knew that it wouldn't look right to walk around in a suit this baggy, it looked awful on him. He didn't even notice how odd that thought was, how unlike him it was. Instead, he thought of options. It was a good thing he'd been sorting through these boxes, he'd already found another set of Mia's work clothes (though they looked like they were the kind she'd been wearing when they first met), some casual clothes, and her medium robes. What to wear?</span></div></div>",

After stripping out of his suit and pants, trying his best not to focus on the naked breasts on his chest or the boxes currently straining against his wide hips and thick ass, Phoenix pulled out the clothes he'd already folded and set aside, and began to get dressed. It was his first time ever putting on a skirt, but somehow Phoenix managed to get it on and situated correctly rather quickly. The jacket came next, then the scarf with her own magatama and lastly her shoes. Looking in the mirror once more, completely dressed, for a moment Phoenix didn't even notice anything was wrong, as if the body looking back at him was the one that should be there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he shook his head, wondering why he'd been feeling that way. This caused his breasts to start jiggling quite a bit, Phoenix letting out a sigh. With no spare bra to be found, it was looking like going braless was going to have its downsides. A look a purpose washed over his beautiful face as Phoenix focused. First, he pictured his regular body again, willing himself to turn back, but once again nothing happened. He could go and visit Sister Bikini as Hazakura Temple, she may know something about this scroll, and how to turn back. Or he could just try and wait it out, go through his day like normal and keep trying to turn back.</span></div></div>",

After picking out <i>California Criminal Law Volume 1</i>, Phoenix started reading and found himself very confused on why he'd never actually bothered to read any of these books before. After all, he was a lawyer, correct?

His conversation skills also seemed a lot sharper and more refined, making it all more natural than it had ever felt before to him.

Finally, Phoenix said, \"Gumshoe, what's going on?

It's called Cafe de Nash.\" After giving him some more complex directions, and a short drive there, they were seated at an outdoor table across from each other and left with the menu. Looking through it, Phoenix was surprised. He'd always heard Mia loved this place, so he thought it would be a good idea, but Phoenix was always a classic burger and fries kind of guy, he didn't explore new foods too often. But there were a lot of interesting dishes on the lunch menu that were actually catching his eye, and he was having issues picking which one to choose. \"I'm have troubles deciding,\" he told Gumshoe. \"What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here, pal,\" he replied, also closely inspecting the dishes. \"I'm really stuck between the marinated lamb chops and the chicken with a garlic butter sauce and pasta.\" Those were actually the two that Phoenix was drawn the most to as well, which he told to Gumshoe. Smiling, Gumshoe offered, \"How about we each get one, and we can share?\" Nodding, Phoenix gave his order soon after when the waiter came over, the chicken and pasta dish, and Gumshoe followed by ordering the lamb. They filled the space of waiting for their food with amiable chatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his immense surprise, Phoenix was having a great time, even if he caught Gumshoe staring at his breasts more than once. That was easily forgiven though. After all the outfit did put them out there, and he wasn't wearing a bra. Before too long the food was brought out, and each of them found themselves loving their dishes. It wasn't something Phoenix ever would have tried, but for some reason it just tasted wonderful. Getting a good forkful of the pasta, Phoenix extended it to Gumshoe. \"Here, try a bite.\" Blushing, the detective leaned forward to take the bite, then offered the same to Phoenix from his own plate. Once they were full, Phoenix had the waiter get them to-go boxes and paid the check, unperturbed by the amount.</span></div></div>",

That done, he took his delicate hands and began to undress his date, to which Gumshoe offered no rebuke or refusal. Far from it, once the pants were off, Phoenix could clearly see the outline of a bulge in his underwear, one that was quite hard already and growing only stiffer. It made him freeze for a second, but then, at the command of a stray thought, he fearlessly caressed it, feeling the organ's heat. \"Uh, are you sure about this, pal?\" Gumshoe asked, with the last bit of resistance he had in him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question hit Phoenix hard, making him stop before pulling down the last piece of clothing on Gumshoe.

Then, he finished the job and they were both naked.

As much as spirit mediums had helped him throughout his career, there was always that undeniable danger that came with them. His mind flashed to the recent summoning of Dahlia Hawthorne, the woman he'd once thought was his girlfriend in college. Graceful, beautiful, but undeniably evil. Suddenly, Phoenix felt his entire body heat up, and with a start he realized what was happening. Looking down, he saw his body changing, shrinking smaller and becoming slight and feminine. When all was said and done, he was basically swimming in his own clothes, wearing the body of Dahlia Hawthorne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Phoenix ran to the bathroom to confirm this in the mirror, and sure enough staring back at him was Iris's twin, back from the dead. That's when he realized something odd: he was still himself. Sure, he looked like Dahlia, but he hadn't lost consciousness, and her mind hadn't overtaken his body. Was that what Mia meant by incomplete? Well, who really cared about whatever she thought. It wasn't like her knowledge of this stuff saved her. The cruel thoughts went smoothly through Phoenix's head, and he felt his beautiful face go pale as he realized what they meant. He may still be himself, but there was something of Dahlia still there.</span></div></div>",

Still, how was he going to handle this? He didn't have any chloroform on him, or poison or a weapon...Phoenix shook his head. No! Bad Dahlia thoughts! Well, hopefully he would just leave...then the door to the back room opened and Larry walked in. \"Iris? What are you doing here? And why are you wearing Nick's suit, and why's your hair look like his?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's right! Phoenix thought quickly. With his own natural black hair, Dahlia looked more like Iris. Putting on a shy, timid impersonation of Iris that came quickly and scarily easily, Phoenix said, \"Oh, hello Larry. It's good to see you again. You see, Feenie gave me a key to his office, and I was planning on surprising him like this.

She was really able to get a glimpse into how her ex-girlfriend had been able to live her life that way: she just didn\u2019t care. Other people were things to give her pleasure, and the two best ways to do that was through sadistic emotional manipulation and sex. After a while, it became impossible for her to think of Larry as anything other than <i>hers</i>, and the power and satisfaction that came from that was like nothing she\u2019d ever gotten as Phoenix Wright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she was still Phoenix, deep down inside. She remembered waking up in her real body, and the dread and disgust she felt when she\u2019d looked back on her actions. What she was doing was wrong, period. It was Dahlia\u2019s twisted personality that made those evil actions fun, pleasurable, and when she become herself again she knew that she\u2019d regret every single one of them. The smartest thing to do would be to wait out the time limit without doing anything to hurt anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what fun was the smart thing to do? What had doing the smart thing, or the moral thing, ever gotten Phoenix Wright but heartbreak and pain? Phoenix shook her head. Those were Dahlia thoughts, she knew that. But they were so...inviting. There was that temptation, that pull, to just give up ever really being Phoenix Wright again. She could channel Dahlia over and over, every time it ran out, take a new name, live a new life, and live it in a way that would be nothing but excitement and ecstasy from beginning to end.</span></div></div>",

But then she tried to throw off some of that haziness that had been seeping into her brain, and focused.

It gives any who touches it the ability to channel any deceased person, regardless of their spiritual power. However, they only copy the spirit, they do not take it into their body.

None of this was like Maya...but maybe it was like the woman she was channeling. \"Maya, listen to me: think for a second. Take a deep breath. You and I aren't a thing, we don't do that. You're not acting like yourself. What if this is because of that weird channeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Maya wanted to do was snap at Phoenix, to say mean hurtful things to him for what he was implying. Her second response that came to mind would be to kiss him deeply, shut him up that way, then he's see things the way she wanted him to. It was only after those two scenarios played out in her mind that Maya realized what was going on and shook her head, fighting the Cherie personality. \"Nick, I think you're right. What am I going to do, every since I became this woman I've been thinking and feeling such awful things, and I don't want to do that anymore!\"</span></div></div>",

It wasn\u2019t the most relieved Phoenix had ever been to see her okay, since she constantly got into more dangerous situations than that, but he was still happy to see she was back to her normal self. Clearing his throat, Phoenix quietly said, \u201cMaya?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Maya blinked her eyes open and looked over to Phoenix.

She needed to be less aggressive, less confrontational, more eager to please, that kind of stuff. Now, part of the style was also being dumb, but she didn't want to actually make her friend stupid.

Still, Mr. Wright, or rather, Phoenix, made up for that quite well. He was quite the flatterer, and if Pauline hadn\u2019t been well aware of her beauty, she would have thought he was using his impressive bluffing skills the entire dinner.

Either he surrendered to the oni, giving it part of his mind as a peace offering to stop is from influencing him so overtly, or he resisted and find himself dealing with twice as much anger and resentment. In the end, there was really only one option that he could approve of. Reaching out with one hand, Phoenix told her, \"I accept your offer.\" She took his hand in shook in, then in a second she was gone, and Phoenix was in the oni body once again, his hand reaching out to nothing. He didn't feel any different, but then a heat filled his body, filled his mind, and suddenly he awoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the room, Phoenix rose from the bed and stretched, and it suddenly hit her that her body felt so much more natural now. It was like she had never had any other body, and even trying to think back to how she'd felt as a male human just felt wrong, like it was a dream of a life she'd never lived. Remembering what the oni had told her in her dream, Phoenix suddenly started thinking about magic, and immediately knew how to cast dozens of spells. She could create a weapon out of thin air, teleport, throw fireballs, it was insane. Intellectually, she knew that the deal had changed her mind, that normally such magic and her body would have felt foreign, but Phoenix couldn't feel upset at the deal. After all, in that moment, she quite liked how it had worked out.</span></div></div>",

The heat felt foreign, uncomfortable, yet pleasurable somehow at the same time. She became shorter, her body plumping out as it contracted until she had a plump stomach resting comfortably past her waistline. Her entire body became covered in brown fur as her head became more animal-like, with a muzzle and animal ears. Her clothes all disappeared, leaving her in just a loin cloth that replaced her normal underwear, though she was allowed to keep her top hat, now brown instead of blue. The last change was the strangest, as she lost the genitals she'd known all her life for a cock and large balls, barely contained in her new loin cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut somehow, it was still Trucy's mind inside. Scared, she opened her eyes and looked down to see the changes that had befallen her. She was some sort of animal person, and the strangeness of her new body made her feel weird, but something about the wrongness of it also called to her, made her feel excited.

Once they reached their destination, Jinxie looked at Trucy with sadness and fear. \"I-I'm so sorry Trucy! This is all my fault, this terrible Yokai has taken possession of your body, and who knows what will happen if I can't remove it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting one furry hand on her shoulder, Trucy tipped Jinxie's face up so they could meet eyes. \"Jinxie, it's going to be okay. I know you'll do everything in your power to help me.\" Feeling suddenly tired, Trucy then asked. \"Is it okay if I take a nap? I'm exhausted.\" After getting directions to a spare bed, Trucy laid down and quickly fell asleep.

In it, Trucy snuck out of the house in the middle of the night, stole one of the other yokai jars, and broke it next to Jinxie, filling her friend with a demon of her own. He also imbued the dream with the flavor of fun mischief, as if there'd be no consequences, just a good laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt worked, and Trucy woke up giggling. It was still well before dawn, and Trucy started thinking about that weird dream. Was there any actual harm in doing that? After all, Jinxie made it seem like removing the yokai from Trucy wouldn't be too difficult, so giving her a yokai was nothing to worry about. Not even thinking over how odd that line of logic was, Trucy quietly got out of bed, still in just a loincloth, and sneaked through the town, taking another jar from ancient building. Before Jinxie could wake up, Trucy took a hammer and smashed a whole in the pot, right next to Jinxie's head, and she watched the yokai enter her friend's body, only now realizing that maybe this was a bad idea.</span></div></div>",

The students stared at him silently, while the teachers stared at him with open hostility. Dumbledore's eyes flashed icily behind his half-moon spectacles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor McGonagall, holding the Sorting Hat, looked down at him, her lips tightly pursed in distaste, like she was sucking on something sour. \"Well you've made your choice,\" she said coldly. \"Now off with you.

Professor, I don't understand...\" he stammered.

You will be placed in the Kitchens, to serve as a housemaid to the school, until your guardians deem to remove you from our care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom within her robes, the transfiguration drew her wand, pointing it at the boy who lived. She tapped the tip against Harry's nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe long, first year robes that Harry had purchased with Hagrid in Diagon Alley melted away in a flurry of silver sparks. Harry gasped as the air touched his skin. He was naked in the Great Hall! But not for long. A knee-length black skirt hemmed with white lace materialized around his hips, while dark, sheer stockings crawled up his legs like living things, squirming over his skin to halt just above his knobbly knees. A ribbed corset sprang into existence and sealed around his chest, the lacing already pulling tight by unseen hands. Harry's gaped to see the large cups that sat empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears began to well up in his eyes. This couldn't be happening. He was going to be a wizard. He was going to be special! To take it all away now was too cruel. \"Please...\" he pleaded. \"I don't understand. Let me try the Hat again. I'll join Slytherin, I swear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, pity softening her features. \"I'm sorry, Harry. The Hat's word is final. Such a shame, you would have made a good wizard. Your parents would have been proud of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a pneumatic hiss, like a balloon inflating, Harry's chest blossomed, nipples swelling into buds in a seconds, which became pert breasts, maturing to heavy, freckle-spotted tits that spilled out over the lip of the corset, forming a proud, soft bosom that would not have looked out of place on Molly Weasley. His pelvis snapped and cracked as his hips widened and his thighs thickened. His tousled hair spilled down in raven locks that framed his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor...\" he said, but stopped, shocked at the low, sultry voice that came from between his rosy lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough,\" McGonagall snapped. \"The feast will be starting soon, and dessert has to be prepared. Go to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flick of her wand, Harry was propelled towards the door and through it into the hot, steamy air of the castle kitchens beyond. House-elves scuttelled around his ankles, carrying heaped pyramids of food, trembling towers of trifle. The door slammed behind him.</span></div></div>",

The two friends had been through more things than either of them liked to talk about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Harry didn't know was that a wizarding stag night was a little more extreme than a muggle one. He was glad to leave the bar, and was trying to work out how to suggest to Ron that it was time to call it a night. The rain was falling heavily and the Knight Bus didn't take drunken wizards, so the pair were left walking the damp London streets. It would take half an hour to walk from Soho back to the Leaky Cauldron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One last pit-stop.\" Ron suggested pointing to a strip club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was glad for a chance to get dry, and shelter from the persistent rain. Besides this didn't look low-rent or sleazy, well not very sleazy. He had even heard of this one, a part of an American franchise, so he knew or at least hoped he wouldn't be mugged, robbed or ripped off once he was inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh he followed Ron as he disappeared inside. Harry really wished Hermione was here... well <i>not here: here.</i> But here, with him and Ron to share memories and stories. It was hard to read Ron's feelings at the best of times, but especially now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cast one last look up at the dark sky. There wasn't a break in the clouds, and the rain continued relentlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paid his admission, and spotted Ron at a small table near the stage. Two glasses already on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not getting a lap dance.\" he said forcefully as he sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Harry, nobody is offering you one, and you're old enough to pay for your own anyway.\" he chuckled over the edge of his glass. He took a deep swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To a new member for the Weasley family.\" He held his glass out. Harry chinked them together and took a hearty swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taste was vile, \"What is this?\" he asked, as Ron seemed to be enjoying his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's polyjuice potion.\" he chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry felt his stomach writhe and shift, he was going to be sick, very sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe doubled over as his stomach cramped fiercely, as his shoulder lay on the table he had a good view of the floor. There was a red plastic there, waiting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed it and retched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why...  who...\" he tried to ask as Ron supped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all Ron did was smile enigmatically, until with a nod of his head he tilted it towards the pneumatic blond dancer spinning around the brass pole.</span></div></div>",

He just thinks I'm an anonymous stripper, a squib.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's show them a good time, and how much we can enjoy this too.\" she giggled as she held out and identical outfit to Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took it in trembling finger, handling it like a poisonous snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Hermione's out there too. And <b><i>he</i></b> won't let things get too out of hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe revelation of Hermione watching her doing a strip tease made Harry's body feel very odd and uncomfortable. But she knew that Ron would never upset her. He was just too intimidated by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny's hands ran over Harry's body teasing and tweaking it as she stripped his poorly fitting male clothes away. They revealed a spectacular body beneath. Even that tiny mole just above her nipple was there too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he decided to make Ron the one who would blush to recall tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's needed Ginny's help putting on the risque outfit, as he had no experience with such finery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after some tugging and adjustment, the twins were fully satisfied and ready to take to the stage.</span></div></div>",

We've been standing out there ages! You trying to give us pneumonia?\" George Weasley grumbled. He broke into a toothy grin at the sight of Harry. Bleached-blonde curls were spilling out from within his unruly black hair, spilling out over a shifting, rapidly-feminizing face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, George. I couldn't find a time to slip it into his drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You planned this?\" Harry gasped, retching again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall figure of William Weasley stepped forward, smiling down at him with his scarred face. \"We don't know how things work in the muggle world, Harry, but in the wizarding world, it's the brothers of the bride that get all the fun. After all, we're the ones giving away our sister. Why should the groom get all the fun? Besides, it shows commitment on your part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what shows commitment?\" Harry stared at his hands, as the molten flesh settled into its new shape - thin, delicate fingers that would look perfect around a man's cock, complete with long, pink-painted nails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The lapdance, Harry!\" Bill beamed, throwing himself down into one of the seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry jumped as a heavy hand slapped him across the arse. Turning, he found himself staring up at the weather-beaten face of Charlie Weasley, the dragon tamer. \"All the way from Romania for this, so you better not disappoint,\" he said gruffly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the transformation settled, the room blurred. George plucked the glasses from his shrunken nose, and the world came back into focus. \"Doubt you'll need these for the rest of the night, Harry.\" His eyes ran over the young hero's luscious curves beneath his clothes. \"Or these,\" he said, his hands gripping Harry's robes.</span></div></div>",

As he clutches his clothes, his hands brush against his swollen and much more sensitive nipples. Harry lets out an audible and quite sensual gasp. Long blonde curls fall past his face, as it is the last to change. Changing the former Gryffindor into just another pneumatic stripper with bleach blonde hair, and a body enchanted for pleasure. Shaking his head, he steps on the bottom of the trouser leg, already having stepped out of his shoes. He tries to force his way past his friends but with his diminished height and reduced muscles it is never going to happen. In fact, they are rather enjoying the new woman pressing her lush body against theirs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout her hands to defend herself, her shoulder sink in defeat and she turns back towards the stage. She watches as her twin steps off the stage, and onto his table. As she steps down George and Fred each help her, taking an outstretched arm and lowering her to the floor like a choreographed move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dancer offers Harry her hand, she takes takes it. Harry sees it as the fastest way to end this nightmare. But there is one consolation, at least Hermione isn't here to see this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he approached the table again, he couldn't help but imagine how many cocks this slut had taken in her career. Before her cheeks went red as she imagined herself on her knees, before her friends. As they were unable to tell the girls apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he could have one little piece of revenge even if it was petty, and made him look like he was taking on his role. With a quick hand Harry grabbed her glass from the table, and threw the contents into Ron's laughing face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spluttered and coughed wiping the liquid from his face, and using a rag to soak up the residue from around his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get our girl properly attired.\" the dancer suggests, lewdly as she lead Harry numbly back stage by the hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a low voice, \"Just roll with it Harry, it's only done in fun. Oh... and you can call me Suzy, and I'll call you Lizzy. That'll please the boys\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before she disappeared behind the bead curtain she called out, \"Do you boys like it when naughty twins dress the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzy didn't need to look backwards as they erupted in approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry could only blush, and look in disbelief at Suzy's outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind the bar, the bartender was idly wiping a glass dry. From his expression this was an all too familiar routine for a wizarding stag do. But there was a sparkle hidden in his eye, too, that suggested this was more personal.</span></div></div>",

Which already hint at her lush body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tries to get her talking, do anything to delay her inevitable, and his first trip onto the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys are already getting restless, as a chant of 'Harry....   Harry....   Harry....   \" filters back stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you really Harry Potter?\" she asks blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis puts Harry on more familiar ground, as most wizards still have trouble when they meet him in person. Although, this is the first time it is with a blushing naked woman, who isn't blushing because she's nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods, and asks her where she studied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she answers, Harry doesn't want to confess that he'd never heard of the place. But she reads his... her own face rather easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a great school, like Hogwarts.\" she doesn't sound upset or resentful as she talks. Harry works her head out of the T-shirt nodding as she listened to Suzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a school for squibs.\" her voice does crack a little as she says 'squibs'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had always considered it an offensive term, like mud-blood and avoided using it. That just seemed ... well ... the most polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harry struggles when the T-shirt gets caught in her longer and unfamiliar hair, as she tried to tug it loose there was an unsettling movement from her chest. Suzy re-assures Harry, \"While it was difficult, we all managed to master a few spells, and this is one of mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry felt a tap on her head, and before her eyes her clothes faded away like mist on a warm winter morning. Now completely nude, Harry had to take in her current situation. She couldn't pretend it was a glamour or some other trick. She saw her reflection in a mirror, naked as the day Suzy was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry looked around for some clothes to wear. But she felt a little off-put by what she could see. Naturally enough there was female clothes on most tables, chairs and even hanging from the back of a couple of chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hand tickled over some ivory silk panties, and she snatched it back. It just felt wrong.... she was a boy .... she shouldn't be .... shouldn't even considering wearing these things....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over to Suzy like a child needing some guidance. But she was rather enjoying the sight of this rather submissive and timid version of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, it feels good to wear these things.\" she cooed to Lizzy as she was now considering the former boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were a Gryffindor...? Weren't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer question was sort of sweet, Harry was used to people knowing pretty much every detail of his life. Upon occasion, even correcting him about some of the smaller things. He felt himself relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I was in Gryffindor.\" Harry/Lizzy grabbed her throat... now they even sounded the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh goody. I have a wicked idea.\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vestiti feminus maximal.\" she chanted, and again tapped him on the forehead with her slender wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the empty air. Lizzy felt her body become more restrained, as a bra formed at her shoulders. The cups forming, then lifting and enhancing her cleavage. As Lizzy gaped down at the impressive quantity of flesh on display. With a yelp, she started forward, unlikeable sensation coming from her rear, as a thong now raced between her cheeks. The satin smoothly rejoining at the front. Lizzy looked between her breasts at the new panties, as they smoothly ... so smoothly covered her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even that sight vanished, as she felt a miniskirt start to from. This was no regulation uniform. Being barely 5 or 6 inches, it didn't even cover her ass. Lizzy pulled at it, hoping it would somehow stretch to cover more.... but it stayed the exact same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her shoulders a semi-transparent blouse started to form. She gave a gasp, as the buttons fastened themselves. It too enhanced her curves. It was two sizes too small, and the outline of the bra and her own nipples were clear to anybody with eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blouse had finished materialising, leaving her with an exposed midriff. She felt a sharp prick, so grasped her stomach. A new piercing had arrived to decorate Lizzy's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her delicate fingers she guessed it was a lion rampant, -the lion rampant- for Gryffindor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she could verify it in a mirror, she felt a jumper appear over the top of the blouse. The chanting was getting impatient from the boys... Louder and louder...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Lizzy looked back from the curtain to her reflection the magic was complete. She was dressed as a slutty Gryffindor. The house badge on her jumper obscenely distorted by her impressive breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath and tried to gather her thoughts. But as she did that she saw how that affected her reflection. Her chest seemed to be magical... it was certainly hypnotic....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Suzy what do we do now... do we need to plan a routine... or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked across, Lizzy saw her twin identically dressed... identically apart from the Slytherin snake on her jumper....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzy twisted and turned admiring her own reflection as Harry watched feeling a deep humiliation, but also oddly very comfortable in these clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One last thing.\" Suzy stepped in close and before Lizzy could object planted a kiss full on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Momentum Graciosa.\" she whispered in Lizzy's ear. Touching her pussy with the tip of her wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy felt her mind fill with the knowledge of how to dance, more specifically how to strip.....</span></div></div>",

Lizzy still feels nervous, although her body just knows what to do. It's the damned spotlight she can't see anything beyond outlines at the tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the reach the end of the walk, they circle around each other and the pole. Their hands tracing out the curves of each other's breasts, asses and stomachs. The girls blow kisses to one another, and fake orgasmic gasps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the music changes tempo. Suzy switches to caressing the brass pole. Soon she is humping it, her back arched in ecstasy as she writhes. Lizzy bends down low, to get nearer the drinkers. She keeps her back straight and her breasts jutting out proudly, as she settles down, her ass rests on the top of her heels, and her knees are spread wide apart giving the table a clear view of .... well everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she does this, the spotlight finally climbs out of her eyeline. Lizzy is already smiling and pouting to the boys. But her smile widens, and some sincerity shows in her expression as she sees that sitting in Ron's spot is a rather annoyed looking pneumatic blonde. Ron must have swallowed some of his own concotion. Her arms crossed furiously under her bust. They lift it up and make it clearer to everyone sitting around the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy looks directly at her friend and blows him a kiss as she winks. Her scowl and frown, make Harry smile on the inside, and Lizzy smile even wider on the outside. Clearly she doesn't realise quite how hot and sexy her pouty frown look to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name, pretty lady?\" Lizzy asks Ron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't answer, but the table erupts with suggestions. Each one wonderfully, filled with bimbo simplicity and the odd one just plain crude, and pornographic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind Lizzy, her twin has her ass jutting out, wiggling it seductively, before turning to watch the reaction she has on the audience. Suzy struts around the pole, slowly almost stamping her feet, every pace makes her flesh move and shake hypnotically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy scrunches her nose, and Ron tries to smile back at her.

She spun her tiny jumper with a free hand, while her breasts danced inside the tight, tiny blouse. Until she threw it into the outstreched arms of a spectator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lizzy reached her she caressed her from her shoulder to her hips. Suzy let out a shuddering gasp. Before letting her mouth hang open. Lizzy slid her hips from side to side, her back to the crowd, jiggling her ass as she slid her jumper up and over her head. As she pulled her arms free of the sleeve, they caught on her wand. Harry had tucked it in the sleeve... just as a safety precaution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled her wand out from where she had hidden it once Suzy had magicked up her outfit. Whatever her form she wasn't going to be vulnerable to dark attack. The battle of Hogwarts was three years in the past, but some still felt the need for revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned back to face the main table, sucking the tip of the wand seductively. She settled down settling in her knees, keeping her head low she looked up at Ron, allowing her hair to frame her face and her cleavage to underline her sexy kittenish expression. Removing the wand she waved it harmlessly in the air...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Accio Glass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hoped to snatch the drink from the table and soak the lecherous drinkers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, even this simple spell refused to work.

It also made her look, exactly as she felt which was unwilling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry in Lizzy's body was still caught off guard, not sure if it was part of the act or not, as Suzy suddenly ripped off the last few buttons, leaving her exposed in only a bra, thong and a very, very brief miniskirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys roared their approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir appreciation doubled as Lizzy followed her twin's example, and wrenched Suzy's blouse away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Suzy loved the attention, bouncing her breasts in the faces of all the whooping and hollering men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must have caught Lizzy's attempt at magic too, as she pulled her wand out. She tickled the tip with her outstretched tongue, giving it a sensual flick. Coquettishly she put the tip in her mouth, and gazed deep into Percy's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPercy blushed redder than his hair, looking away as she winked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she drew it out her mouth, and ran it down her body leaving a glistening trail down her dished and taut stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slid it around her waist, before popping it out between her legs like a faux-cock. She blushed and put her free hand across her open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then the tip glowed, and a shower of sparks shot from it. Hitting Ron in the face. It must be magically guided as they splashed there before running down her face. Ron's hands wiped frantically at the magical residue, passing through it effectlessly.</span></div></div>",

It was salty but not too much, not unpleasantly so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe recalled offering some to Hermione, and she'd loved the taste. She too thought it was salty but oddly sweet..... As she considered the flavour, her jaw suddenly snapped shut and she fell very quiet a deep blush filling her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Ron knew what the taste was, she stopped licking her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzy saw the realisation dawn on Ron's face, and she smiled widely at her, and nodded slowly in confirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzy stepped from the stage onto the table. It wobbled slightly, but she still went down on her knees gracefully. Her ass inches away from Percy's face. Her cleavage in danger of knocking over George's drink. Although that would never happen without being closesly observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snuggled down, like a kitten into a cosy jumper. All eyes on her Ron was glad not to be the centre of attention. While on the stage Lizzy was almost eager for the show to end. She couldn't complete the striptease without anyone watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bartender watched with a distracted smirk, idly drying a glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Suzy's hand darted out and she tapped Ron in the centre of the forehead with her wand. Instantly her clothes started to fade, growing fainter and fainter, until just before turning transparent they transformed into smoke and ascended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that remained to clothe the youngest Weasley brother was a well-filled bikini. Her nipples were barely covered by the top, and the bottoms were thongs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Ron broke... She started up from the table, she glanced back to the front door. But then headed off behind the stage. Even the dancer's outfits were more demure... more .... welll just more .... more of them to wear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts and ass drew every eye, as she passed through the bead curtain and out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzy stepped back onto the main stage. \"Let's finish this now.\" She whispered to Lizzy, before licking her ear.</span></div></div>",

Slowly she wrapped her fingers around the neck of the bottle. She gave Ron a slow seductive wink, and teasingly pulled herself back upright to the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising it to her mouth, she paused, dragging her tongue around the lip of the bottle. A chorus of cheering and stamping erupted from the table. She felt Suzy's fingers weave down her spine tracing each vertebrae as they went. As they reached the base of her spine, she felt a sharp tug. With a theatrical flash, she whipped away the micro-miniskirt. Leaving Lizzy, in her well filled top, and thong panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thongs were crimson silk, and the leather ties a golden yellow, a roaring lion carefully stitched on the front. It was the leather thong that held Lizzy's wand against her smooth and round thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe refused to be distracted by Suzy's action. Instead she focused on keeping the guys attention. With the bottle held firmly in her mouth, she tilted her head backwards, shaking her mane of hair behind her with a wild toss. Her throat worked, as she swallowed gulp after gulp of the beer. They were hammering the table with their fists in time to each gulp. Lizzy's nostrils flared, as the last remnants disappeared down her throat. Slowly, the neck of the bottle sank deeper into Lizzy's mouth, as she made to deep-throat the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis drew a murmur of appreciation, and even a couple of claps. Before it could go too far, she huffed with all her strength, propelling the bottle upwards. Catching it in mid air, she sank into a sensual kneeling pose. Her legs wide, as she held her arms wide. Behind her Suzy, slid her own hands down Lizzy's sweat slicked flank before spreading them wide, and shaking her fingers to complete the display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was incredible.\" Suzy whispered into Harry's ears. Lizzy barely heard her over the pulsing blood in her ears, and her own gasping breath. Her tiny hands resting on Lizzy's shoulders, more than enough to hold the exhausted Gryffindor in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the boys deserve a final treat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzy's fingers tightened around the shaft of her wand. The wand pointed meaningfully into Lizzy's rounded and well supported cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alohamora.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clasp of Lizzy's bra opened on command, and the girls broke free. Veronica didn't know where to look herself, sinking lower into her seat. Suzy rose elegantly to her feet, and Lizzy heard her retreating feet as she trotted off the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally free to get up, Lizzy spared the boys an embarrassed smile. Though whether she was embarrassed for them or herself, she wasn't sure. But, she bowed, then turned and bowed again giving them a view of her round and firm ass, before trotting off stage herself. She did make sure to put enough of a bounce in her step to keep their attention until she vanished behind the curtain.</span></div></div>",

Nobody paid any attention to the bartender, as he finished drying the glass. A task that had taken him at least five minutes. Nobody noticed as he too headed towards the back stage area and the performers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were raised voices that the closed door wasn't muffling. They sounded worried, and shrill rather than angry. Although there was a tremble of panic in one of them. Suppressing his smile, the bartender knocked on the door. He didn't wait for more than a couple of seconds before opening it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three women turned to face the new arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jerry.\" Suzy blurted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry slipped inside, and took in the curves of the ladies, her gaze a touch dispassionate as it roamed over them. A heavy silence radiated from the three, as they waited on Jerry finishing his leering and delivering his message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further words, he landed a resounding blow on Veronica's generous ass.

None of them wanted to spook Harry or his new audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasting his eyes back, she saw that Suzy was now giving the man a lap dance. Her ass shaking and shimmying inches above his crotch. The struggle was clear on the man's face as he fought not to grope or even touch the dancer. A dancer teasing him relentlessly. She leaned forward over the table, thrusting her ass in the man's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave it a shake, and it rippled and rolled, inches from his face. Straightening up, she turned to face him. Draping her hands on his shoulders, she shook her shoulders from side to side. Instantly his eyes were drawn to the dancing titties, as they fought to escape her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy's gaze was drawn to, and caught by the erection that was shockingly visible in the man's trousers. Idly, she guessed his size. He was quite an impressive man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were disrupted as a hand landed on her shoulder. She almost screamed in shock. Whirling around, she saw Ron, or rather the Veronica. Her cheeks were as crimson as Ron's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy took a moment to enjoy Ronni's choice of clothes. The girl in front of her was clearly a Ronni, rather than a Veronica. Her outfit lacked class, and sophistication in every way. Lizzy was glad (hell relieved) she'd got dressed first, that was what Ronni was left with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wore a rubber mini-skirt. Although it could almost have doubled as a belt. Her round ass cheeks were hanging out the bottom, and everything (everything) would be on display if she bent over to tie a shoe lace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wobbled uncertainly on pink skyscaper heels. Her tits threatened to burst out of a too small white T-shirt. The word's 'Contestant' were stretched across the front. Even now, the dark areola were visible through the thin, barely there material. The nipple itself was striving to poke through it, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't even have a coat, to pull closed over her outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonni shrugged, as she spotted where Lizzy gaze fell. \"They were in a drawer, a whole bunch of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy's smile revealed perfect pearly teeth, as she guessed their purpose. It was too much fun to keep to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ronni, sweetie. I think those are for the wet T-shirt contests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonni squirmed, as she struggled to cover herself better. But her skirt wasn't obliging, and her T-shirt remained just a tease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's good humour evaporated, as Ron grew more flustered. Turning back to peer through the curtain, she gasped as she saw Suzy approach the stag party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeigning reluctance, George passed over a tiny phial to Suzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPopping the top off the bottle, she looked directly over to Harry's position, and shot him an amused wink before swallowing the potion in a single gulp.</span></div></div>",

It hung loosely on her narrow shoulders, and was too short to cover her legs. It fell to just below the level of her rubber skirt. Charlie smiled too, with the new coat, it looked like Ronni was only wearing a jacket and a pair of skyscraper stripper heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Lizzy smiled, she at least had a coat that would protect her from the cold night air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge suggested going on to a night club, drawing a wail of protest from Ronni. He shrugged and asked Ronni if <b>she </b>wanted to return to The Burrow as <b>she </b>was just now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was dark outside the club, and the rain had started. Puddles were already forming, the usual Soho night-life was out in force. Ronni snuggled up against Charlie, as a feeling of vulnerability seeped into her bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely they weren't all prostitutes.\" Lizzy thought to herself. She'd never seen quite so much flesh so blatantly displayed. She hoped that some of them were just revellers out for the night, relaxing, partying and proud of their young firm bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her goodwill, and generous nature, she did steer clear of the girls who kept glancing towards the tattooed skin-head. A scar on his face, made him look incapable of smiling. The girls radiated fear, whenever his gaze passed near them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith only Lizzy's skill at magic, she too was feeling vulnerable and in need of a protector too. Casting a look backwards to the strip club, she hoped to see Gerry following her. Alas it was a forlorn hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry thought he saw something, something horrifically bad. But it might have been her own fear. She scanned her surroundings, but it only confirmed her worst fears. She tried to warn George, to pull on his arm, get his attention. But he was still enjoying the joke that Suzy had played on the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA last smoky black cloud slammed into the ground in front of the group. A masked man stepped out of the murk. A hood and cloak hiding his body, and a chromed mask covering his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vengeance! Vengeance for the Dark Lord!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice was shrill, as he advanced, his wand pointed towards the stag party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the street, two more deatheaters stepped into the light, blocking their retreat. Behind them, a final two stepped into their path stopping them from re-entering the club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stag party took cover, amongst the parked cars. The tips of their wands glowing as they prepared for battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first bolt flew from the death-eater's wand, crackling it flew over Charlie's head, crashing into a junction box which exploded in a shower of sparks. The muggles scattered, some shrieking about terrorists, some just fleeing in a blind panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy hoped that the death-eaters would let them escape. Would focus on her, on their true target.</span></div></div>",

Before it slips even lower, a sexual moan slips from her lips, as the tickling magic arcs from her spine, between her round arse cheeks, and vanishes inside her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollapsing to the ground, she finds herself incredibly aroused, uncontrollably so. As she lies there, she sees the girl opposite, her hands buried in her pussy, as she strokes, and probes and tries to get some relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy's teeth chatter, as her hands dart to her crotch, seeking a climax. Her fingernails plucking at the underwear covering her twat. Soon, she too is gasping and moaning. All thoughts, all concern about the ongoing battle an irrelevant distraction compared to her sexual desires. Bolts of magical fire shoot back and forth above the two twitching whores laid out by magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy's thumb brushes against her clit, and she gives a mixed shrieking moaning, giggling cry of joy. Driven on, her other hand, slips between her sumptuous cheeks, two fingers slipping inside, a itch that demands scratching gives her no other option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpposite, she spies Ronni, her plump, erect nipple being pulled, stretched and teased with her free hand. The other still working her crotch, the fingers glistening with her excitement.</span></div></div>",

Thankfully it's not all incoming, as Lizzy saw a deatheater struck in the middle of his chest. The blast threw him backwards, to bounce off a car door and slump to the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the first time that Harry had wished his stag-do had been a larger affair. Certainly since his recent transformation. What he'd have given to have a few more from Dumbledore's Army by his side. Lizzy blushed, as images came to her about how a girl like her could properly thank a rescuer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd tried casting a shield spell, but could only draw a faint flicker of light from the tip of the wand. Ronni was similarly cursed with Suzy's magical lack of skill. Lizzy tucked away the wand, no point in risking losing it in the chaos. The boys were trying to agree a plan. George wanted to apparate and bring help, from the Ministry, or Grimmauld Place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry appeared in the doorway to the club, and quickly incapacitated two death-eaters from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This Way!\" He called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys ran back to the cover of the club. Deflecting bolts of magic as they fled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge grabbed Lizzy's hand and pulled her along behind him. She tried to keep as low as she could, but Suzy's spell was still on her. She moved with grace and elegance, and with an eye-drawing shimmy in her hips. It might have been useful as a dancer, but for fleeing attack...<br>\r\nLizzy felt a bolt of magic smash into the base of her spine. Instantly her legs folded up beneath her as pain ripped through every muscle in her body. Even as she lay in the pavement, her feet drummed painfully against the cold concrete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blast of magic exploded inches from Lizzy's hand, as George reached to pull her along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree, four, five more blasts followed, and reluctantly George had to leave the twitching girl defenceless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignore the whores. Ignore the muggles.\" A strident voice called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowerless to do anything beyond slam her feet repeatedly against the ground, Lizzy watched as they retreated back into the strip club. A shimmering shield flashed into place, sealing them inside, protecting them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough a foggy, pain filled red haze, Lizzy struggled to think. She hadn't seen Ronni, her best friend hadn't made it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDimly she heard the beat of another set of feet. With an almost unbearable effort, Lizzy managed to turn her head, and place her other cheek in the puddle. She saw the pain scribed face of Ronni, her rubber clad ass, bouncing and shaking as her feet danced away, beyond her control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe death-eaters stopped throwing spells against the shield. One whirled angrily towards the tallest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your fault. Your impatience. We need Harry Potter. Either kill him, or capture him. But instead, all we got was two muggle whores. Twins!\" The last word coming out in a derisive snort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of sight, Lizzy felt a fist pull her hair into a knot before driving her head repeatedly against the ground. Thankfully darkness claimed her, as the coppery taste of blood filled her mouth, and her head bounced, with a sickening wet slap for the third time.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Feeling his arms above the sheets, both his hands were being compassionately held. His eyes fluttered open, and he looked up to see Jerry at one side of the bed, and opposite him, was Hermione. Both were holding his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scent of antiseptic hit his nostrils. He was in a hospital, probably St. Mungo's, although some wizard doctors were loath to mix muggle medicine, and their own healing some advances had been made. With medicine being used for injuries and such that weren't magical in origin. He'd followed this with some interest, in the Daily Prophet. Despite knowing this also funded Rita Skeeter. His teeth clenched at the merest thought of her. He took a deep breath, and went to sit upright in the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently, but firmly. He felt Jerry place a hand on his chest and hold him in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just take your time.\" Hermione suggested, her voice was a little gruff, Harry put that down to emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry looked down the bed, his body outlined by the sheets. The abundance of curves, and the liquid shifting on his chest telling him that he was still her. That he was still Lizzy. A soft groan escaped, as Lizzy woke, she noticed another thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione's grip was stronger than she remembered, her hands bigger too. As that thought percolated through, Lizzy took in her friend with more care. Hermione's face was squarer, and her shoulders wider. Her eyes dropped and confirmed what she had already guessed, flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracking her eyes, Hermione smiled and joked, \"Hey eyes up here. Oh... and for the moment you can call me Herman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ron!\" she suddenly snapped as her memories of the attack unjumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone is fine, <i>Ronni's </i>sleeping.

The doors lined up, and she spotted her twin resting there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The aurors almost <i>obliviate'</i>d your memory.\" Herman said lightly. \"They assumed you and Ronni were strippers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were.\" Jerry added with a wicked smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, to keep it out the papers, to keep it low profile, we decided to go with the line that you were squib strippers.\" Herman explained in a low voice. \"Thus separate but neighbouring rooms. To explain all the Weasleys, and your absence, we said that Ron and Harry had managed to escape. That you were pursuing the attackers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry's wicked smile returned, \"If you prefer, we can get the Daily Prophet on your side, and have a high profile interview with their main columnist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shudder went through Lizzy even at the joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moan came from the neighbouring room, instantly Herman's head snapped around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\" he said, \"For the potion. But I've brewed up the restorative, and we can take it together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded to Harry, already half out of his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Herman wants to be by her side, when Ronni awakes.\" Jerry explained.</span></div></div>",

She couldn't argue with him. She wouldn't argue with him. She wasn't sure, it was true, although she was enjoying the anonymity of not being 'The Chosen One'. She was watched with lust, not a mix of curiosity and pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact, I know what you're thinking.\" Jerry said, a deep dirty chuckle coming from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy coloured even more, but her eyes fell to Jerry's trousers, and were fixed there, as she saw the bulge there. The excitement that Jerry was containing for her. She wanted to release the pressure, to bring him as much pleasure as she felt. She imagined sinking to her knees in front of him, and slipping that warm, tasty treat into her welcoming mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They've a mind of their own.\" Jerry admitted, \"I didn't appreciate how easy they were to trigger, and what random thoughts would set off, the little fellow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<b><i>Ahem</i></b>-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry coughed, and suddenly changed the conversation. \"Anyway, you were asking about Herman.

I think Fleur still has her potion, undrunk.\" she finished with a shrug. \"You'd have liked Phil, he looked like a Norse God, although he couldn't lose the French accent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy found the depth of Jerry's voice, his slow speech, all worked inside her brain, making her more aroused, she wanted to hug him to her soft chest, and feel every syrupy smooth word he spoke with every cell in her body.

Even that thought brought colour to her cheeks, as she pictured Jerry's cock, as it rose to attention. As it rose to attention because of her. Her tiny hands curled up, as if in anticipation, then another thought intruded, how wierd this all was. Would it feel Gay. No! She was a woman, at the moment, and it felt right. She was almost eager to begin, her mouth dry with anticipation. Her tongue darted out, wetting her lips. 'Oh!... oh!!' she thought to herself as another way of helping Jerry came to mind.

To feel his touch with every inch of her body, for him to scratch the need, with a passion, with an animal energy she'd never experienced before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the point when the door opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chair legs squealed loudly on the floor, as Jerry leaped back into the seat, fumbling his erection back into the trousers. Your own hands were busy pulling the sheets back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse came into the room. Instantly she took in the scene, the flushed faces, the raging hard-on in Jerry's trousers, and the shy, embarrassed, but proud smile on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a little startled, and embarrassed herself. But that vanished almost as quickly as it appeared. A broad beaming smile replacing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're feeling better.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting down the tray she was carrying, she floated a full-length mirror in behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put on a professional demeanour, the corners of her mouth revealed her true state though, quirking up at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are your restoratives. Personally blended by Hermione Granger, I'm told.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe passed them to them. \"Once you've taken the potion, you can use the mirror, some people find it helps them regain their original bodies. I've heard that some looked even better afterwards, brighter smile, straighter teeth, a change in eye colour. But I've never seen it myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked back to the door, but before she left she turned around again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a button by the bed, if you need to summon a nurse.\" Then she looked more meaningfully towards Lizzy before continuing, \"There's also a bolt on the door for those who need a moment's privacy.\" She patted it as she left, closing it behind her with a filthy chuckle.</span></div></div>",

He eased himself off the bed. The door was only a couple of paces away, as Lizzy sat up in bed. Initially hold the sheets in place against her chest, she shuffled her butt into a good position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a wave of fear gripped her, uncertainty ripping at her excitement, her resolve, her love for Jerry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a solid, quiet metallic -<b>snick</b>-, as the bolt slid into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe adjusted himself before turning around. With a smile he revealed himself to Lizzy, his cock poking demandingly from his zipper. A rude bar of hard, tasty flesh, a physical embodiment of his love for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the bed, Lizzy was trembling, in her hand a tiny bottle lay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, so, so sorry.\" she sobbed, and gathered herself, \"I love you, I still do, I always will...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWords failed her and she dropped her head, breaking his gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry was confused for a moment, until he saw the bottle cap was popped, and the phial empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoudly he swallowed, \"It's all right, I understand. I'd never rush you...\" his words were sincere, but his erection still wanted to argue the point. Especially when the sheet slipped between Lizzy's limp fingers. It slid downwards, each thread teasingly caressing her nipples to a pinnacle of awareness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking downwards, she cupped her breasts. \"I'll definitely miss this... miss these girls.\" Her fingers mauling her generous chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://45.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_md6s84Efv81qk06fqo1_500.gif\" target=\"_blank\">http://45.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_md6s84...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy couldn't tell whether the tingle of magic was coming from her breasts, or her finger tips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Together.\" Jerry said, with a sad smile, \"Always.\" Sitting on the edge of the bed, he took and swallowed his potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComfortingly, he put his arm around Lizzy, squeezing her tight to his side. There was an intensity to a man's need that he wasn't used to. An immediacy that wanted to take control, to hold her down, ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head, dismissing such thoughts. Tenderly he kissed, Lizzy. Already the blonde was washing from her hair, as a darker, chestnut brown spilled outwards from the roots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...\" Lizzy started uncertainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Together, Always.\" Jerry repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are... Are the girls... I mean... am I getting bustier.\" Lizzy's voice trembled, surely the potion wasn't meant to do this. His hair was back to normal, but her face, her reflection wasn't getting any more masculine. If anything, her lips were plumper, fuller, redder more womanly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry slid onto the bed properly, kneeling behind Lizzy, a knee on each side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy felt his muscular thighs, as they pressed against her round, full rear. But her attention was kept by the press of his hot flesh. His naked erection was resting against her spine. She couldn't talk, the only thought that kept surfacing was... If I leaned forward, will he take the hint .... will he take me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts shattered again, as she felt Jerry slip his hands around her. Cupping the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://45.media.tumblr.com/f71e1d945d36561b18cb8c77d387862c/tumblr_mo70zr8E891qjvkgmo1_500.gif\" target=\"_blank\">http://45.media.tumblr.com/f71e1d945d365...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please.\" slipped unbidden from her, although she could never express what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shiver of erotic curiosity wasn't enough as, she felt the magic. Fear was more powerful, she rolled the empty phial in her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn tiny neat handwriting, Hermione's hand, was a warning, extreme emotions may affect the outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy dropped it, softly onto the sheets. In the mirror her eyes always the jade green of her mother, deepened and shifted, taking on an almost feline aspect. Shaking her head, she saw her cheekbones rise higher, her jaw soften even further. She looked like a succubus. Her face a temple to erotic temptation. Her eyes glittered, and sparkled, her lips sumptuous, and desperately in needing only a cock to complete them. She was gorgeous, her face perfect for portraying ecstasy, although appearing other than a bimbo would be trickier.</span></div></div>",

She felt the warmth of his cock, as it responded, rolling slickly from side to side, tickling her vertebrae like a caress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breath caught, as she thought about how much bigger it felt, even now. Trying to picture it, she gasped, she blushed, she giggled, she wondered how on Earth it would fit. She looked forward to giving it her best shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tickle inside her brain, told Lizzy that she wasn't the squib from before. A heightened sense of awareness accompanying her changes. She wondered how large her bust was going to get. With a satisfied, slightly smug smile, she knew that Jerry would appreciate the girls however they looked. The idea made her squirm, or perhaps it was something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned forward, rising off the bed, feeling Jerry's spread legs slip down and away, as she raised her ass. It too was developing, becoming a nice balance to her chest. She couldn't restrain the shudder of need, as she felt his hot cock peel away from her spine. It moved sticking and slipping, until it came to rest in the cleft of her generous ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whimpered her need, hoping that Jerry didn't need any more of an invitation. Surely, waving her ass in his face was clear enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting her breasts against the sheets, she looked at her reflection, paying attention to Jerry, and the way he was licking his lips nervously, his eyes most firmly locked on target. He had the clearest blue eyes, and the firmest of jaws, a leonine mane of hair without looking in the least feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy loved her new looks, her face, her body... the effect it had on men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...\" she whispered. \"Don't keep me on the edge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flicker of nervousness crossed his face. It was time for Jerry to embrace his fate, to grasp his masculinity and lead Lizzy to her femininity. It was only when he gave himself, the curtest of nods that she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, she felt his firm hands caress her plump, pert bum, and gently ease her cheeks apart. Then she felt it. The tip of his cock brushed against her... her ....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thought scattered to the wind, as the first inch entered. Her teeth chattered, her eyelashes fluttered, and a needy, sensual moan came unbidden. It was an exquisite torture, as he eased inch after inch slowly into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the pleasure would never end, resting on her elbows, she started to massage her own breasts and nipples, teasing herself even more. Then in one thrust, he rammed the rest of his length home. Lizzy cried soundlessly for joy, she half expected it to be tickling the back of her throat. His cock was surely over a foot in length. She giggled, at the idea of guesstimating the size of a cock this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she felt him slowly ease himself back out, she wanted to plead for him to stop. Soon, he was thrusting away, his silken length plunging again and again. Her cries warbling, up and down rising in pitch each time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she came, and Jerry came. He slumped onto her back, his sweat slicked chest hair resting warmly against your back. A grunt was needed, and Jerry took his own weight off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair curled up together, shy, shocked grins on both their faces. Slipping a lock of hair off Lizzy's face, Jerry kissed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy was happy as she'd never been before in her entire life. No worries, everything she needed held in her embrace. Kissing Jerry passionately, she slumped back wanting to memorise everything about the moment, every detail, every feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistantly she felt sorry for Suzy, despite her incredible body, Lizzy had hated being separated from her magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were interrupted, as she heard rhythmic grunting coming from somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe confusion must have shown, as Jerry smiled and explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Ronni and Herman, are restored to their proper bodies too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not Ron and Hermione...\" she asked softly, unsure that she wanted to deprive her friend of this experience, this intimacy.</span></div></div>",

She tried to sob out the words... But ended up, just nodding her agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shriek came from outside the room. Jerry felt his anger surge, if those Death eaters had returned, he would defend his future wife to the death.... and it would be their death, if he had any say in the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair crashed from the room, wands drawn, their tips glowing ready to throw spells at any assailant. The cries were coming from the next door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cries changed pitch, Jerry shattered the door with a spell. A silent explosion ripping it to shred.

Even Herman who caught their arrival out of the corner of his eyes was incapable (or unwilling) to do much beyond sharing a wink with Jerry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonni's cries reached a crescendo, as she came. Briefly she slumped half forward, her nails clawing eagerly at Herman's chest, before she slumped against his muscular torso.

The room swirled away in a dizzying, nausea inducing swirl. There was a -<i>whoompf</i>- of displaced air as they vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor boards, creaked beneath the sudden weight as the four of them arrived in the the cramped upstairs room. Looking out the window, saw the marque tent in the garden for the wedding of the century. Well, the wizarding world, the joining in holy matrimony of Harry Potter and Ginerva Molly Weasley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite howls of protest, this was going to be an intimate family affair. The years since the Battle of Hogwarts had been long and hard. Lizzy still recalled Professor McGonagall's letter arriving at Grimmauld Place. A polite and reasoned request, that his wedding be taken as an opportunity for both sides to come together. It pulled at Harry's heart, knowing the harm that had come from his father's behaviour towards Severus. There were also those who felt that the damage done to bloodlines was in need of repair. Although, that was couched in careful language. None wanted to see magic vanish from the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHagrid argued for it too, suggesting half-seriously, that he should think of how many presents he'd receive from all those guests. Harry was still no fan of Draco. But with the passage of time, could accept that he was closer to ... to certain temptations, and certain dangers. It was a thought that didn't sit well with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Harry decided his life had been lived in the glare of publicity, and public scrutiny for far too long. This was the time to mark an end to those things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a polite knock on the door, and the head of Molly Weasley appeared around it. Her eyebrows shot up quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not back to yourself.\" she said. Her eyes taking in Ronni, as if somehow she was to blame. Switching her gaze to Jerry, there was a scepticism in her gaze there too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Errr</i>... That's probably my fault.\" Herman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice rough, and gravelly, but his mannerisms were pure Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ...<i>err</i>... forgot to take account of how strong emotions would affect a person's body image.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.... The wedding outfits are self-adjusting.\" Molly said trying to find a bright spot, as she heard Arthur's voice calling from downstairs. She had to keep that man on a tight leash, his muggle-curious tendencies would be the death of her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The slow creak of Molly Weasley's footsteps as she trudged down made her feel incredibly guilty. It also brought an ironic smile to her face. The Weasley's never seemed to catch a break when they were hosting a wedding. Of course, Harry, Ron and Hermione hadn't been there for the end of Bill and Fleur's wedding. Even so, it wasn't going to be remembered as a great success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out the window at the milling guests, Harry felt guilty at not inviting most of Dumbledore's Army. But her closest friends were in this room, and there were a few others who had been invited. She saw Luna, in a brilliant lilac dress, her hat was a Dandelion head, engorgio'd to fit. She spotted George, who was looking less than joyous. Lizzy knew that he hadn't intended for things to turn out like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerman's voice was in the background, underlining the situation for the four of them. Her restorative had failed, resulting in them ending up in even more sexual bodies. He wanted a word with George himself, to ensure he hadn't '<i>enhanced</i>' the potion himself for effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt Jerry take her hand, gently, reassuringly rubbing it in his large masculine grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's for the best. We can't have a wedding without a bride and groom.\" his gruff tones, sounding for the first time as if he were missing out on his big day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnatching her hand free, Lizzy snapped her fingers. \"I've an idea. Guys, stay here, see what you can work out. But... \" she paused, \"No... I'll explain later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe darted out the tiny, askew room, taking the steps two at a time as she raced after Molly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a floor, she steadied her pace. The girls jiggling was threatening to throw her off balance. But she continued, flowing more smoothly along, her bust dancing in a more regular rhythm. At the bottom of the stairs he finally caught up with Molly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've an idea.\" she said beaming widely, and planted a happy kiss on Molly's lips. \"Just... Just don't tell the guests about .... about any problems for the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly face shifted from shocked, embarrassed, flattered and settled on blushing crimson, at being kissed so passionately by such a lovely girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy looked a little less formal than the majority of guests. But her thin clothes served to accentuate her gorgeous body, a simple satin shift pulled in to highlight her waist, and allow the swell of her bust to be properly displayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Arthur...\" she chimed, as she almost bounced off Mr. Weasley in her rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur simply gaped like a landed fish, and his head snapped fixing on Molly, as soon as he spotted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's she...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy didn't hear the end of his question as she mingled with the party guests. It was hard to restrain herself, as she dearly wanted to talk to everyone. She headed towards the spot where she'd spotted George in the crowd. She brushed past Angelina Johnson her team-mate. Hell, her place in the Quidditch team meant she was friends with and beloved by so many in Gryffindor. She smiled an apology, as she went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloody Veela...\" the comment wasn't loud, or even terribly serious, so Lizzy kept going. Besides it was quite flattering to be mistaken for those enchanted, enchanting creatures. Lizzy was sure that Bill was going to have a very happy home life. Fleur doted on him, and him on her. They connected on a deeper level, than mere beauty, but ... Fleur's love could flare to an unquenchable passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile played with her lips, as she consider raising that kind of lust herself, she nodded a hello to Luna, before she could stop herself. Lizzy felt a special bond to her, for the time they'd spent in the Malfoy dungeon. Tears came unbidden to Lizzy's eyes, as she remembered Luna's sweet eulogy to Dobby, and the kind way she treated him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna's soft, airy voice was unmistakable, but Lizzy kept heading onwards. A flash of red hair ahead, telling her she was near her target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy trusted Luna, completely. Literally, with her life. Turning backwards, she blew the former Ravenclaw a kiss, and a sly wink. Before she turned back she raised a single finger to her lips. Luna reflected it back to Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"George...\" she called as she got closer, \"George...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning at the sound of his name, he spotted Lizzy rushing towards him. A sheepish expression clear on his face. Clearly he thought she was going to dress him down in front of all these guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy let out a gust of relief, and planted a hand on his shoulder.</span></div></div>",

With her imprisoned, it was impossible for her to regain human form. Her insect instincts overriding her higher human functions unless she was constantly concentrating. It was how Hermione had caught her years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy's tone changed, her lip curling, \"Then again, it looks <i>rather common</i>. Perhaps it might give Crookshanks a few minutes of fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge put the bug trap aside, putting it into a sack, and tossing it aside, to roll to a rest beside the main marquee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will have to release her later, I suppose.\" Lizzy admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An unregistered animagus, should be reported to the ministry. I suspect you'd like the punishment they impose on such wizards and witches.\" George said with a wry smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have expected her.\" Lizzy said with a sigh, \"Anyway I have a question for you. More we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy turned to face The Burrow, at the top most window, three faces were pressed against the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge took Lizzy's wrist, and the world whirled away, as they apparated to the top of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do that on my own now.\" Lizzy protested, \"I'm not the same ...\" she didn't want to say squib, or stripper from the night before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I've got my magical powers back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor was uneven, so George's hand did come to rest against her side as she wobbled for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey rejoined their friends inside the tiny room. There had to stand, as Lizzy explained her idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got 'Glamour Rings', don't you George?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Herman, a disguise wouldn't affect our underlying bodies would it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge nodded, and Herman followed suit a moment later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, as you say, it wouldn't really change anything. It'd just be a disguise to hide your real body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough though to get us through today.\" Lizzy explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'll still have this gorgeous, cock-teasing body, but everyone around us will see Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or Ginny, or Ron... or Hermione.\" Ronni burst in excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rings only work for a few hours, and then need to recharge.\" George explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's long enough for the service, and the photos afterwards.\" Lizzy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge's smile widened, \"So the wedding can go ahead.\" his smile flickered, \"Just watch for the ring warming up. If you feel that you only have a few minutes until the spell ends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he spoke, George's hand vanished into his pocket. It was only when it was in to his elbow, that Lizzy realised his pockets were magically enhanced. With a beaming smile, he withdrew his arm. Uncurling his fist, four plain gold rings sat in his open palm.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Playfully, Jerry elbowed Lizzy in the ribs. \"It's supposed to be the wedding of Ginerva Molly Weasley and Harry James Potter. But if you prefer, we could go as each other. It would still be our names.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to, as well.\" Herman suggested. \"Nah!\" he chuckled, \"I don't think you're quite going to pass as super swot Hermione Granger.\" A wry smile on her face, her own reputation was something she was quite familiar with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"George, if you bring the wedding outfits up, we'll search for some hair to imprint our DNA on the rings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge wasn't familiar with DNA, but apparently, it was muggle-tech, like a thermos flask. An item, that Hermione had spent an entire afternoon trying to patiently explain to his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry lead Lizzy off to her room, to search for a stray hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and no petting Crookshanks in the mean time.\" Ronni giggled. Their first experience with polyjuice was still used when Hermione was getting too cocky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonni shyly took Herman's hand and lead him off to Ron's room in the Burrow. Lizzy found a stray dark hair on the comb he'd used on a quiet visit. He wasn't sure whether Ginny had told her mother about that particular visit. Even if it was rather firmly imprinted on Harry's memory. Lizzy blushed, as she realised that Hermione must have made a similar visit herself. It just wasn't the way Harry thought of her. Although her recent experience of sex with a Weasley made her glad that Hermione had had that experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy carefully pressed his scruffy black hair against the ring, wrapping it around the whole ring. A flash of black light came from the strand, and the ring pulsed in Lizzy's hand. Turning he saw Jerry weaving a long copper hair around his ring, forming a slender plait. He snatched his hand back, as a ginger flash came from the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFacing each other, the ring resting in each open palm, neither of them said anything, neither of them needed to. Silently, they swapped their rings. Lizzy hesitated, wanting to warn Ginny of the burden of being the Chosen One. The attention the scar drew, the assumptions, the ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrawing a deep calming breath, \"I know. It'll be all right.\" Jerry softly kissed Lizzy's forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot sure what to say, about her upcoming change, Lizzy smiled and slipped the ring on her finger. The change was silent, and instant, almost disappointingly so. The only hint that the ring was anything other than mundane was as it shifted on their pinkies, before settling to become a perfect fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing over to the full length mirror, Lizzy saw the shy smile of Ginny Weasley, as she twirled in front of the glass. The weight of her bust was greatly reduced, the girls now much more modest. Behind her, Harry Potter, planted his hands on her shoulders. Nuzzling in his lips headed for her earlobes. Ginny inhaled his aroma, bathed in his body's proximity, enjoying the sense of safety, and completeness she felt just from his presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep instinct, made her want to smooth out his wild mop of black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should hurry.\" Harry told his bride, \"The clock is ticking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile the pair of them left the room. Straight away they bumped into Ron and Hermione. The wide, wide smile on Hermione's face, meant that Ginny didn't need to ask if they'd come to the same conclusion. Ron wasn't so much stiff, and formal, but he was missing that charming inelegance. They were both supremely happy with their choices, Ginny blushed, as Ron raised his finger. It darted between the pair of them, but before she needed to ask she made the same guess, the right guess.</span></div></div>",

If you have them go to the main tent, it shouldn't be more than five minutes.\" Harry called downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mum, five minutes.\" Ginny backed him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of grumbling muttering ascended, but was cut off as Molly closed the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge passed them their costumes, and headed downstairs himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never imagined my wedding day like this...\" Harry's voice almost wistful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, with you disguised as the groom, marrying yourself, while actually in another male body.\" Ginny's smile and wink, were pure Harry Potter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's still your dream day.\" Said Hermione from Ron's mouth, as she slid the tuxedo trousers up his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilac.\" Ronni moaned, as she struggled to squeeze into her bridesmaid outfit. Despite looking like Hermione, Ronni's body was still much more curvaceous than the dress was used to. Even as it shifted into place, Ronni felt it rub across her wide nipples, teasing them to erection, her ribs lost mobility, as they were squeezed down, flaring out to accentuate her hips and butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon was now fully dressed, and slipping on a pair of soft white gloves. He checked they were wrinkle free, and ran them over the sumptuous rump of his partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've decided to stay this way around.\" Ron said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have.\" Hermione's voice was less convincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if I can make up the antidote, then I think these bodies will suit us better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione's mouth silently opened and closed as if she were considering what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, she recognised the sound of her own voice, the resolution. When Hermione had been picked up by Grawp, it was her own sternness, that had convinced Hagrid's (half) brother to put her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the shoe was on the other foot, Hermione squirmed, but recognised and accepted her fate. She consoled herself, that after her session with Herman in the hospital, she was certainly going to enjoy significant times together. Even if... or inevitable she spent her time as Ronni, and her lover as Herman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry looked radiant in the wedding dress. The veil covering the tears welling in the corner of her eyes. Her coppery hair cascading over her shoulders, adding just the right amount of colour to her ivory outfit. Even Harry's eyes glistened, tenderly he lifted her veil, and kissed her satiny soft rosebud lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you be my bride, for ever and ever?\" Harry's voice trembled as he asked his bride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon smiled, \"Let's give them some privacy.\" taking Hermione's arm, the pair apparated down to the entrance of the main tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back up to the room, they couldn't hear what was said, but the window perfectly framed the couple kissing in the room.</span></div></div>",

They shared a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry smiled, the corners of Ginny's mouth quirking up. You go down first, it's a bride's prerogative to keep her future husband waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah.\" the tone was a little sad. Ginny felt a fraction of Harry's loneliness, her dad would walk Harry down the aisle. While she would stand waiting, with a couple of great friends, but no family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now, in this rather bizarre twist, she knew she'd always be there for her bride. She crushed Harry to her manly chest, \"You're family.\" she told her with all the love in heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ginny pulled back, she saw the tears swimming in the eyes of her bride. Oddly she felt better, she felt right, a completeness she'd never felt before. A sense of purpose, of having someone to protect, and the strength... and the body to do it. She was almost eager for the disguise ring to lose it's power, so that she could show her Jerry once more. This masquerading as Harry was fun, but it was unsettling to take in his bride, and see the face from the mirror looking back at her, the adoration on her face. But also not her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore risking becoming any more confused, and unsettled, she turned and left. The sound of his feet as he descended the stairs made Harry feel alone. It harped back to those long years under the stairs, serving as a barely acknowledged servant to the Dursleys. Raising a hand to her bosom, she felt her heart racing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was an final end to that chapter of her life. A book she sincerely wanted to close. They had given her a home, and protection, however grudging. Her life had opened up, at Hagrid's arrival, at Hagrid's announcement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yer, a wizard, Harry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gruff certainty, opened his eyes to hope, to freedom, to a whole new world. Despite the pain, the fear, the trials he'd faced, the Dursley's had kept him grounded. They'd never treated him as the wizard who vanquished Voldemort. She found herself nodding, she really must thank them for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDabbing her eyes, and smoothing out imaginary wrinkles from the dress, she set off downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day passed like a dream, every face lit up as she passed, brightening her smile in return. There wasn't one person there, she regretted coming. Arthur Weasley holding her arm, as they walked up the aisle. The flashing of the camera. The knowing smile of Luna, as she swept past the former Ravenclaw's seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe beamed, as she imagined the article in 'The Quibbler', one that would doubtless be dismissed. The 'Daily Prophet' would get the story second-hand. Carefully edited, and presented. This was the Wizarding World's Wedding of the century.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe recalled the smile of Gabrielle, and Fleur, their mixed Veela heritage drawing the eyes of curious men. Their men being gently elbowed in their turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow finally it was all over. She was back in her own body, her Lizzy body. Her hair framing her face, as her head rested on Jerry's strong upper arm. His body glistened with sweat from their recent endeavours. She finally felt she could relax, even if they were followed. Lizzy and Gerry were just another happy couple. The reporters would be looking for a different pair. They'd only be interested in Harry James Potter and Ginerva Molly Weasley. Jerry lay on his back, his breathing slow and regular. He was sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry's musky aroma filled the room, and she drew it deep into her lungs savouring it. Also the tang of something sweeter too. Her fingernails traced the defined muscles of his chest. Those tiny, cute nipples. Slipping lower, her nails danced downwards like ice-skaters.</span></div></div>",

They swirled into existence at the castle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping the rings from their fingers, Ginny Weasley flickered out of existence, a bustier, lustier girl replacing her. Similarly, Harry Potter stuttered and vanished, with a plainer, more anonymous dark haired man replacing him. All of them, shared the same look of deep love, twinkling in their eyes, and drawing smiles unbidden to their lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy's bust danced for a moment, until it settled. The movement went uncommented, but not unnoticed, as Jerry's eyes were drawn to the dancing flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had felt different travelling as a witch, Harry felt the chill of the journey more intensely. Despite it's briefness, she felt her nipples stiffening as if exposed to a cold breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth bride and groom, had wanted to travel by broom from the wedding. But given it's high profile, and the Daily Prophet's level of interest the couple reluctantly decided to apparate instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was setting through the misty haze as they check in. Lizzy levitated their luggage as they walked up the tight, twisting steps. One of the charms/drawbacks of ancient magical building was their history, their draughtiness. She snuggled against Jerry's side, sharing their warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still yelped in surprise, as they reached the bridal suite, as Jerry swept her off her feet, and carried her over the threshold of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLazily reaching an arm out Lizzy ensured the door closed with a solid click ensuring their privacy as she was carried to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was tossed the last couple of feet to the bed, bouncing joyously as her powerful husband stood by, enjoying the sight of his bride, and all her elegance, as she posed on her side. A pose to accentuate the swell of her hips, the dip of her tight waist, and with an arm craning behind her head her sumptuous bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey quickly stripped naked, and leapt beneath the sheets. Both eager for the warm embrace of each other's body, and to escape the cold air of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry's hands moved with surety, surprising and pleasing Lizzy with their skill. They were hands that knew how to please a woman. Lizzy's face was smothered in kissed, given and returned. Her own hands exploring the taut muscles of Jerry's torso. Slipping eagerly over his firm pecs, and squeezing his compact bum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping like eels against one another, Lizzy straddled him. The sheets pooled around her waist, even the air exciting her. She guided Jerry, and eased herself down. A soft, satisfied moan slipping from her lips. His strong fingers held and massaged her tits, as she got a rhythm going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed added to the noise, as it creaked and groaned in time with Jerry's thrusts, in time with Lizzy's driving hips, as they sought the greatest depths, the highest peaks. Lizzy warbled her delight, as she increased her pace. Jerry was struggling to keep up, his breathing becoming more and more ragged, until as one they came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir combined shrieks echoing round the room. Fully satisfied, Lizzy slumped forward, her breasts resting against Jerry's sweat slicked chest. She felt the racing of his heart, beating so, so rapidly. The smile on his face, was ridiculous, but completely sincere and without guile. It matched her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night continued until they had to surrender to their exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Sun, snuck in the window, the sunbeam lit up Lizzy's face. She moaned in protest, as it hit her closed eyes. Her arm flailed blindly, as she dove for darkness, and the return of those dreams... those memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the Sun was relentless, languidly, like a house cat she looked up to Jerry's sleeping face. His handsome face resting on the pillow, still escaping the advancing Sun. It was time to make more of those memories, thought Lizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sweat made it more awkward, but she slipped beneath the sheets. Soft protests slurring from Jerry's lips, his mind still resolutely asleep. The musk beneath the sheets was incredible, the scent of their love pungent. She looked adoringly, lustily at the soft cock resting their. A tasty mouthful, already it was responding to the warmth of her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelicately, teasingly her tongue darted out, a quick circle drew a moan from his lips. It twitched, swelling to more satisfactory dimensions. Deftly, she slipped it into her mouth. Her lips sealing around it, her tongue once more exploring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother groan came from Jerry, a more alert groan, a more sexual groan. He was rousing.</span></div></div>",

The sun hitting Hogwarts castle lighting perfectly one of the largest magical building still standing. They had checked in as newly wed couple, the empty bottle of champagne upended in the ice bucket at the foot of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of Hogsmeade, and Hogwarts, was Harry's. He'd wanted to tour this piece of history, as stranger. Just another anonymous visitor. Now though, she looked back to Jerry's body, she didn't even want to leave the bed, let alone the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe traces tiny whorls of chest hair, as she thought back over the wedding. Once Jerry, as Ginny pretending to be Harry had headed down to the wedding tent. Kreacher had apparated in. At least, he assumed it was apparating, or the house-elf equivalent. He took a moment to admire his master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she'd watched, he'd started to bow, before changing it into a crude curtsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just here, to congratulate my master.\" his tone was grovelling, but sincere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt guilty at not having done more with Hermione, and SPEW. It really was soul-destroying how broken these creatures were. Dabbing away, the tears in the corner of her eyes. She didn't even question that Kreacher recognised her, as the master, even though she was perfectly disguised as Ginny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I serve you, at all... Mistress?\" his tone was soft questioning. He flinched, as if expecting a beating for calling her 'Mistress'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoftly, hoping to be reassuring, she reached out a hand, and stroked Kreacher's head. Desperately she tried to think of a useful task she could ask of the house elf. And something quick too, she didn't want to delay the service at all. The longer the disguise rings lasted in public the better. Idly she spun the ring on her finger, until it hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Kreacher, you can. But you need to be quick. There's an old muggle tradition.\" She ignored the sneer that flashed across the elf's face, a lifetime of hatred was hard to put aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue.\" she recounted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything, you can think of that I can borrow to walk down the aisle. But you'll need to bring is very quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words raced off her tongue, as she fought to speak clearly and coherently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could see the thoughtful expression as the elf mentally reviewed his options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have it.\" he said. His tone almost kindly. \"Or I will in a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, and it's something I can wear.... Without spoiling the dress.\" she added the last bit, just in case he came back with a whole outfit, or something else hideously inappropriate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe appeared to reconsider, she might have seen the slightest shake of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could say another word, the elf vanished, with a <i>whuff</i>, of displaced air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paced back and forth, in the tiny room, berating herself for giving Kreacher this job, ... for not giving the elf a time limit... just from sheer nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like an eternity, although her watch suggested, about a minute, had passed. As she turned, she was faced with Kreacher. The unsettling smile on his face, as he held out his item in both his cupped hands. She couldn't quite tell what it was, but it was cloth, and looked small enough to be easily obscured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was too mortified to ask what it was, and the sincerity of his offering reminded her of Dobby. His old face momentarily obscured by the softer kinder features of Harry's friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, It's perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKreacher beamed at the praise, the honesty of it brightening his whole bearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know the master wanted to be the bride.\" he said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really didn't have time to explain the whole story. Looking out the window, she spotted Harry heading towards the tent. He ruffled his hair, into the usual crow's nest of a mess. Even for such a formal event, there was particular impression to create. She felt her heart race, as Harry turned briefly to look up at the window. Their eyes met, and locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTapping his wrist, he gave her a strained smile, and headed into the main tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back, she saw Kreacher still standing there. But her heart sank, as his offering was now clearer.... entirely too clear in fact. Unfolded in his hands, and unfurling down towards the wooden floor, was a pair of Lapiz blue panties, and stockings and suspenders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall I dress the Mistress?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cheeks turned as red as her hair. But she felt cornered, by her own words, by Kreacher's generosity. Swallowing her words, she didn't trust her voice to deliver, she gave the house elf a nod of approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a shower of white and blue sparkles, the items disappeared from the bed. She wanted to dance, as she felt them appear on her body. The stockings winding their way up from her feet, passed her knees, and up her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squirmed as if she were naked in front of Kreacher, and tried to push that image from her mind. She didn't want to know how this piece of elf magic worked. She felt them cling to her thighs, she suppressed the yelp, as she felt the garter spring into existence. The strapping drew a gasp from her, as she scissored her legs back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cold chill of the silk panties kissed her lips, but it was the thong that she hadn't expected. The razor fine piece of cloth splitting her sumptuous ass cheeks, threatening to cut her in half like a cheese, that she couldn't ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling for words, as she fought the barrage of sensations. She offered her hand to Kreacher, who was shocked and honoured to be thanked for his work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe controlled the squirming as best she could, \"Thank you.\" her words less sincere and certainly less enthusiastic this time. However, Kreacher was too happy, too satisfied to notice. He apparated away, and left the bride to go down to the tent for the main event.... for her wedding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now, even dressed as she was, it felt unreal... it felt surreal. She continued down the stairs, chased by the music she heard coming from the main tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the firm grip of Jerry hand grasping her own, as it ruffled his chest hair. It snapped her out of her memories, and back to the Hogsmeade, and the man in bed beside her.</span></div></div>",

But not before slipping back on Kreacher's present of the stockings, suspenders and thong panties. She didn't need a mirror to know that Jerry was watching her like a starving man waiting for his favourite meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy had to push him back onto the bed, as he hooked an arm around her waist, ready to pull her back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down boy.\" she purred, her tone a honeyed tease. \"Learn to appreciate an.tic.i.pation...\" she hissed the last word, hoping that Jerry would get the joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure if he appreciated the joke, but the bulge in his trousers told her that he appreciated Lizzy's choice of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe newlyweds headed downstairs, Jerry almost drooling with anticipation, still hoping for another session with the love of his life. A carriage was waiting outside with a threshal in harness. In the carriage another pair of newly wed couples were waiting. Their smiles and giggles telling a very similar story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy gently stroked the mane of the threshal drawing a confused look from the four already in the carriage. Jerry smiled sadly, his thoughts on Fred. Breaking the sad reverie, he gestured for Lizzy to mount up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the pair sat down, the carriage set off. Harry hadn't known that Hogwarts was a tourist attraction in the Summer months. But given it's reputation, it was hardly surprising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the carriage headed through Hogsmeade, it was joined by two other carriages, with their own passengers. It was starting to look more like a tour now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had avoided Hogwarts in the intervening years. Almost he returned for his final year with Hermione. Ron having written off that experience as a waste of time. However for Harry, it was tempting, but nobody, but nobody would look at his grades. It was rare for people to react to anything more than his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was very happy to see that there was no visible damage from the battle. Well, not that he could see from this distance. Lizzy curled up against Jerry, the cold Scottish breeze penetrating, and giving her the excuse she wanted. Jerry too, was happy for the excuse, and tucked his cloak around her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tour was especially appealing for <i>her </i>now. She could tour the building, without the cloud of whispers and innuendo that had dogged Harry Potter's every step.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as they walked into the courtyard, Harry felt the same feelings of safety and being home, that he always associated with Hogwarts. Lizzy's whole body language eased, and her manner was easier. Even Jerry picked up on this. It was a source of endless amusement to Ginny that Harry found Hogwarts such a balm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd tease him about which was his most relaxing year. The year he discovered the Dark Lord, who tried to kill him. Or the year, he thought his Godfather was a killer, and wanted to kill him... On and on her teasing went, (although usually gentle and well intentioned). Harry took it on the chin. He was just glad to have someone who saw his as a human being, flawed but capable of love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, visitors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn instinctive, nervous, guilty shiver raced down Lizzy's spine as she heard that voice. It was older, perhaps more care-worn, but still stridently Scottish. As feelings of forgotten homework, and stories just short of lies filled her thoughts. She tightened her grip on Jerry's strong comforting hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a round of applause from some of the visitors, as the cat languidly resting on the edge of the fountain morphed into the familiar teacher... now Head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy glanced to her partner, Jerry was smiling broadly, as Ginny hadn't picked up Ron's study habits, or those of Fred or George such as they were. She'd been studious as Percy, but grounded like Charlie, in contact with her passions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Hogwarts, I am Minerva McGongall, the Headmistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave them a respectful nod of her severe head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will show you around the main points of interest of the castle, and after lunch, leave you free to explore at your leisure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn excited murmur rippled through the visitors, as they whispered their reasons for coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you tell us about....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was timid, and tapered off into silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Hogwarts has a long and illustrious history, although recent years have seen their share of pain.\" Taking a deep breath she continued, \"It has served as the cradle to a variety students who went on to achieve greatness in the wider wizarding world. Many of whom were Gryffindors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further introduction, she walked towards the heavy castle doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you have on comfortable shoes, as there's a lot of walking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, that was the tone that Lizzy recognised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey entered the castle, as the Headmistress pointed out, the great stone statues that fought to defend the school and pupils. Their battle scars largely repaired. Lizzy ran her palm over one figure. It upset her, that magic that could perfectly repair the physical, still left so much emotional, so much mental pain and scarring untouched. They looked fine, but ... Lizzy dismissed the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group passed immense tapestries, and certain portraits introduced themselves. Almost at random, Minerva would have to warn them about trick steps, and of course warn them about the poltergeist Peeves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy thought that Peeves had mellowed over time, finding a purpose for his boredom, an outlet for his frustration in the battle of Hogwarts. But she'd never spoil the spectre's reputation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stairs shifted and twisted. Although, Lizzy felt even they were being more obliging to the Headmistress, than she expected. As they headed up the Astronomy Tower, Lizzy felt her footsteps become more leaden. It was the height, she just was getting swamped with memories. Minerva was moving with a sprightly step, eager to show off the magnifcent view over the Loch, and down the Glen. The angle even made it easier to see the monster in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for Harry it would always be... where Dumbledore fell. Even now, it was complicated for her. It's meaning changing with time, and knowlege. No longer was it where Snape betrayed Dumbledore... No longer even where Dumbledore was murdered. The price of destroying that Horcrux, had already fatally marked the Headmaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt Jerry wipe away a tear racing down her cheek. She hadn't realised she was crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>We can stop. I'll say I'm tired..</i>.\" Jerry offered quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... No... I'll be okay.\" her voice gaining strength as she spoke. Through a narrow window, the Sun peeked, and the pale blue sky tempted her higher... the view would be magnificent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Headmistress pointed out the local landmarks, including a point on a hill where 'Snuffles' had hidden. She pointed out the Quidditch pitch, and where the labyrinth had been for the Triwizard tournament. The Forbidden Forest, listing off a wide variety of it's inhabitants. Lizzy smiled, when she even mentioned the Cabin for the groundskeeper, in passing. Finally she told the group, this was where Dumbledore was killed. Leading the group in a profound minute's silence for her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk back down was more subdued, her stomach rumbled quietly, and she realised that soon the tour would be over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor McGonagall still had a few surprises left though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crumbly Shortbread.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon statue turned on it's base, revealing a short stairway leading up to her office. It was barely large enough for everyone. Lizzy took in all the changes. There was an old Quidditch broom mounted proudly on the wall, and a dark green tartan banner. Out of the way, up against the wall, Lizzy recognised a perch, the perch for a very particular Phoenix. Jerry spotted it too. They exchanged a look, a memory, no words were needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are these all headmasters..?\" one man dressed in a green cape asked. His arm sweeping an entire wall of pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could confirm, \"Is that Snape?\" a voice asked, cold contempt dripping from the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's <b>Professor </b>Snape.\" Lizzy said with surprising passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva's eyebrow quirked up, in pleasure and agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There has been much confusion about my colleague, and friend's deeds and loyalties.\" her voice trembling. It wasn't age, though. Nor was age making her shoulders tremble either. Harry recognised it, instinctively taking a step back. This was suppressed rage. No... Not rage, frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shoulders fell, it wasn't their fault... It wasn't anybody's fault. Although the Daily Prophet needed a stern letter against mud-slinging. Mentally Minerva set aside time for that.</span></div></div>",

It's was spoken with such restrained anger, and almost sounded like someone trying to do an impression of Albus Dumbledore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntently she focused on her cluttered desk, and the mounds of work piled there. However, she was entirely focused on listening to her -so- knowledgeable visitor. Her eyes darted towards Lizzy, and saw the supportive way her partner was holding her hand. It was always nice to see newly-weds visiting the castle. After all, as the best magical school in the country, it was very popular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slightly frosty look on the other woman's face. Her jaw was firmly closed, as she bit back an angry retort. Professor Snape was a controversial figure, with even the Daily Prophet being cagey about his alliances and deeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the frame, even the portrait looked a little startled at being defended. Although, the change of expression was minimal, a former student would be capable of reading the slightly wider eyes, and the curiosity replacing the strain in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry snuggled in close behind Lizzy as she started talking. The warmth, the proximity of his body providing her with comfort against the painful memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started with the hardest details. The petty acts of vengeance, the bullying of Neville Longbottom, Harry Potter, and most Gryffindors. These acts were unfortunately widely known, and beyond dispute. The stories from Slytherin students sending them far and wide long before his 'so-called' redemption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva's smile tightened, as she wanted to defend her friend. A tear came to the corner of one eye, as she knew the facts herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy then moved on to the more disputed events, the events where the Daily Prophet had liked to speculate. Her eyes were no longer focused in the room, instead wandering through her memories. She told the room of the troll in the dungeon. She told them of Harry's challenges, his steadfast friends. She told them of Harry's surprise at discovering Quirrell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room held it's collective breath as Lizzy told them about the basilisk, about Fawkes and rescuing Ginny. She told them how Harry freed Dobby, and of SPEW. Her breath caught and her story faltered, at Dobby's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep drink of water, she moved on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spoke of Harry's struggle for the truth, about who Sirius Black was, about what he had done. Her eyes sparkled as she spoke of the confrontation in the Shrieking Shack, and when the curse broke free. She made sure the room knew which professor had stood between the werewolf and the students, ready to die in their defence. She was rather more reticent about other events, omitting entirely the saving of Buckbeak, and the rescue of the accused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lizzy's voice croaked, she smiled to Jerry, and took a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry continued the story, telling proudly what he could about Snape's double-dealings. With a side-ways glance, she also mentioned Harry's own doubts regarding the integrity of that particular professor. He gushed rather effusively about the trials, especially the first, the combat against a dragon. An odd irritated tone came to Jerry's voice when he mentioned the other competitors, especially, for some reason, Fleur Delacour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis tone softened, as he described the final challenge, and the return of the two Hogwarts students to the castle. As she paused, the whole room, lowered their heads simultaneously, unbidden for a moment's silent respect for Cedric Diggory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he continued, he made mention of the Daily Prophet's rather flexible interpretation of the facts, it's dismissal of Dumbledore and Potter, and it's puppy-like eagerness to follow the Ministry's line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry had heard the rest from Harry, the impossible demands put upon him by Dumbledore, the eternal peril of trying to deceive an expert in legilimency. Especially one so prone to violence. But he was also aware of how sensitive he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rounded off his story fiercely defending Severus Snape, as one of the loyalest and bravest men he had ever known. Nobody noticed, as mutely Lizzy nodded her absolute agreement with that sentiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva had long given up the pretence of working. Her eyebrow quirked up, as she reached a few conclusions. The tear in her eyes were rare but intimate and severe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if a spell was broken, Jerry stepped back to join his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I mean.... That's what I heard..\" he finished, a little unconvincingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor McGonagall clapped her hands, and stood up, \"Well, it's now the perfect time for your meal, in the Great Hall. After which, feel free to roam the castle on your own. If you get lost or have any difficulties, the portraits and ghosts will be more than happy to help.\" she snorted softly and smiled, \"excepting Peeves.\".</span></div></div>",

After all the presents we received, I need to return one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning from her husband she called to the air, \"Kreacher...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only a moment before the house-elf apparated in front of his mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have served me, and my family well and honourably in difficult circumstances.\" her voice caught, \"I hope you'll stay as my friend... and...\" her voice trailed into silence, as memories of Dobby swam to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd have liked this. A smile, a smirk came to her face, as she pinged, her garter belt for the house-elf to catch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're free, Kreacher. With my thanks, and an invitation to visit whenever you wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKreacher's eyes glistened, as he looked at the clothing held in his open palms. After all his years of enforced servitude, after the years of cruel masters, mistresses. He swallowed nervously, bowing deeply to his mistress, and her lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKreacher raised it up, stretching the elastic wide and crowned herself with the garter belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his mouth, to thank her, but the words wouldn't come, couldn't come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoftly Lizzy answered anyway, \"I know....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKreacher's eyes filled with possibilities, as he considered what his future... his future, words he never expected to think, what it might bring. Bowing deeply, his ears brushed against the floor, and he apparated away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked to herself, to Jerry, as she sank to her knees in front of her husband. As a student, it was something she dreamt of, on more than a few occasions. Waking with an erection, and blushing, as he'd looked over to Ron, as if he could read his thoughts, read how what he and Ginny had done in his dreams. Well, it was time to fulfil those promises, to make Jerry's dreams come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy's hands trembled in anticipation, excitement. As she undid Jerry's belt, unzipped the button. She tried to do it sexily, with allure. The look on Jerry's face was transfixed, as his hands grasped the arms of the chair. The nails threatening to dig into, dig through the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sprang free, as Lizzy eased his underwear away. Bobbing about in front of her face, Lizzy instinctively licked her lips, and swallowed. It just looked so big... too big. But she was up for the challenge. It twitched at her touch. It was warm to the touch, her fingers just long enough to wrap around. It still bucked and bounced with a mind of it's own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry let out a hiss, as she grabbed his shaft with her other hand. Twitching and bucking, but still under Lizzy's command, she heard Jerry's breathing become ragged and rasping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparing him a last look, she slowly ran her tongue all around her lips while he watched hypnotised, unable to look away. As she guided him between her lips. Her tongue traced the underside of his cock, as she swallowed it deeper and deeper. Some unknown instinct worked, and she felt his full length, even as it pushed into her throat, she felt the gentle knocking as his balls brushed against her chin. Their aroma pungent, but not unattractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy gave her husband the perfect blow job. The one she'd/he'd always dreamed off. Jerry's hands fluttered about her head, as if afraid to guide her, as if afraid it would end too soon. But his shriek of joy, came as he did. With his cock firmly embedded in her throat, she swallowed the salty goodness. As Jerry softened, she eased herself back onto her plump rear to rest on her heels. His cock slipped free, she kissed it softly as a final good-bye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry tried to speak, but like Kreacher before him no words came, no words were sufficient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoftly Lizzy answered anyway, \"I know....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she licked her lips this time, they took a slicker glistening appearance, the traces of them, mingling there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lovers felt nothing but joy, as old magic worked around the pair. It erased the lies, the disguises, the fears, and bound them together. Lizzy become truly Lizzy, and Jerry became Jerry, body and soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were many theories about the disappearance of Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley after their marriage. Dark wizards revenge, vengeful Death-eaters. But the deep magic, the old magic that had protected Harry as a child ensured the bond remained between Lizzy and Harry, between Jerry and her family. Lizzy and Jerry were blessed with an anonymous life, just another happily married couple.</span></div></div>",

Alecto was playing her part perfectly, drawing the young man deeper into her trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStripped of its Dementor wardens since the fall of the Dark Lord, Azkaban was no longer the inescapable prison it had once been. It was nearly a year since the sibling Death Eaters had escaped Azkaban together, a year of running and hiding, forced to disguise and live among muggles to survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether they had vowed to avenge the Dark Lord. Impatiently they had waited for a chance to strike back at him, but the boy was well protected, surrounded by Aurors and friends, skilled veterans of the second wizarding war. Killing him would be impossible unless he could be separated from his friends. Tonight, on the eve of his wedding, an opportunity had emerged. By morning, Harry Potter would have lost everything he held dear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlecto Carrow, \"Suzie\", lead the boy backstage. Feigning giddy excitement, the Death Eater stripped Harry of the remainder of his clothes. Her slim fingers were shaking as she tore away the boy's boxers. He stood there, wandless, utterly naked, defenseless, and she savoured the situation. She could kill him now if she so wished. But no. The boy's punishment had to be worse than simple <i>death</i>. His defeat had to be complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to resist the temptation any longer, she pressed closer, her fingers exploring the delicate, pink, female sex of the boy-who-lived, relishing the shudder that ran through his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-this wasn't uh-exactly the night I had in kind,\" Harry stammered, as her fingers stroked deeper, sliding inside him ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've yet to see the best part,\" \"Suzie\" whispered teasingly in his ear. \"When I'm done with you, even your friends won't be able to tell us apart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what!\" Harry gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled impishly. \"Trust me, I'm doing this for your good. We're going to play a little game of switch-er-oo with your friends. I can make them think that I'm you. If you can convince them that you're me, they'll leave you alone for the rest of the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs crazy as it sounded, her logic was sound. The stripper could take the guys' attention, while Harry could slip out while they weren't looking and return when they offered the polyjuice potion to return him to his original body. Yet... \"I hardly think I can convince them I'm really you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave that to me,\" she smiled. To Harry's surprise, she brandished a wand. He would never taken her for a witch. She pressed the tip against his throat, muttered a word beneath her breath, and a warm glow ran through his voice box. \"That'll help you play the part, make sure you don't give the game away. You won't be able to let slip your true identity to your friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean... I won't be able to tell them that I'm <i>Lizzy</i>?\" Harry gasped, clutching his vocal chords. He had meant to say 'Harry', but the word had emerged from his lips as transfigured as his body. \"That's not right, I'm <i>Lizzy</i>. No! <i>Lizzy</i>!\" Annoyed, he tried to form the syllables, but all that came out was, \"Lizz. Eee. L. I. Z. Z. Y. Damnit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlecto giggled at the young man's panic. \"Now remember, unless you want your friends to take advantage of you, you're Lizzy Fairbush, stripper,\" she said, grabbing a matching thong and sliding up \"Lizzy's\" longs, securing it deep between his buttocks. \"And I'm Harry Potter, the boy-who-lived.\"</span></div></div>",

Mostly they played games of wizards chess, but even the violent-brawl-in-miniature was starting to lose its appeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry barely noticed as Hermione's queen brutally decapitated his King. \"How about we make the next game the last, Hermione?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" hermione agreed, as she reset the pieces. \"Actually I was wondering if you want to make a little bet to make it more interesting,\" she said, with an unusually sly look in her eyes. \"I've been trying to practice my transfiguration spells but it's hard without an... assistant.

They formed a ring, and became a crown, as the piece stood at the far end of the board identical to the other Queens on the board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, none of the friends saw that, instead focusing on the changes to Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis plain school jumper and trousers, had transformed. Their fabric jumping in quality and softness, as they morphed. At his waist they wove themselves into a single piece. Cotton softening to a blend of satin and silk. At his neck, he felt his shirt retreating, it was shrinking to nothing, already smaller than a T-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he felt it tighten around his chest. He looked at the chess board, already suspecting, already dreading what was coming next. He felt his chest swell forward, each breath it rose and fell. Each breath it fell back a little less, each breath it pushed relentlessly further forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe neck of his jumper was now revealing a swelling cleavage. The view hypnotically holding Ron's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud crack, burst among them, and Harry felt a sharp, but very brief pain shoot from the base of his spine. Reflexively, his hands reached to explore to feel for an injury, to stop any gushing blood. But there was no injury, there was no blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, he shook his head in pointless denial, as he felt his arse swell larger beneath his fingers. He felt his thighs rounding out, in time. Even briefly he pushed back, hoping to end the torment. But the soft round, cheeks just absorbed his fingers. Mocking in their march outwards, bigger, fuller, further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnatching them back, Harry raised his hands before his face. The fingers were slimmer, at the ends of arms that were more slender and feminine than should be possible. The weight on his chest provoked a worrying question, and his hands darted to his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrantically fumbling, Harry panicked, as it became clearer... as it became undeniable that he was now a she. A member in good standing of the fairer sex. As if afraid of infection or contamination, she wiped her hands on her dress, as she pulled them from her crotch. But that just revealed her narrowed waist, above those widened hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cleavage, <i>her </i>cleavage and bust felt massive and overwhelming. But she tried to calm herself, with the idea it was her new view, the very different, very personal perspective that was making the girls look bigger and scarier than they really were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, she felt a weight land on her head. A gasp ripping itself from her lips, her hands reached up, to snatch, at the crown that had dropped into place. Her fingers caught in the ornate style of her new hair-do. A mass of coiffed curls, and ribbons. She wished she had a mirror. Her hair... His hair, had always just sort of been there. Even after the most drastic of cuts, and now... now, it was a feature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervousness dried her mouth, and she tried swallowing, her tongue darting out to lick her lips. Discovering the waxy taste of lipstick, she turned to her two friends. She took deep breaths to fight off the growing dizziness, the sense of unreality.</span></div></div>",

Unlike Ron Harry had noticed Hermione was a girl for quite a while now, as well as what a beautiful woman she was becoming. Harry loved her surprise hugs mostly because he got to feel her rapidly expanding chest squashed against him, more recently nearly smothering him, his childhood with the Dursley's making him even shorter than the book worm and putting Harry (not that he was complaining) face to nipple with many girl's breasts, especially as many of them (Hermione included) had had a growth spurt over the summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Harry's favourite part of Hermione was her ass; he'd even started helping her carry her books to class this year just to get to follow her and stare at her ass without being lectured. Hermione's ass was perfect, not a flat 'boy ass' like Ginny but not 2 over filled balloons that turned all underwear into a thong like Lavender (You wondered what idiot wears just their underwear to bed if they sleepwalk?) About a handful for most boys a little more for Harry's naturally smaller frame. He were transfixed by the sway of her cheeks as she searched for him; his rational thoughts knowing soon Hermione would either find him or give up and leave, and he could tell the next person wouldn't be as nice as Mione would. Unfortunately at the moment what Harry's logical side thought didn't matter, teenage hormones prevent him from doing anything other than stare at the enormous view of Hermione's ass shaking, an image Harry found quite satisfying as he committed it to memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harry's attention was drawn when the compartment door was opened fully, a tall (even by normal standards) sexy witch entering, dragging her trunk behind her. Harry watched in horror as with her 2nd step she easily and unknowingly crushed his trunk (minus his wand which he kept on his person) under the heavy (most likely muggle) boots she was wearing, Harry yelling at her to try get her attention as well as hoping she'd be more careful.<br>\r\nUnfortunately for him the universe was already showing it's disinterest in Harry's well being as after putting away her own trunk she took a seat, which happened to be the one Harry was currently occupying. Harry's eyes widened in shock as he tried to get away but a mixture of his small size and the size of her ass meant he couldn't outrun it, getting pinned between the witch and the seat. It was at this moment that Harry was (slightly) thankful for his durability, knowing if he was normal sized (and therefore Tonks would be quite a large giantess) he'd be just a bloody smear on her ass, as apposed to being in pain (hence slightly) but still able to breath, as well as having no lasting injuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNymphadora <i>'call me that and you die' </i>Tonks sighed as she sat down, unknowingly grinding Harry against her ass as she tried to get more comfortable. Pulling out her wand she cast the strongest privacy, locking and not-notice-me charms she knew before with a deep breath she released her current form. <br>\r\nTo Harry all he felt was an increase in weight and therefore pressure, but to anyone viewing it would be much more: Tonk's ass swelled and his breasts ballooned to G-cup, her hair turned a charcoal black and her eyes turned from the forest green of her father to a deep purple. Tonks palmed her mounds with a sigh, her mom said she took after her 'big sis' (As Andi herself was fairly average and despite having a kid Cissa was still an A) so that combined with her slightly heightened cheekbones and pale complexion she looked remarkably similar to her Aunt Bella. <br>\r\nIt was also at this point Tonks kicked off her boots, sighing in relief as she spayed the toes of her bare feet, her heavy steel capped boots may be a great deterrent/weapon against pureblood morons but they killed the first few weeks of breaking them in. If they didn't do so much damage when they connected to a wizard's nads she wouldn't wear them, but they were effective, Hell she was pretty sure she removed the ability to reproduce from several Slytherins, Gryffindors and that one Hufflepuff who thought groping her in a hallway was a good idea. Not that anyone would anything to her, 'blood traitor' or not she was still Black blood and as any Slytherin will a test she definitely took after her favourite aunt and uncle (Bellatrix and Sirius) in terms of 'creativity' when it comes to hexes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry nearly cried in relief when the pressure was released, but barely had time other than catching his breath before he was once again flattened when the ass weighting comparatively that of an apartment dropped back on top of him, Harry tried to yell when she lifted each of the following times before repeatedly being crushed by the witch's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhat is with this seat?' Tonks muttered bouncing up and down hopping to flatten/smooth whatever was under her, until she finally gave up and stood up running her hand along the seat directly under her ass.<br>\r\nWhat happens to Harry?</span></div></div>",

Wherever he was, it was warm and comfy. His seating was warm and giving, like an enormous bean-bag chair.

Perhaps the roar of a dragon unleashing a gout of flame. Then his thoughts clarified, it was the hubbub of a crowd. He was still in the stadium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried calling out for help, but nobody seemed to hear. Certainly nobody responded. Beneath his feet, the ground shifted, his feet unable to gain any purchase, he headed towards a drop... another drop. Was he concussed.

Reaching out, he grabbed as tightly as he could onto the uneven surface. But he felt almost secure, it gave him a proper chance to look around. It looked like there was some safety netting to stop people from falling off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held onto that thought, until, a huge face peered down on him. It blocked out the Sun, the confused, then amused face of Hermione Granger, her face surrounded by her wild hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...

With a swift glance he saw the girls huddled around the edge of the pool were keeping an eye on his ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are magical protections in place 'ere.\" Fleur explained, as Harry snatched the top towel with one hand. Flushing, he realised he needed two hands to give himself any modesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBriefly he turned to face the wall, flashing his cute ass to all the room's occupants. Again the giggling resumed, as Harry wrapped it around his waist. Turning back to face Fleur, he tucked the towel in at his waist to hold it in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really sorry. I didn't ... I didn't mean to...\" Harry's voice was high and piping, he tried to cough it clear, and continue in his regular voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nous avons...

Don't you 'ave such magic in your dorms....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry remembers the stairs turning into a slide when he tried to follow Hermione to the dorms. He also remembered Hermione not facing the same problem, getting to the boys side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly Harry's hands reached for his crotch, even through the thick towel, he could tell it was reduced. Ha! It was barely there. Turning back to the wall, she ripped open the towel, and a soul-deep wail was ripped from his throat. The wail was high and shrill, and very feminine. With shaking hands he <i>now</i> she, re-secured the towel in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned back to face Fleur, there was a new sensation too. A delay, a shifting from her chest, as it took a moment to catch up. She went to cup her new swollen nipples, but snatched her hands back, as if afraid of spreading some contagion. Beneath those riper, fuller she saw her chest swelling outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA piercing 'Eeeeee' came unbidden. She felt the towel shift at her waist, but was transfixed by how her new chest (was it now a bust) how it moved. The ripples with the least movement were unfamiliar and unsettling. But she was more concerned with how it continued to surge forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready the girls felt massive and heavy, and bigger... far too big to be real. She really wasn't used to judging them from this angle. But finally as if her nerves snapped, she clamped her hands in place. Determinedly she tried to force them backwards, to restore her former masculine flat chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensitivity of the new nipples drew a gasp from the newest Gryffindor girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful, 'Arriet, or the magic will fight back too.\" Fleur's warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if listening, the magic intensified. Her ample bosom smooshing between Harriet's splayed fingers. With a ruffling, and a soft hiss, Harriet felt the towel slip down her legs. Legs that were smoother than he'd ever seen. Legs that were topped by an arse that was swelling backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harriet let go her bust, the girls heaved on her shoulders, the weight of the unrestrained F-cups tugging painfully, a reminder (as if it was needed) that bigger girls need support, and Harriet was a bigger girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the shock hit her, she slumped to the floor, her knees cushioned by the towel. Again the reminders mocked her, as she felt her expanded arse ripple at the impact against the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least, you've kept a dainty waist...\" Fleur said trying to sound compassionate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling hopeless, powerless, and lost, Harriet burst into floods of tears.</span></div></div>",

In the shade of her mountainous bust, was a wasp waist, completely unnatural, and just as completely arousing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet did the only thing that felt right, she fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head cracked off the marble floor, and in an instant she was gone. Free from her trials, free from the dragon, free from whoever was orchestrating this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the dream, Harry was just resting at Hagrid's hut, with his friends, times were simpler. He had a true friend with Ron Weasley, and an equal but different friendship with Hermione. The teacher's pet, who'd lied to her teachers for them. His slumbering face pulled into a smile, and he was juddered awake. The hut, the friends all vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet woke and found herself dressed head to toe in Beauxbatons Bleu. An unfamiliar cap upon her head, she scrabbled up from the comfy chair. Her legs hissed, the nylons caressing against her skin, against each other. Mentally she assessed the changes. She felt the satin soft, cool embrace of the panties, and the teasing, cradling confinement of <i>her </i>bra. She wobbled a little in the heels, thankfully they weren't too high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't recognise the room, it could be the Room of Requirement, or still inside the carriage. Even the heavy stone fireplace didn't help her pin it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey'd combed her hair as well. A long body of dark hair, flowed smoothly over her shoulder. A reflection in the glass of a portrait, showed her that she was wearing full make-up. Her emerald eyes had never looked more feline, her cheekbones never higher or more haughty. Her mouth, a rosy promise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA whimper escaped her lips, as she drank in her body. The uniform did nothing to conceal how curvaceous her body now was. The swell of her bust, was perfectly tailored. Her waist was well contained, accentuating, enhancing the outward curve of her wide hips, and the roundness of her sumptuous powder blue arse.</span></div></div>",

An appraising glance left Harriet with the impression that she had the hottest bod.

Hermione was a generous C-cup, or maybe even D-cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny was between a fullish B-cup, and a C-cup. It was only as Ginny tugged at her cape, that Harriet realised how obvious her glances were to the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a disapproving snort from Hermione, and a look on her face. Ironically it reminded her of that time in the library when Hermione had told her about Romilda Vane, and the love potion she intended for him, as the 'Chosen One'. Or more precisely, her reaction when Harry had pointed out that he <i>was </i>the Chosen One.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We 'ave a portkey, ici.\" Fleur offered, to break the tension. \"If you'd feel safer, we can sneak the three of you back to Beauxbatons.

She realised that she was finding English more alien to her, and even thought back on her own words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Portkey?\" Harriet said, happy to change the subject, as she nodded her pretty head to the lacrosse ball floating a few inches above Fleur's open palm.</span></div></div>",

Even in an all-female environment, she would draw attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly added, it was mostly jealousy, rather than sexual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet only really heard the <i>mostly</i>.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Or rather as her eyes were drawn to the way her arse shifted, and danced. It looked like she was out to attract guys. There was a bounce and a swivel that looked so right, and so wrong too. With Hermione and Fleur chattering up front, neither girl had noticed how Ronni was shimmying and shaking. Her feet would land deliberately, not loudly, but firmly, sending an eye catching ripple dancing across her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to hide her smile, as Ronni idly played with her longer hair, she appeared oblivious to her own changes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Errr.</i>..

Anyone could fly at the moment, and nervous flier would often bring friends to cheer them on, and offer encouragement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFleur directed Ronni into one small tent to change clothes, Harriet into the neighbouring one, and when she directed Hermione to one was greeted with a friendly, but firm 'Non, merci'. In a lower voice, and in English, \"I'll sit in the stands and offer you encouragement.\" Her head turned more towards Ron's tent, as the door flaps settled back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione's accent making Ronni flush, at the ideas it inspired, but couldn't carry out (at the moment). She darted inside her tent, with a flashing glance to her own bust to ensure it hadn't grown again. Seeing the flustered Ronni, Harriet entered her tent with a touch more amusement. Catching in her peripheral vision Hermione walking towards the pitch, as Fleur entered her own tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harry entered, the light changed, becoming both brighter and clearer. The top of the tent was now clearer, allowing in more sunlight for her to change. Also, the walls of the tent had changed, from white to blue. A nice system to avoid accidental embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe word reached Harry's ears too clearly. Though it sounded more like a pissed-off Ginny, than his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning towards the sound, Harry replied, \"It's merde, maintenent.\" even attempting to imitate Hermione's accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her amusement evaporated, as she too flushed at the sight of the Beauxbatons Quidditch uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baise, moi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as she plucked it from where it hung from the broom resting against the central tent pole. It reminded her of the Beauxbatons swimsuit, that caught his eye, and kept his attention from the second trial. Just a little thicker, and with a mini-skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, eager for an excuse not to play. Harriet decided to try on the strip, sure it wouldn't fit her generous curves. Confident that Ronni would be thinking the same herself. It just wasn't tailored for her body, let alone Ronni's boosted (punishment?) curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, as she tugged at the shoulders. The fabric rippled and stretched. Magically adjusting to fit her physique. Desperately, she tried to tug the mini-skirt lower. Already feeling over-exposed, and vulnerable. Catching sight of herself in the full-length mirror, she was taken aback. At how gorgeous she looked. Her body a little over-ripe, over-stated, but not grotesquely so. Also, her face was beautiful, highlighted with make-up to enhance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously smoothing away imaginary wrinkles from the uniform her fingers brushed over her bust. As if attempting to smooth it flat. Instead discovering the embroidery beauxbaton crest there. Closing her eyes, and taking a deeper breath, she decided to give it a fresh appraisal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn opening her eyes, Harry realised she looked like one of the women from old Star Trek. With a groan, and knowing her excuse about it not fitting wouldn't be accepted. Harry left the tent. He was met, by an equally distressed Ronni. Her hands fixed to the hem of her skirt, a battle on her face between pulling it lower, and simply stopping it from flapping in the breeze. Indeed her freckled face was flushed beetroot. Her bigger cleavage decorated with the same eye-catching freckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rustle of a tent flap, had the girls whirl around to face the noise. Only to see Fleur emerge from her tent. Harry too felt a wave of humiliation, seeing that she was bustier than Fleur. Though thankfully not so endowed as Ronni. A startled squeaking 'Eeep', bursting from her lips, she glanced at her own bosom. Expecting it to erupt. However, it wasn't a lewd glance, and her bust remained unaltered. Well, either it wasn't lewd, or because she was out of the school uniform. But she felt a wave a relief flood through her veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In this school, we are united. We have no separate <b><i>'</i></b>ouses.\" she explained.</span></div></div>",

They see Hermione leaning over the edge of the balcony. Her eyes on their arrival, rather than players whizzing through the air behind her turned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile is a mile wide, as she waves to the three new arrivals. Eager to show off her skills Harriet mounts her broom, and flies into the pitch area, with a nervous Ronni close behind.

The flapping, snapping material sets their skirts fluttering against their plump arses. As gentle but relentless spanking from their own outfits. Both girls were also aware of how much wider, fuller, heavier their arses felt as they straddled their brooms. Also their low, bent over grip, makes both feel as if they're pulling the broom deep into their cleavage. The image disturbing and impossible to resist.</span></div></div>",

Even with her ginger hair, she looked distinctly different. Harriet had check out her reflection at times, and knew that she looked nothing like Harry Potter. She looked as feminine and girly as Fleur, and however intently she stared, there wasn't a hint of a scar on her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly Hermione looked the same, at least physically. With the blue uniform brightening her smile when she relaxed enough to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was certainly a different experience walking the halls like this. Almost like a different kind of invisibility cloak. The girls glanced at her, and quickly, often sniffily, looked away. The boys were oblivious to her, or at least her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry would have given 10 galleons to be invisible to one more boy.

Unfortunately, she wasn't as hefty and, her bust crashed against his arm, and she fell to the floor her arms flying. The bounce and ripple from her bosom was tremendous, and drew Cormac's eyes, hypnotically holding them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked torn between fleeing the shrieking girl, and his obvious staring, and helping her to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't very polite.\" Fleur interrupted, \"She is terribly flattered, but alas she is spoken for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCormac nodded his head, swallowed, and left as quickly as he could. They all heard his running feet, once he rounded the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose, this is your way out of asking someone to the ball.\" Hermione said a little huffily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet dusted off the worst damage from her uniform, and Ron glowered at the floor, embarrassed by the truth of Hermione's accusation.

He just stared at them unmoving, luckily he was small and buoyant enough for that, bobbing gently from the ripples the 4 giggling witches produced.<br>\r\nIt was quite safe until he was hit by a perspective tidal wave, sending him directly into the girl's cleavage. Harry was left to squirm for several minutes until he was pulled out by a smirking Fleur ''Oh 'Arry, I'm sorry I wasn't there to catch you zis time, but even at your size it's only polite to ask a girl before diving into her cleavage'' she laughs at his near luminous blush while trying to hide his growing erection.<br>\r\nWhen he regained his senses Harry noticed Fleur was now in the bath with the rest of them, dressed in a dark blue bikini, and assumed she was the reason for the wave earlier. She gently places him on her breast as the other girls coo at how cute he looks at this size, luckily she makes no attempt to remove his hands from his fully awakened junk, though she is also cooing as she played with his hair.<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

Arriving at the empty classroom she specified he removed the cloak and called out to her. He receive no verbal reply only a flash of red light and then blackness.<br>\r\nHarry awoke some time later to a smell of flowers pressed up against a pale wall. He runs a hand along it and hear booming but familiar laughter \"Stop that Harry, it tickles\" as he turns his head in the noise's direction his eyes had adjusted enough to see it ......... A giant Hermione smiling down at him. Turning back to the 'wall' he sees the sole of her right foot as well as the source of the flowery scent. \"Do you remember before 3rd year when I wanted a pet so badly but my parents said no? How when trying to comfort me you said 'Any animal would be blessed to have you as their owner' and I asked 'even you'? \" Harry nodded to each question remembering how he'd said if he were a pet he'd love to have someone like Hermione as an owner<br>\r\n\"Well Buckbeak's trial, any extra class weren't the only things I researched with the time turner, another was a ritual to shrink another magical and make them a witches pet. Now we finally have a quiet year I decided to make you mine; I even used the advanced runic array so you couldn't be seen or heard by magicals with a Y chromosome or muggles. So I'll ask you the question for real Harry: will you be my pet for life? Do keep in mind certain responses will be met with 'unpleasant' action\" it was at that point Harry noticed her seating position meant she could have foot on either side of him, her toes occasionally blocking his view of her face when they wiggle. This became more of a problem when as she said 'unpleasant' Harry felt a slowly increasing pressure on his sides, realizing she would crush him between her feet if he refused Harry yelled \"yes Hermione I'll be your pet!\" To which she squealed with joy and her toes clenched.<br>\r\nHarry finds himself with his skull trapped between her right big and second toes, at least until Hermione noticed his predicament and released freeing him. She then picked him up and stood to her full height. \"I'm glad you accepted though I wasn't sure you would. As such your travel arrangements and sleeping areas are incomplete, don't worry though I have a very special place for my very special pet\" with that he was treated to the last surprise of the day: Hermione had huge breasts, D maybe double D in size and he curses Hogwarts shapeless robes from hiding the wonders Hermione in a T-shirt revealed.<br>\r\nPalming her left breast she gently separates it from it's twin. Harry was dropped into the enlarged crevice right before Hermione let go of her breast causing him to be entombed up to your neck in tit flesh. Hermione giggles seeing his condition causing both Harry and her breasts to jiggle \" This will be your home until your permanent one is complete, you should be safe and will not be able to fall out. Now if you'll excuse me my next class is Ancient Runes and WE can't be late\" after that Harry's once friend now owner skipped out, no doubt purposely ensuring his stay was far from peaceful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Hermione treat him from this point on?</span></div></div>",

But he wasn't ready to face the school librarian, nor Hermione in her element.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe corridor was quiet, but that was quite normal at this time. His stomach gave a growl of complaint, after all the years in the cupboard, it was hard to be away from a good meal. But that was for Hermione part of the appeal, while everybody was in the Grand Hall, enjoying the feast, she had the library virtually to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was sure, that when she was alone, Hermione would sniff the oldest parchments, inhaling the dust of bygone authors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Petrificus Totalus.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the spell hit, and the sound of the voice was familiar, girlish. However, he couldn't say who, and now with the spell working he couldn't even turn and face his adversary, as she approached. Her shoes... Her heels clicking steadily off the cold stone floor of the passageway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHot breath teased his hair, as her voice whispered to him, just an inch or two away. His head refused to turn, to reveal his tormentor. Somehow, he was sure it wasn't a Slytherin. He knew that many of them doted on the idea of impressing Draco with a gesture... with some act of revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Retro diminue.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wand ruffled his chaotic hair, as it tapped his skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry watched mutely screaming, as the world rose up around him. His heart pounded, as he shrank to the size of a doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shall regret insulting me ... and my sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's hair was slicked to his head, as the words were sealed with a kiss. Her succulent lips were wide enough to encompass his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDearly Harry wanted to apologise, he'd never meant to be so rude to either of the Patel sisters. But with a gentle touch, she straightened Harry's legs, and moved his tiny arms. Harry imagined he looked very camp with his hands on his hips. But she lifted him, up until he was inches from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try not to enjoy this too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned Harry to face away from her, and with great care she lowered Harry into her cleavage. Until he was held in a pillow embrace. His arms stopped him from falling down, and Harry sat, or rather stood like a proud jewel in her centre of her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry could feel every beat of her heart, as she buttoned her blouse shut, sealing him off from sight. He tried to speak... to do ... something ... anything. However, he was still deep in the power of the spell, and was left to enjoy the gentle shifting of her bosom, as her fingers worked. Even if for Harry it was like riding the most bizarre fun park ride.... The bean-bag roller coaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was sure, that Parvati was putting in extra effort to embarrass Harry, surely a girl's bust couldn't be this mobile. The distraction would be endless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was dark inside the blouse, and oppressive. Although even now, Harry's eyes were adjusting. He could see through the material, and make out the outlines of the walls, as though through a dense fog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Hermione.\" Parvati said with real joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Parvati.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry would have waved... But just couldn't...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,.. Hermione, I meant to ask... Could I borrow, 'Hogwarts, A History.', from you? I fancy a little late night reading.\"</span></div></div>",

Rummaging around, her arm disappeared up to her shoulder, until with a triumphant smile she revealed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParvati took it just as happily, and lifting it to her face, she took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I was the only one to do that.\" Hermione confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't beat the smell of a good book.\" she answered with an barely suppressed squeal of excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's view vanished, as she hugged the book to her bosom. His fleshy prison tightening all around, as he was smothered in a warm sweet embrace. He was relieved, as the pressure eased, the lace trim on Parvati's bra lowering and setting a silken horizon for him. Through the material of her blouse, he could see another shape looming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls hugged their good-byes, Harry could feel the pulsing of Hermione's heart, and the deep red of her bra through a gap between the buttons. It was trimmed with a golden lace, tiny lions embroidered along the edge. Again he felt the gorgeous constraint as Parvati's titties squished him in their relentless embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting off at a skipping pace, Harry felt like he was sailor abandoned on a rolling ocean. After turning a few corners, he was bathed in light, as the top buttons were undone on the blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying the scenery, and journey.\" she patted him affectionately on his tiny mop of disordered hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abstinence.\" she said. Harry heard the sound of the portrait opening, and soon they were in the Gryffindor common room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the spell ease, as his fingertips started to warm, and respond to his urging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rhythmic jiggling, as she trotted up the stairs to the girls dorm was distracting, and hugely pleasant. There was an oaken slam, as she closed her dorm room door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer slender hand slipped inside, and fished Harry out from her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tossed him to bounce on her well-made bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a choice for you.\" she said a smile playing across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are just <b>too </b>cute to change back. So you can wear some of the finest dolls clothes that I have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer enormous hand revealed some doll's clothes spread over the bed. It was obviously magical, given how detailed and elegant it was. Elegant was the right word Harry thought, as it was all abundantly feminine and girlish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he'd been able to shake his head, or move his jaw, he might have given an answer straight away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe uncurls her fist, and reveals the smallest potion bottle he'd ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I could use a new familiar. I think you'd make a cute rat, or perhaps an entertaining cat. As you squeak your rage, and I console your friends about your disappearance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe widens her spread arms, \"So it's time to choose...\"</span></div></div>",

His whole body spasmed, as his muscles twitched. Harry drew his wand, but it was a mere splinter against his captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Expelliarmus.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrieked in his tiny piping voice.

However, after having to put up with Dudley's hand-me-downs, at least these would fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping the panties up his legs, he found they teased his skin to a higher awareness, as their silky softness was undeniable. Unsure what to wear next, he picked up the bra. Slipping it over his shoulders, he watched as the cups flattened against his chest. The catch magically secured itself behind his back, making his stomach squirm at the little surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much to cover up the soft, frilly underwear, he quickly pulled on the rest of the clothes.

The cups of the bra flattening against his chest, like a very abbreviated T-shirt. He also felt the skirt tighten up, pulling in to cleave to his boyish ass, and rather straighter physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParvati picked him up, uncurling one hand, she gently placed him in her other palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the most convincing of girls.\" she told Harry with amusement. \"But probably my new favourite doll. Now pirouette for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout many options, Harry obliged. As he turned on the spot, he felt Parvati's palm shift, as she gave a gasp of surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry gave his own little gasp, as he saw a cloud of pink emanating out from his body... out from the clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look of fear and surprise on Parvati's face convinced Harry that this was well beyond what she expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry expected what happened next even less. As he felt his hair sprout wildly. Plucking wildly at the mass flowing over his face. He gave a little yelp of surprise. Already it was longer than Hermione's... Well, in scale anyway. Although Harry's mop was always untamed, it had never been as thick or reached half way down his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new sensation awaken for Harry, and instinctively his hands leapt to his chest. Beneath his hands he felt the nipples, and weirdly he also felt the sensation through his chest too.

Relentlessly they pushed forward, soon filling Harry's cupped hands. He also felt the underwear adjusting as it managed to cope dispassionately with the changing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lost her balance, as Parvati wrapped her hands around Harry's slender, rounded, hairless legs, planting the transforming student on her bed before fleeing the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harry struggled for balance, her arms went wide, and she felt the jiggling, shimmying on her chest... and also the answering weight shifting behind her.</span></div></div>",

Harry's eyes flung open as he looked up, straight into the gaze of Bellatrix Lestrange the ex dark lords best follower. His focus began with her face; pale skin and features, deep amethyst eyes and thick pouty blood red lips framed by wild black hair. His gaze followed down predictably stopping at her large breasts, her corset creating a crevice he could get lost in at his current size. There was little of note until he reached nearer his own level, instead of her usual high heeled boots her feet were bare, her toes twitched and scrunched in a way that worried Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now we can have some fun\" Bella said before Harry had to roll sideways to avoid being stepped on. \"Awe you moved, you were supposed to stay put\" she pouted Harry barely avoided her other foot. His panicked heartbeat had him breathing deeply, filling him with  lungfulls of her scent. He had expected with the knee high, high heeled boots she always wore the smell wold be terrible but it wasn't, it was pleasant and mildly fruity, something he wouldn't mind smelling normally (even if she covered his face with her feet) but not when it was trying to make him a bloody, gooey mess between her toes. He then managed to get up and start running \"oh goodie a chase\" Bella giggled as she dropped to her hands and knees and began to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry knew she was playing with him; if she'd put any effort or speed into it she'd have killed him the first time never mind all the others, also she hadn't stopped laughing and giggling since he'd woken up, not her usual hyena cackling but more one of amusement. There had been a couple of times he'd almost stoped and let her catch him in the last while except for one thing; every few minutes she'd snap her teeth at him, he could feel it just behind him even if it wasn't, at his size it was a sonic boom. Eventually exhaustion overcame him and he stopped and that was when Bellatrix pounced; Harry closed his eyes expecting to feel the witch's perfect teeth tear into his flesh but instead he was enveloped in something soft, warm and heavy. Opening his eyes Harry saw he was surrounded by pale flesh and could hear muffled laughter and then he knew; Bella had landed her breasts on top of him. His prison shook in what Harry assumed was her standing up again and heard her say \"Got you HA, HA! Now ickle Potter is all mine forever, now what to do with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Pointless information: Voldy is dead, Bella not dead, Bella kinda OOC.

She wanted to reward Harry, for his kindness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven her fellow Ravenclaws were known to slip and call her Loony, she was more inclined to forgive them. It was done with affection, and helped reduce the sting of it. After leaving Cho in the common room, she was suddenly hit by the perfect idea. Clearly, Harry hadn't meant to hurt her friend, nonetheless Cho was very upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked through the dormitory bookshelves until she found the right book. After all, it would do to make a mistake with a spell that was to be a reward... an education.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry just needed to understand the complexities of a girls emotions, their range and power. With Hermione at Harry's side Luna was sure the experience would be quick and painless. Even accounting for the drag factor of Ron's emotional ineptitude, Harry would learn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs an additional benefit, it would give Harry a degree of anonymity. Time away from being the Boy who lived. Time away from that scar, a chance to move around the school without being noticed at every turn. To hear the conversations that change whenever he entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next quandary she faced was whose face should Harry take on. It would have to be a current student, the school wasn't so big that a stranger would pass unnoticed. A smile quirked up the corner of her mouth, as she considered how sexy, or plain Harry would be... Which she'd prefer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould she want to be able to distract her fellow students, or just mingle anonymously. Mentally she reviewed her options. A subtle nod or shake as she whittled down her choices.</span></div></div>",

A quick glance at her watch told her it was dinner time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went over the spell in her mind. It would transform Harry into Romilda Vane, the changes would need to be slow to avoid causing Harry any pain or discomfort. However, he ... well, everybody (else) ... would be oblivious to the transformation until it was complete and Harry was alone. It was meant to be a learning experience, and not a punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smirk crossed her face, as she thought of Romilda, she was blossoming into womanhood. Luna wondered how Harry would take the attention, he was used to being stared at. But the cause of the staring would be very different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeating herself at the Ravenclaw table, the girls on either side, slid just a little further away. She was used to this, but it was still hard to take. As a large dish appeared before her, piled high with her favourite foods. Luna drew her wand beneath the table. Looking around, she spotted Harry, and favoured him with a smile. The spell would give the target the appropriate clothes, Romilda was known for her racy taste, and almost persuaded Luna to choose another to be the template. She certainly didn't expect Harry to be flashing her underwear, so decide to go ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was too busy talking to Ron and Hermione to notice. Casting the spell beneath her breath, she gave the swish and flick. A brief flash of light lit up her blouse, and she watched as at the same moment, Harry shifted uncomfortably in his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell started slowly, accelerating as the changes occurred. Although Harry wasn't able to see the difference, his comfy boxers had just become a silken thong. A silken thong that split his cheeks uncomfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA airy smile came to Luna, it was always rewarding when a spell was well cast. Tucking her wand away, she directed her attention to the food in front of her.</span></div></div>",

Besides, she enjoyed the sight of Harry's hair, already a wild nest, now still as wild, but bouncing off his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of the Gryffindors, or anyone else was aware of the changes happening in their midst. Luna wasn't sure how slow the changes were going to be, magical changes were more obvious when they were faster and gave their target less time to adjust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like Harry had shifted his seating, but to Luna he was now a couple of inches shorter. She also thought that his shirt was looking silker, and starting to hang differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dropped her gaze lower, and through the forest of legs, she spotted the receding skirt retreating up Harry's legs. Legs that themselves, were rather smooth and evoked some mild envy in Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe adjusted her spectrespecs she took in Harry's face. His lips were fuller, poutier and more feminine than androgenous. His lashes also looked longer, and fluttered more extravagently. The whole shape of his face was tending towards Romilda's, now. As Harry sat forward, there was a shifting surge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna blushed, as Harry's bust crashed forward, apparently he was now female, and not wearing a bra. The colour and shape of her nips, very visible to the Ravenclaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurely, Romilda wouldn't be out in public without a bra. Surely, it was still waiting to transfigure into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giggle escaped Luna's lips as she recalled when she'd first heard Romilda's name mentioned. She'd been trying to sneak a love potion to Harry Potter. The thought of finding himself in her body, made her giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking in Ron and Hermione she was glad to see that neither of them had noticed they were now talking to a girl. Oblivious to Harry's new look, and even her softer voice. She breathed a sigh, when she spotted the frilly cups of a bra pressing against Harry's blouse. The thought of Harry's bust would probably reduce Ron to a blubbering wreck. There wasn't much more than a residual trace of magic around Harry, and Luna was sure the changes were complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelicately dabbing her lips, Harry excused herself. She too was oblivious, but soon to find herself waking to a very new situation.</span></div></div>",

She slid the book back onto the shelf with a little more ease than she fetched it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was unaware of the extra inches in height she now boasted. She was equally blind to her shortening hair, shrinking from cascading locks to a tousled nest. Brushing a stray lock from her forehead, she didn't feel the lightning scar that was becoming visible there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNor did she notice as her skirt extended down to her shoes, as it transformed into a plain pair of uniform trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna watched with detached pleasure, as her spell completed. Perhaps now, Harry could enjoy some anonymity as with an inaudible pop. The transfigured became aware of their changes. Harry suddenly found himself blessed with a female body, abundantly so, and extremely feminine, judging from the lace trim she felt as the bra cupped her bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry managed to quell the scream of horror to a muffled whimper. But her hands nonetheless darted down to her skirt. A squeak, high-pitched but brief escaping as she discovered she truly was a girl. As if still looking for hope, her hands leapt to her chest, mauling her full, pert bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, she felt everything, both in her fingers, and just as shockingly from her bust. The pain startling, the mashed bra crinkling beneath her assault. From Ron's fixed goggle-eyed expression, to Hermione's hissed '<i><b>Milli...</b></i>', she knew this was truly how she looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione's hissed comment also telling her exactly who her friends thought she was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the library, Romilda Vane's hands were in his crotch, confirming that he truly was male. Her long mane of hair now a memory, she was gasping, panting, barely capable of breathing, and incapable of yelling her horror at whatever was going on. Dizzy, and faint, he slumped back on his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wood feeling colder and less comfortable with his new less padded rear. As black specks whirled around his vision, Romilda's head slumped to the side. Reflected back from the rain-splattered glass was Harry Potter's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn alertness sprang into her muscles, a mystery fire her brain. A cautious hand rose to touch the scar. It's edges clear to her touch. The mirror image matching her movements. He swallowed several times before realising this was real... or at least happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, he bumped against the edge of the desk. A longing was now expressed. Romilda sank back down in his seat, the erection stiffening and refusing to go away. His cheeks blushed in shame at what she was thinking. Relentless the blood pulsed in his veins, and he felt his new cock bob in time, as if eager to find a new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With ease she settled in beside Ron at the Gryffindor table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luna... are you?\" she started uncertainly, the confusion clear on Ron and Hermione's faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you responsible for this?\" she gestured to her body, her hand bumping against her bust. The surprise causing her to snap her hand away as she blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Harry. I thought you'd like some anonymity, a break from people staring at your scar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Luna's words, both Ron and Hermione felt their recent memory restore. The sight of Harry transfiguring into Romilda Vane drawing a delayed gasp. Both at their sudden recollection, and their complete blindness to it, only seconds ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione was bursting with question. Milli eased a silver platter from beneath the fruit, and took a moment to admire her reflection in the etched silverware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer reflection was smiling oddly, back at her. It was genuine, and slightly confused, the hint of a pout on lips that looked too full were a little worrying, and the hint of bimbo naivety not something Harry wanted to over-think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luna.\" Hermione hissed, barely above a whisper, but even that was silenced, as Milli reached across the table. Her hand resting softly on Hermione's wrist as if to restrain her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dobby tried far worse, to save me.\" She had to pause, her soft tones almost girlish with delight felt alien in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was done with good intentions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to Luna, \"Thank you....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna beamed back at Milli, \"Any time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words taking a different meaning to Harry, than they did for Hermione. Ron was faintly behind in the conversation. His gaze on Milli's rising and falling chest, as she spoke... as she breathed, as if looking for some flaw in the magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ron.\" Hermione hissed, \"Don't stare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay guys, have fun.\" Luna left with the three friends still somewhat in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the library, the new Harry was struggling with her first erection. Well, the first one she'd had herself... herself?... himself. It bobbed, and responded to her every touch. Insistent and immediate, she knew the 'cure' for an erection. Though the quiet alcove in the library felt very public. His hands dropped from exploring the scar. His lap, his hard-on feeling incredibly visible as it caused his trousers to tent unmistakably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHissing in pain, as he rose from the desk. The problem hidden by a rather too swiftly applied parchment. It twitched, as if ready to explode with every passing second. The urgency of his need, building in Romilda's mind. The inevitable end, either by his own hand, or just from time setting his mind racing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe toilets, and their privacy feeling impossibly far away. The quiet of the library making every sound seem like an accusation, an attention grabbing revelation of his need. He tried to tell himself, he was alone in the library, that the silence was a good thing. That <span class=\"clgrey\"><i>she</i></span>... <i><b>he</b></i>, could solve this problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven just thinking of it... felt like it raised the urgency. His flesh pulsing more firmly, more rapidly with every passing second.</span></div></div>",

Hermione's mouth opened and closed silently, as she considered and rejected objection. Her gaze just following Milli's retreating back, as she went to anonymously explore the castle... for the first time ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought made her wonder. After all these years, what it felt like, the burden of that scar. The way it defined and limited Harry's options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking across the table, she spotted Ron's gaze also on Milli's departing back. Well, a little lower actually. Milli's rump moving with eye-catching grace. She was moving, with a natural feminine grace, not as some boy trying to pass as witch. Hermione thought back to the skirt smoothing movement, her hands brushing over her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn appreciation growing for Luna's spell. She'd left Harry with enough instincts to pass, without those tell-tale mannerisms that'd reveal the person's original gender. She wondered about combining it with poly-juice. Questions flooded her brain, as she thought of the consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe startled herself from the thoughts, looking up suddenly. Milli was gone entirely from the Great Hall. With no idea where she'd gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the library, Harry had found the quietest corner of the library. His view out the window, making him feel exposed. His back shamefully to the rest of the library. His fist furiously pumping away. It was a revelation to Romilda how sensitive the damned thing was... His grip shifting between, too tight, too soft. Each touch sending the damned thing twitching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't meet the half-reflected face in the glass. The expression as his hand worked it's magic, an amusing range of contortions, none of them erotic. Until surprising himself, he finally came. His knees weak, and trembling, he rested his free hand on a table for stability. His other hands holding his softening cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe excess cum drooling over his fingers, he looked at it. The source of his frustration, so demanding, so insistent, now deflated and the tension gone from his body. A smile split his face, it had been intense, and fun. Sure that he would do better the next time... Almost eager for their to be a next time. Inside her Harry body, Romilda felt a thrill at the daring of her actions. Actually pleasuring Harry to cum, he smiled at himself... to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gaze dropped to see the mess he'd made. His nose crinkled in distaste.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had no problems changing in front of Harry, partly because she was unsure as to if he was even aware in his form, and also he would be spending a lot of time with her breasts so if she had any problems she wouldn't be doing this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry initially had no idea what he was only finding out her was clothing when Hermione said 'worn', wonder what he was when she began to strip, when she flashed her breasts to him Harry knew 2 things; he was a bra, apparently Hermione's size, and that Hermione had beautiful, big, bouncy tits. He was picked up again and brought closer to his prize, though he stopped at her face (which if Harry had would be pouting) and she began speaking \"Okay Harry you're about to go somewhere very special, so behave right?\" Harry just looked back at her thinking \"<i>I'm a bra! What do you think I'll do?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione must've realised her flaw too as she giggled before lowering him to her breasts, then attaching his clasp with a smile. Harry was enjoying himself, Hermione's breasts felt as soft as then looked and were really perky, there was just one slight problem; Hermione's nipples were hard and stabbing into him. Though even that he put up with mainly because it meant she was very aroused by the current situation and his presence, including his current position. Nice to see they were both getting enjoyment. Hermione was surprised by her thoughts on the matter; she'd expected to be apauld by this; she felt it as wrong but damn the feel of him on her skin and the idea of using Harry for something this naughty got her wet (and very glad she hadn't made Harry into a pair of panties)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, now what?</span></div></div>",

Looking down he saw he was much closer to the ground, meaning he had shrunk as well as his uniform transforming into a pillowcase with a gryffindor crest on his chest.<br>\r\nHarry heard someone aproach behind him and felt himself turned around, noticing he was eye line with the edge of Hermione's skirt.

As his elfish lips shifted from foot to foot ensuring he didn't favour either of his mistress' beautiful feet. He only stopped at her command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his knees, he look up, up his Mistress. She looked to tall, powerful, commanding and wise. Even the swell of her bust hiding part of her face was magnificent. She gestured him back to his feet. Obediently he stood in front of her waiting for her next command. The pillowcase his only clothing, mocking him further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Debbie....\" she said absently, \"I'll call you Debbie, it'd be wrong to have a house elf called Harry Potter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile on her face was uneven, as if she were in two minds about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie wanted to object, but again the nausea rose in her throat, at the very idea of even saying 'Harry Potter'. It was abhorrent and unnatural. A house-elf should accept their status. Debbie nodded to himself.

The thought was freshly completed, as a solution came to mind.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Debbie obeys the Mistress.\" he answered. But even as Debbie answered, he felt the house elf magic go to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Debbie is a female house elf, Mistress.\" she continued. Her voice slightly higher, slightly softer. The physical changes barely noticeable. Hermione noted the way the pillowcase hung on her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can feel the compulsion, can't you? Debbie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebbie could only nod her agreement, sadness in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you need a taste of the day of a house elf.\" She smirked, \"You should count yourself lucky, it's Christmas and the castle has barely any students at the moment. But a day in the kitchen will be a good lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverjoyed at being given a task by her Mistress, Debbie apparated directly to the kitchen to help.

Her big ears flopping lazily in danger of sticking to her head in the humid, steamy heat of the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA house elf, apparated in beside her. Another female. Her gender was impossible to deny. Her wide tennis-ball sized eye swivelled in her head, and a few sparse hairs decorated her head. Her ears too, were low and hanging to the back of her head. Though more in fear than exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was the bustiest elf that Debbie had ever seen. Her pillowcase pushed out by her lavish chest. She looked sorrowfully at her own snitch tits, barely there bumps. Then back over to the new arrival, who guessed their size was smuggling bludgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, without clothes she didn't have a bra, and without a bra... the girls were quite mobile and eye-catching. Deciding to make friends, she held out her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Debbie.\" she announced proudly. A genuine sense of worth and pride from her labour in the kitchen filling her voice. This ... This tottering pile of dishes was her work, and not Harry's she was tempted to give a sweeping gesture to show her achievement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sullen, \"Ronni...\" was the answer she received, and a half-hearted hand was extended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe forgot about the hand-shake, even as she pumped the new arrivals hand vigorously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill shaking it, she took a second deeper look. That sparse hair on her head was a coppery red, and those eyes were too familiar to ignore, magnified incredibly, it startled her that she hadn't recognised Ron earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to say his own name... or his name... but her tongue refused to form the words. Instead, with her free hand she snatched up a flat plate and slapped herself on the forehead with it. Horror struck, she glowered at the plate, and the arm holding it, before dropping it back into the soapy water as if it were a dangerous snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her instincts, she persevered. Especially as she spotted the Gryffindor lion distorted across her pillowcase by her chest. It danced slightly as Ronni's breath sobbed in and out of her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the words burst forth... \"Mistress.... Mistress 'Mione!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gasp of recognition from Ronni, and a burst or rapid nodding followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost triumphant, Debbie punched the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe connection broke through Ronni's funk, as she took a second look at the elf shaking her hand. A smile of recognition broadening across her face as she either guessed or saw who Debbie truly was. Her cheeks slightly red she gestured to her abundant chest and unhelpfully shrugged, setting the girls in motion once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe handshake was smothered, as the pair hugged each other tightly. Breaking apart, they sized each other up once again. Again, the biggest difference was Ronni's lavish bust. Each full titty, fully as large as her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think... Mistress 'Mione hates one of us...\" she joked, her long fingers flicking between the two of them. Almost stabbing herself in the bust as she did.</span></div></div>",

The pair exchanged a look, Debbie felt the compulsion fade. She turned to look over at Ronni, spotting that both sets of pillow case clothes were soaking wet, and almost transparent. But it was Ronni's whose clung to her flesh. The ripe red nipples just as startlingly big, outlined against the sopping material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress Hermione.\" Debbie said, as she apparated away to join her Mistress. Ronni vanishing at the same moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a curtsey to her Mistress, as she appeared. Hermione smiling at her return. But as Ronni appeared beside her, the smile dropped entirely. Only the corners of her mouth quirking upwards in a smirk, as she spotted Ronni, and her sopping wet pillowcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>Finite Incantatem.</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was focusing her wand entirely in Debbie's direction.

But not too different from making the Dursleys' breakfast, and his other chores from home. He looked between Hermione and Ron, waiting for his friends restoration.

Harry's messy hair exploded from his head, just as unkempt, but now resting on his shoulders. The other changes were just as rapid at coming. His hands jumping to his chest, as he felt the T-shirt vanish, or rather transfigure into a bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe painful constriction, and empty cups not a problem after a few seconds, as she lost and gained inches in all the right places. Her swelling bust pushing the numb hands backwards as they filled with soft breasts. Hermione blushed, as Harry looked awkwardly at her. Harry having to look up a few inches from her new height. She fought the compulsion to check that she was fully female, the last changes taking place beneath her trousers, the tailoring adjusting to accommodate wider hips, and a fuller rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a sign or Hermione's distress that she hadn't realised this was going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's mouth opened, but fell silent, as she recalled Hermione's anger with Ron. She didn't want that cold fury directed at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione's face flashed through a complex, confusing set of emotions. Anger, fear, confusion, humiliation... her cheeks taking a faint pink hue, as she hid her face lowering her gaze to the floor.

Without hearing more, he knew a trust was breached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tasted it straight away.\" she spoke faster, as if rushing to the conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He denied it at first, and the argument escalated, I.... I... I said too much.\" she finished on the verge of sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what he wanted to find out in the heat of the argument, it was probably something stupid like finding out what to get for my birthday, or an honest opinion...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry let her gather her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I blurted out my insecurities... and before ... and then... well... one petrification spell later. Ron is frozen and unable to resist as I pour the remains into his mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was... I was still angry... I pushed too much... too far...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain, the regret was clear in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked him about his perfect girl.... and he told me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fell silent for a very long time. Cautiously, Harry reached an arm around her shoulder and held her as she sobbed. Harry couldn't fully hide her smile, as she understood the bustiness of Ronni the house-elf. She sincerely hoped that Colin Creevey caught a picture of her for later teasing. But that was for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWarily, attempting a joke, Harry observed, \"You did know Ron wasn't complex. She'll probably appreciate the experience... well, in a week or two with a little perspective.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently, she shook Hermione's shoulder, \"Besides, the best revenge would be to tell the twins. Then Ronni will be remembered forever.\"</span></div></div>",

At the same time, she wasn't going to make an issue of it. With Ron's offence still too recent, and for Harry too vague. She wasn't about to talk about being female and what he... she liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair chatted for hours into the night, with Hermione leading the conversation, and sticking mostly to their studies. Harry was happy to listen, joining in as Hermione talked on and on. Clearly unwilling or unable to think about or talk about Ron. However, Harry was distracted by her new body, and found a competitive streak she didn't know she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Hermione's eyes were on a page, she'd sneak glances, comparing their build. She couldn't be sure, but Harry thought she was bustier... and perhaps firmer, too. Smoothing imaginary wrinkles from her skirt, she wasn't sure if she had more junk in her trunk than 'Mione. A worrying thought being whether that made her happy, jealous or insecure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut both girls were startled by the -<i>Whufff</i>- of displaced air, as two house-elves apparated into the dorm room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonni was downcast, her gaze low not meeting either girl's gaze. But the contrast was behind her, with a spindly hand resting on her shoulder was a beaming Dobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Harry... Mistress Hermione.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded to acknowledge them both. With a house elves indifference he was oblivious to Harry's new gender. But Ronni wasn't even with her eyes hidden, her cheeks burned red. The reason why clear to everyone in the room. In her outstretched arms she held a cushion, red velvet with golden braided tassels at the five corners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't the cushion that was humiliating Ronni, rather the clothes resting on top. The pair of red satin panties, and on top of them the matching bra. Harry's eyes boggled, the cups were enormous, making her feel both relieved, a sympathetic twinge from her shoulders reminding her of the reality of having breasts, and a genuine curiosity about who'd wear such a thing. A boyish need to know fuelling the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roberta Ravenclaw's underwear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words coming from Ronni's lips, in a sullen murmur, that sounded like Ron confronted with homework, but in a voice that couldn't have been more different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Busty Berta, the Ravenclaw's bimbo, both shame and hero.\" Hermione's pronouncement making Ronni quiver in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her tone lightened, as she continued, \"House elf, I grant you your freedom, I give you these clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonni stood there, unsure what to do... or if she needed to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get dressed.\" Hermione's snarl causing Harry's head to snap in her direction, the vitriol so alien for the normal quiet bookish girl. Ronni just flinched, cowered and obeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panties easily slid up her house elf legs, hanging loosely on her body, clearly not made for a house-elf's shape. Dobby watched eagerly, enjoying the sight of a fellow elf being freed. It was only as Ronni heaved her heavy bust into the waiting cups of the bra, that the changes started.</span></div></div>",

Momentarily, there was a look of lust on Dobby's face, the pride in Mistress Hermione freeing an elf briefly beaten into second place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she struggled in Busty Berta's borrowed bra. Her agile fingers securing it in place. Even as the Hermione's curse completed, Ronni tugged the pillowcase back into place, an attempt to provide some modesty if not dignity. Already it was becoming too short, as Ronni stretched upwards. The flappy ear shrinking inwards, soon disappearing in a dense forest of thickening hair. Her Weasley nature asserting itself, as a deep copper mane covered her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked askance at Harry, as if still hoping that she was becoming Ron. But for all the other changes humanising her, none were making her any more masculine. With her simple house elf clothes, the school's magic worked to provide her with something more basic than a school uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pillowcase... or rather it's tattered edge shifting and becoming denim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/f1c683047a5283fc3de9590566cc44b6/tumblr_p3irq2d6cj1w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/f1c683047a52...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer human hands rose to cup and cradle her bust.

A pulse of warmth spreading out from her chest, filling her with dread. It battled with the ice in the pit of her stomach. Knowing what was coming she looked over to Harry for some help, some sympathy. But none came as Ronni's chest swelled even larger. Her nips making deeper impacts in her top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just think of it as a blessing.\" The words spat with an anger, as she quoted Ron's earlier words back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if feeling the need to explain, her expression softened, as she turned to Harry. \"Those are the .... <i>titties </i>... she wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain the 'titties' was clearly Ron's poor choice of words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wanted for me...\" Her eyes darting to the restored witch, \"Well, now they're my present to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/59313b58502157e55f2383c7bf3d4371/tumblr_p3irq2d6cj1w2lwkto2_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/59313b585021...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're no longer Ginny's big brother, more a bigger sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon's hands came up, the need to hide her bust as deep as it was useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry tried not to stare, not to ogle those immense eye-catching breasts.

It was a cry that sent shivers down Harry's spine as he was instantly reminded to the house elf Winky who he had seen being freed in his fourth year and every time he saw her she would be crying and shrieking.  Not all house elves were like Dobby, most were absolutely devastated when they were freed, and it seemed like Ronni fit into that category.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter witnessing that uncomfortable scene Harry asked, \"Well, was that it?  What's the next part of your plan?\"  Harry looked to Hermione and was surprised to see that Hermione looked uncertain.  Hermione spoke more to herself than to Harry and said, \"But that wasn't supposed to happen.  That curse was supposed to break and Ron was supposed to transform into...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may say Miss Harry Potter's lady friend!\"  Both Harry and Hermione jumped at Dobby's interjection, they had both forgotten he was still in the girl's dormitory with them.  Dobby continued, \"House elf magic is very powerful and ancient and tends to override a lot of the magic of witches and wizards.  And freeing a house elf is one of the most powerful and ancient magics of them all.\"  Then upon seeing Harry and Hermione's worried looks added, \"But do not worry Miss and Miss, I's is a free elf so I know how hard it is for Ronni right now.  So Dobby will help!  Dobby will find miss Ronni.  Dobby can care for miss Ronni.  Dobby can provide for miss Ronni.\"  And then with a big gulp and the biggest smile Harry had ever seen on the house elf he said, \"Dobby...Dobby thinks he LOVES miss Ronni.\"  And then with a giggle as though he'd said something naughty he shouldn't have said, disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think I know that Harry!\" Hermione stood up and began to pace, \"That stupid Ron, I was just trying to teach him a lesson that he needed to learn and now look where he's ended up.  As a homeless house elf with panties that don't even fit her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry thought about bringing up how this was just as much, if not more Hermione's thought, but thought better of it as angry sparks started to shoot from Hermione's wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got to think of something soon before Mrs. Weasly finds out.\"  The color drained from both girl's faces at the thought of this.  So Hermione did what she always did when faced with certain doom.  \"I'm going to the library.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she was off.  Harry stood to follow her but soon found the room spinning.  It wasn't until just then that Harry realized how tired he was, after all, he had spent the entire day as a house elf working non stop and now that he was human again, that work was taking it's toll on his still female body.  \"Oh yeah, I actually almost forgot,\"  Harry looked around the girls' dormitory for a second to make sure he was alone and fondled his chest.  \"It's been a weird day,\"  Harry considered going back to his bed but decided a strange girl sleeping in Harry Potter's bed would not help out all the gossip about him.  \"I'm sure Hermione won't mind me staying over for the night, we're both girls after all.\"  Harry said with a chuckle as he bundled up on Hermione's bed and wondered what tomorrow would bring.</span></div></div>",

The two were a tangle of limbs sharing the one bed. With a good night's sleep, her anger at the boys had faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories of the previous night flooded back, and a quick glance beneath the sheets confirmed that she had undressed for bed. Harry already snoring had lulled her into a false sense of security. The fully clad newest Gryffindor girl was still to familiar for her to feel naked in front of her. It was too easy to imagine that innocent sleeping face transforming into a leering visage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing carefully to slip from her still sleeping companion Hermione eased herself from bed. The chill of the castle dorm making her skin prickle in objection. Tiptoeing to her trunk, avoiding the creaking floorboards, she slowly opened it. Her gaze more focus on the sleeping girl in her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her attention back to the trunk, she gasped in horror. Her hand covering her mouth, as a soft moan came from the bed, and sound of sleepy protest, as Harry turned over in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll her regular clothes, her underwear, her uniforms had vanished..... Worse was what had replaced them. All the underwear was slinky, a mix of satins and silks, stockings, tights, basques, corset, and somethings that made her shudder to imagine wearing. Plucking up a skirt, it was little more than a belt with a few inches of cloth as decoration. Holding it in place, against her waist, it was truly as short as it looked. Spreading her fingers to estimate the size, she guessed it was only about six inches of pleated material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point, she spotted the scrap of parchment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><i>A present for the Present giver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nX X X<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonni</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lurid green ink, only too familiar, and the hand writing confirming it.

Hermione had bitten the bullet and dressed for breakfast. However, her version of the school uniform was rather more risque. Her skirt several inches shorter, her jumper and blouse just too tight, clinging to her curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry noticed that she was bustier, and curvier than her friend, but at the same time looked less so, against Hermione's more revealing clothes. Hell, even her shoes had a higher heel. As he closed the Trunk, Harry failed to notice his name etched into the wood. 'Harriet Jane Potter', with a shared tight nod of their heads, the pair headed down to breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls wanting their skirts to be longer, and their identities to be less well-known through out the school. There was a pensive look on Hermione's face as they left the dorm. Both girls walked through the common room, with a spring in their step not wanting to draw the experience out for longer than necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, they managed it without any bother, without any more than a few customary hellos, and friendly nods or smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting from the Fat Lady's portrait, Harry thought Hermione looked more concerned. Keeping her own head low, she avoided all eye-contact. However, it was quickly clear that they weren't going a direct route to the Grand Hall, and breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a whispered hiss to Hermione, she asked what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could be wrong... I don't want to say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard for her to pick the right pace, as she felt the girls jostling if she went up and down stairs too quickly. Worse, she knew others were also noticing the movement, the boys eyes snapping to her blouse before she passed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bust once again proving troublesome, as Hermione stopped without warning. Harry crashed into her friend. Her bust swallowing Hermione's arm, in the deep cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nod of Hermione's head, directed Harry's attention to the Trophy cabinet. The various shields standing proudly on the glass shelves, polished to a mirror shine. Her expression was tight lipped as she got Harry to read the names on one shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Harriet Jane Potter: Seeker'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's mouth dropped open in disbelief. \"The magic hasn't just made you fit to visit the girls' dorm. I think it's altered you history....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words trailed off, as Harry's mouth gaped. Opening and closing, silently, like a confused goldfish, unable to say any coherent thought, or phrase any question.</span></div></div>",

He was revered around the tiny circle of friends that saw his trophy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe powder blue panties, were clearly genuine, hand stitched, with the Beauxbatons crest. Harry was tired of being dismissed, and belittled for the Tri-Wizard Tournament. True, he didn't have their education. But, surely his experience counted. He'd faced Voldemort, himself... Well, with Quirrell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd fought the memory of Tom Riddle, and destroyed him, too. Not to forget all those dementors, and yet, he was still a leetle boy, in Fleur's eyes, dismissed as juvenile and competing only by some treacherous cheating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurying his rising anger, he showed the panties around the close knit circle. No witches were present, and he didn't know how he'd explain it to Hermione, if she ever found out. He intended it as a private trophy, a secret he could keep for himself. Perhaps wear them, for one of the trials.</span></div></div>",

Her words loud enough, for anyone listening who wasn't considering applying themselves to their studies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Professor.\" Harry answered promptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe patted a book resting on the stand beside his chair. Moving his hands to clasp them in his lap, he felt something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA motion, the damned panties moved as if they were alive. Pressing his arm down he leaned heavily, but unobtrusively against his thigh. It wasn't about to break free, and become visible. They slithered with a satin hiss, diving deeper into his pocket. The panties slid back and forth against the seam of his pocket, the friction making them warm, as they moved. Harry jumped slightly, as the first stitch snapped. He was able to hide the motion, as the panties were particularly brief, soft and satin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, their escape was foiled, he could feel them as they worried the hole bigger, the stitching unravelling, as the panties worked the hole larger and larger. He started slightly, as he felt their chill satin touch brush against his thigh. The damned things had escaped. Their progress visible only to him as a wrinkle, a wandering crease in the crotch of his trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor McGonagall was unaware of the underwear and it's battle with the Chosen one. She was making her way up the staircase to the girls' dorm rooms. The smile on her face, suggesting, at least to Harry, that it was probably Quidditch related. Harry mused about whether she wanted a word with Angelina, or perhaps Ginny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, hit attention was needed more immediately, as he felt them slip free entirely from his pocket.</span></div></div>",

Getting up Harry looked around for a mirror to have a proper look at himself.

The name had faded too much to be read, but it had her attention. She curled up in front of the fire, a blanket across her lap, and Crookshanks on top of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her cat started to cutely snore, she knew she was in for the long haul. She was not the sort of monster who would disturb a sleeping cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione found it to be intriguing. It reminded her of Harry's potion book, and felt like it was written by someone with a real insight into transformations and transfigurations. She wondered how it ended up here. It was hard not to be dismissive, as she looked around the ramshackle, but homely house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReminding herself, it was rude to make such judgements, and that she was a guest. She dismissed the uncertainty, as just a thing that an old wizarding family picked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found a whole range of spells, including a whole... well, ceremony... rite?.... to help a wizard or witch to become an animagus. It came with a worryingly long list of warnings, but she filed it away mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn page 56, she found a gender reversal spell. She read it twice to be sure, as polyjuice, and other such potions were generally considered the simplest way to perform a transfiguration. The risks of miscasting a spell, could lead to rather horrific results, and formed the basis of some legendary creatures, according to her History Professor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly she thought of Professor Snape. He had been incredibly proud of his prowess with potions. Understandably so, and when she discovered he was the half-blood prince, he went up in her estimation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile crossed Hermione's face, as she realised that the twins had obviously never spotted this... this treasure trove of spells.</span></div></div>",

The memory made her smile, he had a such a soft side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, in the confusion Ron got the wrong end of a dull conversation.

The prankster sense was strong in the Weasley DNA apparently. Hermione's sense of guilt at the thought of the Weasleys' being crammed into their own garage trying to replicate her magical artefact, well, it evaporated. The girls were also sure that Molly appreciated having them out from under her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys.\" Ginny snorted with amusement, but without malice as she lowered her cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they can be entertaining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione took the opportunity to probe Ginny about Poly-juice, and her own problem with Millicent Bullstrode's cat.

But coming from two muggle parents, she was interested in knowing if those raised by a witch and a wizard were more .... <i>experimental</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning closer, so as not to be overheard, Hermione listened intently for Ginny's answer. The pause in the conversation felt like enough of an answer to her, but she was eager for more details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head darting to every door and window, Ginny checked she wasn't being observed or overheard, before she too leaned towards Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, at one dinner there was an awkward conversation at the table.

She swallowed her frustration with another mouthful of tea, but she had a lot to consider. It certainly sounded like that old spell book was genuine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first thoughts, had been to take away one of the divisions between them. As a swat, she wondered if Harry and Ron would find it easier if she were a Herman, rather than a Hermione.

Alas, that meant that he was thinking about his life and how average, and insignificant it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was just another Weasley, not as studious as Bill, he was destined never to be a prefect. Just like Percy. He knew that for a fact, even without magic. He lacked Charlie's passion for magical creatures, a fire even Hagrid had noticed. Grinding his teeth, too at the fact that Charlie had also played Quidditch for Gryffindor. Just like the twins, just like him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell, the twins, even though she might curse them loudly and frequently. Ron was sure that they were Molly's favourite. They had an easy charm, a laid-back manner and luck that meant that things just happened for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had given them the money, but it was the twins who ran the business. Frankly that surprised the hell out of everyone else in the family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Ginny, little Ginerva, well, she would be the first Weasley daughter to come to Hogwarts. He scuffed his feet as he walked along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn afterthought, that was it. He was an afterthought, a hanger-on. Even with his friends, even Hermione and Harry, they liked him, he supposed, but he was just sort of there. Never the one with the breakthrough, never the one to lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOH God!

He sent a loose stone skidding across the passage in anger at the realisation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can help...\" a voice hissed on the breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Ron drew his wand. It was almost certainly Draco, had he been muttering, talking aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can help...\" the voice repeated, spectral and sibilant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show yourself.\" Ron answered as bravely as he could.

The room was unlit, with only a beam of light catching the dust from a small window, and the shape of the glass on the floor. He could almost make out shapes in the room, perhaps statues covered in cloth, or mirrors, but they looked fairly immobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can make you unique.\" the voice promised. Even now, he couldn't pin down the direction. It was clearer, and inside the room, but beyond that he simply couldn't tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not scared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he entered the door, the door wrenched itself from his grip, and slammed shut with a resounding oaken boom, shutting out the light from the corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lumos</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wand bloomed into life, lighting up the whole room.</span></div></div>",

Merlin's beard it's only the most important night of the school year!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, final exams are much more important, they directly impact what you can do in the...\"  Hermione said immediately upon hearing the idea that anything was more important than schoolwork.  Lavender however just dismissed Hermione with a hand wave, \"Well this more important than school!  Not only is it the night that impacted your social standing in the school.  But what's more who you go with is like a public declaration of love!  It could determine what boy you marry and have kids with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What boy I'll marry?!\"  If Ronni still had testicles they would have shrunk and gone internal at the though of going out with a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\"  Lavender said with a knowing nod.  But Hermione just shook her head and decided it wasn't worth arguing with Lavender as she waved her wand and turned out the lights.  Ronni lay in the dark with thoughts of what had happened today to him to make him a her.  Every little uncomfortable shift in the bed made Ronni very aware of how soft and foreign his body was from every jiggle in her chest to every ripple in his ass, Ronni couldn't escape her current reality even in her dreams.  Ron was running through a forest of cloaks and cauldrons that kept trying to close in on him until they all collapsed on him.  He managed to push them all off, but his body was Ronni's again and there was a mysterious stranger standing over her.  Ronni didn't know anything about him but that he felt deep down this man was handsome, Ronni tried to approach the mystery man to see who it was when a flood of red hair made it's way into her mouth choking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonni coughed and spit until all the red hair was out of her mouth, it took a moment for her to realize she was still in the girls dormitory and yesterday was not a dream, Ron was in fact a girl named Ronni.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay over there Ronni?\"  Ronni heard Lavender say from her bed.  Ronni looked up and saw that Lavender and Hermione were already dressed to go down for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, because you need to get dressed and grab some breakfast quick.  We need to get ready for the Yule ball tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that won't be for like 8 hours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we need to make sure we do everything we can to look our best, and some potions that will help take that long to brew.\"  And Ronni was surprised to hear Hermione say that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I won't go.\"  Ronni said, he figured his time would be better spent trying to figure out what had happened to her, she might even go to the library of her own volition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be daft Ronni,\"  Lavender said and then with a smile she added, \"Besides, Ginny told me someone is waiting for you outside the portrait hole waiting to ask a certain someone a very special question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great...\"  Ronni said as she finally got out of bed.  She looked under the bed and grabbed a the freshest looking pair of underwear and began to put it on.  Ronni was a bit surprised at the size of bra he needed to wear.  He'd never seen one that big in person!  Than again he'd only ever seen his mom and sister's at the burrow when his mom made him help her with laundry, but it was still impressive.  With some odd looks from her fellow Gryffindor girls, Ronni managed to get the bra on during her second attempt and put on the rest of the girl's uniform.  The three girls went down the staircase and at the portrait hole stood Ginny talking to someone outside.  Ginny turned back and smiled.  \"And here she is,\"  Ginny walked back and started walking ahead with Hermione and Lavender.  \"We'll leave you two alone,\"  She said before adding in a whisper to her new sister, \"Don't blow it.  You've got him on the line.\"  Ronni gulped and nervously stepped out to see who her prospective suitor was.</span></div></div>",

She was already dressed in her least flattering, least feminine clothes, a red Gryffindor hoodie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel his presence, as she was leaving the portrait hole. Flipping her hood up, she licked her parched lips and gathered her racing thoughts.

He was eager to break the hug. Ronni taking control of herself, patted his back too. A silent agreement to break the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of... c-c-course I remember you...\" Harry's voice a nervous stutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwkwardly, Ronni realised she'd excited Harry. A look of distaste flashing across her face, as she felt Harry's stiffening response to her hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping her face of all emotions, she broke apart. Relief was clear on Harry's face, as they broke apart. Unable to meet his eyes, Ronni looked intently past his shoulder. Unwilling... unable to lower her gaze, to risk seeing .... 'the bulge'. It was Harry who first broke the silence.</span></div></div>",

In the distance Ronni could see the tall and thin silhouetted figure with an unmistakable curved nose wearing thick fur robes.  \"Krum.\"  Ronni whispered breathlessly.  Viktor heard his name called and his sallow skin seemed to brighten a bit upon seeing the curvy red head enter the hall.  \"Ah, Roon-ee.  It is very good to see you.\"  Viktor said with his thick Bulgarian accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the world are you doing here?  Here, outside my common room.  Viktor bleeding Krum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here to talk to you Roon-ee.\"  And Krum took a few steps towards Ronni with his oddly duck footed walk.  It was hard for Ron to imagine Krum walking all the way up to Gryffindor common room, Ron began to picture Krum dramatically flying through the halls, darting around corners, dodging Peeves before landing flawlessly before the fat lady's portrait guarding the common room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\"  Ronni said with a little bit of a disbelieving squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"  And Krum stood still as though he needed a minute to find his words, and then a little quickly he said, \"Will you go to Yule Ball with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?  Go to the ball with you?  But I'm a bo...I'm just not someone who...would normally be asked out.  Why would you ask me?\"  Ron stopped himself before blurting out he was really a guy, <i>Not that Krum would believe me anyways</i> Ronni thought as he mindlessly played with his skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ask you because you are very pretty.\"  Viktor said bluntly and then feeling he was too blunt added, \"And I've also seen you fly with Potter.  You fly very vell, very beautifully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well thank you.\"  Ronni said as he thought about how even in this weird reality where he was Ronni instead of Ron he was at least still pals with Harry and still loved to fly.  At least some things were the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vell,\"  Viktor said expectantly, \"Will you go to the ball with me Roon-ee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, go spend time with you?  With dancing?  I...sure.\"  Ronni said weakly, his desire to not go out with a guy was completely overwhelmed by the chance to hang out with Krum.  And what's more in just a few words, Krum made Ronni feel more appreciated then most people he's ever known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am very happy to hear this, I look forward to seeing you tonight.\"  Krum nodded curtly and then turned to walk away.  Ronni walked away too down to the great hall as though she was in a daydream.  Had that just happened?  Before she could rationalize anything Ginny had practically dragged Ronni to Hermione and Lavender.  \"So...did he ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you say yes?\"  Hermione questioned and Lavender scoffed at that, \"Of course she said yes, give us the details!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonni retold the tale of what just happened, she was in so much shock over the whole thing she didn't even fill her plate with the usual mountain of toast and bacon she'd had just about every morning.  When Ronni got to the part where she accepted Lavender screamed loud enough to draw looks from the other house tables, \"I knew it!  I knew you had it in you to get a 10 like Krum!  Oh this is great!  But you can't just go into tonight like usual, I'll give you the best advice, I'll help you get made up.  Ohh, I'll even give you a reading your tea leaves to see what you're and Krum's future holds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't talk nonsense Lavender, divination is a joke.  Ronni, I'd recommend using some potions to make sure you are at your best tonight.  Something for the nerves and a few other little potions would work marvels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you could just be yourself and unleash the good old fashion Weasley charm.\"  Ginny said roller her eyes at the other girls suggestions.  \"How do you want to get ready for the ball sis?\"  Ginny asked her brother turned sister.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After several fruitless hours of wandering the halls in search of a room that seemed to have magically disappeared Ronni hung her head and made her way back to the Gryffindor dormitory.  In the common room there were dozens of people waiting excitedly for the Yule Ball to begin, all talking about what songs the Weird Sisters would play, what food would be prepared, and most importantly who was going with who.  Before he could get to the girls staircase Ronni definitely heard her name mentioned under a few peoples breathes.  Ronni didn't want to deal with it and headed up the staircase where Lavender and Parvati were putting on more makeup than Ron had ever seen in his life and Hermione and Ginny were hanged out by Ronni's bed.  When Ronni entered the dorm all eyes turned to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where were you!  The champions and their dates have to be down in the Great Hall in less than an hour!\"  Lavender said nearly hysterically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonni just shrugged, \"It won't take that long to put on my dress robes.\"  Lavender and Parvati seemed to have been stunned into silence as Ginny approached and said, \"I know you don't like it, and you're naturally hot no matter what you do, you're still wearing some makeup.  You are my sister after all and don't you want the Weasly girls to be the belles of the ball?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonni mumbled something cross under his breath but Ginny ignored it, \"Come on Ronni, strip down and lets get you ready.\"  Ronni reluctantly began stripping off his clothes.  It had almost been 24 hours but Ron still wasn't used to seeing the massive lumps of flesh on his chest.  Looking down at them he wouldn't be surprised if he had the biggest breasts not only in his year but the whole school.  Reluctantly Ronni looked for his dress robes and found them oddly in the exact same place she'd left them when she was a he.  Draped over Pig's cage.  And what's more they were the exact same dress robes as before with ruffles and lace all over them that looked like they were from a previous century.  <i>\"No matter how my reality changes I'm always going to be poor.\"</i>  Ronni thought sadly looking at the robes that actually looked like they'd fit Ronni better than Ron.  As she held up the dress robes Ronni heard Lavender gasp.  \"Oh no, <i>THOSE</i> are your dress robes!  What were you doing going out for a walk!  We could have had time to fix this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back off Lavender.\"  Hermione said warningly wanting to protect Ronni's feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my sister just going to look even better when she makes even this thing look good.\"  Ginny added.  Ronni wasn't sure about that, but decided there was no use putting it off anymore and removed her skirt to show off her thighs before covering himself up with the ancient robes.  Ronni looked at herself in a mirror and thought, <i>\"Well, one plus side of being a girl is I don't have to wear these stupid things as a guy.\"</i>  And indeed these dress robes really put the emphasis on the dress with intricate lace patterns lining the bottom of the robes in a way that made them unmistakable look like a dress.  Ronni couldn't critique himself any more before Ginny joined her sister's side in the mirror and said, \"Come on sis, we've got to go.  Champion's dates have to go down to the great hall in just a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, your coming too?\"  Ronni asked and Ginny rolled her eyes, \"Of course, while you were making goo goo eyes at Krum I was using the Weasly girl charm on Mr. Harry Potter, and I think now that I can string two words together around him I think he likes me.\"  And Ginny smiled as she added, \"And it does hurt that I'm almost as developed as my big sis.\"  Ginny playfully cupped her own breasts for a second before playfully cupping Ronni's boobs to compare.  Ronni blushed and for the first time he took a good look at his sister and realized she was starting to become a woman.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sisters walked to the great hall Ronni thought about his sister and Harry.  <i>\"It'd be nice if those two hit it off well, hell Harry's practically a brother to me...doesn't mean I won't kick his arse if he hurts her though.  Although if Harry's attracted to a girl like Ginny surely he's not also attracted to...\"</i>  But before Ronni could finish her thought she and Ginny were greeted by Harry and Viktor.  Harry a little awkwardly said hi to both Weasly girls and Viktor took a deep bow and took up Ronni's hand and kissed it.  \"You look lovely Roon-ee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no I look like a...nothing.  I look so dumb with these stupid robes.\"  Ronni rambled on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, the robes do not matter to me, I like what is, how you say, under them.\"  Viktor said in such a stoic manner Ronni wasn't sure if that was a perverted come on, a genuine complement, or some translation error.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny giggled at Ronni's silence, \"Well you two can talk all about what's under Ronni's robes later, we have a ball to go to.\"</span></div></div>",

Ronni looked at the company she was keeping.  Cedric Diggory and Cho Chang were smiling and having a casual chat like they were old friends.  Harry and Ginny were chatting away as well, it looked like Ginny was trying to make Harry laugh and loosen him up and it seemed to be working.  And Fleur Delacour was with the Ravenclaw quiddtch captain Rodger Davies and...he kept glancing at Ronni.  Fleur glared at Ronni as with a flick of her veela like hair she drew Rodger back to her, but she had to do this a couple of times.  <i>'Wait a second, is Fleur...jealous of me?'</i>  Ronni thought as the door opened and the very stoic Viktor Krum offered his arm.  \"Shall ve go Roon-ee?\"   Ronni gulped and said the only thing that could come out, \"Sure.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe champions took to the dance floor as the Weird Sisters played some slow and romantic sounding song in the background.  Ronni felt the eyes of the world on her.  Ronni felt his face turn redder than his hair.  For a brief second he thought of running away and hiding away in the chamber of secrets where nobody could look at him again.  \"It is all right, I am with you Roon-ee.\"  Victor whispered in Ronni's ear in a very sweet way that came through the accent.  Ronni looked up at Krum, and just like that the world went away.  Krum was looking at her as though she was the most important thing in the world, even more important that the snitch.  And for the first time since he'd been turned into a girl and his world was turned upside down, Ronni felt ok.  Ronni let herself rest against Krum's warm chest and let him lead the slow dance.  Before everyone knew it, the song had ended.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA more upbeat song began to play and the dance floor began to swarm.  The feeling of hundreds of eyes on him returned and Ronni looked round nervously.  Viktor seeing this carved a path towards some bushes.  With all the chaos and dancing and teenage hormones going on they actually didn't notice them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\"  Ronni said taking a breath for what felt like the first time since the Yule Ball began.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is no problem Roon-ee.  I just vish I could do more for you.  You are so beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, thanks.  Viktor.  You don't look too bad yourself.\"  Ronni said wanting to return the compliment.  And before Ronni knew it, Krum was leaning closer and his hand was moving up her leg.</span></div></div>",

The suspicion that Ginny wasn't a person to annoy was still strong as strong with Ronni, as it had been with Ron. He didn't want to piss of his sister, in this reality or any other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least they won't accuse me of smuggling bludgers.\" Lavender said in a faux-whisper loud enough for everyone to hear. A pointed glance towards Ronni's large chest underlining her barb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Ronni's turn to blush crimson, as she worked out her sister's meaning. Tugging the sheets up, as high as she could, and sinking as low into the bed as possible. At the same time, she wanted to throw her shoulders back, and make as proud a display of her body... her bust as she could. Why should she be embarrassed by her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLavender's comment triggered a memory. Every time, she had to block one of the goals with her body, the pain of the impact, and the reaction from the crowd was mortifying. It had felt like a tactic, a clever Ravenclaw tactic, to make her more nervous. Fewer attempts at goal for her to punch, or kick clear, and more body blows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... something a little more binding this time.\" Hermione suggested softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um hmm,\" Lavender agreed, \"You had Lee Jordan stuttering whenever you saved a goal against Ravenclaw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, a spell as well as a couple of sports bras.\" Hermione added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonni sank even lower in her bed. Just the top of her head popping out from the sheets. She could tell from the look on her face, Hermione already had a spell in mind. An eagerness to try and experiment with it glittering behind her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'll be fine to play.\" Ronni answered, a hint of impatience in her voice, \"But, I will need a good nights sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLavender and Hermione exchanged a look, at Ronni's snappishness. But, let it end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Nox</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights extinguished, darkness claimed the room, and in minutes only the sound of slow steady breathing came from the girls.</span></div></div>",

Her feet stumbling on the uneven stones of the floor. The girls help her keep her feet.</span></div></div>",

Occasionally he would add a little extra dried skin of boomslang or knotgrass, and then gesture over the mixture with the elder wand, muttering incantations beneath his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside a glass vial beside the cauldron was the final ingredient - a lock of light brown hair, freshly clipped from the head of The-Transfigured-Being-To-Be. He took it now in his wizened hands and tipped it into the potion. The thick, grey gloop cleared, becoming a thin, dark purple-pink liquid. Taking a small cup, he gathered a sample (enough for a transformation of roughly an hour; hopefully long enough for his purposes) and drank it. He was relieved to find that it didn't taste of earwax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat back into the headmaster's chair and patiently waited for the changes to complete. Beneath his robes, his flesh bubbled and rippled unpleasantly like molten wax. Old bones cracked. Young, strong muscle grew within him; and tough-as-leather joints becoming supple once again. Colour flushed into his silvery hair until he was a brunette. Touching a hand to his face, he felt the wrinkles of age and the furrows and lines of an oft-stressful life vanish. His beard accumulated as a pile of hair in his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes subsided. For a moment, the aged Professor stared around his office in bleary-eyed confusion before giving a cry of 'Ah!' and removing his half-moon spectacles. For the first time in many decades, his vison was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs was his body. Stiffly, he rose from his chair, uncomfortably aware of the way the heavy, coarse robes moved against his naked breasts.</span></div></div>",

Although he -she giggled- she didn't agree with all their rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Beauxbatons she knew that feminine grace and decorum were rigorously enforced by magic. She was also worried as she found a rather feeble wand tucked in the sleeve of her uniform jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran her hands down the side of the uniform. Feeling the narrow waist and the swell of her hips. She didn't feel ready to examine her chest yet. Even now, it seemed to loom large in her view. She was certain that that was one of the Elder Wands' last tricks on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt hair waft around her head, and with a frustrated gesture tried to flick it aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like a wave of blonde tresses crashed across her face.

Even doing that gave her a hint as she felt her chest shift alarmingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl in the reflection was an absolute beauty. Her curly blonde hair framed an elegant face, with a petite nose, and full lips her wide eyes completed it. The face was a mask of innocence, it seemed to suggest that the girl in the glass was incapable of retaining the least of thoughts, let alone a spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe allowed her gaze to dip down. It was then that she confirmed that the Elder wand truly had a twisted sense of humour. Her curves stretched the uniform to it's limit. She wasn't a seasoned judge of these things, but she guessed that she had an E-cup or something similar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>You girl! </b>Don't spend all day entranced by your reflection.\" The voice snapped behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDumbledore snapped around like an obedient pupil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name, girl?\" the professor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dora.\" she answered against her will.

To say any other name, but 'Dora' was all that would come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me Professor.... or Professor O'Donnell.\" the teacher glowered at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Dora, Professor O'Donnell.\" she even added in a little curtsy as she answered.</span></div></div>",

Before Harry or Dru could explain, they and Hermione watched as Ron transformed. The effect was much smoother and less disturbing than what followed taking Polyjuice Potion, and yet it was still quite creepy to see all the muscle and masculinity Ron had drain away from him, his chest expanding out into a pair of fair-sized breasts, his red hair growing longer and magically being pulled into a ponytail, and his clothes changing to better fit his new body. When all was said and done, the girl sitting near Harry had kept Ron's freckles and hair color, but otherwise looked cute, naive, and a little chubby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked uncomfortable with everyone staring at her. \"What're y'all lookin' at?\" she asked, her voice coming with an American Southern drawl. She heard it as well, and looked torn between being shocked and not finding it odd at all. \"Am I goin' nuts? Just a minute ago I sure plum was Ron Weasley, but now I sure as heck ain't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDru, of all people, looked very compassionately at the girl and asked her, \"So then, like, who do you feel like? What're your new memories telling you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Rachel Weasley, an American witch who was adopted by the Weasley's after my Ma and Pa died and it didn' look like they could have no girls of their own, though my firecracker little sis proved that wrong.

Rachel, you and I will head to Gryffindor Tower to see how far these changes went. Hermione, you take Dru to see Dumbledore and tell him what's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in their House Common Room, Rachel and Harry quickly realized that no one batted an eye at the \"new\" student. They didn't push their luck by asking around, and when they went up to Harry's bed, they found no bed where Ron's had been. \"Guess muh stuff must be over in the girls dorm, I s'pose,\" she said. Then, before Harry knew what was happening, she turned to him and started kissing him. Harry's first reaction was to lean into the kiss, but he regained his senses and pushed her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ron, what are you doing, mate?\" Harry asked, his face red with embarrassment and excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl gave Harry a sad smile. \"That's just the thing, Harry: I ain't Ron no more. Sure, I 'member being him, and I ain't opposed to turning back if I can, but right now I'm Rachel, and Rachel wants to y'all's pretty, British face 'till we stop feelin' like it no more.\" For the life of him, Harry couldn't think of a counter-argument, even though he was sort of dating Dru already, and so the two feel onto his bed, Rachel unaware of just what has transpired there hours before.</span></div></div>",

Time fell away. She could have worked his cock for minutes or hours, Harry couldn't tell, he was lost in the sensation. Looking the beautiful redhead in the face, he suddenly couldn't take it anymore. Harry grabbed her by the hair and pushed her down, forcing her to take his cock in its entirety, then began thrusting into her. \"Take my cock, Rachel.

He didn't recognize either girl. The blonde one in his House's uniform would be seen as quite shapely and attractive to inexperienced students, but to him she just looked like someone ready to fail all her classes. The other, a Gryffindor, was purposely wearing her uniform incorrectly to show off her ebony curves, and her sultry make-up invited things that should have been against the rules. Before either could say a word, he snatched the box of chocolates out of the bimbo's hands and opened the lid, looking at the sweets within. \"Trying to bribe a teacher?\" Snape said with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDru tried to say something, but Hershey cut her off. \"For fuck's sake, man, what's the matter with you? Yo, these chocolates are straight up-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going to get you detention? Yes, yes they are,\" Snape stated. Looking at the confections, Snape felt is annoyance fall away for a moment. Even if they were going to be punished, these chocolates did look quite good. Quickly picking out one that looked especially delicious, Snape popped it in his mouth and chewed, happy to find it was filled with a Scottish whiskey, his favorite. As he ate the chocolate, the two girls in front of him looked on in despair. Their eyes soon began focusing on his chest, and he looked down to see his body shifting and changing. His hips widened outwards, his legs became shapely, his ass ballooned out into something to draw men's eyes, and his chest grew large breasts. His entire body lost any trace of masculinity, from his groomed facial hair to his sharp features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all was said and done, standing in the doorway was an older woman with a shapely, somewhat plump figure and a face that looked both severe and motherly. \"Well, girls, I do wish you'd interrupted me sooner,\" Shirley Snape said. \"Why don't you explain the entire situation to me, won't you?\"</span></div></div>",

All three of them had been changed, transfigured, and despite her many years of potions knowledge Snape had no clue on how to return them to normal. Whatever curse these chocolates contained was far stronger and more mysterious than any she'd known. Not only that, but from the way they explained things, each and every girl to result from the transformation had an obsession with Potter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Potter...</i> Snape thought to herself. When his first year started, she vividly remembered her expectations: that he'd be as rude and arrogant as his father. Instead, the young boy proved to be as compassionate and hard-working as Snape's childhood best friend Lily, and she had done her best to care for the boy, in her own way. But as he grew into a man... <i>What a man he had become.</i> Snape knew all of these memories were new, were false, but they felt perhaps more real than the truth. Shirley Snape had discovered long before an affection for blossoming boys, for young men just learning about carnal pleasures, who needed a guiding hand, but while she'd yet to help Potter in this way, she wanted more with him. Not just sex, but a full relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, girls, follow me to the Headmaster's Office. We'll need to speak with Dumbledore.\" The two transfigured girls followed Snape obediently, causing her to realize just how much more effective a teacher she was now. Perhaps her previous attitude towards teaching had been a bit...awful? Still, the thought of seeing Dumbledore made her scared. With Draco now Dru, clearly unwilling to serve the Dark Lord and carry out her task, that plot was already ended. Yet Severus Snape had made an Unbreakable Vow to end the headmaster if Draco couldn't. Did the fact that neither Severus nor Draco technically existed anymore allow for a loophole?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finally reached Dumbledore's Office entrance, they found Rachel Weasley and Harry Potter waiting for them. Their clothes were both a little out of place, as if they'd been put back on in a hurry. Rachel quirked an eyebrow at the approaching group. \"Y'all are just gettin' here? What in tarnation happened? And who's that lady with ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore either student could reply, Snape took control of the situation. \"They decided, quite rightly, that a teacher's perspective could be useful. They tried to explain to me what was going on, but the chocolate's curse intervened beforehand. You used to know me as Severus Snape, but I'd now prefer Professor Shirley Snape. Now then! The Headmaster doesn't need to see all of you, now does he? I'll fill him in on the situation, and meanwhile Rachel and Dru should investigate their living quarters more closely. I'm aware of how the curse plays with memories and reality, but you both need to make sure you actually have everything you need to continue life as the fairer sex. Granger and Potter, meanwhile, can return to their common room until they're summoned further.\"</span></div></div>",

She was still Hermione, he k ew that, but the way she looked, the way she acted...she was so different!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHershey decided to break the silence first. \"So, what's up with you and Rachel? Or you and the bimbo, for that matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question didn't make Harry's nerves any more stable. He sat down on a comfortable couch and replied, \"Well, uh, I still need to discuss it with Dru, but I was considering giving polyamory a try. I like both of them a lot, and if it's possible to be with them both, I want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poly, huh?\" Hershey asked, sitting down next to Harry very casually, extending her body across the couch in a confident fashion. \"Is there room for one more?\" she asked, her black eyebrow quirked upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question only made Harry more nervous. \"I didn't realize you liked me that way, Hermione.\" He couldn't keep his eyes off the cleavage her top teased, or her large, pouty lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her eyes. \"Listen mate, until this curse business is over and done with, I ain't Hermione. I'm still the smartest bitch in the school, and I got the same ambitions and shit, but I'm also the school bicycle. I got no fucking clue why I used to be so stingy with sex, Harry. It's amazing. It's natural. It's just fucking fun. But I want more than that with you. I didn't before the chocolates, but that shit has changed, man. Are you down to be with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry probably would have agreed no matter the situation, but with his cock tenting his trousers and his brain thinking via sex, he nodded immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could even ask, Hershey reached over, groping his cock, then freeing it with a single <i>zip</i>. Hershey went from clothed to naked in seconds, and before Harry knew what was happening she was riding his cock reverse cowgirl style, giving him access to her soft, succulent ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen two students, Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnegan, came down the stairs from the dormitory, their eyes on the sex. Harry was scared of what they would say, but was surprised to see them smile and start undressing. \"Hope you don't mind a few more, Hershey,\" Dean said as they approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her part, Hershey watched the two approaching Gryffindor's like a lioness on the prowl. \"You know me boys, I'm always hungry for more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the sex continued, with Harry in her pussy, Seamus in her mouth, and Dean in the palm of her hand. She loved how it felt, to satisfy three men at once, not to mention he pleasure all of it gave her anyway. Hermione would have blushed and squealed at such an act, but more then ever Hershey was happy she wasn't Hermione anymore. What neither she nor Harry noticed until all was done and all had cum was that the two boys knew her as Hershey: the curse was imprinting further upon reality.</span></div></div>",

The woman's raven-black hair and teacher's robes made it clear her station, despite the fact that the headmaster knew every teacher in the school, and this buxom woman was not among them. \"How may I help you?\" he asked, keeping his voice level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his immense surprise, she rolled her eyes at him and fixed him with a haughty stare. \"Really, Albus, I'm surprised you haven't noticed by now.\" It was then that Shirley Snape explained to the headmaster everything that had happened that day, and the nature of the box of cursed chocolates she held in her hands. When all was said and done, Dumbledore was sitting down, his withered blackened hand on his face. \"Yes, it's quite the pickle, isn't it?\" Snape asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That certainly is one way to say it,\" the headmaster replied, running through all the ramifications in his mind. \"I can feel the curse in my mind, now that I know of it. Young Draco and Ronald have already begun to be rewritten in my memories. I can recall their students lives as both how they were and how they are, and I'm sure something similar will soon occur with Ms. Granger are yourself. I'm confident that were I not aware of the curse, I wouldn't even notice things had ever been different, the same way I'm sure every other member of the school is slowly adjusting to their new world. What is far more troubling is how this all affects our plans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirley couldn't stop herself from snidely saying, \"Your plans, you mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbus continued speaking, as though he hadn't heard the comment. \"Dru is no longer a Death Eater and has no plans to kill me whatsoever, and soon I'm sure the mission itself will be retroactively removed from existence. Depending on your new memories, this could put you in an unusable Unbreakable Vow or to have never made in it the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it was clear he was waiting for her to speak, Snape thought through her new history and supplied, \"It seems I'm still your agent with the Death Eater forces, but I'm trusted far more than I was before and I haven't been forced to make any Unbreakable Vows whatsoever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in the conversation, Dumbledore smiled. \"Perhaps we shouldn't look this gift horse in the mouth? In a way, a Dark Mark is itself a curse, a powerful one developed by Lord Voldemort himself. But these chocolates, through their own mysterious magic, completely removed them. Is it possible...\" Dumbledore looked at his cursed hand, the sign of his impending death. \"I do not fear death, and yet I feel the world may need me longer than my mistake would normally allow.\" Finally, he let out a sigh and sat up, walking over to the box of chocolates on his desk. Looking through them, he finally picked out one with a peanut butter filling. Snape watched, her eyes wide, but she did not dispute his choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher watched as Albus ate the chocolate, and his aged form shrunk, twisted, changed, until standing in his place was a completely different person. She appeared to be someone in her late teen years, possibly her last year at Hogwarts, though her stormy eyes contained the same wisdom they had before. The youth's tanned and ruddy-hued skin peeked out here and there from a robe that was only half worn, and underneath were athletic clothes, a shirt and shorts. The girl had lost several inches in height but was still tall for a girl, and while she wasn't exactly curvy her athletic build would still turn the right heads. Oddest of all was her curly red hair, of a hue much darker and deeper than the ginger Weasley's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Snape looked at the girl in front of her in genuine recognition as the new memories appeared in her head: this was Alvira Dumbledore, headmistress of Hogwarts. The most brilliant witch in Britain, the archenemy of the Dark Lord, and the one who held Snape's life in her hands. Her youthful appearance was due to a once-in-a-lifetime enchantment that happened entirely by accident that left the seventeen-year old Alvira eternally young. She'd never looked hard for a way to disenchant herself, enjoying the perks of the energy of youth and the practicality of never growing old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same information was running through Alvira's head, and once she felt caught up on her new life, she smiled at Snape. \"Now now, Professor, don't gawk. I know I'm cute, but I'm still your boss.\" With a wink and a spin, Alvira moved to leave the room. \"To be young again! I haven't felt the urge in decades, but I think I'll go for a jog around the campus, see how the students are doing.\"</span></div></div>",

To his surprise, all three were happy to share Harry, and the poly relationship truly began. He would sit with them during classes and for the most part their old dynamic hadn't changed. Rachel and Hershey still argued, Harry still did his best to stay neutral, and Hershey was doing her best to make sure they passed their classes. Only now, Harry's girlfriends would sneak it kisses to him when they could, and Hershey found some of her free time occupied between study sessions when a classmate wanted a quickie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor their first Defend Against the Dark Arts class with Shirley as a teacher, they found things were much better. The emotional abuse was gone, and while her expectations were still high it seemed as though she genuinely wanted to help out her students. When the class ended, she said, \"Potter, could you stay behind, please? I have a task for you.\" Rachel left without a word but Hershey gave Harry a coy smile, one he also saw mixed with jealousy on the faces of some of his male classmates. Once they were alone, Snape locked the door and turned to face Harry, her beautiful face focused on his. \"So, Potter, I see you're adapting well to all of our changes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure of how to respond, especially when someone like Snape was now a gorgeous older woman, Harry looked away, blushing, and stammered, \"Y-yeah, I suppose I am. It's nice, so far at least, and it seems like everyone is actually enjoying being different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor nodded, then took a step closer. She reached up with a soft, smooth hand a raised Harry's eyes to meet hers, and warmth radiated through Harry's body. \"Tell me: do you prefer me this way?\" Before Harry could answer, Snape took out her wand and, with a flick and a murmured spell, sent her teacher's robe flying off her body to rest folded on a desk. She now stood in front of him clad only in her lingerie, her overripe breasts straining out of her bra, her thick body soft and supple. \"Answer me, Potter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Harry said, softly, unable to take his eyes off his teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis answer must have made her happy, because she used her wand to disrobe him as well, leaving the two of them both standing clad only in their underwear. She closed the distance and took his mouth in hers, her large soft lips leaving her purple lipstick on his face. Harry pressed himself into her, his hands roaming all over her body, and shivered in pleasure as she whispered in his ear, \"Let me show you how happy <i>I</i> am with this transformation.\"</span></div></div>",

Horror struck at being bustier, and -<span class=\"clgrey\"><i>shudder</i></span>- prettier than Fleur, she was cursing up a storm, in her soft tones, as she stormed back to the abandoned box of chocolates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of poison was familiar to her, and tainted food and drink a common method of dealing with an enemy. She scowled at her reflection, to find herself on the receiving end. But the expression reflected back was of shattered innocence, wide-eyed confusion, without a trace of power, masculinity of threat showing from her features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear would have driven her to run for the chocolates, but her body already felt more mobile than she liked. Her bust always in motion, those hips seemingly moving further, wider and with a wiggle she couldn't control. The vanishingly small hope of being restored before this.... this <i><b>offence </b></i>was known driving her faster... keeping her progress discreet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready she felt too aware of her bust. Too defined by her femininity.

The thought of the chocolates no longer being there, didn't bear thinking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she felt she'd succeeded, the door... the final door opened before her. She stared blankly at Crabbe and Goyle, as they blocked her way. Frustration on her face, she was furious when they didn't immediately step aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen their fixed blatant stare, reminded her that neither one knew who she was. Even if they'd been capable of raising their eyes to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me.... It's Draco.\" she hissed, in a low, humiliated tone. As if daring them to deny it, or argue. But her words were greeted with blank confused stares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouths working like cows chewing the cud, their expressions vacant. She hadn't befriended either one for his intelligence. However, their comprehension was about to dawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a look of discomfort crossed their faces simultaneously. Draco had the savage, but bitter joy, as Crabbe and Goyle took the same journey, he'd so recently taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effects were similar but not identical, the new cohorts were shorter than Draco... shorter than Dru, even.

Draco's reflection now looking incapable of guile or deceit. As her features settled, her mouth was narrower, but her lips were rose-buds, lush and full, with a tiny inviting gap she just couldn't close. Her wider eyes made her look permanently startled, as if she were facing her first blow job.

Her mouth open, Daphne saw she it was full of cum. Gloriously full, traces spilling to her lips, leaving a stick, sickly gloss in it's wake. The taste was clear from Crabbe's expression that despite the unfamiliarity, she knew exactly what it was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful now, <i>Vittoria</i>, you know good girls swallow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne's feet drummed against the cupboards beneath the bench, as she saw the conflict in Crabbe's eyes. The fear of, the need to spit it out. Screwing her eyes shut, her mouth trembled closed, and her throat bobbed, once... twice... and finally a third time, before re-opening. The look on her face, far from triumphant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.

Moments later, accelerating to sound more like a machine-gun, as she burst through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gorgeous cheeks driving it apart, her thong panties beneath straining against the additional burden.

But no inspiration struck, as she too picked at random. She looked at it, as if seeing her fate only made worse by it. A deep belief that somehow Draco was going to be restored, and both she and Georgia would live on as they were. The punchline to a dirty Slytherin secret, the butt of a poor joke. Her eyes flicked unfortunately to Goyle rump as the thought occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco was more considered in her choice. Her hand floating between the two remaining in the box. Her eyes fixed on Daphne's face, trying to read it for signs, a clue, a flinch... This was a trap made for her, surely Daphne would react to her pick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dithering girl.\" Daphne snapped, as she felt Malfoy's gaze, her blunt attempt to divine which would end her life as she knew it, or restore her... him! him to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plush lips forming a snarl, as she made her selection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who'd like to go first... ladies?\" Her beaming smile making the other look away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco's hope of a clue... surely Daphne would want to draw out the pain. Suggest someone who'd  taken a tainted chocolate to raise the spectre of hope higher. But she was happy if the restorative was taken with the next bite. Or maybe, it was the last one, the remaining chocolate, and they were all about to receive an additional dose of femininity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought niggled at the back of Draco's mind. If it came to it... If that was going to be the one to reverse the changes, they'd all dive for it simultaneously. Or would Daphne take it to spite them all. Did Daphne want to be Dave?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth felt so much smaller, as she looked. The thought of having to force it down, smearing it into her face made her quail. The sound of lips smacking hit her ears, and she saw Goyle's back. The next round begun. Looking to Crabbe, she was nibbling at the chocolate. Her previous ravenous hunger now rather spoiled by the previous selection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the realisation on Draco's face, Daphne taunted her once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dithering girl...\" she tutted with dismay. \"Too timid to be a husband, you'll make a fine wife with the right guidance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefiantly, Draco gave her a two-fingered salute and jammed the chocolate home. Surprising herself at the action, she choked, before chewing it, her mouth drier than she thought possible. She had to make two attempts before she could swallow it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Goyle's back turned, it was easier to check Crabbe out for any progression.

Despite Draco's efforts she felt her hands sliding down her body, driving relentlessly for her crotch. The idea of frigging herself to a climax impossible to refuse. Her innocent face a mask, as she bit down on her plush lower lip. Her eyes darting to the remaining chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne merely shook her head, 'No', there was no rescue there for Draco's ease. No hands warding the chocolate against being snatched. Fingers trembling they reached her twat. Exploring, with a cautious and enthusiastic speed. Her gasps came faster as she found the release for that warm, wet tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gasps, came with intermittent squeaks, and high yipping cries, as her nips stiffened, as her face flushed. Her breath became animalistic rasping, roaring in her own ears, the pounding blood just as deafening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco wondered, as her fingers worked away, if she could have resisted this pleasure for long enough to snatch that last chocolate... even if her life depended on it... even though her -<i>damn it</i>- <i>his, his</i> <b><i>HIS </i></b>very gender might depend on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDipping a finger to the last in the box, Daphne left a finger print in the pristine chocolate surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really weren't meant to share, sweetie.\" Daphne offered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your humiliation was meant to include all of these...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms swept to include the cum-hungry bimbo, and the horse-assed Goyle with her steadily dripping nipples.

Her defeat was absolute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last chocolate doesn't do anything.\" Daphne revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gasping lips round and wide, her face looking incomplete, requiring only a cock to complete the image. Draco's sensual gasps paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last chocolate completes the spell... and ends the curse. <i>That</i>... That restores your meagre masculinity. You'd only have to live with the memories you'd made, the decisions you'd taken.

Daphne left the 'boys' to consider their options. In moments, the three of them were snuffling and licking the crumbs from the table, eager to be rid of their various feminine features. Draco snorted, and scrambled after the fragments, her hands sweeping them towards her mouth in broad circling gestures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sensual whimpering squeak told of Goyle arrival. Her sensitive nips objecting to the coarse grain of the wooden table. At the same time, as she jammed chocolate clumps into her mouth, a puddle of milk was spreading. Her bust sending shallow ripples across the surface. Behind each girl, their wide hips, and expansive asses shimmied from side to side, as they vied to finish the last remnants and recover their masculinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrabbe's efforts sounded more as if she were on the verge of coming.

Until the entire doorway was filled with twenty Slytherins enjoying the sight of those waving rumps, and the snorting snufflings of the diners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sound of desperation came from the girls, as they hunted for the final crumbs. But, behind the appreciative audience, Daphne was licking the last smeared chocolate from her fist. A moan that was purely sexual erupted first from Dru, spreading to Goyle, and Crabbe, as the curse ended had the crowded doorway on the verge of sniggering revelation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a series of pops, those lush hips cracked and collapsed. A matching series came from the broadening shoulders, as their skeletons returned to a more masculine configuration. The sumptuous curves that covered them melted away. The chests flattening, the nipples diminishing, and finally those so round rumps deflating back to dull male proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sigh spilled from Draco's lips, a long held breath finally released, as he felt his hair return to it's former length. Hands darting to his crotch, Draco welcomed back his cock, covering it, hiding it from further peril.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to face the door, Draco was horror-struck to see the watching crowd. An appreciative ripple of applause coming from the audience. The words, <i><b>'My father will hear of this...'</b></i>, clearly not rushing to his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Malfoy name, and reputation meant something entirely different after that day. The story lingering around the Slytherin Common room for years, even after the departure of every participant, and every direct witness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt became a tale, that spread around the entire school.

Nami looked around, surprised that Sanji wasn't fawning over her like he usually did. She went towards the front of the ship and asked Vivi, \"Have you seen Sanji anywhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe princess frowned, and shook her head. \"No, I haven't seen him all day, actually. Is he missing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami sighed. \"Well, we're at sea, and he was here yesterday, so unless he decided to take a midnight swim I think he's fine. He's probably just in the kitchen, cooking breakfast.\" With that, she walked into the kitchen, only to find it empty. This was getting weird. Sanji didn't do much else besides cook and flirt with them. It was then she heard the sound of someone talking coming from the men's bedroom. She walked over to their door, and could make out that it was Sanji and Chopper talking. That's where the idiot had been. Nami rolled her eyes and opened the door, and found the two of them sitting at a table, Chopper in his Brain Point, and staring at what looked like a large strawberry, covered in swirls. Nami nearly fainted. \"Is that a Devil Fruit?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two turned to look at her, shocked. Sanji sputtered for a second before managing to say, \"Nami, what are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nevermind that, answer my question! Is that actually a Devil Fruit?\" she asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji shook his head and sighed. \"Yeah, it is. Doctor Kureha slipped it into my bag, with a note. She's had it for a long time, apparently, and she thought maybe I could use it. She didn't know what it did, so I'm having Chopper take a look at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChopper chimed in with, \"I don't know either. I'd need a book on the different known kinds of Devil Fruit before making a guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a tense silence before Sanji turned to look Nami in the eyes, his face serious. \"Nami, I need your advice. Should I eat the fruit? Is the potential power of it worth the loss of my swimming ability.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it is!\" Nami replied. \"You don't exactly do much swimming anyway, so it can't really hurt. And who knows, the power it gives you might make you even stronger than Zoro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat comment settled it. Before either could react, Sanji grabbed the fruit with one hand and ate the whole fruit in three bites. His face went blue, and he fell to the floor. Chopper changed into his Heavy Point and kneeled over Sanji, worried.</span></div></div>",

Instead, his eyes were trained on Tony Tony Chopper, the ship's new doctor. He'd never noticed how...muscular he was when he was in his Heavy Point. His eyes trailed over Chopper's form, a heat burning in his crotch. He licked his lips, which felt different, somehow, and said, \"Uh, Chopper, wow. I never noticed how...handsome you are...\" <i>This was so weird!</i> Sanji had always had his eyes on the ladies, but now he couldn't seem to care about how Nami looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sanji, is...is that you?\" Chopper asked, blushing. <i>Oh, he was shy? That was so cute! No, Sanji, stop it! You're a man!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cook coughed a little, his mouth dry. \"What happened? Why are you looking at me like that?\" He noticed it, then: his voice was a lot higher in pitch. He stood up and almost sprinted over to the mirror in the room, and was shocked at what he saw. He..wasn't a he anymore. The Devil Fruit had turned him into a woman. Sanji took note first of how tall he was, maybe half a foot taller than before. He moved one hand, noticing how small and dainty it was now, and ran it through his long hair, marveling at how soft it felt. His eyes trailed down to his breasts, and he noted that they were very large, probably around the same size as Nami's. His stomach was lean and taught, and his wide hips and full butt gave him an hourglass figure that many women would kill for. Sanji only had one more thing to check, even though he already knew the answer. He moved his other hand to his crotch, and could feel the truth: he wasn't a he anymore. Sanji noticed then, almost absently, that she wasn't getting turned on at all by her body. She would've thought before that a chance actually be a woman would be amazing, that she would have her own breasts to play with. But now...she wasn't really interested in that. She turned back towards her friends, and again blushed at the sight of Chopper's strong, manly form. It was obvious to her what had happened, but she didn't know how to respond to it.</span></div></div>",

She might be a girl right now, and apparently a straight one, but that wasn't going to affect her. Sanji thought about it for a second, and realized how to change back, feeling it like a muscle she could use when needed. With a minor effort of will, she changed back into his normal self. He looked over at Chopper, and didn't feel any of the burning emotions he was before. Then he thought about his female form, and his passion was back to full throttle. A loud throat clearing made him turn his head towards Nami, who was glaring at him, apparently expecting an explanation. He blushed, knowing he was making a fool out of himself as usual for her. But how could he not? Those breasts, those eyes, that behind! She was a perfect woman! Realizing that he still hadn't responded, Sanji coughed and replied, \"I think that was the Hito Hito fruit, but I'm not sure what model it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChopper frowned. \"So wait a second, it was the same kind of Devil Fruit as mine? That's fascinating! We need to tell the others about this, then we can start experimenting and trying to find out exactly what model it was!\" Sanji nodded and headed on to the deck. The rest of the crew was milling about, waiting for the next destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took all of Sanji's concentration to make sure he didn't run over to Vivi and ask her if she needed anything. Instead, he asked, \"Everyone, can we meet up? I have something important to share.\" In little to no time the Straw Hats were all gathered there, waiting on Sanji.</span></div></div>",

All of them were in their beds, enjoying the peace after their hard days previously on drum island. The only exception was Nami, who sat awake at the table in her cabin, her eyes trained on a spiky fruit covered in swirling patterns. She'd received the Devil Fruit from Dr. Kureha on Drum Island, who had sensed the worries Nami had. She wasn't a bad fighter by any means, but when compared to any of her crewmates, she felt inadequate. She didn't want to be a burden to them again, not after Drum Island. This fruit...would solve that. She'd never been much of a swimmer, so the problematic downside of the fruit wasn't much of a problem for her. But still...there was a risk to it. Neither Kureha or Nami had been able to identify it, so it was completely random when it came to what it would do. Nami looked over at Vivi, who was fast asleep, and made her decision. Nami wanted to be able to help her friends, to be there for them the same way they were there for her. It was time to take a chance. She knew it only took one bite to gain the power, and she'd heard how terrible they tasted, so she only took a small bite from one of the spikes. She felt something stirring in her stomach, and she braced herself, uncertain what was to come next.</span></div></div>",

She reached the mirror, and marveled at what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body had stretched to meet her new height, making her look thinner. Her breasts had grown a little, so that they matched proportionally. Her skin looked a little darker, more tanned, but it felt softer to her touch. On her neck were gills, and her open mouth displayed slightly sharper teeth. She turned around, and saw that there was a small shark fin on her back. She raised her hands, and sure enough there was webbing between her fingers. Nami had become half-fishman, meaning it had been a Hito-Hito no Mi fruit, Fishman Model. That also meant this was only her half-changed form. She wasn't sure how she felt about this. On the one hand, the natural strength of a fishman would make her a much more dangerous opponent in a fight, maybe just as strong as her friends. But she'd been terrorized by fishmen her entire childhood, and changing into one just didn't seem...right. Nami didn't know what to do next.</span></div></div>",

Her eyes gained a predatory glint, and her teeth sharpened into the teeth of a shark. Her tanned skin hardened into scales, and she could feel her muscles growing. Her arms bulked out from the thin arms of a woman into the thick thews of a bodybuilder. Every part of her expanded with musculature, and with it a rush of testosterone hit Nami's brain. She smiled into the mirror, excited at the strength she was feeling, at the savagery her new appearance implied. She watched curiously was her breasts faded away into thick pectoral muscles, and her thin waist pushed out with more muscle and sinew. The fin on her back grew out into a savagely curved sign of danger to all who saw it. Nami could feel what was coming next, and ripped off her night gown to she could see it happen. She looked on as her vagina opened up, and a large cock came out, quickly followed by a tight pair of testicles. She stood there, finished changing, staring at her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami didn't know how to take this new body. It was strong, fast, dangerous. She knew that. But it was also...male. Then again, she could always change back, and her half-way point was also female. Plus, this was a brand new opportunity! She'd always wondered what it was like to be a man, and now he was!

He walked over to the table and sat down in a chair, though it was a little too small for him now that he was a fishman. Nami didn't care, he was too far gone. Nami had had a few lovers in the past, before she'd joined up with the Straw Hats. They were flings, usually just so she could steal their things, but it gave her enough experience that now he knew what to do. He reached down with a large, webbed hand and started stroking his phallus, shivering with the intensity of how pleasurable it was. Nami had no clue that they were that sensitive, and thought back on his previous exploits with a little more care. But the thoughts wouldn't stick, instead his mind wondered back to her previous form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought about her heaving breasts, her butt, and of course her pussy...but then something weird happened. In his mental landscape, Nami's form shifted into the half-changed, fishwomen form, and before he had realized it Nami had grabbed onto his cock and was beating it, faster and faster. For a second he wondered why he would imagine his old human body, when he could think about the fishwoman Nami instead. He knew that was odd, but it made sense. Then, his eyes opened and focused on Vivi, still asleep. Nami thought about all the times they had gotten dressed together, all he'd seen of her naked form. She wasn't as sexy as his own female self, but she was right there. Nami was startled as Vivi, moved a little in her sleep, and leaned upwards, getting out of bed. Her eyes were open, and she turned to look at Nami blearily, confused. It obviously took a few seconds before she realized who this fishman was, but the hair was a dead giveaway. \"Nami, is that you?\"</span></div></div>",

Some bystanders quickly went over to him, recognizing the winner of the UA Sports Festival as the person spasming in pain on the street asphalt. A few phone calls later, and the teenager, his body changing drastically, was relocated to the school infirmary. By the time he'd gotten there, the changes were almost over. His hair was longer, almost down to his butt, which was wider and larger than before. While he hadn't lost any of his muscles, his entire body looked slimmer and sleeker, with the exception of the larger, pillowy breasts that had grown on his chest, large enough to rival his classmate Momo's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the staff to figure out who was behind the transformation.

Some flicker of anger came from the concern of his face, but it felt a lot weaker, what he felt more was joy that the person he admired most in the world seemed to care about him, like it was filling a hole that had been there his whole life, a hole he had never wanted to admit to. \"Young Bakugo,\" the teacher began, his voice hesitant, as though he didn't know how to explain this. \"You've been through a lot of changes, and you're going to be okay. A quirk-user known as the Inverter attacked you, and his quirk...you're a girl now, Bakugo, and from what we understand you'll likely be experiencing more changes than that. You'll be released to your family soon, and you'll still be able to go to class, but we'll want you to let us know about any changes. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't, not really. Looking down at his hospital gown, he could see the truth of what All Might was telling him, the breasts clearly attached to his chest. But why would the Inverter do this to him? He'd heard of the mysterious person, but they usually tried to make people better. Wasn't he already good? A hero? <i>I wish I could blow the asshole up and...no, that would be awful! I have to be careful with my quirk, I don't want to hurt people.</i> Bakugo could feel the dissonance in how he was thinking, but all the aggression he'd had in him before...it just felt terrible now. Still needing to work things out, he told All Might, \"I understand, sir, and I'll be sure to let you know everything I notice.\" His voice came out feminine and breathy, and like all the other changes so far, it felt both foreign and familiar at the same time.</span></div></div>",

The rest of that day passed in a flash, with Bakugo inspecting his now changed rooms, full of feminine clothes he found himself wanting to wear and posters of male heroes that he was drawn to in a way he tried not to think about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way to school the next day, the ran into Deku. Normally, he would have felt so much rage and pain at seeing the nerd, he either wouldn't have said anything to him or he would've thrown some barbed insults his way. But instead, Bakugo's heart skipped a beat. Deku looked so cute, with his freckles and messed up hair and muscular physique poorly hidden by his school uniform. It was all Bakugo could think about, the emotions pouring into his brain at seeing his childhood friend were overcoming everything else, he just wanted to tackle the guy and kiss him. His mind screeched to a halt, and he pondered what he was feeling. Did...did he like guys now? Was he totally in love with Deku?

If true, some part of him wanted to smile savagely in satisfaction, they should all know he's the top girl here. Shaking that weird thought aside, he listened as Eraserhead explained their assignment for the day: a scavenger hunt to simulate search and rescue. Everyone was put into teams of two, and given an area to search for either dummy hostages or hurt people or evidence to be used to convict a villain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Bakugo was paired with Deku, and they had to search the school warehouse for the fake evidence, some kind of vial or syringe or something. Bakugo couldn't help himself from muttering aloud, \"Stupid class, making me look with the damn nerd, why is he so cute, this is all dumb, I hate this, do I even look good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that last rhetorical question, Deku worked up the courage to respond. \"You do!\" he stammered out, before adding, \"Look good, I mean. You're really cute like this, Kacchan.\" The compliment fully awoke the new persona in Bakugo, and more than anything in the world he wanted to glomp onto this nerd and kiss him, make love to him, let him know how amazing and special he was in every way he could. His pride fought these feelings, but he wasn't sure if he'd be able to.</span></div></div>",

Still feeling sleepy and confused, Deku approached the table and saw someone different reflected in it. He was a girl now, looking cute and dainty with a sexy edge. For some reason, he wasn't freaking out, and instead searched the room. It wasn't long before he discovered he still owned a lot of All Might stuff, it was just more subtle or more hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tear-filled conversation with his mom and a call to the school later, it became clear to everyone that Deku had been Inverted as well, and Bakugo showed up at his house to walk him to school, she herself knowing what it's like to be Inverted. As Deku walked outside in her school uniform and saw Bakugo, he immediately found himself not liking what he was seeing. What a bitch, jerking off all the guys, being such an easy slut. She should know her place, especially when she isn't even <i>that</i> attractive.

Clearly conflicted on how he should be feeling, Deku hesitantly said, \"H-hey Kacchan. I heard what happened to you. Are you feeling okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn any previous day, Deku showing Bakugo sympathy would have elicited white-hot rage that someone as low as him was looking down on Bakugo, and some small ember of that feeling did well up inside him. But far more than that was an overwhelming sense of happiness that Deku cared about him, and about his feelings. Detaching himself from the hug, Bakugo started walking, a small skip in his step, as Deku quickly caught up. \"It's really weird, Deku. Everything is so new, but it also feels like it's the way it should be. And my emotions, they're different too. I'm so much less angry than I was before, instead I just want...\" Without thinking, he almost finished the sentence as he'd wanted to, to tell Deku that all he wanted was him in his life, that was all. Instead, blushing more heavily, Bakugo finished, \"...to make other people happy.\"</span></div></div>",

Sitting before the bank of computer monitors, his hands clenched tightly in front of him as his eyes swept from screen to screen, absorbing the data - news broadcast, crime reports, video feeds from cameras he had smuggled into criminal dens years ago. The analysis was troubling - a 240% rise in violent assault, 380% increase in robbery, a 820% increase in arson attacks throughout the city. All within the last two weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe winced as he sat up straighter in his Batchair, clutching his side. It had been two weeks since his fight with Killer Croc. He'd made the mistake of fighting the criminal on his own terms in the sewers deep beneath Gotham and it had nearly gotten him killed. He'd taken a brutal beating, only just escaping with his life and multiple broken ribs. The bruising had subsided but his body was still tender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Gotham, his bloody cowl had washed up in a sewer overflow the next day and the criminal fraternity had taken it as proof that Batman was dead. Armed with this belief, they had begun an unprecedented crime wave in celebration. They were doing overtime. The kingpins were even importing criminal labor from outside the city in order to expand their territory now that the Dark Knight was no more. Gotham was rapidly becoming a battleground between rival families undoing his lifetime of work in a matter of days. Penguin was hitting bank after bank. Poison Ivy was seducing an army to fight by her side. The mayor had undoubtedly been replaced by Clayface. A meeting of the major crime families was to take place tonight, to decide how to consolidate their hold over the city once and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was no use sitting here. Batman would <i>have</i> to make an appearance tonight, if he had any chance of ever stopping this madness. Yet as he climbed from his chair, pain cut through him and he clutched his ribs, barely able to breathe. He couldn't face squeezing himself into his suit, let alone fighting. One lucky punch to the gut and he'd be out for the count.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLimping across the Batcave, he approached the Batsuit...</span></div></div>",

Lady Spellbinder might be seeking a magical item to increase her illusion powers.  Catwoman could be stealing some bauble to finance her life style.  It might just be an ordinary theft but he doubted his luck in that respect.  The batmobile soon arrived at the museum after racing through the streets of Gotham.  Pulling into a back alley to park.  He climbed out slowly to ease the pain of movement.  The medicine he took dulled the ache but he knew that the fight ahead would aggravate his wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman's sense of justice drove him on.  He slipped in a backdoor hurrying to the Arabian exhibit.  He stopped briefly to examine a guard unconscious and tied up.  A physical injury appeared to be caused by blunt object.  Batman cut the guard loose before continuing.  Entering the Arabian room, a sharp pain hit his abdomen.  He crumbled over in pain.  \"Batters up Bats!\"  Shouted the familiar voice of Harley Quinn.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarley noticed Batman not getting up so she prodded him with the end of her Louisville slugger saying, \"What's up Batty?  You got stomach cramps or something?  Pooh your no fun at all if you just lay there.  I know how about you tell me which item I should steal.  You just say yay or nay if you like what I pick.\"  She skipped over to one display not waiting for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm how about this one?  A real magic lamp just like in Aladdin.  What do you Bats maybe I could wish up a nice wish to fix yah good.  Oh, what is this?  I think you\u2019ll like this one its got history and junk.  You like that cerebral stuff eh well this here crown toppled an old timey sultan or some such.  Yah see it is cursed.  Or maybe this here necklace it is said to enhance the beauty of the wearer.  It certainly looks sparkly enough though I think you should put it on it might fix that mug of yours.\u201d  Harley mused as she flitted about from one display to another.  She smiled at the grimace on Batman\u2019s face.  A deliciously fun decision came to her mind.  She grabbed one of the items and began casually strolling up to Batman.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He couldn\u2019t let her get away while strength of will remained.  Steadying his aim he flicked out a batarang.  His aim true it struck Harley in the back of the head.  \u201cOw!

Flipping about Harley rubbing the back of her head said, \u201cYou are going to pay for that Batsy.\u201d  Hefting up her oversized hammer she took a swing at Batman.  He dodged with a precise sidestep.  A well placed chin strike sent lifted her off her and landed her again on the floor into dreamland.  By the time she woke she found herself bound and ready for police pickup.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman attempts to remove the necklace failed.  Deciding to retreat to the comfort of the batcave.  There he might be able to do the research to find a way to remove it.  Magic does not follow the natural laws that bind the world.  He often struggled with it.  In the past facing off with ghosts, demons, and once werewolf.  He contemplated contacting Dr Fate or Zatana but decided to access the problem first.  It might simply be a stuck clasp.  Plenty of tools at the batcave.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving his cowl he examined the necklace in the mirror checking for any clasp to open.  Finding none he moved onto a scanner frowning at the results.  Unknown, not promising.  He next began researching into the history.  A history of being worn by women famed for their beauty.  Going back to Greece its origins spoke of being forged by Hephaestus and blessed by Aphrodite.  Batman thought about contacting Wonder Woman.  She might know the validity of the legend.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman felt a wincing pain as skin drew tight.  Years fading from his face.  His brooding appearance softening almost sultry.  His normally form fitting attire sagging as he shrunken.  Stripping free he found all that once might be called manly wasting away.  The changes progressing rapidly.  Scars and injuries of battle dissipating under a magical onslaught.  Leaving smooth silken skin.  Collapsing to the floor as his manhood drew up inside of him.  Insides churning with his interior altering to contain his new sexual organs.  Areolas pushing out as his breasts took shape.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheeks shifting high as long lashes batted with every blink.  A sex symbol that would inspire lust not fear in the criminal population of Gotham.  His melon like breasts jiggling with each step.  Long toned legs that he used to retrieve a robe to cover himself in.  He didn\u2019t wish to give Alfred a heart attack by find a naked woman strutting about the mansion.  Putting away his costume he headed to his computer to send out a message for help.  He knew that this grew beyond his abilities to manage.  Sending the call out to\u2026    </span></div></div>",

You need to rest, eat, perhaps a few of those playboy antics you secretly enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe set the tray of food on the Batcomputer, and Bruce had to admit that it did smell delicious. He turned away, reaching for his mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may, Master Bruce, the \"death\" of Batman is an opportunity, not just for crime but for you too,\" Alfred spoke up quickly. \"The criminals think you're dead. They're operating freely in the open, their defenses lowered, but as soon as Batman rears his head they will go to ground. Why not take advantage of that while you can. Perhaps a little reconnaissance work - enter their organizations, learn their plans, and <i>then</i>, once you know how they operate, Batman can return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce hesitated. It was true that, as well as being the world's greatest crime fighter, he was also the world's greatest detective and a master of disguise. If he couldn't fight, there could be no harm in focusing on the latter for a few days. His attention moved from the glass case containing his cape and cowl, to the extensive disguise kit he kept, containing every piece of clothing, wig, and make-up he had ever needed, not to mention a few gadgets from the Wayne Enterprises R&amp;D department that he had yet to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, Alfred. A little cloak and dagger never hurt anybody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except the criminals, sir,\" Alfred said with a rare smile, as Bruce began to delve into the disguises.

He surveyed them with a keen eye in exactly the same way Alfred had seen him selecting his armour and gadgets before a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tonight, the Penguin is hosting a meeting of all the major crime families of Gotham at the Iceberg Lounge. The Falcones and the Maronis, Black Mask and White Shark. Security will be tight, but the serving women will be able to walk unseen among them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would hardly honour them with the term 'women', Master Wayne,\" Alfred said primly. \"The Iceberg Lounge is little more than a glorified brothel.\" He stifled a chuckle as Batman held the glittering scrap of clothing against his muscular physique, apparently testing its fit. \"Perhaps master Tim would better suited for this role. If you don't mind me saying, sir, he has the physique for that outfit, while you, clearly, do not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too dangerous for Tim. If his cover was blown, he'd be a lamb among wolves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As would you. Pray tell me how you intend to fool them that you're a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman gave an enigmatic smile, and Alfred rolled his eyes as he reached for that infernal utility belt, plucking from one of the compartments a small item that would no doubt prove the old butler wrong. It was a syringe filled with a bright green liquid. \"Perhaps you recall the disagreement I had with Bane some years back, Alfred. I was unable to defeat his chemically-enhanced strength, but with Fox's help I created this, an antidote to Bane's Venom that temporarily reversed his super strength, atrophying his muscles to a point where I could beat him.\" Alfred winced sympathetically as Bruce drove the syringe needle into his own arm and applied gentle pressure to the plunger. \"If I can judge... the dosage correctly... it should mask... my strength....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Alfred's eyes, Bruce was shrinking. His defined musculature was falling away, especially about his heavily-built upper body. All those long years in the gym undone in a matter of moments. His once massive arms were now slender things, and his clothing hung off a delicate frame. He just prayed that Bruce had got the dosage right - he had been weak before, as his muscles atrophied he barely seemed to have the strength to remain standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman slid the syringe from his arm, examining himself with satisfaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you know what you're doing, Master Wayne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always do.

It resembled a bulky, gun-metal box emblazoned with the WE logo with two large orbs on the front. It sat on the upper chest, and worked by injecting a special gel into the woman's chest to enhance her bust. The early gel had been the major health concern, leaking into the bloodstream and causing all sorts of problems, but together with Fox's help they'd helped smooth out the technical problems. It had sat in Bruce's armoury for nearly a year. He'd doubted that he'd ever need it, but he always liked to plan for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tugged off his shirt. After many years of being at the height of physical perfection, it was quite a shock to see his scrawny torso. Even after Bane broke his back and saw him laid up for months, he hadn't been reduced to such a weakened state. Fortunately it would only be 6 hours before he was returned to his normal self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe set the device for DD-cups. He didn't like the thought of having breasts that big, but it would be better for his enemies attention to be focused on his chest and not his face - deception and theatricality, always keep your enemy distracted. The augmentor was heavy, and as he tried to lift it over his head he became suddenly aware how weak he was. The anti-Venom had sapped his strength, leaving his arms with all the muscle of a string bean. They shook trying to lift the thing from the table. It took Alfred's help to fit it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heavy metal device sealed tightly about his upper body, and he felt two sharp incisions just below his nipples and a tingling, spreading warmth in his chest as the gel was pumped inside. The skin tightened across his chest as his new breasts inflated gradually, swelling the fill the cups of the device, until his ample flesh was squeezed tight inside the cold metal confines of the device. He was grateful when Alfred unbuckled the device and lifted it over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old butler's face was a picture. Bruce's breasts jutted proudly from his chest, massive and globular. They looked fake, but that was no bad thing - there were few women in Penguin's employ who hadn't been augmented in a similar way. The taut skin felt tender to the touch and his areola had been stretched obscenely by the treatment, but it would all (hopefully) return to normal once he allowed the gel to drain back out, leaving him with nothing more than two small new scars to add to his collection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remind me again why you never took this to market, sir,\" Alfred mumbled, looking rather red in the face, his white moustach twitching as his eyes fixated on his masters now addages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGingerly, Bruce hefted them in his hands. Already the heavy flesh ached for something to hold and lift them. He took a step, and the massive mammaries sloshed about, throwing him off balance. How on Earth did catwoman put up with these things - he'd never seen evidence that she used even a shred of support, yet she leaped and ran across the rooftops of Gotham on a nightly basis, while remaining as perky as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let go of them, letting their weight sag back against his torso and sending a twinge through his lower back. Reaching for the bottle of chemical depilatory, he kicked off his trousers and set to work slathering himself from head to foot in the stinging foam, being particularly generous about his stubbled jaw and bikini line. He rinsed himself clean in one of the freezing cold waterfalls that splashed down through the Batcave, and his body hair washed away with the foam, leaving his skin baby smooth and pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTucking his now hairless member between his legs, he slipped the special panties up his bare legs. They flattened his manhood against the underside of his body and held it there. He wriggled into the corset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little help here, Alfred.\" The butler stepped up behind him, grabbing the strings and giving them a tug. Bruce stifled the pain as the corset contracted about his sore ribs. \"T-tighter.\" He was sure he heard a crack of bone as the unyielding corset tightened, but he said nothing, sucking down sips of air. Evidently his broken ribs had yet to heal completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finished, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce looked down. His waist had been pulled in, and his breasts spilled out over the top of the corset so that he displayed quite an hourglass figure. Satisfied with the effect, he worked his legs into the holes of the leotard, stretching the gaudy garment over his body. It was a snug fit, but he was relieved for the slight support it offered his bust. He fidgeted with the material until it lay flat over his crotch., then fluffed the cotton tail upon his ass. The buttocks, while pert, were rather lacking, though he hoped his chest would make up for that. The dark stockings glided up his bare skin to just above his knees, showing of his smooth, pale thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fastened a shoulder-length wig of straight, brunette hair over his closely-cropped, black hair, and positioned the bunny ears in his new locks. Finally he buttons the collar and cuffs about his slim wrists and delicate neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman did a little spin, showing off every inch of his feminized body. \"How do I look, Alfred?\"</span></div></div>",

Everything felt constricted, his busted lungs struggled to breath under the strain of the corset and the leotard left little to the imagination or protection. He twisted slightly to stare at his rear again. The tight cloth made the pert ass look tighter. Nothing large, but hopefully not out of place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she'd be happy to have a daughter,\" Bruce joked. He started speaking lighter, with a slightly higher register. His sentence ended in an upward tilt -not quite a question, but close. It still was a little husky, but that wasn't a bad thing either. He needed to get into the mind set and prepare himself for the night. He wouldn't have any of his normal strength. He'd need to plan more and use his agility.  \"I don't think I look to bad either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe so, Master Bruce,\" Alfred shook his head, \"I'm sure she'd prefer her daughter to wear a little more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep that in mind for next time,\"  Bruce said. He motioned toward their small garage. \"I'll be taking one of the beaters. It will look less out of place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have have any identification at least?\" Alfred moved first, his discomfort at him obvious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a Matches Malone kit ready for this kind of situation. Its already in the car - with a purse.\" He admitted and followed as carefully as he could in the heels. He had worn shorter heels in the past, minor costumes, but nothing like this. The serum didn't take any from his height, yet girls were expected to where at least four inch heels, leaving him at least six and half feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hips rolled at he walked, and the cloth nearly dug up his ass. He didn't let Alfred see his discomfort. He did not have enough time for an argument and surveillance - not if he wanted to be back in time to safely change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could at least attempt to have some decorum, Master Bruce,\" Alfred said when he turned back to look. \"Unless you are intending to be picked up as a woman of the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately,\" Bruce said when he finally made it over to the car, \"that is what I need to be. I'll keep you posted, but this should be a quiet night.\" He opened the door, turned and sat ass first before swinging his legs in. He slowly was getting into character - he hadn't thought of a name, yet, but by the time he got there, he would have a decent one.. He turned the key, the ignition sputtered, though it ran perfectly. It was clever work, despite being completely repaired and have several after market safety features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"i would truly wish to believe you,\" Alfred said as he watched the car speed away. </span></div></div>",

Not quite a hooker, but a stringer hired for the night. He parked on the street, and climbed out to join the other girls waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, lookie here.\" Bruce hadn't even gotten within the street lamp before the other girls saw him. They were dressed up as well, matching his bunny ears and tail. \"You're a new girl hun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea,\" Bruce nodded, swallowing hard. He focused on playing the part, of a girl working in less than ideal conditions. \"Is that - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sugar, this can either be one of the best nights of your life, or the worse,\" another girl said. She stood a little shorter than him, not as large of breasts, but a bigger ass. Her dark skin stood out again the lighter colored bodice. \"You just stick with us, keep your mouth shut and eyes open, and you'll do fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce nodded and took a tentative step closer. It wasn't too cold, but the breeze from the harbor cut through the little cloth he wore. The other girls shivered along with him, and stood in a close circle. Some of them were smoking, but most just watched the harbor. He figured they would send someone shortly to pick them all up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women around him chattered a bit, drawing him into conversations about their hair stylists, the weather, the Knights, even the Lounge. They offered advise, which was helpful, but mostly they were there. Waiting with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot for long as a speedboat appeared in the wake of the harbor. Two men in suits stepped off, leaving another two on the boat. \"Ladies,\" the shorter of the two said with a nod. \"We don't have long, so we'll make this quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're working on contract for tonight, 8 to 2am. If we want you longer, we'll tell you. Anything extra we don't know about it, but your cut is sixty percent. We'll know and you'll pay up when you leave.\"  He looked at each of them, stopping for a few short seconds. Even on him. Nothing long and nothing substantial. Just enough that to ensure they all heard him. \"No drinking or no drugs, You're clear headed tonight. You can't handle that - leave.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of the girls left.. It felt like a script, one they repeated each night. It felt odd that they waited out here. They were not regular waitresses, which mean a call list of some type. The fact that the girls accepted him without question spoke otherwise. The clear rules were spoke to their role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were whores for the night. Paid well, protected by the Penguin, but whores all the same. Bruce nodded with the rest of the girls and sashayed his way up the ramp and onto the boat. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The boat ride was surprisingly warm. They were underneath a cover. He huddled between two of the girls, Candice (call me 'Candy') and Ashlynn. They made the joke about him completing their song - he gave his name as Brandi. None of their names were the real ones. He giggled with them. The lightness helped him ignore the way the leotard was riding up his ass. He was close to wearing a thong at this point - not that much different from the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All off,\" the guard said with the wave of a weapon as they docked. \"We'll take you name at the door. Any cash you turn in at the end of the night to be counted. You'll get your cut then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce filed out after Ashlynn and before Candy. Another guard with a clip board stood at an entrance. Fake names were written down, and the girls were waved in. Not immediately. Some were asked to push up their breasts, others to tighten their suits. Bruce stopped in front of the guard, meeting his eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The wig,\" the guard said after writing down his name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got enough girls and trannies with wigs tonight. The short hair will do you good.\" The guard looked back up at him. Bruce met the man's gaze before reaching up. He pulled the brunette wig off, revealing his short, ruffled hair. The guard handed it off before motioning Bruce to lift up his breasts too. He let out a sigh, but smiled as he pushed them up. They felt full in his hands and bounced slightly, but were now sitting slighly higher. The corset in the suit helped to hold them up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must have been enough, as the guard waved him through. He kept walking with a swing to his hips, finding it easier to move in the heels as the night went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Brandi. We'll get that fixed for you inside,\" Ashlynn said. Candy wrapped an arm around his shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been told twice to lose the wig,\" Candy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three for me,\" another girl, Caroline, chimed in. \"They didn't mind it sometimes, but I think they like us natural.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce watched them ask another girl to remove her wig, revealing a short bob of red hair underneath. As she turned toward the group of them waiting, he caught the the slight fear in her eyes - no his eyes. She was like him or as the guard in-eloquently put it, a 'trannie.' Bruce stepped up to her, and offered a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're looking good.\" He reached up and brushed her hair. \"Better than me at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" the red-head  whispered back. \"Usually, I'm further up in the line and can get in with it. I'm not, I'm not used to not wearing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't worry it,\" Bruce said, tugging her up to Candy and Ashlynn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, us trannies need to stick together,\" Candy said, hipchecking Bruce to release the red-head. He nearly paused in his step, but kept going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandy passed very well. Had she not brought it up, he may not have made the connection. After the comment from the guard, he hardly was surprised. They were all good looking, and if the Penguin wanted them all, well, the call would not have put it out there. Still, comforting to know he wouldn't look too out of place. With all of the makeup caked onto his face, this outfit, and his complete lack of muscle, no one should see him as Bruce Wayne tonight. He just needed not to give them an excuse to look too closely.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Some quick work and product in his hair gave his short cut a more feminine flair. Bruce marveled at the sight. Yes, there were still the mannish appearances, but they were muted under makeup and cut. He'd need to stay out of the papers for a few weeks, but he'd be okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce let those thoughts go as he was handed a tray and pointed in the direction of the high rollers. Not that Brandi was supposed to know that, but he had the plans to memorized since Penguin first submitted them (and the ones not included). There was little he did not know about this place, and on his first night, Brandi was assigned the ones most likely to give him what he needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, he just had to give them what they needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the tray and pad (they had to be props, he wasn't here as a waitress), Bruce followed Ashlynn through the growing crowds. He watched Candy slip to the low stakes poker table. \"You want blackjack or poker?\" Ashlynn asked him as they walked up the steps. There were private rooms, and they would probably be filled as the night when on. He'd leave at two, and hopefully get out of here before the serum wore off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Craps,\" he spotted several mob made men at the table and getting them to talk would be easier there, than poker or blackjack. He smirked at Ashlynn as he made his way to the table. \"Poker if they are feeling lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce saddled up to the table, letting his long legs carry him and draw their attention. His large breast helped keep them off his face. The jiggle felt off, but he ignore that in favor of memorizing the faces at the table.  \"Well, lookie here.\" A Falcone boy watched her approach with a lecherous grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello boys,\" Bruce said, letting his voice remain light. He ran a hand over the man's arm to his neck. The boy shuddered underneath the touch. Bruce kept going, walking around the table and drawing their attention. Their conversation had stopped at his approach, but he didn't let that stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped right next to Alexander Riley, a high level made man for the Irish mob. He was one of the younger men at the table, but had the highest position in his respective family. He would be a good starting place, and his gaze never left Bruce. \"Having fun?\" He received muttered affirmatives, but Riley kept watching him. \"And you honey?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Riley drew out the word, blushing slightly. The table laughed at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce leaned forward, giving the table a show of his cleavage. \"Oh, who's winning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your boytoy there,\" Santo Maroni (low level, only here because he's paying a premium - what deal is he looking for?) nodded back at Alexander. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce smiled at the boy and tapped his chest with a manicured hand. \"Lucky boy. Don't let me stop you.\"  Another girl came over, wrapped herself around another of the mobsters, and just like that, the gambling began again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of them said a word about Bruce being a 'trannie,' even as Riley's hand began to wander. A hand dug into Bruce's ass, clenching one cheek after a particularly profitable win. He gave the boy a kiss on the cheek, and tried to pull away, only for him to pull closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table had started to talk about an arms deal, and forcing Bruce to stay there. He was pulled against the growing cock in Riley's pants, and the wandering hand moved from his ass to his own crotch. Riley said nothing about the small bump, only to start playing with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce shuddered at the touch. Riley ground against him, his cock pressed into between the perk cheeks with each cheer. Even when he started to work out the details of an arms shipment (at the table, the idiot), Riley kept a hold on him. Bruce leaned over and blew on to the dice another Riley mobster held out, pressing harder against the cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was enough for Riley to pull Bruce tightly against his waist. He felt the man shudder against him, and he froze for half a second before kissing his cheek, leaving a large lip mark on it. \"Okay sweetie?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley nodded and released him, slipping several hundreds into his breasts. The boys cheered, and the other girl at the table shared a sardonic smile with him. \"Thanks.\" He pulled her in for a deep kiss before letting her go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be right back boys,\" Bruce said as he sauntered away. He ignored the tightness in his panties and hoped there was no wet spot against his backside. \"Need to freshen up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right on time,\" Ashlynn said as she walked away from the poker table. She looped her arm in his and together, the two headed to the bathroom with eyes on their asses as they went.</span></div></div>",

His cock was still trapped in his panties, but hard. The bathroom was thankfully stocked with some makeup for the waitress and whores (they really were separate - the tray was just for show, something to get her out there without giving it all away). \"Hmmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, you were giving him a pretty good time already, and its not even nine,\" Ashlynn said with a smirk. She leaned her ass against the counter as Bruce started working on fixing his lipstick. He picked a cherry red, something with a lot of pop. \"was it good for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout his training, his lipstick would be smeared across his face. As it was, he still managed to blush. \"Maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, poor baby. How'd you make out?\" Without so much as a 'by-your-leave,' Ashlynn's hand dove into his cleavage. He shivered at the contact. He wasn't expecting his skin to be so sensitive. her fingers played along his breast for a few seconds before digging out the wad of cash. \"Damn girl, already a thousand.\" She flipped through the bills before shoving it back down there. It felt awkward to carry something in her cleavage, but they managed to hide it. \"Make sure you give that up at the end of the night. Once saw a girl try to grift a hundred from them. Last I heard she was in some Mexican brothel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good tip,\" Bruce said. He turned back to the mirror and blew a kiss. The man he was hardly could be see. All he saw was a pretty face, bright eyes, and a sexy haircut. Even his shoulders didn't look too big in the damn outfit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop admiring yourself,\" Ashlynn said. She stepped behind him and wrapped her arms around his waist. He shivered from the contract. Her breasts pressed against him, a familiar feeling, but through his own leotard now. He could feel her nipples against his shoulders. \"you really are too good looking for here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if I'm....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a boy in a dress,\" Ashlynn said with a giggle to take out the worst of the it. \"Much better than some of the boys that come. You'll do well.\" Like Riley, her hand dipped to his crotch. \"This okay?\" Her hot breath against his ear as she started to play with him. He nodded, leaning against her. \"They leave us so hot, and never finish.\" Her fingers dug beneath his panties and pulled out  his cock. She slowly worked her hand up and down. \"Saw they didn't help you out. I'll fix that if you help me later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh - okay,\" Bruce was surprised at how good it felt. He lost count of the number of handjobs he had been given over the years, but this was different. The pressure built up, and up. He felt the warmth growing inside of him. Maybe the serum - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce moaned as the climax overtook him. He slumped against Ashlynn, her hand still playing with him. He grew harder in her hand, even as he recovered. \"What...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone's a two pump chump,\" Ashlynn giggled, but kept going. Bruce shook his head. He never came off that fast. \"And quick refrac - lucky you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks?\" Bruce said once he caught his breath. His face was flush, not just for the orgasm. Ashlynn had gotten him hard again but tucked him back into his panties. Unlike when he did it, she left it up, showing the very obvious outline of his cock. It hadn't shrunk - much - but now there was no hiding what he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me,\" Ashlynn whispered . She kissed his cheek, then turned his head more to kiss him on the lips. \"Fix up your lipstick and head back out. We've got more money to make.\" She let him go. He followed her and watch that ass shake. He felt a bit of jealousy at the thought of not being able to make his own jiggle like that. It was odd, and definitely not one he expected. He shoved it aside to focus on the mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sauntered off, leaving Bruce with another hard-on - this one more obvious than the last. He could only comply, figuring that if the mobs families already knew, then it didn't hurt any more. It would serve as a distraction. Besides, the thought of walking out there, in this outfit, with his cock for everyone to see was kind of enticing</span></div></div>",

He typically had complete control over his body, but tonight was different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight, his body was enjoying the attention. It wasn't humilation, though, he felt a little for people staring at him so openly. There was lust in their eyes. He was used to women and some men, but now it was mainly men, and some jealous women. Weirdly, this made him more confident - or rather, Brandi more confident. He needed to move out of the mind set of Bruce and let Brandi take charge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandi waved at the boys at craps, smirking at their disappointed looks. He figured one of them may ask for more later, but that well was dry. The boys playing poker would have more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt eyes on his ass and cock as he walked through the tables. He brushed some shoulders, shared glances with the other girls and waitresses, and let the guards follow him as they wanted. There was power in his movements, different than Batman. This was a social power, one held by simply being rather than from his riches or status. He was, therefore they stared.  It was oddly intoxicating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evening boys,\" he said as he approached a table. Ashlynn had waved him over behind the back of a mobster and pointed at a pair of Falcone boys \"How we all doing?\" He stood over the pair and bent to drop his breasts at head level. both pair turned to look down his cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better, now that you're here,\" the right one said. The left just kept staring, though his eyes flicked between his cleavage spilling from his outfit and his tightly outlined cock.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game moved on, hands after hands, While Riley was about touching him, these two were all about him touching them. Brandi brushed their shoulders, leaned his breasts into them, and even a few kisses on the cheek. His cock remained hard throughout all of it too, which was kind of disconcerting, but he ignored that in favor of charming the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was vague talk at the table about another shipment, the kind of talk around what they actually were shipping. Humans? Sex workers? The chips kept changing hands as the men spoke about the arrival times and security. Never about the cargo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Falcone boys were receiving the cargo though, which meant he needed to figure out his next move.</span></div></div>",

He had enough to start with the Falcone boys, and despite a generous offer, Brandi just shook his head. The boys made a move to intimidate him, but the guards and other mobsters cut that off quick. He appreciated it, but wasn't surprised. The reason for supplying hookers in house was to make sure you minimized trouble - which means taking care of them whether the guards wanted to or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandi simply moved onto the next guy at the table. This guy was a talker compared to the others. At first, he was interested in the logistics of the Falcone's operations, but now that they were gone, he seemed more than happy to turn the attention to himself. He was a new face, and Brandi needed to make sure she knew identified everything she could about the guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I may not have been able to get them on board, but I'm sure you gentlemen would be interested,\" the man said. He was shorter than Brandi but as skinny. His body felt tight under his suit, and he enjoyed the touches along his exposed skin. Short, unkempt brown hair, but an above average face. Not the best looking guy, but definitely not the worst - miles ahead of the Falcone boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop trying to peddle your trash,\" a man said, tossing in the big blind. The dealer began the round, and Brandi counted the cards even as she played with the collar of the man with a potential plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You call it trash, I call it a way to make money,\" the man glanced at his cards (Ace, Two, hearts). \"What if I can make your girls the best on the market? Healthier, sturdier, safer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll do what? We've got surgeons,\" King-four said. The man chipped in for a hundred. The next two folded (eight-four and ten-three)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"too expensive, unreliable, and worse, narcissistic.\" Ace-two hearts said. \"My method is cost-effective. And like I said, safer. Faster too, but it always was going to be.\" He glanced up at Brandi, smiled and tossed in a raise. The next player folded (pair of threes), but the next two called (Queen-four clubs and nine-eight). The betting finished, the dealer buried one and dealt a four and five of hearts, and a queen of spades. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not narcissistic too?\" Big-blind/six-five of clubs asked. He raised a thousand, which King-four called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I am,\" Ace-two said, calling the raise. He leaned back into Brandi's hand, his elbow brushed against his cock. \"But I'm more than happy to improve my methods rather than make a name for myself. That may come later, or not at all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen-four called the raise while nine-eight folded. The dealer buried one and dealt a eight of clubs. Eight-four scowled but shook off his anger.  \"So what can you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAce-two hearts smirked as King-four raised another thousand - probably trying to buy the pot. \"Make you a better whore. A little science, a little magic, and some  ingenuity, and let me tell you, I can make a plan Jane into a dream girl.\" He called the raise, trying to pull the straight, a flush, or a straight-flush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Queen-four said as he raised four thousand. The big blind called, as did King-four. Ace-two paused. \"you can do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May take a bit more, and I can do some other...fun things. Call,\" he tossed in the requisite amount. He pulled his arm forward and then wrapped it around Brandi. He kept playing with the hairs on the back of his neck. \"I can even make this lovely girl even lovelier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dealer buried, and dealt the three of hearts. Brandi felt the man's hand grip tighten slightly, but otherwise he gave no identification he won.  In fact, a thumb dug into his ass crack as he stared down the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to see that,\" big blind said before betting ten thousand. King-four glared and folded before he turned to focus on the Ace-Two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" he said. \"How soon can you arrange a demonstration? This kind of thing would be worth seeing - if you're looking for investors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I am, and ones who would allow me to test a little as well - all for your benefit of course,\" Ace-two said. He double the bet, forcing Queen-four to make a decision. \"Tonight, next hand in fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd call just to see that,\" Queen-four said, tossing his chips in. The big blind did as well, prompting Ace-Two to show his straight flush.  The chips were pushed over to him, and he stacked them with his free hand. Brandi glanced up at Ashlynn who just shrugged his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you, Lady Luck,\" he said, handing her two grand in chips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"thanks sweetie,\" Brandi leaned down to kiss his cheek, pressing his breasts into him. He pulled back up and looked around the room. The crowds had grown and the high-roller tables increased. He caught the eyes of a familiar woman and quickly glanced away to a guard. The guard nodded and approached, his hand held out. He handed him the chips before focusing on Ace-two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we've got two lovely ladies here, and I've got some select product to help...enhance them shall we say. That is of course if Mister Cobblepot minds?\" He glanced up at the guard beside Brandi.  He stilled as he waited for the answer that would dictate how this night ended. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ace-two kept an arm around Brandi's waist as they walked. \"I'm going to make your wildest dreams come true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Brandi's eyes grew wide. He could not escape this, and if he tried to fight, than Ashlynn would probably get hurt as well. He just needed to focus on getting through this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" he said. He gave her a squeeze. \"I promise, when this is all over, you'l be a new person.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was what Bruce was afraid of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everyone was in the room, Ace-two was handed a suit case. \"Ladies, please stand right here.\" He pointed the front of the room. He set up just to the side of them, placing his briefcase on a table. Brandi caught sight of several vials resting in it, and likely more underneath the ones on top. \"The best place to start is the beginning, so lets start with the basics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"  One of the Falcone men asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I want to make sure my canvas is clean and free of blemishes.\"  He turned back to the crowd with two light blue vials in his hand. \"Oh, it seems we've gathered a few more people. No matter, more people means you all get to see first hand what I can do for your organizations. Now, my name is Dr Mathias Zan. I'm a biochemist and geneticist. That is all secondary to my passion of improving people. I want to make these girls the best they can be. And these,\" he shook the vials in his hands, \"will help me to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to Brandi and Ashlynn and held out the vials. \"This won't hurt at all. Wht's going to do is clean up and soften your skin slightly, soften and strengthen your hair, and improve your general health. Any issues you may have had, any marks or scars from before will be gone.\" Ashlynn glanced at Brandi before she took the vial. Brandi quickly did the same. He uncorked it and stared at the contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light blue liquid was more viscus than he expected. There were too many guards here and too many people who probably had weapons on them. He couldn't move without being noticed and with everyone's eyes on him, there was nothing he could do but comply. He tipped the vial to his lips and drank the contents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, his body began to feel warm. A tingling sensation started down his throat and continued to spread quickly through his body. He felt marks fade and a brush of his hand against his forearm only told him how soft and sensitive his skin was becoming. He gasped at the light touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I apologize,\" Zan gave a chagrined look to them both. \"This sensitivity will extend to all erogenous places as well.\" He reached out a tweaked Ashlynn's nipple. She let out a moan. and cupped her breasts. Her face grew red, but Brandi wasn't sure if t was because of the sensitivity or the embarrassment. Her glance over at him confirmed it was the latter as she quickly looked away. \"This enhanced state is temporary, but overall, they will enjoy a much better experience with a lover's touch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive,\" a woman said. \"I may just want to purchase a vial for myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we can negotiate that once the demonstration is done,\" Zan said with a nod in her direction. \"There may be other things you all wish to purchase. Understand that for a fee these all can be tailored to your specifc needs.\" Definitely supervillian potential. Bruce may need to offer him a job at WayneTech to prevent him from falling too far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Now then, I can do a number of things next, but I think I will start with this,\" Zan held up a single light green vial. \"I only have one of these, so I need a volunteer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it do?\" Ashlynn asked before Brandi could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZan shook his head. \"That would be telling. But I can give a hint. It will help you return to an old perspective.\" Brandi and Ashlynn shared a glance. Brandi wanted to volunteer, to protect his new friend, but he didn't know what this mean. This wasn't so much as a riddle but an allusion to the chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who is going to be?.\"</span></div></div>",

I expect that most of you may wish to purchase this one, but the cost is most prohibitive. It also can have some unfortunately side effects\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandi raised the vial to his mouth and swallowed it whole. Much like the other one, the consistency was slimy and he had to focus on getting it down. He felt a burn fill his throat and them spread to his body. Unlike before this burn reached beyond his skin. He bent over and tried to focus on the pain. He wouldn't scream for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, if you can't tell what is happening, my lovely assistant here is experience a slight age regression - roughly ten years,\" Zan said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandi's eyes show wide from his doubled-over position. He gripped his stomach as whatever was in the vial worked. The burning sensation reacted with his sensitive skin, making it both worse and better. He felt an arm go around his waist to hold him up - an arm that inadvertable brushed against his hardening cock. He bit his lip to hold in the moan and tried to resist the impulse to rub against the arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd impulse he failed to control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brandi?\" Ashlynn's voice reached through the fog. He slowly stood straight as the burning ended, but he knew he was still rock hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't need a mirror to know what happened. He knew what he looked like ten years ago. He was just turning twenty, but buff. With everything else going on tonight, he probably looked even more feminine than he started. The soft skin and youthful appearance probably made him look even younger. The makeup may have helped to make him older at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, perfection,\" Zan clapped and soon the crowd was as well. There were multiple offers to purchase this vial, and it might be the best seller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I should have taken it,\" Ashlynn whispered. Brandi didn't know how he was going to explain the lost years, but he'd figure it out. He needed a sample first. His biggest fear was the loss of muscle memory. He ignored how good Ashlynn's hand felt just above his cock, how much he wanted to press it up and rock against it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to focus on what Zan was saying. Not how much he wanted to cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, the next demonstration is for both of our fine guests.\" He pulled out two more vials from the case. \"This perfect to help a girl who needs just wants to look natural.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held out the bottles to them both. \"Bottom's up.\"</span></div></div>",

He couldn't leave without make a noise, and there were too many to leave without being hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshlynn had already taken the vial and uncorked it. He quickly followed, and tried not to show his hesitation. Much like others, this vial burned slightly as he swallowed it, but hte burning spread out from his throat and int ohis chest. He felt the weight shift. He reached out to cup his breasts as they first slightly deflated, the implants he used disappearing before he felt the weight of his own flesh, fat, and muscle growing in his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a long moan as a rush of electricty rolled through him, centered on his nipples. He instinctively rubbed his breasts as another ripple went through them.  The same ripple ran down his back and he felt in his cock. He vaguely heard Ashlynn's moans beside him. She leaned into him, holding onto him to stand upright. He felt his cock tighten more and threaten to spill in front of everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful, simply wonderful,\" Zan's voice cut through his haze. Brandi opened his eyes to applause as the crowd stared at them. He blushed both from the excitement running through him and embarrassment from the crowd. His nipples poked through the thin material of the outfit and his cock was hard against his body. He knew they could see it, see him for what he was, but he couldn't do anything except play with his new breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were larger, impossibly larger than the ones he had before, but they were all him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unlike the other ones,\" Zan moved closer to them, smiling wide at them both, \"the sensitivity for this enhancement is permanent. Every touch to your magnificent breasts will feel like a choir ringing through you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're perfect for a tit-fuck!\" A voice yelled back from the back. Zan glared, but nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I suppose they are,\" he said. \"Though, that is up to them. Let me be clear. I do not force my gifts on to anyone.\" Brandi wanted to scoff at the idea, but was still trying to get himself under control. He had managed to stop his fingers from reaching toward his erect nipples, but could do nothing about the straining erection he still had. \"As a part of my gift tonight, these girls have received also a complete health update - they are the healthiest versions of themselves and will find their bodies maintain longer with little effort. Such is a prize for being the first to experience these wonders.\" His smile turned dark. \"You sir, seem like you could use some of these as well.

Brandi had to admit he was little impressed at the action. What he didn't want to admit was how sexy it was and how much harder he felt watching the man stand up for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is not unwilling,\" one of the guards said. \"It is a choice of this, or going to the backroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I pick this,\" the mobster nearly cried out. Whatever was in the backroom was not pleasant. Zan shifted his stare from the guards to the man then back to the guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but understand, that this decision is final.\" Zan turned back to Brandi and Ashlynn. \"Ladies, I'm afraid that I'm going to have ask you to disrobe for the next portion. You will be compensated for your time and actions for this portion. Is that okay?\" Ashlynn nodded and Brandi felt himself nodding along with it. Zan turned back to the mobster. \"You as well. Everything.\" He waved a hand at the mobster but turned his back on them. He started to rummage around his suitcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandi started to slip off his outfit. He felt the tug against breasts resist the pull but flop out from underneath the outfit. It still clung to him and he resisted the urge to cover himself as Ashlynn just faced the crowd as she disrobed.  He slipped off his heels and pulled the outfit down from his waist. His cock popped out harder as everyone started to applause. He blushed and stepped out of his outfit, but managed to keep his hands at his side. Ashlynn finished as well, revealing bright pink nipples of her breasts. He wondered how his looked as they breasts felt as large, if not larger on his frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done,\" Zan nodded at them and turned back to the mobster who was standing a few feet form them and covering his own hairy crotch. \"With a new volunteer, I have a few additional items I can now show. I think I'll start with this one.\" He held up a dark purple vial. \"Sir.\" He held out his hand to the mobster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's it going to do?\" the man asked.

Despite the pulsing desire to grab his cock and jerk off, he squeezed back and focused on not showing any terror. His body was weaker and he was younger to go with it. They may be 'compensated' but there was the real chance of never leveling this place tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mobster began to yell and then scream in terror as his body began to melt away. His fat disappeared inward before pulsating out from his ass. Muscles disappeared as the man wrapped his arms around his waist. Cracks echoed through the room as the murmurs grew louder with each jerking movement the man gave. His body shrunk and cracked as it melted inward. It was like watching Clayface dissolve under a chemical bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the screaming fell into whimpers in a high register. The man was a fraction of himself, his body now looking both younger and more feminine. Most of the fat had disappeared, only remaining on his ass and hips. The cracking of his bones resulted in narrower shoulders, wider hips and a thigh gap. Brandi could actually see the tiny dick attached to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go,\" Zan said, smiling widely. \"A prime example of one of concoctions. While most of what you've seen tonight had been single or simple actions, this one was more complex - as you can all see. IT also is much more painful to than what I prefer to offer. The man is experiencing the same enhanced sensitivity, in addition to diminished muscle mass, fat, and bone size. The more dramatic the change, the more dangerous it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZan walked back over to them. \"I will not do such things to you. Please know that what I did was to ensure you remain protected.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshlynn nodded, but Brandi just stared at him.

Her hands reached up to her hair, which began to spill out of her. Her shoulder length locks quickyly grew to the middle of her back and then just past her ass. Brandi caught her around the waist, holding up his friend as whatever was in the vial worked. Her skin felt warm against him, and he did his best not to rock his hard cock against her. The soft moans coming out of her lips were not helping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mobster's moans were much louder, drawing everyone's attention. Brandi focused on Ashlynn. \"You okay?\" She nodded, leaning into him. Her long hair brushed against his ass, surprising him how long it was. \"Okay. Think you can stand up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but not going to,\"  Ashlynn whispered back. She gave him a smirk, letting her hand brush against his cock as she straightened up. \"I'm so going to fuck you silly after this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be okay with that,\" Brandi whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for some of the more extreme stuff,\"  Zan said before either of them could recover. \"Let me say we only have a few more.\"  He turned back to his case, and turned back around with two new vials. \"Now, I take it is your turn?\"</span></div></div>",

His face sagged, his features running together into a ugly, dripping slab of clay split apart with a grinning maw that dripped slime. All to late, Batman noticed the characteristic smell of wet earth that filled the room, easy to miss in the dankness of the Batcave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thin, upright form of the butler swelled, losing definition, the clothes vanishing into the amorphour, grey-brown flesh. Clayface towered above Batman, ten feet high, the walkway beneath his massive feet groaning and sagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clayface,\" Batman choked out, barely masking his panic. How had he not noticed sooner?! He fought to clear his mind of the fear rising in him, yet it seemed harder now. How could he have been so foolish, injecting himself with the Anti-Venom. As long as it coarsed in his veins, he was as weak and helpless as... a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, not helpless. He was still Batman and, strong or not, he still had his agility and a whole cavern of gadgets at his disposal. Yet Clayface was standing between him and the armoury. To get his suit and utility belt, he would need to somehow get through him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClayface gurgled in mirth. \"Surprised to see me, Batman? Or perhaps.... Bruce Wayne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to keep him talking. When Clayface was distracted, he would make his move for the equipment. \"How did you know where to find me, Clayface? I know for a fact you're not smart enough to figure out my secret identity yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A stroke of luck really. After your... death, I thought it would have a go at running Gotham. It was fun for a while, being the Mayor, but soon I started to think, 'why have all this responsibility?' Why settle for Mayor, when I can be a man far richer and more powerful than him. A man like Bruce Wayne...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amorphous figure began to condense, assuming a familiar human form, the tall, broad-shouldered, handsome figure of Bruce Wayne. Clayface ran a hand through his short-cropped hair and felt his chiseled jaw with delight. \"I took the form of your butler to get closer to you. Only then did I discover the truth, that you are in fact Batman.\" His eyes roved over Bruce's swollen breasts bulging from the plunging cleavage of the leotard. A line of drool fell from his lips. \"Or should I say Bat<i>girl</i>. I've been watching you for some time, trying to decide to best time to strike. I could never imagine you would serve yourself up to me like <i>this</i>. The story's are true what they say - you're almost as good as master of disguise as me. You'd really have fooled Penguin and his lackeys. And using Anti-Venom on yourself... inspired!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you done with Alfred?\" Bruce demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid you'll never find out, my dear\" Clayface crooned, stepping confidently forward, a mixture of lustful and violent intent on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow or never. Batman broke into a run. Yet as he did so, his heavy breasts sloshed against his chest, and he stumbled, his weakened legs falling out beneath him. The anti-venom had robbed him of his agility as well as his strength. He staggered...</span></div></div>",

His gruff voice cracking as he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love a husky voiced girl.\" Clayface added his own voice sounding gravelly and deep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ruffled Bruce's hair, \"Oh and there's one other thing I love on a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce felt twin pricks in his ass, and soon there was a hiss. He felt a warm liquid sensation fill him up. He rocked his hips from one side to another but it didn't help. As the hormone laden gel gave her a rounded and full ass to balance her new chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another angry press, Clayface pushed the button once more making his ass a work of outstanding beauty and prodigious size. It was undeniably feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven groaning as her bones ached and muscles tensed her tone became softer. The implant gel just wasn't meant to be used in this way, or to this extent.

It wobbled like jelly beneath his grasping fingers. \"After all your triumphs, to come to this. Your city in ruins, your mighty strength gone, your body mine to do with as I please, in more ways than one. Such a pathetic end for the Batman,\" Clayface gloated. \"And yet such a wonderful new start for Bruce Wayne. Gotham is going to be seeing much more of him in the weeks to come. Oh yes, I'm going to love living your life. The money, the power, the <i>women</i>...\" Clayface licked his drooling lips. \"Mmmm, I've been learning all about you these last few days, while you were laid up in bed. Your Batcomputer is quite extensive. You really are quite anal, every aspect of your life documented, you've saved me so much hassle becoming you. Tell me, do you keep records of all your conquests, or just the pretty ones? I barely know where to start! Do I want to have Selina Kyle first, or perhaps Talia. Yet how I'd love to make Black Canary sing. Or maybe even Wonder Woman. A woman birthed from clay, that would suit me down to the ground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman's head was spinning. The gel was leaking into his blood, clouding his mind. Cassius shifted his weight on his back and grabbed the two laces of the corset, pulling them tight with vicious force. A degrading, feminine cry escaped his lips as the air was forced from his crushed lungs beneath the steel vice of the corset. His ribs snapped beneath the pressure. Twisting his head, tears of pain in his eyes, Batman stared disbelievingly at his crushed waist. It was horrifyingly thin, small enough for a man to wrap his hands entirely around, accentuating his hips and tits. He couldn't breathe. His body screamed for air. He was suffocating! He had to get free!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce could feel his damp, earthy breath on his neck as Cassius hissed in his ear. \"Or perhaps I'll pay a visit to the lovely Barbara Gordon. She gets so lonely cooped up among all those computers, I'm sure she'll be like putty in my hands at the slightest attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething long and wet and warm was snaking up Batman's leg, coiling around his thigh like an anaconda. He shuddered in disgust as the horrible thing slid up through the crack of his massive buttocks. Reaching down, Cassius hooked a finger inside the leotard and the panties and pulled them aside, and Bruce felt the bulbous head of the thing teasing against the entrance to his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But first things first, I'll have you.\" Batman had no breath left to gasp as he felt the first inch slide inside him. The girth on it was huge, and his aching body stretched to accommodate it. \"Bane might have been the first to break the Bat, but I'll be the first to split him in two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as all hope faded, their came a swish and a thunk, and Clayface reeled back with a cry of pain, pulling himself from the Bat's body, though his serpentine cock still remained coiled around Batman's leg. He turned, straining to see his attacker in the dimness of the cave.</span></div></div>",

A cloud of icy cold CO<sub>2</sub> burst from the tank freezing his flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman didn't need any more of a distraction, with her free leg she kicked out and snapped the frozen dirt encircling her.

It was unsettling but also weirdly exciting. As she considered being at the mercy of Batman. Alone and isolated, not even Arkham was so intimidating. At least people would know if you were in Arkham. Down here, nobody would even know you where you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can slide him in here.\" Bruce said, indicating a cell like a giant fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's not even a door!\" Selena observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doors don't stop Clayface.

The kind that draws the eyes of men whenever she merely passes by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce's voice wavered as she spoke, mixing joy at her plan for Clayface with the realisation that, that would be a problem she'd have to live with herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Bruce.

Perhaps her son could save Gotham where she had failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did she know that the villain she sought was right beneath her.

Casting a darting glance down to Batman's ample bosom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bruce's eyes followed, it was shockingly clear, just how much bigger she was than the average woman. She wasn't used to seeing them from quite this angle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're wrong, you know.\" she said. \"You don't deserve this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce's eyes were on the verge of tears as she looked deep into Selena's sincere eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't do your crime fighter routine, without that tough body... and that oh so arousing gruff growl of yours.\" she made the last few words extra husky, just for Bruce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her light-hearted manner, she was being genuine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But with the right slinky, distracting skin-tight outfit you could be one of Catwoman's kittens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let the joke fall, as Batman choked back some harsh breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On another matter, I've put the rest of Clayface into the cell. So he won't be regaining his mass for a good long while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to judge her reaction, but just shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbruptly, she held a hand up high above the back of the chair. \"Make it two teas.\" she called out clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjusting her position, she swung one leg high and across, and put one arm around the back of Bruce's neck. So that she was sitting less suggestively in across lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfred placed the tray on the low table in front of the chair. He didn't bat an eyelid at the two women entwined on the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll fetch another cup, ... Sir.\" he walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm impressed.\" Selena confided, \"Nothing upsets him... is that a necessity for living here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slid off his lap and took a seat at the other side of the table. Picking the teapot up, \"Shall I be mother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce took a moment to work out her very English idiom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... please pour away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena poured Bruce a cup, and settled the pot back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a sip. \"Burlesque.\" he said without preamble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This body is only fit for Burlesque.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlfred silently return with a second cup. He knew exactly who Selena was, and cast a meaningful glance at his mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can retire for the night... I'll tidy up the cave later... we don't want you getting affected by the chemicals.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last thing we need at the mansion, is a French maid replacing the butler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a deep bow, he left them alone. The door clicked solidly closed.</span></div></div>",

Next she snuck an arm around Bryce's waist and pulled her tight against her own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll lead for just now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBryce was stiff and clumsy as she was lead around in a gentle dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to relax, and go with the flow. Resistance is for those with more strength than you can muster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena's hand slipped lower, and she gave her dance partner a gentle pat on the ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatman's growl of disapproval lacked depth and sounded on the verge of groan. But with her thought still in flux, she followed Selena's lead, and found the whole exercise more straight-forward, even enjoyable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time, since Clayface had tried to rape her, even that thought still made her rage rise, and she stiffened. There would still be a reckoning for that offence, and she was damned sure that he'd never see the inside of courthouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting her head on Selena's shoulder, she drew the heady aroma in as she moved. But something was at the back of her mind, something was out of place, just wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer famous detective instincts took the puzzle and worked on it, as she whirled around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost fell over Selena's feet as worked it out, there were two cushions. One in her own chair, and a twin on the Sofa that Selena had used. There was a stinging swat on her ass, \"You were doing so well.\" Catwoman murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have two identical cushions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes drew close as they darted between them, trying to spot a clue. Which was the fake. She wanted... so desperately wanted Selena's help. However, she wasn't sure how good Clayface's hearing was when disguised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a strangled choke, as she realised that Clayface had just had a generous faceful of gorgeous feminine ass until recently, either her own or Selena's sweet tushie.</span></div></div>",

The cosmetic product penetrated her flesh, fusing itself into the muscle and fatty tissues of her glutes, and swelling in response to her body heat, plumping out her magnificant ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Make it stop,</i> Bruce pleaded silently (she would never give Clayface the satisfaction of begging aloud). <i>Make it stop. It can't end like this.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe imposter stood, and it seemed as though her prayers were about to be answered as his fist closed and swelled into a hammer forged of wet, dripping clay, which was swung against Bruce's head.<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\nBruce woke slowly. Her body ached. Her lungs screamed for release. The skin of her breasts and ass felt tight, thin, and stretched, as though the slightest caress would tear it. She felt weak. Weaker than she had ever felt before. Weaker than when Bane had broken her spine and rendered her wheelchair bound for months. It was a fight to open her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn empty syringe was sticking out of her left breast. Muddy fingerprints covered the plunger, which had been pushed all the way in. Only a few drops of Anti-Venom remained within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a great effort, she turned away from it, her head flopping to the side. She was still in her Batcave, trussed tightly and gagged on the wet, cold stone floor. The tall, suited figure of Bruce Wayne turned away from the Batcomputer as he saw his captive stir, moving towards her with powerful, purposeful steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that you were saying about getting the dose just right? Something about the effects not being permanent if you calculated it correctly...\" Cassius laughed, sliding the syringe from her breast. \"I readjusted your calculations while you were sleeping. I think you'll find the new effects to be far from temporary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius crouched over her immobile form, his gloating face hovering inches from her own. He moved lower, vanishing from her limited field of view, and she felt his coarse stubble sliding over her breasts as he plunged his face in between her bloated, pillowy breasts and motorboated her enthusiastically. He rained kisses on her soft skin of her belly, moving over her navel down to between her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another miscalculation you made. I've been checking your records. The gel in you is an order of magnitude what it should be. Your blood is choked with estrogen, your brain swimming in it. Look at what it has done in just a few hours. Imagine the effect after a few days, or months. I must admit, my curiosuity is piqued. I think I'll keep you alive after all, <i>Batman</i>, just to see how you turn out. There is... one thing that it can't do however. Let me show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassius's hand grabbed Bruce's limp head, moving it to stare down at her own body. Between the cleft of her own cleavage, she saw her manhood, flaccid, shrunken and hairless, out of place between her soft, swollen thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortunately I've discovered a new ability,\" Cassius said gleefully. \"I have a certain caustic touch. I can melt flesh, turn it into clay like me. Let me show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill holding his head, the imposter reached down with his left hand, pressing the tip of his index finger against the tip of Bruce's cock, who gasped as his penis erupted in pain. She watched, unable to look away, as the skin of her dick bubbled and liquified, her shaft melting into flesh-coloured goop like a candle beneath a flame. Cassius pressed against the amorphour mass, pushing his finger deep into Bruce's body. Her head swam, tears blurring her vision as her penis was obliterated. A low, horrified moan came from her lips as Clayface set to work sculpting a pair of labia either side of the new hole between her legs, crafting her vagina with a lustful eagerness.</span></div></div>",

I have a habit of taking in waifs and strays.\" For that moment perfectly emulating the Bruce Wayne voice known for his philanthropic deeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Clayface settled on Bruce's stomach, she felt the warmth of his body. It felt like it was throbbing, vibrating, massaging his flesh intimately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips parted in horror as she realised that was exactly what was happening. Clayface was remoulding her to fit the role he was creating for her. As he rocked from side to side, she felt her own hips creak, and give, widening and thickening under the relentless pressure. She felt her masculinity crushed into her body. The eerie rippling, as if she were being penetrated, as she was re-gendered to fit her new curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBruce thrashed, his shoulders crashing against the floor. But the sheer weight of Clayface had her pinned. Her efforts ensuring only that her cheeks were slapped again and again, by her expanded bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA leering look spread over Clayface, as Bruce's chin and cheeks reddened beneath the fleshy assault. Her waist shrinking crushed beneath his torso. Bruce was going to end up with a true hour-glass figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe refined whore that Bruce had aimed for buried in curves. A body built only for sex, capable only of inspiring lust. She was a succubus in human flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching out a marshy arm, he pinned her to the floor, ending the sound of her zaftig efforts at escape. With a disappearing wink, to her terrified face, his features melted and poured himself from head to toe, cocooning her in his mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he covered her, rising up towards her neck, she took a last deep breath, as he spread over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was warm, and relaxing the attention his earthy wrapping held her. She felt a teasing rippling from each proud nip. Stimulated, and expanded at his direction. She felt her throat massaged, to a higher, tighter, more feminine pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope I get this right.\" Clayface's words resonating through every muscle and bone in her body. \"This will be rather permanent. These dosages are irreversible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice faded into a chuckle, as she felt her consciousness fade. Her mouth unblocking, enough to let her breath, snatch enough air to fall asleep exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll call you Barbi... my Barbi Doll.\" were the last words to take her into the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the nightmare was far from over when she woke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Struggling to sit up, she found a massive bust was to blame.

The sound of racing feet came from the house. They faded into nothing, as the Freddy parked the van, and applied the brake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the front door, the gang realised that they'd need to split up. The house was larger than they'd realised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelma looked around. Scooby and Shaggy stood beside her. The pair of them were trying to look every direction at once. Their frantic darting heads didn't calm down until Scooby smelled food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>R</i>itchen.\" he said in his odd way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head at how quickly the hungry pair could forget a danger. Daphne and Fred were heading up the stairs of the abandoned house. Each step drawing a pained creak from the wooden floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found herself wondering how she'd ended up with the two goofballs, while Daphne and Fred ended up as a couple, <i>again!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging at the inevitability of it all, she followed them to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe candlestick lost it's spectral glow just before the door opened. As Velma entered she found the pair of them ransacking the cupboards in a hunt for food. In a house that had been empty for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plentiful spider webs, and general run down state of the house didn't dampen their determination. Resigned to a long wait, Velma knew the boys weren't going to give up searching any time soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moon was on the wrong side of the house, so the only light in the kitchen was reflected from the greenhouse glass in the garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the candlestick, she briefly wondered if it was an antique. It was certainly heavy, as if it were made of silver. Blowing the dust off the stub of a candle, she hoped they'd be quicker if the kitchen was better lit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking her matches, she lit the various candles around the room. But Shaggy and Scooby seemed oblivious to her aid. In the feeble light she went to the window, and looked at the base of the candlestick. It might have a stamp on the bottom. But nothing was clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning it the right way up, she struck her next match and lit the candle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt flared to life, and Velma felt the world change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked, and in that instant the kitchen vanished. Looking around she saw Daphne holding her hand. She felt ... wrong. It was hard to say why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the revelations came:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was taller than Daphne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer clothes were different, she didn't like wearing white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand looked bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it came together, her fingers trembled as she felt the ascot at her neck. Letting go Daphne's hand. Or rather shaking it loose, Daphne confirmed that she was now a he.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that He was Freddy. She was in Freddy's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA high shrill shriek came from downstairs, a cry that she recognised instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Velma!\" they both said at once.</span></div></div>",

The feeling of Daphne's craving for a protector made a wicked idea bubble to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep you safe.\" she growled (a little too deeply, and gruffly) pulling Daphne in closer. She felt Daph's stiff nipple against his own chest, and the sound of his own words shifting between them from direct physical contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She probably just lost her glasses.\" 'Freddy' joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapping an arm around Daphne's shoulder, he kept her close to his side. The pair walked quickly downstairs. Velma was finding a new distraction intruding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked down the creaking stairs, he felt the blood pulsing in his veins, ... and elsewhere. Looking down, he took in the flat chest and rather clearer, the way his trousers were now hanging. He felt Daphne's nerves, her quaking body, the softness of her breasts, the slimness of her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Fred' wanted to keep this body for as long as possible. He was sick of Fred's prejudice, the real Fred always dismissed her. Now the shoe was on the other foot. He could now be the dismissive one, acting as if <i>Velma</i>'s glasses, <i>her </i>short-sightedness, was a reason to dismiss her concerns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Fred' steadied his nerves, through that door was the kitchen, and his former body. Surely she'd want to be back in his own body as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door creaked as the pair of them entered. Shaggy and Scoob, were kneeling beside Velma's body.

So you didn't see the Ghastly Ghoul?\" he directed the question to Shaggy and Scooby, both shook their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Velma did, check... look out the windows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daph' hold her hand, talk to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne sat beside the groaning girl.

George Blake explained each item as they passed, though they were labelled in Arabic, English and French. Velma was getting restless, as they approached the end of the tour.

Answering the phone, his voice was hushed, and hard for anyone to make out. Fred wandered towards one golden scarab, and Daphne was happy to give her father the privacy he wanted. The grumble from Shaggy's stomach, meant that soon he'd be grumbling himself. As if harmonising, Scooby's belly rumbled and rippled in sympathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelma joined Fred eager to show her expertise about Ancient Egyptian. Happy to take over with George otherwise occupied. She gave a potted history of each item and their significance.

It was his turn to get lunch for their meal break back at the scrapyard.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile walking to his truck, he decided to stop by Pop\u2019s Stand that was just in the middle of the street for a quick read of comics. He approached the stand to see an old gray tom manning it while reading the newspaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Pops!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHiya, Chance!

They recently popped up in the market too.\u201d<br>\r\nHe used a boxcutter to open the top and revealed the contents, then spreading them on the counter. Comics galore from superheroes to fantasy to sci-fi to more genres were laid out in plastic sleeves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith them in plastic sleeves, you can\u2019t take them and read them for free you know.\u201d Pops said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah, I know.\u201d Chance grumbled. Though there were many interesting options to choose from and he can afford at least one for just $3.99. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind/genre of comic book did he get?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
