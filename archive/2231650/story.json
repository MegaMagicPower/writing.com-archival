            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alright to start us off, I'll do several story lines of my own:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory one: The pet avengers and the raccoon - The pet avengers have a very memorable encounter with Rocket raccoon which begins a long and lasting friendship, of sorts. Until the Raccoon decides to make better use of the avengers as belly fodder, than companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory two: a pet avenger unleashed - the often maligned supercat Hairball decides to strike out on his own. But first he'll need to get rid of some, or all, of his teammates in the best way a cat can. X3 if they won't show him respect, he'll make sure they pay...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory three: Dex-starr kills the pet avengers - DC's very own super powered animal, the red lantern kitty Dex-starr, finds himself in the marvel universe. And he's none too pleased or impressed at what he finds there. A team of soft, innocent super animals, they fill him with such rage. There's only one solution to that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory four: In the belly of the beast - An alternate ending to issue #3 of the original series, which saw the pets end up in the belly of the giant whale Monstro. But this time, they will not escape. </span></div></div>",

The raccoon in question clucking his teeth in apparent boredom, staring out at the dots of stars around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZe zame boring Zaturday, Comrade?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket gave the dog beside him a weary, withering look, then took another swig of his beer. He could never tell if Cosmo was making fun of him, sarcasm didn\u2019t translate well through the telepathic cloud they communicated through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZeems Zat Zay\u201d He chuckled, mocking the dog\u2019s thick Russian accent to an eye roll from the canine \u201cApparently the infinity stones are back in action, so maybe that\u2019s something to check out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlready found, comrade Rocket\u201d Responded Cosmo, scratching a little at the fishbowl helmet around his neck \u201cby a new team....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRocket looked at him, then back at the computer panel as several pets flashed on the screen. Some familiar, some not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised an eyebrow. Looking at the cat, the dragon, the dogs, the tiger, the falcon and the oversized frog on the panels before him. And before he could stop it, his belly gave a low rumble. Rocket ignored it, for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a matter of fact, it was hard for Cosmo to figure out how the raccoon felt about this at all...</span></div></div>",
