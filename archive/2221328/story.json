His days include watching the latest show, working out, and practicing magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yeah, Fukase isn't a ordinary human. The redhead is actually descended from a group of powerful mages taught by a great sage. Thus Fukase possesses an arson of magical abilities, one if which is casting ancient spells. These abilities came in handy as he often takes care of those who mess with sacred artifacts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne favorite spell is the shrinking curse, capable of shrinking full grown figures to the size of thimbles. This usually was followed up by a crushing stomp of Fukase's leather school shoe. Despite his smug carefree nature, Fukase dosen't give mercy to those who mess with the sacred relics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuro<br>\r\nAge: Unknown (appears 17)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.furaffinity.net/view/36245811/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.furaffinity.net/view/3624581...</a> )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: An ancient being who actually happens to be the God of Darkness. Despite his title, Kuro is usually very chill and has filled the role of a NEET in modern times. He has a friendly yet lazy demeanor as he sometimes morphs into a cat to take better naps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he often spends his time playing video games and appearing carefree, Kuro actually has many deep regrets. In the past he had given some of his power to a group of wizards called Dorians. He grew a brotherly friendship with the first king of the Dorians Berwald, however this tragically ended as the wizard sacrificed himself to save his people in times of persecution. Kuro felt grieve and extreme guilt as he wandered the world for centuries, wanting to see his friend again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finding Roni, the reincarnation of Berwald, Kuro became uplifted again and dedicated his lifecto protecting the wizard. However, Kuro rediscovered his old power. Specifically the ability to grow giant, not to mention Roni had recently learned i time travel spell. Perhaps some revenge was in order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver<br>\r\nAge: 15<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: Born in Victorian England this blond boy was shown the cruelty of the world from a young age as his father was a selfish drunkard. Eventually taking control of the Colewood oil company, Oliver showed no mercy to the people foolish to think they could control him and his money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange occurrence happened as Oliver recieved a visit from a future scientist named Will. Although he orginally was going to crush him like a bug, Will convinced him to let him live as his future knowledge could help the Victorian boy. Oliver agreed, though he showed his authority by making Will his pet, not only doing as he said but also pampering his always smelly noble feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs of recently Will has constructed a size ray, while Oliver could now literally crush his enemies, he had much more ambition in store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni<br>\r\nAge:18<br>\r\n( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.furaffinity.net/view/36245835/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.furaffinity.net/view/3624583...</a> )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBio: A Finnish-american boy who usually spends his time watching anime and playing games. He is friendly albeit shy at times but believes everyone can use kindness in their life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoni is in fact the current reincarnation of his ancestor Berwald. He is one of the few Dorian wizards left in the world, having abilities that are elemental, psychic, and reality warping in nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he prefers the micro role, Roni can gamble in the role of a giant. Though it is rather awkward when he has to ask someone if he can stomp a building. Still it's a work in progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a calm sunday, the sun was beating down on the town as spring ended and brought the heat of summer. In a large yet comfortable house was a redhead relaxing in the A/C.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukase was dressed in a pair of turquoise trousers and a black tank top that was almost glued to his muscular torso. Despite the A/C, Fukase had just gotten back from a jog and was feeling the effects of the head. His underarms were drenched in greasy sour stench to accompany the b.o emitting from his muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead didn't seem to mind the smell as his arms were thrown over the couch. On the coffee table were his large feet, a pair of grey soaked socks plastered on. They were three days old, since Fukase lived alone he tended to hold off laundry until it was all emptied. The socks cotton was filled with cheddary foot sweat and dried lint, being smashed into it after the jog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukase looked bored as he skimmed through the T.V. \"Geez can't believe they postponed the next season, was one of the few gems among the trash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the redhead stopped as he caught a breaking news report. He narrowed his eyes as the Totem shrine that laid in the forest appearing vandalized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This is the third sacred site to be tampered with this month. Along with shattering the fox statue. The offerings laid at last night's festival were reported missi-\"</i>, Fukase shut off the T.V, throwing his feet onto the floor, feeling the crummy sock squelch under his weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, this isn't some jackass pulling a prank, needless to say I'm feeling a bit pissed.\", Fukase flicked his nose before walking towards the entrance of his house, his sweaty muscles pushing against his tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting his leather shoes, Fukase smirked toothily as a shadow covered his eyes. Pushing his foot into the shoes immediately made the socks heas up the grimy and cheesy sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukase walked out into the heat, his heels clicking with each step. \"Looks like i can't have a bug free weekend huh?\"<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nDeep in the forest a series of trucks were parked in a formation. Men in combat equipment were walking around carrying various statues and shrine adornments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukase looked down from the branch he sat on, sweat dripped down his body as the humid air hung in between the trees. The redhead chuckled as he whipped his forehead. \"Thanks mother nature, I'm definitely gonna put this sweat to use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a piece of crumbled paper out of his pocket, Fukase snapped his fingers. The paper suddenly formed into that of a golden statue, shimmering as it stood in Fukase palm. The redhead smirked as he tossed the \"statue\" below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile a man patrolling the area suddenly rose his rifle as a thud came behind him. However the man blinked as out of nowhere a gold statue had appeared in the discarded piles of leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey i think we missed one!\", the man called to the others loading the truck. A man in a white button up walked over, heet out a gruff noises as he checked the papers<br>\r\nIn his hands. \"The hell, the to...tum..fox shrine said there was only one statue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over, the men signaled the others to approach. Around thirty men exited the building set up as they joined the armed men around the statue. A few other Casual men looked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell corporate never said anything about a gold statue.\", a man in jeans said. \"Mark you get anything on this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark the button up, shook his head. \"Nah i didn't get anything, but hey less work! Cmon let's get it packaged.\" The man ordered signaling one combatant forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever just as the armed man touch the statue, it dissolved like burned paper. \"W-what the!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukase sneered as he had the 50 members of this organization in one spot. Putting his fingers together, symbols suddenly appeared on the tree circling the men. Confused yells echoed as the area was engulfed in a red flash. And like that the men vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukase hopped down each branch, before landing and crunching twigs beneath hid leather shoes. The redhead hummed as he slowly walkes up to the trucks, his steps were slow as he didn't want to step on anything...important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he reached the circle, Fukase suddenly heard a crunch and squelch beneath his foot. Lifting up his foot showed his leather sole now with a red plat, traces of combat clothes were visible among the blood. The boy sighed. \"Geez i already broke one\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlanting his foot on the tire of one truck, Fukase grinded his foot to scrap off the flattened corpse. Looking towards the pile of his illusion paper, Fukase grinned as he saw the multiple specks of shrunken men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh not bad, first time shrinking that many shrimp.\", Fukase cockily grinned as he began reaching down his sweaty palm wide open.<br>\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>\r\nMark groaned as he opened his eyes, the ground definitely wasn't the forest as it was smooth and cool. He was in a building of sort, did corporate pick them up after they passed out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up, the man looked around the room, it was surprisingly bar with a rather poor looking bed. The white walls looked rather thin and....plastic?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting those thoughts aside, Mark made his way out the door, it being rather light. Upon walking out, Mark widened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis men were wandering the streets, scooping out this new area. The road they stood on looked more like paint then concrete and the cars next to buildings had a similar plastic look. The sky also was lit but was colored a strange orange tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, you're awake!\", an armed man said jogging up. \"We scooped out the area, this doesn't resemble any town we took residence in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark furiously scratched his head. \"Damn it just where the hell are we?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a shake began to travel through the ground, unlike an earthquake it wasn't random but more rhythmic. It grew intense, had the buildings not been plastic they surely would've collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow suddenly cast over the city, the shaking was finished whale sized leather shoes crashed on each side of the city entrance. A chuckle boomed down as the earthshakers stood before the puny buildings and people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, Mark swore his hair turned white as two towering legs led up to a muscular torso. On top was a smirking redhead with his toned arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukase looked down, excitement and pride filled him as he now technically had a city under his control. This has been a toy city he had as a kid, now it had use once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you shrimp awaken, for a second thought i would to crush a few of you ants to get you moving.\", Fukase smirked as he bend down, hus trousers hugged his large rear and his chest puffed out as he put his hands on his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukase smugly grinned as he watched the men watching speechless. \"Hm you seem to have trouble adjusting to Crushville.\", the redhead leaned down licking his lips. \"They say a town's name represents it's residents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Fukase welcome them?</span></div></div>",

Fukase's eyes darkened and the giant gained a sinister grin. \"I'm the one who's gonna punish you for your sins against the sacred sites around town.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately for you specks your crimes warrant a death sentence.\" Fukase chuckled evilly. Mark stared up at the smug giant who had captured them, his men were looking around in terror at each other. Some had curled up in little balls on the plastic streets and were crying in complete fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukase enjoyed seeing how his declaration had broken some of the men's spirits already. Might as well keep going, really twist the knife so to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, you fucked with the wrong shrines little maggots. So the only punishment fitting the crime is a horribly humiliating torture and death. You're all screwed, hahaha!\" Fukase boomed with wicked laughter that rang in their ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please, please let this be a joke!\" Mark wailed as he fell onto his knees and clutched his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukase licked his lips, \"No joke, little runt. You're all going to DIE here, and trust me I ain't gonna make it quick.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears streamed down Mark's cheeks as he tried to block out the cruel booming voice. The group seeing their leader a blubbering mess felt their morale sink lower than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerror and panic began to set in...and Fukase stood up to his full height...loving how they gazed up at him in fear.  Feeling the sweat he built up today still present all over his torso and his feet which were still clothed in their rancid, squishy socks...Fukase knew what his next step would be..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But that would come later, his torture would be sweet before he effortlessly squashed these ants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiggling his toes, Fukase felt the gunk residue built up. It had dried up but grew gooey as it had time to heat up in his sock and show. Stepping on the heel of his leather show, Fukase sighed as his foot was relieved of the tight stuffy hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry boys you're gonna have to wait to have more fun.\", Fukase teasingly said to his shoe as he slid it to the side. Lifting up his socked foot, the redhead licked his lips as he grabbed the hem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look closely worms, this is one of my stompers. I bet i crushed more vermin then you make money. Your sins will have my feet be your god, it can and will put you beneath it.\", the boy spat down as he began to pull off the sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukase sighed as the crummy sock peeled off his sweaty sole, the pinkish sole was smeared with cheddary sweat. Steam was visble as the warm skin was let out of the stuffy sock. As the sock slipped off, Fukase kept his toes clamped together, as if holding something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing the sock onto a building, the tinies yelled out as the sock squelched and let out a burst of chessy wind. The mist of sweaty foot musk flooted the oxygen, Mark's eyes burned not only from the frantic tears but the bitter stench he breathed in. Coughing as he inhaled the thick air, Mark looked up hopelessly as Fukase smugly smirked and crossed his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm guess some sweaty fog was on the forecast.\", Fukase's eyes grew a shadow as he grew teeth with his smirk. Raising his large sole already dripping gallons of sweat to drop and splash, Fukase spread his toes. \"They also mention lint rain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing his toes together, Fukase hummed satisfied as he felt the gunk in his toes grouping up. With a flex of his toes Fukase set a few globs falling to the streets like bombs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men all yelled as the balls of grey gunk fell, one ball splattered on a car getting it to tip over. Mark stood up just in time to witness a grey ball falling directly above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No-not like this!\", Mark attempted to sprint but was too late as the gunkcrashed and pinned his legs to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny coughed as the cheddary funk was rising from the splattered gunk. The stench was growing stronger and unfortunately a few of his men were also trapped by the lint rain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukase casually continued rubbing his toes, this was just a portion of what he had planned. These runts would breath in the funky smell of a spirits anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext...</span></div></div>",

Humongous globs of toe grime and funky discolored lint splattered the buildings..and the mini people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to get to shelter!\" One of the men cried out as he raced towards a plastic skyscraper. Following his lead, some of the men ran inside the toy building. \"W-wait! Don't leave meee!\" Mark yelled as he attempted to free his legs from the sludge trapping them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was of no use, the thick toe muck was like a powerful adhesive gluing his legs to the painted on road. Fukase of course took notice of the leader's predicament and grinned in smug triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How sad, looks like your fellow ants have abandoned you. You're all alooone~!\" Fukase singsonged cruelly as tears once more filled Mark's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I would say all alone...except I'm here.\" Fukase grinned evilly. Planting his bare foot down outside the city, the giant lifted his other foot out of its shoe...and lowered the smelly socked foot dangerously close to Mark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, the poor man thought he was done for. However, Fukase wasn't going to crush the helpless man..yet. It was too much fun to break these insolent bugs down...and break their spirits and torture them in various ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukaske's socked sole stopped inches from the trapped man's face, the stinking ceiling of soggy cotton filled Mark's nostrils with a giant's foot odor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was only going to get worse as it had before, Fukase slowly began to peel the sock off. His grin widening, he boomed down: \"Enjoy your strip show...maggot!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBit by bit, the stinking, pinkish sole of a giant teen was revealed...right in Mark's face. The poor man turned green as the close proximity of baring was allowing the stench to bust out and infect his olfactories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt, the sock was pulled off of his toes...and promptly deposited directly on top of the skyscraper that the men had taken refuge in. \"Oops...my bad...\" Fukase sarcastically said with a sneer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreams of disgust and horror at the smell emitted from the covered skyscraper, they were trapped in there now with a dirty sock fumigating the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFukase spread the bulbous toes of this newly freed foot...right above Mark. Cheesy slime and lint slopped down all around Mark, he screamed as he knew his luck would run out...and one of those globs of toe gunk would smack him in the face and begin to smother him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for him, Fukase was careful not to overdo it in that manner...wouldn't want his prey to die off so soon for lack of oxygen. The stinking ceiling of foot flesh suddenly came down, gentle and slow, so that Mark wasn't crushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, Fukase delicately placed his reeking sole onto Mark's trapped form...and had his big and second toe on either side of the runt's head. Mark looked pleadingly up at Fukase's smug face high above...a toe on either side of his head...and a horridly steamy and rancid toe crevice in his face. </span></div></div>",

The tinies gagged and were now at the mercy of Fukase's smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant sneered as he lightly squeezed Mark's head, squishing the gooey gunk over him and shoved the smell more in his face.

As he delivered a roundhouse kick to the punching bag, it swung so hard it fell off its hook! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops! Hehehe, sorry 'bout that!\" Diego sheepishly rubbed the back of his head with a grin. His ripped and muscular upper body shone with sweat and as usual it was bare. An almost visible cloud of body odor hung around the young fighter at all times. Who had time to bathe when you were training to be the strongest?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owner of the dojo waved him off at the apology. \"Don't worry about it, Diego. You've gotta prepare for the tournament tomorrow! Think you'll be ready?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego grinned confidently and flexed a bicep. \"Of course! This time I'll take home grand prize for sure!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't count on it! I'M gonna beat you to it!\" A snide voice called over. Diego looked over to see his green haired rival, Jose. The greenette had a cocky grin as he sipped juice at the bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah! Maybe if you spent more time training and less time sitting on your behind, <i>pendejo</i>!\" Diego mocked back. Jose didn't lose his cocky smirk, in fact it seemed to grow wider. \"We'll see who comes out on top...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dojo luckily was open all hours of the day and night, it was around 10pm that Diego finally decided to call it quits. The entire dojo had emptied out and the place now stunk of the bluenette's well earned sweat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping his forehead with a towel, he draped it over his broad shoulders and exited the dojo. \"A good night's rest is important for the future champion!\" Diego said to himself with a slight yawn. Stepping out into the crisp, cool night air, Diego could already sense someone was waiting in the shadows for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come out now!\" He ordered firmly. Out of the shadows, to no surprise of his, stepped his rival Jose. \"Hmph, so that's your plan? Ambush me in the dark out here?\" Diego glared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...you haven't even heard the best part. You're not going to be competing this time! Or any ever again!\" Jose planted his feet firmly on the ground and began to channel his aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego took a combat stance, he could feel some kind of attack coming up so he readied his defenses. To his surprise, the attack never came! Instead, Jose looked around in confusion as he began to dwindle in height! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice became a shrill squeak as he finally became only centimeters tall! Diego blinked in confusion before bursting out in laughter. \"Hahahaha! <i>Idiota!</i> You thought you could shrink me but it only ended up backfiring! That is what you get for trying to cheat, <i>pendejo!</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego's voice was like a rumble of thunder, and Jose clapped his hands over his ears as it was just that loud. He whimpered as the ground shook, the gigantic sandaled feet of his rival stomped toward him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh what a mistake he'd made! He was plucked up between the two thick fingers of Diego and brought up to his smugly grinning face. \"Maybe if you'd work out a little bit, you'd be a champion like me!\" Diego smugly proclaimed, flexing a glistening bicep on his other arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But no, you had to take the easy route didn't you <i>idiota</i>? Well, I can't let you trying to use such a technique on me just slide..\" Diego licked his lips. Jose whimpered and tears began to stream down his face, he felt so helpless..he was always so jealous of Diego...and now he was even more pathetic before the musclebound fighter.</span></div></div>",

He was so tiny that his rival turned giant's finger pads firmly held him. Diego's smirking face used to fill him with anger whenever he won, but now it filled him with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the speck between his fingers, Diego felt both giddy and thoughtful. Having your enemies be literal bugs to you was different and he wanted to teach the greenette what happens to people who fight dirty. Feeling the various drops of sweat drip down his muscular torso, Diego suddenly grinned toothily as he bounced his huge and b.o ridden pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know <i>bicho</i> i think i have the perfect way to teach you a lesson.\", Diego smiled eagerly as he once again flexed his buff arm. However, the blue haired began to stretch the arm over his head, revealing his sweat drenched side. At the bottom of his huge arm was a patch of sweat filled hairs, unlike the b.o a more sour stench began to seep out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until this trick of yours reverses you'll be helping me in my training!\", Diego stated firmly keeping his fuming armpit open and colliding it with his mighty odors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJose nervously chuckled, feeling himself cough as he got a sniff of the sour potency let out of that ripe underarm. \"O-oh like watch you workout and cheer you on?\", the tiny pathetically guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow covered Diego's eyes as he smirked. \"No <i>bicho</i>, I'm gonna use you more...hands on. As long as i have you, I'll be enjoying a living sweat rag, insole, and more. I think it's best you get on my good side and start complimenting my <i>sudor</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe greenette grew pale as the fingers holding him began to go closer to the open and fuming armpit. The sour odor was like a thick putrid air as his nostrils burned up from it already. \"W-wait come on just bring me back to the dojo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego smugly chuckled. \"Your first duty is to keep these pits nice and comfy, when i get home i expect to hear how awesome they smelled!\", the giant didn't give another second before using his thumb and jamming Jose into his sweat filled pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJose dared not yell as he was smacked into the greasy and humid wall. The sour and hot air bleed directly from the sweat glands shedding the huge drops of sweat, one of which splashed onto him like a bucket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego looked slightly surprised before smirking. \"Huh whatta you know i can barely feel you in there <i>bichu</i>! Eh dosen't matter that'll make me feel even bigger.\", the buff giant began to lower his muscular arm, shrouding the speck in a shadow. \"Hope you enjoy the ride <i>idiota</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thumb finally lifted off his back, though Jose found himself already stuck to the damp skin. The drops of sweat were acting as glue and keeping him stuck to the greasy skin. Jose looked up in horror as the buff skin lowered down, casting gusts of sour winds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the heavy weight came down, sandwiching him into the soft greasy pit with a booming <b>Squelch</b>. The warm sweat splash onto him as he was squished into the hot putrid body of his giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiego...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Hello welcome back to another interactive. Here i am to spread more macro ideas. This time i will be putting the OC'S created by me and other be in macro scenarios.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow here's the gist, an oc needs to have a good amount of characteristics. You can't just add a name and a few sentences. If you add an OC i want them to have a good amount of character to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo here's how it will go, you will introduce your character in a choice. If you can add more then two choices then feel free to add two OCs or more. Make sure there is a choice for another OC to be added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk so rules.<br>\r\n-The macro content is Male macro, the big guys are guys. <br>\r\n-Do not do anything mature with a underage character. As a rule of thumb OC'S who do mature stuff should be 18 and up. <br>\r\n-Crush, vore, smell, feet, Etc are all good, however keep scat and piss out<br>\r\n-Have at least 500 characters in post, no few sentence chapters!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk I hope you enjoy ^^</td>",
