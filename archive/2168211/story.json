Along with <b>Teniko</b> who's recent chapters were so great I added on them to the intro)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world became an extraordinary one when a baby was first born glowing in a hospital. Soon after that people appeared showing up all over with different capabilities. Today more then eighty-percent of the world's population registers to possess powers. Crime rates grew rampant in the streets, so the government created a new profession. One where people could arise to become superheroes. However, not all superpowers or quirks which was an easy way to call them, are all that glorious. Some have to work vigorously at achieving such a dream, and others...well others can't get an opportunity to shine really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich brings us to our two such characters, Yuuto and Mikan. The best of childhood friends, who are regularly being beset by others. Women to be explicit, that come across them in their daily lives. Causing either one of them, to go on prolonged misadventures. Besides that, they've always gotten each another's back through thick and thin. Sure, the pair can have a casual quarrel too. Usually ending with Mikan, the one winning on top being stronger. But who doesn't argue, they and by they I mean Mikan feels guilty and apologize, no one knows when that be? But they continue to this day to be together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-One Year Ago-</b><br>\r\n\"Come on! Just a few more.\" May ordered Yuu, perching on his back for extra weight. Yuu sweated, his arms striving to lift himself. He essentially brought it on himself, pleading May to change and help him vigorously train the past couple months before the hero exam. Hoping for even a small chance his quirk might finally show. His best friend Mikan got her quirk when she was only eight. Hell everyone had theirs by now in his class too, making him dread he might never to get one. Yuu couldn't take any more, and let himself drop to the floor in defeat. May lingered sitting on his back still, \"Get up you got one more to go!\" she barked. Yuu sighed maybe he had enough training for today and to continue tomorrow. \"Can you just get off of me,\" Yuu asked her struggling to pull himself out. May was feeling unusually more heavy, considering she's in her alternate persona currently. She, however, remained relaxing on top of him shaking her head in revolt, \"You can do it!\" she cheered. Yuu closed his eyes, deciding to give it his all pushing off the ground as May chanted his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay's eye's widened, watching Yuu's body glow, his skin pigment turning a whiter tint. His body was shrinking in on itself, while the rest of him changed to fabric. Yuu huffed as he felt May growing twice as heavier then moments ago. \"Ok, See I did it now get off!\" he said opening his eyes. Yuu became scared immediately, as he stared directly up at his colossal step-sister with his nose pressed in her crotch. \"What the hell happened!\" Yuu screams muffled beneath May, seeing her revert to her usual self. \"You did it Yuuto! You got your quirk!\" she expressed happily, pulling him out from under her and squishing his face into her breast. \"Alright, Quit it! I can't breathe. What am I? I bet it's something cool right,\" Yuu asked unable to move his head or body for that matter. \"Uh? I think you transformed into a pair of my panties? Perv.\" May giggled. \"Very funny! Seriously? What did I turn into?\" Yuu provokes again. \"You did though, a plain white pair, I bet you were thinking of something naughty,\" She giggled at the implication she made. \"Don't worry Yuu. I'm sure you'll be able to transform into all kind of things!\" she told him, carrying him with her towards her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA year had passed since then, and Yuu had learned that he could become not only clothes but other objects as well but only if he knew what they were up made of. He spent a while learning how to turn into different things, mostly everything in his house. What he did learn was that he could also enhance the power of anyone who wore him. He also discovered that he could accidentally transform if he weren\u2019t paying attention or even while in his sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-Present Day-</b><br>\r\nYuu and Mikan stood outside in front of the school as the day ended. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it Yuu! We might be real heroes!\u201d Mikan spoke excitedly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuu nodded \u201cyah I somehow made it through, even with my terrible mastery of \u2018Objectification\u2019 I can still smash a robot or two turning into my household couch\u201d he laughed at his misfortune, and Mikan punched him on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be like that, remember how long it took you even to get your quirk, you\u2019re like ten years behind everyone else. Well, that and you\u2019d probably be a lot more prepared if you didn\u2019t spend half your time learning how to turn into pervy stuff.\u201d She said playfully, and only half-joking<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey I can\u2019t help it if I can get a little closer than most guys, what can I say I have my priorities straight,\u201d Yuu smirked, playing into the joke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe you can perv your way into saving people.\u201d She hopped onto her feet to signify the talk was coming to a close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuuto looked up at Mikan and smiled. \"Somehow, I think it's going to be a little harder than that\u2026 but thanks.\" Mikan walked over and patted Yuu on the shoulder as he stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, we should head home it's getting late,\" Yuu said, grabbing Mikan by the arm. Her heart raced, feeling close to him, with a joyous occasion for the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The next day</b><br>\r\nOnce home, time ticked by for the poor Mikan, excitement lay deep in her heart as she hopes to get in Hero school. She might learn actually to control her powers and impress her mother. Soon falling asleep, dreams trickled in until morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikan, some women from U.A. called this morning asking if you could come in to discuss things a bus will be here soon to pick up you up,\" Asuka shouted, up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikan sprung from her bed, falling to the floor. \"Mom, you're telling me now!\" Mikan shouted back, her feet glided across the ground a hurry, combing her hair and dressing casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bus came to a stop at her household, she got on, noticing all the other prettier girls already abord. \"Hey! Ready to go?\" Yuu spoke, sitting in the way back, Mikan taking a seat next to him. \"Turns out, I might be the only male this is going to be the best - year - yet,\" he drooled. Mikan casually slapped him in the back of the head playfully,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get your mind out of the gutter. I swear you can be so creepy sometimes\" She smiled. Yuu grinned,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I saw a dude that looked like he had a mohawk of grapes for hair try to peek up girls skirts at entrance stairs to the mall. As long as I don't reach that level of creep, I think I'm fine!\" The two chatting happily amongst themselves, halting once in a while to pick up the remaining students until finally arriving at the school and heading to a classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stood around, Yuu's head filtering back and forth from all the girls. He appeared to be the only boy for sure now, as the door opened, Mikan twitched with nerves as she saw the famous Midnight standing at the end of class. She glanced over at Yuu drooling, reminding him to focus before recomposing herself for Midnight's speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, class, I'll be your teacher, Midnight. First of all, congratulations on making it to UA! I hope you enjoy your time here! Your acceptance letters are sending out as we speak,\" She gave a flirtatious wink, her eyes rolling over the class. \"My- quite a gender disparity- I suppose they wanted to avoid certain classmates joining... well- please take your seat at your assigned desk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuu went to the other side of the room, a bit far for comfort but still within eye reach. Mikan took her seat with her classmates near the back of the room. Her eyes trained to the center as a couple of girls whispered. She looked back at Yuu trying to sniff a tall blonde girl's hair, what she wouldn't give to slap him for a good moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you not in the wrong class, Kendo?\" Midnight looked outwards towards Mikan, who raised her eyebrows. Looking behind her before looking back at Midnight, she just pointed towards herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? I'm... Mikan?\" She looked confused for a moment as Midnight checked something. \"Mikan... ah, shrinking quirk? Sorry about that, well... would you like to be the first to come up and introduce yourself along with providing a demonstration of your quirk?\" The seductress tapped her foot as Mikan felt a cold sweat dribble down her spine. She gritted her teeth,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have- excellent control over it. There are also some side effects that I would like to avoid,\" She stated. Midnight sighed, rubbing her temple, \"If you can't use your quirk, then you shouldn't have been allowed into the academy... what are the side effects...?\" She quizzed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikan sighed, looking slightly bothered by the fuss, \"It's- not proven, but I might appear to be tasty at times. A dog almost ate me once and... there have been a few other times where bad things had happened. People also seem to act on certain impulses while I'm smaller but- might be unrelated.\" With a small huff, Mikan stood up. Stretching her arms a bit with a grin as she looked to Yuu, \"I do want to get control of my powers though, so I shall do it,\" Midnight smiled, directly at her. Mikan just barely managed to keep her cool as she walked to the front of the class- carefully breathing to avoid prematurely shrinking.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mikan cleared her throat. \"Hello- I am Mikan, and my quirk is shrinking. I can be squashed and stretched, but please do resist. I'm serious!\" She gave a bow before inhaling. The world grew around her, shuddering slightly at the size of things, as she disappeared in her clothes. Mikan almost fell over as Midnight slender gigantic curvy form walked over. Midnight's gloved hand plucked her up from the sky, showing the rest of the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we are, please congratulate Mikan on going first- it's not an easy thing to do with a class of new people. So- if you could-\" Midnight sniffed the air, \"Oranges...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikan blushed to shield her bare body from the others, more importantly, Yuu. Not giving too much time to think, one classmate rose their hand. Midnight pointed the girl out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teacher, What if we accidentally squash her?\" The girl stated,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should be fine, she mentioned her quirk lets her squash, do you mind if I demonstrate?\" Midnight glanced at the tiny girl who was trying to focus on growing back with the demonstration finished. Not waiting too long for an answer and wanting to move on, the giant dominatrix themed hero decided to compress the poor girl anyway. A small yelp left Mikan's lips as a force suddenly squashed her into a ball of slime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMidnight didn't see anything wrong with squashing the tiny student down. Her fingers pinched and stretched at the girl as she spoke.<br>\r\n\"See? Perfectly fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuu stood up, nervous for his friend. \"Ah- wait, teach- her smell often makes people...\" He tried to explain, but Midnight just tossed away his claim. \"I am aware of her stated side effect! But isn't proven yet\" When suddenly, one girl let out a moan, followed by another, and another. All but a few girls were fidgeting their legs, trying to remain seated. \"Teacher, she's making me starve,\" one girl yelled, \"No, wait, I need to see her now,\" a girl begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it looks like I have competition with another exuding  Hero. I wouldn't normally do something like this. But, I shall keep an eye out just in case. Yuu, right? Would mind coming up next?\" Yuu watched as the glob that was his friend placed on the Midnight's desk. He gave a little sigh before standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now announcing, Yuu! Hear to serve!\" Midnight told, putting on a show handing over the stage to hum. You choked on his words most of the girls exposing their panties from their seats, \"Hello...I'm Yuu. My power is the ability to transform, giving a power boost to those that use me. I can only transform into objects that I understand fully though... and I can't turn back until I've been used and given time to regain energy\" He grinned,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuu visioned a stool in his mind, something simple to not tire himself. But instead, he was gently floating in the air, as a pair of cotton green panties. Among the girls, half giggled, the last grunt with disgust from pervertedness. Midnight smirked devilishly, as Yuu, morph again to stool rather crudely made and not too complicated. \"Let's move him out of the way for now,\" Midnight stated, placing poor Yuu away as he protested.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Mikan soon grew back, sliding off the Midnight's desk. She dressed, taking her seat beside a couple of girls. One of their stomachs started to growl, making things a little nerve-wracking on her as she glanced over to the stool that was now getting dragged out by Midnight after some girls announce their quirks being Stink and Barrier.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Can we use the chair,\" Fumi shrugged, hopping up and activating her quirk. The chair shuddered as another Chikara, suddenly made a barrier around the two to stop the school from getting fumigated. The girl that cast the Barrier pulled a fancy pose before flicking her hear back with a huff. \"No need to thank me, I'm simply doing my job as the future class president\" She announced, giving an award-winning smile that charmed Mikan slightly. \"Yuu, let that be a lesson to you not to abuse your power\" Midnight expected Yuu to turn back, before dragging him to the side, wondering if he did need more time to transform. Which the answer was, of course, yes, as he twitched in agony.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMikan stifled a laugh, served him right for perving. She zoned out as the announcements continued. There were a couple of interesting ones that seemed like they might be trouble for poor Yuu, but hopefully, nothing would come of it, a few even terrifying herself as many others still had a turn. A shudder ran up Mikan spine as someone from behind started sniffing her hair. \"Akunaki Nanako?\" Midnight readout, looking over as the girl at the back that had been smelling, Mikan stood up suddenly, wincing as her stomach growled. The orange-flavored girl looked back at the woman behind her, feeling more nervous then she looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-here! Um- I'm Nanako, I can eat things and turn them into projectiles, I'm almost always hungry...\" She licked her lips, glancing at Mikan before sitting down. She looked ashamed for a moment before leaning over \"I'm- sorry- I don't know why but you smelt delicious. Food doesn't sit well with me,\" She noted, rubbing her tummy. Mikan returned a nervous smile, \"Haha, no problem..I mean, I've survived digestion before but I would rather not go through it again\" She looked at the practically drooling girl with sudden apprehension \"Don't know why I just said that, sorry! Uh, I have some snacks if you would like?\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne after another, a girl went up showing off their quirks, Yuu remained a stool for the period, \"Alright, that'll do... so last few, please make it quick so we can move onto the next topic. Alexis Green?\" the teacher spoke, a smirk popped up from the students. \"Hi, hi! Alexis here! Mikan-chan, your assistance, please!\" She wandered to the front. Mikan looked a little confused, carefully going to the front with Alexis. \"What..\" Mikan started, before getting tapped on the shoulder- suddenly shrinking down. \"Quirk, force activation! I can force someone to use their quirk!\" She grinned. Midnight nodded, \"Good work, but please don't suddenly use your classmates\" She bit her pen. \"Or else, punishment will be in order.\" she finished, raising an eyebrow. Alexis gulped, smiling politely for a moment before making a note to do things behind the teachers back. She almost stepped on the poor tiny while returning to her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Midnight bent to help Mikan back into her seat. But before she could, a girl skipped over, kicking her tiny from the floor with a grin. \"Oops!\" The ditzy looking girl grinned, everyone watched Mikan splat on top of Yuu. \"Honestly, be careful there,\" Midnight sighed, looking over to the two helpless students.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n The girl who tripped hid her grin as she knowingly rubbed the back of her head. \"Haha, sorry, I'm such a klutz! Good job, we saw where she landed though, or she'd be in a world of pain!\" She chuckled, Midnight gave a small smile, \"That is kind of my theme- so,\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Right, messing up on my first day! Monowasure Koi, my quirk is Forget! Um- quick example\" An evil little grin slipped through the crack as she touched Midnight. The teacher blinked for a moment, confused as she looked around the room before noticing Koi. \"Ah... wait... Monowasure Koi... quirk forget...? Jumbles short term memory... please don't use it on me suddenly,\" She stated, frowning at the girl as she bonked herself on the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Whoops! Sorry, I got way too excited!\" She smiled, bowing before heading back to her seat. On the way, Yuu noticed with annoyance, the girl making anyone that wasn't snickering forget what just happened.<br>\r\n He couldn't do much at the moment as he watched Midnight round skin-tight butt heading towards the two. Mikan formed two blob hands in an attempt at defending herself before the sadist slowly sat down with a mighty wumph. There was no sign of her as the curvy teacher scooted forward Yuu body forward, breaking under her weight.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Moving on,\" Midnight pushed the list of girl faster, breaking two of her students will, under her tone ass, all without her being the wiser. \"Alright... next up is Jurota Ranko\" Midnight stated, adjusting her seat slightly for more comfort, Yuu groaned in pain for a moment as Ranko got up. Ranko stood out quite a bit, her fur shimmering in the light slightly as she happily bounced in place. \"I'm Ranko nice to meet you! I'm like-\" Ranko stop sniffing the air for a moment, before getting on all fours and smelling towards Midnight's chair. The teacher raised her eyebrows, lifting her feet as the girl sniffed around, adding to the weight for Yuu. The beast girl looked up for a moment before suddenly jamming her face into the teacher's crotch. Her sharp teeth nipped at the squashed Mikan, dragging it out into the open before sucking her into the dripping maw. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n Mikan could only look in confusion just before the gnashing teeth started to demolish her. \"What do you have?\" Midnight grimaced, trying to grab the wolf girl, but she just skittered away- mashing whatever it was into oblivion as the teacher tried to piece things together, the stool that was Yuu and Mikan absences. She glanced at the clock, pulling Mikan from the dog girl's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Midnight looked over, \"For the love of-\" Midnight rubbed her temple more than before. \"Screw it. We're close enough. I can tell you guys are all going to be hard work..., since we've gone over the time, then I'm going to shorten this. Mikan will class president,\" the teacher walked towards the door Yuu finally formed back, \"Wait-\" Chikara spoke, getting cut off by the teacher quickly, \"You'll Vice president. Quick vote, who is unhappy with this arrangement?\" Midnight glanced over the room as Chikara and Eiko raised their hands. The two looked visibly flustered at the class, \"Good, I expect to meet you all tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone left as Yuu tended to Mikan, making them miss the bus ride home, \"I'll see you later Mikan, I got to get home before they worry,\" Yuu shouted running off in one direction. Mikan felt afraid, but she wasn't as far from home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho would you like to follow?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yuu ambled himself on through the busy streets of Tokyo, heading his way home a considerable distance from U.A. high school. \"Man, I can't wait to tell mom I got into U.A. High. She's gonna be so excited,\" he spoke out loud with excitement, imagining his mother Kazumi's facial expression. She was his only role model growing up other kids had All Might, but for him, it was always her. Yuu's father abandoned him when he was growing, so he never got the chance to know him intimately. Still wondering what he must have been like as a person? Did he have a quirk or just an average individual? Anytime Yuu questioned his mom about this she describes him by saying, \"The guy was a good for nothing person or the only thing good he gave her was him.\". Then Yuu's happy smile quickly turned upside down to a moderate frown as he remembered his new Stepmom Mao. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n It's not that Yuu hates Mao. She very sweet and is always trying her best to be a loving mother to him. But she can be such a clumsy person or obscure to what she has done. Yuu would admit in secret his mother has been much livelier since they married after she saved Mao from an exploding building. Plus, she helps out more with her in-home hero costume repair shop/laundry joint. Yuu has seen a lot of famous heroines come by his house. Mt.Lady, Midnight, Ms. Joke, even some cute girls and their moms. Yuu began dribbling over fantasizing the number of girls he imagined getting closer too. In his short pause, Yuu got the perverted idea to tell some of the girls at school tomorrow about Mao business, his mind raced with even more impure thoughts forming. But in all Mao is a beautiful person to have in his life, and she would probably want to throw a congratulations party in his honor, but in some way, he already knew something terrible would occur.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Yuu recalled a few months before the exam when the first incident happened, and he unknowingly changed amid his sleep. Yuu shifted into a similar pair of Mao panties that he threw in the wash the night before, and Mao had found him the next morning amongst his bedsheets the following day while collecting his dirty clothes. It was a miracle he didn't get caught in the act after changing back in the hamper, although it hasn't been the first time and probably not his last.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Expecting the crosswalk symbol to turn green at any moment, Yuu began thinking about his step-sister May next. She's presumably at home presently sitting in the living room watching Television or in her room playing a video game in her usual attire of an unwashed long T-shirt, panties, and socks. Yuu questions if he should withhold the news even more now. Mostly May will drag him in her room and want to cuddle him all night being so proud for him. Not that her health persona any better then she forced him into more exercise training, and he didn't want that coming home. He's lucky she enjoys being lazy more than fit.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Arriving finally home, Yuu walked through the door, expecting a quite welcome only that wasn't his case. Instead, the moment he walked in, he greeted a face full of Mao's round tush as it came crashing down upon him. Mao was meanwhile unaware and relaxed for a moment to get her bearings. \"That was a close one, thank goodness I fell on...YUU!\" Mao responded, surprised, remarking him home early, \"I thought you were hanging out with your friend Mikan?\" she laughed, still resting on top of him. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"No, I chose to come home today,\" Yuu muffle spoke softly beneath her, \"Can you please get off of me now Mao? It's getting hard to breathe!\". Mao giggled again before standing, \"Sorry about that.\". Yuu stood himself now free and breathing air, looking at the ceiling that held a half hung sign saying congratulations. Yuu, a nervous sweat form on his brow, \"You found out,\" he asked.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Of course!\" Mao proclaimed happily, \"The letter arrived not long ago, Imagine your mothers look when she finds out you got into U.A. High. She'll be ecstatic.\". Mao went back to fixing as Yuu went up the stairs towards his room, near the door. He stopped as for May came out to hug him. \"Congratulations Yuu! You're finally gonna be a superhero,\" May said, hugging him closer. Yuu gagged as the stench of her negligence, penetrated his nose. \"Thanks, May,\" Yuu said, tears in his eyes. \"Don't cry! Come on, let's celebrate by playing this new video game,\" May replied, dragging him by the arm.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Yuu quickly broke free from her grip, \"Maybe later I'm just gonna relax till mom gets home.\". Shutting himself in Yuu sat down on his be finally exiting when his mom did arrive. \"Honey! I'm so happy for you even though we haven't trained much,\" Kazumi spoke, embracing her son, \"Come on, Mao said she made you a cake.\".<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAfter eating with his family, Yuu was ready for bed almost before he felt like he forgot something which was...</span></div></div>",

He hadn't got any closer to making friends with most  of the other girls besides a brief few if he could call only Ranko one. Unlike his best friend Mikan, who spiked in popularity after being named the class president. She was currently busy being surrounded by three other girls, but Yuu knew he'd get a chance to chat later on, not that he was jealous. Sure it had only been a couple of days, but Yuu was starting to cherish the class he had assigned too. Besides himself, with all the hotties in one place, his most enjoyable part of all homeroom was his teacher being Midnight for crying out loud. He could hardly contain himself, but thankfully the opportunity to show off what he could do would be coming soon enough, and maybe he'd get to see some of the girls in a more compromising position in the meantime. He had already narrowed his favorites down from the vast list of girls in the class, and supposedly they were going to do something hero-esq today.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe pulled out of his daydream by the slapping of a riding crop on the chalkboard, Midnight was starting the class already. \"Alright my lovely little students, today we are going to have a team training exercise, you'll be paired up by random, so the lot of you get changed into your hero costumes.\" there couldn't be a more perfect opportunity to get the ball rolling as it were. Suiting up in his hero outfit (which he really wanted to redesign, honestly making it a lot like his mom's was not the greatest idea he ever had). The changing room was lonely since he was the only boy in the class, and he could definitely hear something going on on the other side but either way, he was first up to draw lots which meant he was the first one to be designated a team and start the day's demonstrations. Unfortunately, the exercise would have Yuu acting as the Villian this time, protecting a massive (cardboard) doomsday device. Lucky for him, he was getting to do it with one of the girls he had wanted to spend more time with, the cutie on the villain team with him was none other than...</span></div></div>",

The short girl had chosen to make her hero costume a Konoichi outfit, maybe it was just the pop-culture version but the almost not there skirt had spandex shorts under it and she had fishnets lined with shuriken that teased just under the skirt making it an eye draw. She seemed to have some sort of chain under her purple sleeveless fabric. Yuu were clearly checking her out at this point and by the time he got to her face, it was curved into a huge frown.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Are you done or would you like to wait until the hero team gets here before you stop trying to undress me with your eyes.\" She tapped her foot and Yuu gulped, she was going to be a tough one to get hands-on time with if he could convince her to use your secondary power at all.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Yuu stumbled on it \"What uh, I can turn into a thing and-\" She held up her hand<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Right right your Quirk just turns you into an object, I can use that.\" She shimmered for a second and then there were four of her, they started talking at the same time [b]\"Okay, Yuusless Turn into the biggest rock you can, we're making a trap\"[/b] Yuu started trying to argue but now that it was four girls and not just one the pressure of her glare made him agree. Yuu made himself now a big rock suspended above the area just before the doomsday device. The girls recombined after Yuu was set up and ready the real battle began, She sent her clones to scout the lower levels, and continued to keep in touch with them via tiny communicator. She was clearly much more prepared than others were in general. The problem was when one of them radioed in as captured. Things quickly went downhill from there as your opponents burst through the door. Ito Ai and Kirin Suki the strings from Ai's fingers had one of the clones captured but Niko was sure of herself her other clones came back to fight and it was kind of cool to watch. Ai though managed to slam Niko into herselves and they recombined, Suki even triggered the trap, Yuu thought he would hit her but suddenly a wall of light blocked his path causing him to start rolling towards Niko instead.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Yuu panicked and changed back as you landed on top of her. The force impacting her barrier had knocked Suki back as well but Yuu wasn't going to be able to prevent them from getting the to the papermachie device. \"Niko, I can make you stronger so you can stop them but you've gotta-\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n She cut you off once more \"Do it then!\" Yuu panicked and choose the first thing you could think of grabbing her butt under the shorts you disappeared having changed himself into a thong to go under her spats. Yuu was assaulted by her sweat immediately and clenched together by her tight buns, Yuu could feel her touching the front of his body.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"What are you doing!\" Not that Yuu could respond to her now that he was buried under her spandex and booty flesh. but then she felt it, a slight surge in power and then both of you multiplied. It was hugely disorienting to feel like Yuu we're in more places than one and now that they were moving out of sync the toned muscles of the petite girl were roughly rubbing Yuu in a variety of ways. It wasn't entirely unpleasant but all the shifting was making it hard to focus on how nice her shapely behind was.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n In the end, even though Yuu didn't get to watch the rest of the fight Niko must have somehow beaten them, but walking back to the room she didn't seem to realize just what had happened to Yuu. She was picking at his strings trying to figure out why her cloths suddenly had such an itch.</span></div></div>",

He might not recall what her quirk was at all but the dark purples and short skirt really worked for her. She didn't seem too concerned with preparing though and You couldn't resist asking why. \"hey uh, Fumi? what exactly is your plan for keeping them out of here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skunk themed hero in training looked back at Yuu and rolled her eyes \"Well I'd already be doing it if you weren't just standing right there, I don't want to hit you with my quirk and get blamed for knocking out my partner Yuu.\" You gulped guessing that her power was probably destructive in nature, completely missing her theme's vibe you made a rash decision to get a little closer to those curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can uh, boost your power sort of but I need to be pretty close\" Fumi looked back skeptically and raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"how close exactly?\" this was the moment of truth, not that anyone could hear the conversation so you decided to just go for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wear me when I turn into panties.\" it got really quiet for a moment, almost as if she wasn't believing what was being suggested. but then she shrugged deciding why not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright 'Inani-mate' if you think you can handle it, I'm size large\" you nodded egarly and visualized just the type of panties you thought would go with her outfit, pure white and then suddenly you were them. It would take about five minutes to gain the stamina to change again, at least after you were taken off. The next thing that happened was her current panties being slipped down her legs, clearly at one point they had been the same pure white untouched color as you were now, but they were slightly damp with sweat and yellowish although you couldn't tell that was unnatural from the outside. \"oof that pair was reaching the end of it's use anyhow, I was hoping to find a guy that could put up with my quirk, didn't think you'd offer to get so close to the source though.\" She laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to protest that you were rethinking your decision when the smell actually hit you as soon as her skin touched your fabric. it was like the worst sweat smell you had ever smelled but if you were licking it instead. you gagged a little but that was enough time for her to seamlessly get you most of the way up her Thicc thighs, she had clearly given you the wrong size because she was now struggling to pull you around her booty effectively silencing you for the time being. The snapping of your waist band around her hips lead her to stretching, every fiber felt ready to burst at any moment, but you somehow kept yourself together. she hummed above you \"perfect fit you really do know how to make a girl happy huh yuu, I will not be needing these anymore!\" and subsequently tossed her 'old' panties out the window of the building.you of course could only hear her saying that and guess what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud speaker sounded that now that the Villians had had ample prep time the heros would be entering the building. \"alright, lets see how that boost of yours works mr.panty\" and that's when things got much much worse, if her just getting near you was bad enough that you would have watering eyes now that you were wrapped around her ass and the sweat was soaking into you thoroughly you're sure that it would kill you if you weren't just fabric right now. The smell of Fumi's rump was permeating the whole building and soon enough Villian team was declared the winner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you your classmate had no intention of taking you off until they got back in the changing rooms, after all she only had one pair of panties with her and you were just gonna have to deal. you tried to complain at her about it but talking like this only succeeded at causing a wedgy, something that neither of you wanted. It seems everyone was more concerned with watching the next match than weather or not Fumi had actually taken you off or not. You could hear the skunk themed girl humming to herself as she wiggled to get comfortable in her chair, grinding you underneath her. You didn't know a girl this pretty could have smelled this bad but you were starting to think that you should think a bit more about who's underwear you offer to be.</span></div></div>",

You really wanted something to focus on that wasn't the smell and so unintentionally you focused on the ass that was dominating you, it wasn't all that painful as her booty had a lot of padding you could even admire how you were sinking into it a little. you had almost convinced yourself that you couldn't smell anything when she slightly lifted off of the chair and farted a little. The gas brought you right back to where you had been, the hot air reminding you of the putrid stench coming from that soft rear. You shouted but because of your positioning you succeeded at making at best a muffled protest that only caused Fumi to grind slightly into the chair to remove the weird feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally blessedly she lifted off the chair and it seemed like they were going to change now, she would surely take you off then right? Then another thought passed through your mind, you were going to the girls locker room! a chance to see all the beauties in your class half naked, things were starting to look up. Unfortunately for you when she shed her hero outfit she hooked her fingers around your waistband and pulled you down just slightly, \"Hey, funny story\" she was whispering and you couldn't see anyone else around her. \"I kind of don't have another pair of panties with me. Hold out till I get home yeh? Thanks.\" You tried to scream at her to not pull you back up but by the time any noise came out it was muffled by her jiggly ass. She took her finger and scratched at you giving herself a wedgy and bringing you much farther into her crack, there was a whole layer of sweat that you hadn't even touched that soaked into you when she did that, causing you to gag because much more than smelling it you could taste it now. \"Calm down dude, I know you're excited to spend more time down there but I need to focus and that feels tingly. I'll scratch if you need to stop it okay.\" She said that as if you were just agreeing with her and she had no idea that she stunk to high heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were forced to endure the whole day as Midnight didn't even question where you had gone and you learned basically nothing due to Fumi constantly fidgeting with you. You weren't sure what was going on after a while, one of Fumi's farts managed to make you pass out even through your massive tolerance while inanimate. When you woke up you found you had managed to transfer your face outwards during sleep but you could still feel yourself wrapped around the Jiggly flesh. You tried to make out your surroundings before talking to Fumi obviously she was in her own room in her underwear reading. What you saw was nothing short of a horror story for panties, strewn all over the floor were dozens of pairs of formally white panties torn by being worn thin with excessive sweat, all of them long dried up your sense of smell suddenly came back and it hit you like a ton of bricks. you coughed and spooked Fumi who flipped over and muffled you immediately looking around and finding nobody she rolled back over, you needed her to take you off so you could go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fumi! It's me Yuu I'm still your panties!\" she was much calmer this time leaning over her shoulder to look at you and talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeh, I almost forgot, I wanted to tell you when we got home but I totally ran through all my good pairs, I'll need a fill in till I can go shopping I'm sure you wouldn't mind you know considering you volunteered and all. Oh and like be careful with being noisy too if my mom finds out that I brought a guy home, especially as underwear you know touching important bits she'll go berzerk on you.\" That sounded less than good if only Fumi wouldn't smell so bad this might even be a desirable situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Fumi you've gotta take me off I can't just stay panties like this without calling home. And your smell-\" you started<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IS FINE. and you knew full well what my Quirk was when you asked to be my panties, I flipped you out so we could talk but if you're gonna make this hard for me I'll gladly turn you back the other way. If you don't shape up your attitude by tomorrow I think I'll do just that.\" She huffed and rolled over turning off the light, clearly done with the conversation you only hoped she'd be more sympathetic tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately by the time you woke up Fumi had already been moving around for some time, you could see her half dressed in the mirror but your vision was being pinched quite a bit. You tried to say something to her but it only just barely caused a vibration with your body, you noticed the problem right away. Your body had been dragged into her crack over night and she hadn't even bothered pulling the wedge out effectively silencing you on accident. She was getting dressed for school! you wanted to yell at her but in her frenzy she threw cloths on over you and was running out the door on her way to school. She was about half way there when she finally got fed up with the wedgy you were giving her and absent mindedly pulled you around her cheeks again. The familiar weight settled in and you almost wished you were still a wedgy as the light sweat from her jogging was added to your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fumi!\" She jumped but calmed down when she remembered where you were again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeeze don't scare me like that. And don't talk while I'm out in public what if someone was around?\" She said as if you were worried how emberrased she would be wearing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you were gonna get new panties! I don't know how much more of this I can take.\" You begged immediately regretting it as the terrible smell from yesterday came back full force now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I SAID I needed to go shopping. When do I have time to do that between classes, house chores and homework? Shopping is a weekend activity. And I'm flipping you back over if you keep complaining.\" She started walking again, as if the conversation was over. You had to get help so you waited until you could see other feet walking beside hers and started to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey I need-\" and then you were cut off by Fumi pulling up and wedging you deep between her cheeks in an attempt to silance you. True to her promice as soon as you were at school she ran to the bathroom and flipped you to where all your senses were shoved inward towards her ass and then slipped you back up. no facing her ass the smell was even worse and she was just skipping off to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for them to notice that you weren't attending though and Midnight could only turn to Fumi for answers. If you could have actually heard her lie you would have thought she was coming up with it all day yesterday because she somehow convinced your teacher that you were doing special quirk training but could legitimately still pay attention as you were still technically 'in' the class. Of course your grades were likely to suffer because of this but Fumi was determined to keep you as panties for the next week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't get to think about much else besides Fumi's ass in that time either, how much it wighed, how it smelled, the way her sweat tasted. It even felt nice sometimes but she didn't sit on soft things much. The only time you could hear was when she was standing and she didn't do that often, so you got sippits of Fumi's home life and gossip at Gym time but other than that it was constant ass and after six days of it you were starting to wonder if she was ever going to let you go until... an image of all the panties on her floor flashed into your mind causing you to tence up across the soft flesh. This motion somehow was the catalyst for reminding your captor that her panties, while very nice feeling, where alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey panties! good news it's the weekend! and you know what that means..\"</span></div></div>",

You could however give a little encouraging squeeze, an action you had learned the smelly girl liked, and truthfully it was one of the better parts about your stay as her panties. \"ohh, I know you'd rather stay but everyone's only going to buy that special training story for so long. I'll definitely let you do this again if we have pairs sometime though, you're like so great as panties.\" Of course you wouldn't agree to it, unless she learned to tone down her Quirk a little. It probably would take a dozen tomato baths to get the smell off of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou weren't free yet though as she got dressed to go to the mall, and unfortunately she decided it would be easier to walk than ask for a ride. You couldn't be bothered to be mad though because after a whole week of nothing but ass you'd finally be able to breath some fresh air, so you happily jiggled along with the ample booty. Of course the first thing she was going to do wasn't strait to the underwear, she was a girl at the mall after all but you'd decided it was fine, Fumi was going to set you free so drinking her gross sweat for a couple more hours would be nothing. She went to the food court first, then browsed around window shopping for hours, revealing the gas from her choice of Mexican throughout the whole trip. You quietly reminded her of your presence through the whole ordeal, unintentionally prompting her to lay more gas into you, but at this point you were almost nose blind to her sent, constantly surrounded by it as you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fateful moment arrived though, you heard her shuffling around and locking a door, your salvation as she pulled you down to her ankles giving you the view you had admired a week earlier and had been treated to a few times in the last weak as she used the bathroom. This time was different though she had a few pairs of lingerie in her hands that it seemed like she was going to try on. They weren't the low quality things you had seen scattered around her room, although there was a package of those off to the side, finally mercifully you were slipped off her feet and brought up to the mirror. Just as you had thought, Fumi's ass had ravaged your pantie form the formally white exterior of your body had been dyed yellow with her sweat, and you were soaked. You could even see the beginning of wear and tear right where your face had been wedged in her crack. as if to read your mind she said it out loud \"looks like my big ol' booty did a number on you, let's hope you can hold out till Monday at least Yuu.\" She laughed like it was a joke \"Kidding kidding, but at least till we get back to my house, I haven't bought this stuff yet, and these fancy ones are just to try out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had learned at least one thing, and that was arguing with Fumi would only lead to more torment, so instead of responding you just let her set you down and try on the different panties. You weren't about to just let her put you back on however, summoning all the force you could you tried to activate your Quirk, thinking about turning back until a skimpy black number landed on your face and broke your concentration. In an ironic twist your quirk activated and you were a copy of them, you could feel as if your body absorbed the sweat and got rid of it as your new body was fully intact and clean. The change managed to be noticed by your captor who went wide eyed from the event.\"Yuu what happened, why did you change like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to formulate a response that would appease her but before you could even come up with it she seemed to come up with something of her own. \"Oh I get it! you want me to have some nice panties for when you can't be down there so I should replace you on the shelf and take these panties so you can sneak out later. It's a risky move but for a poor girl like me your sacrifice wouldn't go unnoticed, alright.\" She pulled the tag off of the real panties and expertly replaced it on you, right over your mouth so you couldn't tell her what a terrible idea this was. Your timer was reset now so you couldn't really change at all right then and she was already sliding the thong up her legs, and you were suddenly thankfully that was the one she thought you wanted her to wear and not you as the thong. She was practically prancing out to place you back on the hanger, seemingly unaware that pinching those parts of your body would prevent you from shifting until you were released. You couldn't even see what price you were, but you had a feeling this wasn't going to end too well for you.</span></div></div>",

You waited for her to get close, she was browsing after all before you made your move, shaking the hanger you managed to fall off the rack catching her attention. Her hands grazed your body letting the sweet sent from her calm you as she massaged your form. She looked at the price and decided that since they had jumped out at her she could treat herself, they felt particularly comfortable. You could only celebrate internally as the absolute goddess of a woman unknowingly saved you from having to explain yourself to a stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got to wait a good while though as midnight finished shopping and you were brought back to her house, you were still restrained but you could hear her fishing around in the bags for you, and finally when you were out you got greeted to an amazing view of the mature woman stark naked you were practically hypnotized by her still perky breasts before she ripped the tag off of your face allowing you to talk once more. \"Wait ms. Midnight! it's me Yuu\" she was startled of course, but you had already realized your miscalculation when she brought you back to her face, it had a sadistic grin on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A simple pair of panties being one of my student's? how exciting ahh! you seemed comfortable at the store but now!\" She pulled you off the hanger and stretched you between her hands bringing you slowly to the floor. this was the exact opposite of the situation you had wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, can't we talk this over\" She slipped a foot into one of the holes. \"I mean I'm not just a pair of panties\" she put her other foot in and started to lift \"Please I mmmf\" you slid between her cheeks now only able to shout muffled words into her jiggly flesh. you tried to shout more but Midnight pushed you farther into her crack before taking a seat on her bed. you could feel the wetness from her crotch starting to seep into your form but oddly the scent was much different, as if midnight rather than a nasty smell produced a sweet one. Still as much as you lusted after your teacher it was odd to feel her fingers now rubbing herself through your body, her other hand presumably on her breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started talking again now but with demands! \"Keep struggling, those pathetic struggles are so hot.\" You tried not to contribute but when she started making sexy noises, the rubbing was starting to feel good for you as well. you Shuddered, your whole body managing to barely stimulate her but she was shouting for you to keep it up so your body obeyed and as you felt the flood hit your body you surrender and blacked out from the amazing feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could feel movement midnight was moving around getting dressed or something, you shuddered letting her know you had woken up. she grased her hand over your body lightly. \"Ah good I was worried for a while, panties, now that you're mine you'll be required to be attending me as long as I wear you. Start with those little struggles, ahh, that feels nice... Today I'll be..\" </span></div></div>",

He glanced at the time, and thankfully there was enough left to get the job done. He raced down the stairs entering their little home store from his kitchen backdoor. Once inside, Yuu noticed how much Mao turned the once small shop into a ligament business. There were so many bags from actual hero costumes to their real clothes. It was a veritable gold mine for him, as he then discovered further that Mao separated according to gender, and from clean to unwashed. Yuu had tears forming in his eyes with luxury, quickly digging through some of the girl's belongings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't figure out the lot of them, as Mao did her work by number system rather than name tagging. But the small few he did know by heart were of pro heroes. The first one was of Uwabami, which surprised even Yuu the most, considering her celebrity status. She could probably afford over one hundred washing machines and fifty dryers to the three Mao's currently owned in the shop. But then again Yuu thought, maybe she just like privacy and a particular way she likes her clothes handled. Yuu couldn't hold his urge as he unsealed the bag to peek inside, her maroon dress with scale-like details was resting on the very top, even after a wash Yuu could scent her perfume surfaced on it. He tried his best to get a proper study of the size and details, as he never knew when he gets another chance, before looking at the rest to remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuu drooled as he found one of her undies, a skimpy pair, that even his daydreams gave him almost a bloody nose. Moving to the next bag, filled with light blue gear, the giant cat claw gloves resting on the top, Yuu knew meant they belong to a Wild, Wild Pussycat member. The outfit had well-hidden stitching that Mao's prized for producing, Yuu could see al the fine detail put into repairing it, even her tail was in the bag, which Yuu always imaged another pervy way it could apply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last of the two bags Yuu curiosity brought him two was a white leotard and purple thigh-high boots, that to him almost resembled like socks. He knew right all of this belongs to the strong female hero Rabbit Hero: Mirko, the battles her costume could tell, would drive Yuu over the edge probably. He knew she was a solo career Hero, who didn't believe in the help of others, but what he wouldn't give to be one if not both of her boots if he had better control over his quirk. Finally, he got to the last bag, inside he thought by chance was another pro hero's outlay, it had a light-grey jacket, with some belt and wrist guards, and black knee-high socks, and short black boots. The only hero coming to Yuu's mind was Burnin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuu analyzes everything he possibly could from the hero's bags, not skipping any detail. Having such a field day perving out on the female heroes stuff, Yuu lost track of time. He quickly put everything back, forgetting to seal them in the process, as he grabbed some lady's unwashed mentionable, she had good taste as he hastily examines a dark purple matching bra and panties probably if not her favorites by the stretch marks as he threw them all in the washer then the dryer. The store alarm went off, signifying a customer's arrival, lost in a state of panic, and Mao's approaching footsteps Yuu ran to bag the clothes, tripping over the open bags and mixing the possession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMao open the back door to her shop, seeing the horrors that her stepson brought, \"Yuu! Where are you?\" she stated angerly. The customer rang the service bell, as Mao in a hurry began to mix and match what belongs to whom, not realizing that one of those clothes was Yuu himself who accidentally transformed to a similar matching piece that landed on him. \"What Mao!\" he shouted, but was stuffed in a bag with other threads that buried him. \"Sorry, Sorry, Here's your order! Thank you for your business. Please come again,\" Mao smiled, before turning around to find you. Unaware that you were heading home with none other then...</span></div></div>",

Creaking the door open you looked around for anyone in the living room, seeing that nobody was there you set your stopwatch so you could test how long it took you to change back from... ah something simple, a couch cushion. You moved the actual padding next to the couch and sat in the spot it had been, Imagining it in your head, the cushion but fluffier, more durable and suddenly you were looking at the ceiling and your watch was ticking away the seconds, the previous record ten minutes between changes now all you had to do was concentrate.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n It wasn't in the cards for you though, nearly as soon as the change happened the door to your parents room creaked open and softly closed, you recognized the panties and sheer nightgown, your stepmother, was coming out for some reason, but you couldn't let her know you were staying up late to practice, so you stayed silent. Mao grabbed the remote to the T.V. and was hovering right over your position, as soon as it clicked on her titanic ass dropped onto your cushion form, depressing slightly under the weight Mao blinked and bounced a little. \"Ohh, this feels better than usual, so soft.\" She leaned back and put her feet up, letting her full weight press into you. Apparently, Mao came out to watch a show once a week after everyone else was asleep, and for however long she was there, you had no choice but to cushion her. The feeling was different than when she just managed to smack into you while you were human, as an object her ass was dominating your whole form. every little wiggle left more of an impression of her shape into you and with the weight you were compressed but it was kind of nice feeling. That was what you thought until she farted into you, you coughed, the rancid smell dispersed through you and lingered. It wasn't the kind of thing you'd want to happen but then she did it again! filling your senses with her gas you could only cough again, making your body vibrate a little.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mikan paced herself praying that she can at least make it home for once without having another incident from her quirk. It was already hard enough being malleable for her as it is, \"Hurry up you dum light,\" Mikan stated with irritation as she repeatedly pressed the crosswalk button. She grew increasingly nervous the longer she waited, questioning why Yuu couldn't have offered to accompany her home like a gentleman. In retrospect, she could have requested him to herself instead of being in the scenario now. \"When is that boy going to get the hint and ask me out already,\" Mikan asked herself inwardly blushing. She perpetually had feelings for him since middle school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikan retained the day thoroughly, crying beneath the jungle gym in the playground on her first day after just moving. She desired her mommy until suddenly Yuu appeared, lightly coated in dirt probably from playing with the other kids. Yuu presumably was having fun when he found her there in a ball position, walking right towards her wondering what's wrong. Mikan sniffled wiping away her tears as she explained her situation. Right away, she assumed he'd have left her there to resume crying. However, by a turn of events, he stayed and comforted her. The next day he sat and ate lunch when she was sitting alone, parting up for buddy projects, and defending her from the other harsh kids. The two of them spent every day together and were inseparable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came third grade when Mikan acquired her quirk and everyone suddenly started to accept her. She became quickly popular, always having someone suggesting to hang out after school. But, she denied their offers to hang out with Yuu instead and soon she was protecting him from the other students when they got their quirks. Mikan laughed to the irony when it's supposed to be his job initially, not the other way around. She remembered another time one bully picking on Yuu and decided to confront the girl alone, which was a horrible mistake since it only concluded with her being eaten and finding out the function of the digestive system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikan giggled more from all the memories shes shared over the years with Yuu. Honestly, she might have considered not going if he wasn't going to be there for support. \"Finally,\" Mikan sighed with relief when the light finally changed. Almost near home, Mikan heard the sound of a bustling crowd. \"Hey what's going on?\" she asked a civilian running with the rest of the people gathered. \"News is Mt.Lady fighting a villain a few blocks down,\" the person told Mikan before running to the action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mt.Lady Huh?\" Mikan question about heading over to see another comparable quirk user in action it wasn't a common thing for villain attacks to occur close by her home, \"No! I got to get home,\" she told herself dismissing the idea. After another fifteen minutes of walking, Mikan was home thankful she didn't shrink because then it would have been an hour perhaps longer. \"Mom I'm home,\" she acknowledged walking in. \"Hi dear, I didn't realize you went out? Where you at Yuu's house,\" Asuka asked her oldest daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikan was not surprised her mother forget she was heading to the hero tryouts. She misremembers even the most straightforward things she is doing unless told by Mika. Sometimes Mikan thinks if it weren't for her overly sexual body or her quirk that was making guys dumb giving her the simple things in life for free then Asuka be somewhat smarter. \"No mom I was at the hero examination,\" she said with dispirits, If her dad was still around, she knows he'd be happy to hear the news following in his footsteps. Mikan almost shed a tear. She hasn't thought about him for a while now. She was only five when he disappeared. The last memory was of him coming in the room kissing before he took Mika who was crying. Did he up end up leaving her or did something happen to him on duty? The police never honestly found out, but sometimes Mikan feels like he's closely around in spirit. \"Speaking of Mika,\" Mikan realized scanning around to find her little sister, noticing from the creeping darkness of the top stairway she saw the bright redness of Mika's eyes. She had a haunting grin as she sat there gazing back the gloomy air filled around her making her like a shadow. Mikan felt terrified like Mika was waiting for her to fall into her grasp unaware. She was always up to no good like the small villain she claims to be, and won't quit on it either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way I'm falling for one of your dumb plans sis,\" Mikan spoke sticking out her tongue as she turned attention back over to her mother. \"So guess what mom I got in U.A. isn't that great,\" Mikan said cheerily waiting to see her mother in the middle of cleaning acted with no congratulatory mood. \"Hello, earth to mom! I'm going to be a hero like dad was. Aren't you happy for me?\" she announced again with even more excitement but was receive the same reaction. Mikan grew even sadder every time she comes home; it's as if she becomes even more invisible with each passing day in her own home. Mikan felt herself losing control and about to have an episode with her quirk, sprinting upstairs just dodging her little sister. Mikan locked herself in as she started her breathing exercise to calm herself. She breathed in deeply as did with exhaling and planned on...</span></div></div>",

She felt her body solidify for the most part that it could before she finally relaxed, then descending in her unmade bed from combined exhaustion. Mikan reminisced about her classmates. Many developed girls that Yuu probably be perving on during the semester, and half of which she still didn't know of there quirks. But throughout it all, she was determined than ever to be a hero with Yuu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, I brought you dinner,\" Asuka announced, knocking at her bedroom door. Mikan got up from her bed, as it was unexpected for her mother to be bringing her food to her room. \"Surprise,\" Asuka shouted, holding a stack of pancakes that where Mikan's favorite, in the whipped cream and chocolate syrup, wrote congratulations. Mikan went into tears, as she believed her mother didn't care. Behind Asuka stood Mika, handing over a drawing of the two of them fighting as hero and villain getup, as they celebrated like a family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Mikan got out of bed early, dressing for the first time in her school uniform, heading for the start of her career. Mikan strolled at a pace to hurry to school, noticing Yuu by the crosswalk they always part ways at when hanging out. \"Yuu,\" Mikan shouted, rushing to her best friend, she tried covering her blush, witnessing him dressed so handsomely. \"Ready for the first day,\" Yuu asked, with a smile, to which Mikan replied with a nod, \"Yeah, but you better control yourself around all the girls,\" Mikan pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Mikan and Yuu soon reached U.A. High, Mikan viewed all the diverse teenagers in various shapes, sizes, among others features arriving for their shot at the big leagues, as she looked to Yuu, he was drooling at groups of pretty girls chatting. \"Mikan,\" a lively voice greeted out to her in the distance, Mikan began searching for whoever it was seeing the person by the tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJurota Ranko, the dog girl, who almost ate her yesterday, she was energetic rolling around in the dirt, acting like a typical dog before running on all four towards the two, holding her bag by her jaw. \"Mikan! It's me, Jurota,\" she shouted again, with more enthusiasm, \"I missed you on the bus yesterday. I wanted to apologize for almost eating you. It's just that when I smelt you, I was reminded me of my favorite chew toy back home,\" she spoke, panting from being in the heat of the sun. Mikan saw Yuu giggling before Jurota started growling and backing Yuu away. \"Is panty-boy here bothering you, Mikan?\" Jurota asked guarding Mikan against Yuu. \"Ugh, no, he's my friend!\" Mikan quickly stated, \"Stop! Sit girl,\" Mikan yelled, as Jurota did what Mikan ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJurota stopped snarling as she sat on the ground, \"Your friends with Panty-boy?\" Jurota asked, remaining seated. \"Yeah, he's my best friend since we were kids! Also, you can stop sitting,\" Mikan told the girl, as she stood. \"Why are you calling me Panty-boy?\" Yuu asked next, to which Jurota blushed with giggles and a wage in her tail. \"Almost all the girls in our class are, after your performance yesterday. Yuu grunted \"Hey, I'm going to be able to turn into a bunch of cool things soon,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Yuu, she has a point a majority of the time you transform in panties,\" Mikan laughed along to the image. \"I knew it, Panty-boy! Panty-boy! That's your nickname from now on,\" Jurota jumped and roared, \"Hey, maybe you can help me? I have trouble finding suitable pairs with my tail,\" Jurota said, enticing Yuu with a short lift of her skirt showing a bit of her fashionable yellow pair. Yuu drooled as he stepped closer to her before Mikan grabbed him by the ear lobe. \"Sorry, Jurota! But he needs to focus on school right now,\" Mikan declared, tugging harder as Yuu cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, maybe another time, Panty-boy! I'll see you later, Master,\" Jurota replied, as she ran off barking at a bird flew over her head. Mikan let go of Yuu, \"Did she call me, Master?\" asked Yuu with confusion. \"Yeah, I think she did! She reminds me of a Kobold from some of the manga I read,\" Yuu grinned whispering in Mikan's ear, \"They supposedly give the title to the person they cherish and remain loyal to the most,\" Yuu backed away laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Mikan knocked him so hard across the back of the head he fell to the ground, forming a large red bump. \"Hey, I'm only kidding! Maybe it was an accident,\" Yuu said, treating his wound. Mikan hid her face, red with embarrassment, hoping it was just a sli[p of the tongue. \"I'm going to the bathroom. I'll meet you in class,\" Mikan told Yuu, heading inside. After finishing her business, the bell for homeroom rang, as she realized she was going to be late on the first day, and in her hurry, she entered...</span></div></div>",

Someone who she recognized from one of the qualifiers. The panting girl looked confused, turning around to the rest of the class who looked around to her. Including Eraser head who looked extremely annoyed. <br>\r\n\"A-ahh-\" Mikan froze, feeling panic seep through her. She tried to come up with some kind of response but her panic won over as she felt the world suddenly grow around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShivering at 5cm, the class suddenly started chattering while Mikan was unsure what to do. She was waiting for Eraserhead to scold her as she shivered at her size.<br>\r\n\"Hey... she's gone... Deku get up. Let's continue the lesson\" Eraser heads voice floated somewhere overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing for a moment, the sudden realization that this class didn't know her quirk set in. To them, it might of looked like she sank into the floor or teleported! She might be in the clear! A shaky sigh floated out as Mikan shakily turned to walk towards the door, not too comfortable being this size but semi glad that she seemed to escape Eraser heads wrath.<br>\r\n\"Scary- I thought for sure he was going to-\" She stopped, a small yelp got caught in her throat as the bottom of a shoe flooded her vision. \"I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPLAT<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina Ashido planted a foot firmly on our poor hero as she offered her hand to Deku.<br>\r\n\"Yoo- you floored it!

Her shoe spread out almost unnoticably from the increased weight before going back to resting. No-one heard the muffled cries underfoot.<br>\r\n\"Thanks- sinking through the floor... teleportation... maybe... she looked like she was going downwards could it be...\" Deku started, before feeling the glare of his teacher. Freezing up, he thanked Mina before returning to his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikan groaned as the foot lifted. Her goopy body sticking to it, unhappily trying to drip free as it soared in the air. She winced just before slamming onto the floor. The weight above shifted, further smearing her into the shoe as the girl pushed off for another step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlick STOMP slick STOMP slick STOMP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor goo girl knew she was getting further away from the door every step as the girl made her way to the other end of the classroom. Taking her seat at the very front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling dizzy as her clothes were slowly destroyed, Mikan hoped that the girl would get to her seat soon to give her a chance to escape. The sound of a chair moving felt promising until the girl above paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foot lifted, going higher this time as the splat soon saw the pink face of Mina looking back at her shoe. The girl looked a little confused, not noticing the desperately reforming limb trying to get her attention.<br>\r\n\"Oh- I stepped in something\" Mina spoke, the foot suddenly coming down to the floor with a wicked stomp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScraping her foot on the floor for a moment as the class was getting settled, the alien like girl soon obliterated Mikan's clothes, leaving a small mark on the floor as the goop girl writhed unnoticeable. Mina glanced down with a slightly worried look.<br>\r\n\"W-wait-\" Mikan gargled, as Mina looked over her.<br>\r\n\"Ah crud- I don't want to get in trouble for staining the floor... uh- \" She ran her foot over Mikan a few more times, spreading the rather annoyed glob around a bit.

Mikan only considered a valid excuse for being tardy on the first day to tell Midnight, as if that was least of her problems trying to get free at a snail pace. She only hoped that perhaps the girl forgot about her being stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, above Mina yawned of boredom listening to eraser head lecture about hero guidelines, she wanted some excitement and fast, remembering the little mash between her feet to clean up. She glanced under her desk, discovering the splatter lingering there not noticing any change, having no clue how she stepped in it or where it came to be at the source, nor even conceive of it being another student in a school full of various kids with quirks. She looked around at her nearby classmates quickly, before kicking off her right shoe, Mina was glad she neglected wearing socks on the first day as her foot descends on the muck to dissolve it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikan wiggled herself in hope to get free and far from dangers reach with most of her body slowly swelling back into a momentarily spherical form, allowing her the tiniest bit of movement. Still, she had made a mere inch, until a giant shoe came dropping down with a frightening boom. Mikan had only so much a chance at the looming shadow growing closer, witnessing the colossal pink barefoot head towards herself and plant itself down right on her malleable body. She made several bubbly groans as the girl's foot collided, toying with her oozy mass like dough, the odor of sweat filled her senses, like the rest of her body altered slightly darker from absorbing the mild dirt stuck to her keeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina had shivers run down her spine when her toes made contact with the odd substance below as it held a strangely warm touch, she could've sworn it was struggling as it overflowed each cranny between her toes getting them all wet and very gooey, evoking of the slime kid toys she used to love receiving by her mother. She was unaware of having caught Mikan's face between her big and index toe. The tasting of foul toe b.O running on Mikan's tongue, as Mina continued to force the tiny squishy girl to be stretched and splattered back down over and over, unable to pry free. Mina lightly giggled from the massive amusement this thing was bringing, unaware she drew the attention of the others, immediately acting causal as Eraserhead went back into lecturing. she sighed with relief getting back to listening, all while messing around with her little putty plaything, grinding the poor thing hard with the ball of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikan screamed for any potential help, her body throb from soreness and defeat, with how rough the girl was behaving out, it baffled her this pink girl had this much energy after practically doing everything into mushing her into oblivion, as the waggling of toes rocked her body, flipping it back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina hearing the little squishing sounds brought back a ton of childhood memories, it was a shame she had to come to the part of discarding the thing, as her foot began to seep acid slowly on the oddity. Mikan faced the floor sensing a tingling sensation flow across her backside fastened to the girl's foot from the base of her heel to the sole, as the sensation became a stinging burn with an increase of rancid foot odor. Mikan had no clue what in the world was happening, as she suffocated breathing in the smell, suddenly the pain quickly vanished, which she was thankful for, but she wanted the nightmarish torture to stop already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina felt the jelly material evaporate from her foothold, and not a moment sooner as Eraser Head told everyone to follow him outside. Most of the class already leaving the room as she hurriedly placed her foot back in her shoe, not observing the off coloration. In Mikan's view she felt the breeze of fresh air blow against her body, all the pressure of her captor left, conceiving herself to be standing she thought there be enough time to make it to the first period. But as Mikan tried to run she couldn't shortly realizing she couldn't partly feel any of her body, not an arm, a leg, or even a simple finger, she started to panic, as a force drove her towards the white padding of the interior shoe being shoved inside. Mina slipped her foot in, spirting to the others who were entering the locker rooms, as Mikan screamed for answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the lockers, the girls got to undressing as Mina once again slipped her shoe off, that when she noticed her little slime thing stuck to the bottom of her foot. Mikan looked back at the weird pink girl with horns, she kind of frightened her. \"Hello,\" Mikan yelled, but spoke nothing, \"Wait, what are you,\" Mikan cut off as the girl's nail dug in her. Mina huffed, \"Crap, I got the stuff stuck on my foot,\" rubbing her fingers into her foot. Obviously, her acid didn't mix well with the gooey matter as it dried to her foot sole. Mikan shrieked, as the nail continued to rub her out. Mina gave up as the others already dress began to leave, she got some progress at removing it but have to deal with it later as she shoved her legs into her tracksuit. Mikan wept having become stuck to the bottom of a weird pink girl's foot the pressure of the girl's weight crushing her more. She was tilted to see two legs passing her, before being lifted again to a boot. The wind was blowing her newly, smelling the horrid smell of sweat when she was suddenly..</span></div></div>",

The tiny girl barely gave a small shaky sigh of relief before Mina shifted her foot backwards slightly, pressing the tiny girl back into the floor with her boot before walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a little bit of time for the blob to regenerate back to normal human shape, her eyes glancing around as she realised she was smaller then before.<br>\r\n\"D-did that girls quirk make me lose a couple of centimeters...?\" Mikan shuddered, turning to hide somewhere until she regenerated her mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFLOP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething heavy fell on the tiny girl, pressing her down. It seemed like some kind of cloth. With a wince, she tried to crawl away, before suddenly feeling herself lift up. \"W.w.w.w.wait?!\" Mikan stumbled, floating away from the cloth and up to the ceiling. Her flailing body going unnoticed as Uravity continued getting changed below, slipping on her panties before grabbing a floating sock without thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to figure things out as she floated to the ceiling, Mikan could do nothing as she watched the girl grab the floating sock before gravity turned back to normal.<br>\r\n\"YAAAAAAAAHHH\" She gave a small yell, falling down from the sky. She landed somewhere with a small splat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoka Jiro looked up, a little confused as she thought she heard a yell.<br>\r\n\"Did... anyone here that?\" She asked, glancing at the girls. Tsuyu Asui aka Froppy flipped her jacked over onto her back, clicking her zip together.<br>\r\n\"Hmmm?

The tiny hero attempted to grab on, to stop herself from sliding further- only to feel the heavy jacket they trained in slam into you- causing you to drip deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe greasy skin slopped over the small figure as she flooded down. A slightly weird, moist smell in the air faintly wafted over the poor girl as she slid deeper until hitting the bra strap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling battered, Mikan just lay there for a moment, before panicing at the sudden movement of Froppy. In her attempt, she fell the other way, slipping partway between the bra strap and her back before the strap slowly grinded down into place.<br>\r\n\"WA-\" Mikan managed to yell, before getting made into a splatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach movement, however small, translated into the strap. Slowly chewing the tiny girl up before eventually spitting her out the other side. Woozy, the orange droplet barely reacted as she slipped into the panties of Froppy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Froppy gave a little 'Kero?' Her ass cheeks clenching momentarily as she felt something cold dribble down between them. Shifting uncomfortably, it felt like she was developing the worst case of swamp ass in the planet. Not wanting to leave the lecture, she just clenched hard and dried to focus, unsure what to do. Sweat from embarrisment added to the mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwamp ass was right, it smelt awful. The orange glob was sloshed out, mixing with the sweat as it was pounded into adding to the swamp ass. Mikan was not happy, her form constantly slopping between the cheeks- somehow unable to slide further as Froppy's own coating stuck her in place. Some harsh movement happened outside before the world started to tip and tilt. The cheeks spread apart quickly as the battered orange form felt itself slip deeper. It seemed like the girl had started to crawl on all fours.</span></div></div>",

She felt her body physically shrinking from her grasp as her room grew more prominent, the mere sound of the twisting doorknob filled Mikan with fear as her little sister attempted to break-in. Finally, Mika must have given up it ended, as she left with heavy foot-stomping to signify. Mikan felt her body steadying, from the relief of one crisis, but there was still the lingering one of her mother's lack of emotional satisfaction. \"Screw it,\" Mikan screamed with such fury, leaving the safety of her bedroom, taking her jacket and fleeing her home, \"They don't care about me,\" she muttered with sniffs, drying her tears away as she wandered the darkened streets, heading to the one place she wouldn't feel isolated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rain came pouring down Mikan as she was nearing Yuu's house as she walked to the entrance ringing the doorbell, she felt a little awkward to be showing up without much notice. The door began to open as none other than Kazumi stood there still dressed in her hero get up, her body and outfit sodden in sweat after a long day, and mildly buzzed. \"Mikan, what brings you here at this hour come in,\" Kazumi said, inventing her sons best friend out of the gloomy weather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to barge in, but I just wanted to celebrate with Yuu! I'm sure you heard the news,\" Mikan replied, placing her wet jacket on the hanger as Kazumi lead her to the others all gathered. \"I did and congrats to you as well! I'm so happy the two of you will be with each other in the same class,\" Kazumi related drunkenly, grabbing Mikan in a tight hold, plunging face deep between her massive breasts. Mikan's nose filled with the stench of Kazumi's body odor and alcohol, before finally let go as she Yuu. He was wearing a bargain store party hat on his head, eating ramen, with Mao and May, above them, all hung a congrats sign. Both his stepmom and sister blushed as they saw Mikan. However, Mao showed she was an extra fraction more excited to find the gummy girl over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Yuu turned around, noticing Mikan, which made him so surprised that he acted in his usual foolish oneself, spilling hot soup on himself, acting it off as best he could when running over to his friend. \"Mikan, what are you doing here at this hour isn't sort of dangerous to be out alone,\" Yuu asked, he knew she never typically came over uninspected and such a late hour. Mikan was so touched by the display Yuu showed for her safety that her heart raced, \"Oh, know you care about me after you didn't walk me home,\" she responded unsettled, giving him a good flick on the head to mask her real feeling by acting tough around him. Yuu felt the eyes of the room on him, \"I'm sorry, Mikan! I'll walk you home for now on,\" he pleads as his moms and sister giggled to the romantic gesture. Mikan joined Yuu and his family, eating and celebrating their accomplishments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night grew late as Mao and May turned in, Yuu and Mikan spent time watching TV to the point they both passed out on the couch, she was a sound asleep lying party on his chest, until he got up covering her with a blanket and went to his room.

Mikan figured that she was still around since the fight was only fifteen minutes from your house and She were right! as a matter of fact she could see her moving to her next Villain in her giant form, running quickly to catch up. The squishy girl was wheezing by the time she caught up to her hero and the Villain she was fighting. Apparently it was just a connivance store robbery but the villain had some sort of spike power, Mt. Lady made the mistake of bringing her foot down on top of him, which caused about as much damage to her as a thorn knocking the villain out but causing the Giant Hero to start falling back in surprise from the sharp pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Mt. Lady was highly trained so her plan was to change back to her regular size just before she hit the ground, Mikan however had no idea that that would be the case, only that the huge globes headed towards her were too big to dodge. her fear of the situation activated her quirk causing her to shrink at practically the same time that Mt.Lady did. The situation stayed the same, only now Nobody would think that Mt. Lady might have landed on someone. *SPLAT* Mikan were decimated by the Assvalanch, Mikan didn't think that anything had ever hit her so hard and the way she splattered out reflected that, reducing the poor girl to a goopy splatter on the back of Mt. Lady's uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe uniform was quite clingy and when she lifted up Mikan's body made a Velcro ripping noise as it was pried from the ground. The blond hero tried to look over her shoulder thinking that it was the sound of her uniform ripping, but not finding a torn shred of it on the ground she touched her ass to make sure. Mikan felt the fingers roll over her and smear her burst body even more dragging it over her crack and onto her other cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugg, did I land in water or something? This better not make my suit see through\" She complained, letting Mikan know that she was unaware it was a person she had landed on.

Except you'll discover how seldom that's achievable for our two young heroes when learning more about them. As well as, the obvious ever ongoing problem with the girls of the universe standing in their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Quick note</b><br>\r\nIf you're unknowing of the show character's here is a link I provided to the wiki page to help! :) <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://bokunoheroacademia.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Characters\" target=\"_blank\">http://bokunoheroacademia.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Characters</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Characters:<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\n<b>Yuuto Fuun (Yuu):</b> Our first main hero! A fifteen-year-old, first-year student. Yuu's an ungainly, medium height, white petite boy with light green eyes and buzz cut light brown hair. He's abnormally clumsy and pervy around most girls getting himself in all sorts of trouble including with his best friend, Mikan too. Recently discovering his quirk one year ago, it enables Yuu only to transform into any object he can clearly remember the make-up of how its made. Not experienced using his quirk quite yet, He can't control when the transformation sometimes occurs or when he doesn\u2019t monitor his reflex closely. Yuu will normally change at random in the worst time imaginable and frequently become used by whichever girls close... Yuu's only lucky that unlike many others his clothes and things come with him when he transforms, although sometimes that\u2019s more of a problem than a blessing. In addition to the other drawbacks Yuu has not committed plenty of items to memory for his transformations, and most of what he does know are everyday household items and clothes. The last stipulation on his quirk is that he remains stuck in his transformed state until he can regain his energy for another transformation either back to normal or into a different object. Lastly, Yuu's very unlucky. It's the meaning of his last name even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Kazumi Fuun</b>: Yuu's young looking thirty-two-year-old lovely mother. A natural tan woman. She has an hourglass frame with a bust size cup of 40Ds. Her smokey blue eyes show off her fun spirit in them followed with her pixie silver brown hairstyle. Kazumi's always blushing and getting embarrassed about the fact Yuu inherited her quirk. Kazumi's quirk grants her the power of changing into anything for which a situation requires unlike, Yuu she has mastered the ability to the point of rapidly shifting from object to object. Kazumi desires to help mentor her son but, is never at home to do this. She hardly had the chance to teach Yuu basics to help but she is confident that her son will become as proficient as she is one day. Today she goes by the alias \"Silver Fox\" stopping home shortly to rest before heading back out on patrol. Her costume is a decorated leotard with pantyhose, high boots, and a mask all silver toned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mao Yoshida</b> -Yuu's new hot twenty-eight-year-old stepmother. Mao's has honey tint eyes and long emerald hair. Her triangle slim body shapes her hips close to about as full as her plump ass does. Regularly finding means of colliding into Yuu's face with it.  She's a charming and bubbly person to be around. However, very accidental prone when striving to be an excellent mother to her new son. Mao is one of the many few who is quirk less. Because of this, she runs a successful hero costume business in her household during free time. Mao periodically asks Yuu for his friend Mikan to coming over. She privately enjoys using her as an incentive and a durable material source when making other hero's outfit. Mao does everything she can to secure a good future for her daughter Mayumi. For example, asking Yuu to do something with her because she thinks he is a good influence on Hana. She often forgets that she did this though and knowing May, he won't leave the room until she falls asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mayumi Yoshida (May)</b>- Yuu's eighteen-year-old, stepsister. Some say May character is a mix of two. Her real persona is lazy and unhygienic about her appearance around others. Her reaction when speaking is expressionless and sleepy. She spends most days locked in her room playing video games unless it's to come out and bother Yuu. For example, taking him into her room to cuddle him all day long. She likes him a lot but would typically never openly express that to him. She normal staggering her household as she woke out of bed. Wearing a pair of socks and a long T-shirt that covers her underwear. Her eye color is dark green with her hair in a dark ash brown frizzly comb mess. May quirk only actives when she eats citrus. When that happens, she turns into the sweetest person on the planet, cheerful and motivates herself and others to be active and clean. Should I mention she hates eating citrus? So it's rare Yuuto sees her sweeter side! Her biological mother secretly tries to put citrus into her food because she wants her to come out of her shell and start living a normal life. But she doesn't take it so well that her mother tries to change her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mikan Konna</b>- Our second main hero! A sixteen-year-old, first-year student. She's a confident, tall, pale fit girl with green eyes and orange hair regularly kept in a side ponytail. Some easily confuse her with another class student from 1-B. But, the sweet aroma of Oranges she emits out can easily give her away.  Although, Mikan acts assuring and in charge around her best friend Yuuto. She's terrified beyond belief about her frangibleness alone during periods, causing Mikan's main quirk to initiate shrinking herself down to five inches in size most times. These factors contribute to her body made of a strange malleable substance gifted from her mother's side, along with the fragrance she secretes.

In attack form, Ranko is more wolf than human as her coat thickens, extending out her jaw with full canine teeth, paws for hind legs, and razor sharp claws to match. Ranko is not always there in the head during times at school. She's chasing her tail, barking at stray cats, or just plain being feeble-minded when not in the heat of battle. That's when she can think clearly and do some work when given orders. Ranko Is friends with both Yuu and Mikan, but see's the two very differently as individuals then who they indeed are.

She is very wary of Yuu and often calls him out for perving (even if he\u2019s not) and confronts her other classmates when they ignore him.

Fumi isn't ashamed by her foul bodily smell genuinely she embraces it, and wears the same panties and socks and even unwashed school outfit from the previous days continuously. Lately, Fumi has turned bitter and rude to the people who do have to inhale it and put up with her smell, by informing them to get away if they can't stand the fragrance. For Yuu, he sees a lot of his step-sister in her but more pretty under the redolence. Mikan, unfortunately, is much closer as her natural smell can hide her noxious fumes for short periods.<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nSeat 8 Name:Funsui Sumi (both)<br>\r\nQuirk: Ink</b><br>\r\nSumi is a unique fifteen-year-old girl who always has been since the day she was born.

The noticeable change is to Sumi is her face that is now two big white eyes meaning she doesn't speak and frequently draws her emotions on or relates sign language. The only one in Class 1-C who can understand her without doing so is Ai, so they often hang out together.

Which all true seeing as she is the second most beautiful girl in the class and previously was number one at her old school with her best friend, Eiko. She has the second largest chest size of the group and hates when things don't go her exact way. ChiChi quirk (Bubble) allows her to create just a barrier around herself or others as a forcefield of multiple sizes to protect or use offensively in danger. She usually does this in an over showing flashy way that gets her caught in some trouble at most times. Since losing the title of Class President to Mikan and stuck with the title of Vice President, ChiChi holds a deep settling grudge on the squishy girl and uses her quirk to mess with her at any given opportunity along with her best friend, Eiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Seat 10 Name: Iro Rina (Yuu)<br>\r\nQuirk: Color Spray</b><br>\r\nRina is Class 1-C competitive girl, and willing to give it her all one hundred percent. Being the second tallest of the bunch, she is mostly a slim waist girl with sky blue hair. However, Rina does lack in the chest department with the waterboard cup size from everyone else.

Her quirk (Color Spray) allows her to use the coloring from her clothes into a different powerful shoot. Red for fire, Blue for ice, and yellow for lighting.

Out of annoyance knowing he's a Prev, Rumi partners herself with Yuu who can restore the color efficiently when being her skin-tight suit at times, giving her unlimited shoots although unaware she is tiring him out fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Seat 11 Name: Monowasure Koi (both)<br>\r\nQuirk: Forget</b><br>\r\nKoi is the fifteen-year-old genius student of Class 1-C. She has short platinum blonde hair and a slim rectangle body. Kio is usually the one the class would want to see when they got a severe problem or need a plan. The irony for her is she judged as your stereotypical dumb blonde when that isn't the case, and so most people don't come right to her. Koi Quirk (Forget) enables her to jumble a person memory. Where they are then misremembering the last moments, they were supposed to be doing. Koi is good friends with both Yuu and Mikan as they both are the ones who know she's a genius person. However, Koi use her powers a lot on the other girls and make them obscure when unaware they have her friends somewhere amongst on them.<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nSeat 12 Name: Tenkai-suru Tsubasa (Mikan) <br>\r\nQuirk: Inflate </b><br>\r\nTsubasa is a fifteen-year-old bratty plump girl with medium chocolate cherry hair and puffy chubby cheeks that associate with soft child-like features.

She is Class 1-C privilege owner of having the largest chest department measuring in at 172 centimeters (5 feet 7.5 inches) and 57 kilograms. She is Cheery and friendly to almost everyone and has a strong sense of justice, With her Quirk (Boost). Hikari can strengthen her body proportionally to how much pressure is on her. She regularly uses tight clothing to simulate pressure but that runs the risk of ripping often, and so she will often buddy up to Yuu to get some more durable costume choices. Despite meaning no harm by it, Hikari is usually a lot for Yuu to handle considering she often wants him several sizes too small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Seat 14 Name: Hayai Hitome(Yuu)<br>\r\nQuirk: Speed</b><br>\r\nHitome is a fifteen-year-old spunky, energetic girl and always excited to get started with whatever she\u2019s doing.

As you might guess allows her to move much faster than average, limited mostly by how much she is wearing and lose the clothing can gain her the extra speed. Hitome main issue after racing around so much is her sweaty feet problem. Which is why she is always airing out her rancid feet after by taking off her shoes, and the other classmates besides Fumi find a nuisance. She also loves making little wagers for minor favors and often gets Yuu to do them. Which is why he usually ends up as a pair of stockings so Hitome can push the limit of her quirk and not bother the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Seat 15 Name: Kirin Tsuki(Both)<br>\r\nQuirk: Light Wall</b><br>\r\nTsuki is a fifteen-year-old, large curvy hourglass girl with ripple alternating rainbow hair that performs the same features on her short tail.

She can also make a lance attack using her horn. However, using both at once gives Tsuki a significant headache, so she uses them separately. Tsuki has a major sweet tooth that over the years made her thighs and ass grow exponentially making it challenging to find a good pair of pants or more importantly panties for the matter that don't tear or rip in a matter of minutes. Luckily after meeting Yuu and Mikan, she has begun to find it a less tedious task.<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nSeat 16 Name: Yameru Eiko(Mikan)<br>\r\nQuirk: Lock</b><br>\r\nEiko is a fifteen-year-old, pear-shaped girl, and snobby imitation of her best friend, ChiChi. The two of them have been with each other since middle school, so it was no surprise the two of them stuck together, even more, coming to U.A. High. Eiko usually follows the orders given to her by ChiChi, but does get irritated at times and does her own thing. Eiko Quirk (Lock) gives her manipulation over liquids and some semi-solidified substances turning them harden mass that only she can release the hold on when she wants. Since Minkan initiation of class President Eiko discovered with the help of her best friend her powers can work on the squishy girl, and ChiChi friendship and happiness is something she takes seriously so locking Mikan in a form once is a while bothers Eiko very little.<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nSeat 17 Name: Y\u016bdaina Megumi (Yuu)<br>\r\nQuirk: Majesty</b><br>\r\nMegumi has glossy silver-white hair and a perfectly proportioned figure for her five foot six height.

Megumi power is more effective on men but can affect women if she tries. She has grown accustomed to people basically falling at her feet and doing whatever she wants, and she adores being pampered by boys, basically singling Yuu out as the only boy in her class so he should be hers. She refuses to make the first move though, merely assuming that Yuu will beg to be her boyfriend if she waits, not that she isn\u2019t continually dropping hints. She hasn\u2019t told him yet but in her mind, he is her boyfriend, and he\u2019s cheating on her if he\u2019s using his powers for other girls. Megumi can be selfish, but she thinks she\u2019s doing what would be best for Yuu, even when she needs to punish him for being \u2018unfaithful\u2019.<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\nSeat 18 Name: Taberu Machi (Mikan)<br>\r\nQuirk: Munch</b><br>\r\nMachi is a fifteen-year-old fitness girl with medium neck length brown hair and spends a great deal of her time outside of school at the gym.

The first is her never-ending predicament of having a cute little pot belly among the other weight she puts on after from the using her quirk not to mention indigestion. The second which is her more common issue a sore mouth. Which is why Machi tries keeping a pack of gum on hand that eases the pain remarkably. Machi is friends with everyone in the class and always has an explanation ready when Mikan goes missing, and she randomly starts to chew on a piece of gum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n1) Neither Yuuto or Mikan can die, so don't do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Be sure to use proper grammar and spelling. Also if you wish to write Yuu's chapters in \"First Person\" I don't mind at all. The same goes for Mikan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Make chapters more than one sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Limit the choices. After things get to two paths, it's decision time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) NO PLAGIARISM. DO NOT COPY SOMEONE ELSE'S WORK AND PASTE IT IN HERE UNLESS CREDITED.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6) If a there's a sudden development that doesn't make any damn sense, or if a chapter is nothing but a sentence long, I will delete the chapter without hesitation. HOWEVER, if it's clear that some effort is put into it, I'll kindly email you before going over and fixing grammatical or continuity errors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7) Anything involving gas/toilet stuff can apply within this story among many other things I see fit. Expect for dick growth, none of that here, please. Sorry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8) No male interactions within the story. This story is strictly FEMALES ONLY! So no Yuuto messing with Mikan, only Mikan can mess with Yuuto!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9)Any of the characters from the world of Boku No Hero Academia can still be used, but please keep rule #8 in mind.</td>",
