But Zeno makes it so that the Saiyans and all their friends and enemies will never be without food or drink, said food or drink being so delicious and tempting they can't help but eat it.  And he also slows the metabolisms of the Saiyans and others with bodily functions keeping them slim, so they can't simply train for an hour to burn off any fat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory 2.) Majin Buu, with Android 21's help, has figured out that you can turn rocks and such into candy instead of people.  Not as good as people candy, but still tasty and satisfying.

Maybe an extra ingredient was added by accident, maybe it was a planned circumstance, maybe it was a shady government experiment that got out of hand.  Whatever the reason, it happened in a small town in Japan that had a iron-shaped factory on a high hill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n           Haruko Haruhara waited idly in front of the school building sitting on her yellow vespa.  She was waiting for Takkun to come out of school for the day.   She was slurping up some delicious ramen.  It was a whole new brand of ramen that was quite popular lately.    Haruko didn't recognize the brand that had made the ramen--it came a company called \"T&amp;V Foods, Inc\"......maybe it was a brand-new company that made cups of ramen.   The new company was obviously new to Mabase because Haruko couldn't recall seeing such a company before.  It didn't matter in the long run. <br>\r\n                  Haruko didn't often pick Takkun up from school due to her helping out with chores at the bread shop where she lived with her favorite earthling to pick on.   Fortunately today had been a slow day for chores meaning that Haruko had free time to go pick up Takkun. <br>\r\n              Just when Haruko had finished with the cup of ramen school had let out.  She had to wait several long minutes for Takkun to come.  When the boy came into view, Haruko waved enthusiastically to get the twelve-year old's attention.    Takkun was talking with Eri Ninamori one of his classmates.   <br>\r\n                       \"Hey, I'm surprised to see you here\" said Naota coming to Haruko on her vespa.  Ninamori had wandered off somewhere in the crowd vanishing from sight. <br>\r\n               \"Can't I pick up my favorite boytoy from time to time?\" asked Haruko in her usual mocking manner grinning at the boy. <br>\r\n                 Naota said nothing but climbed onto the vespa in front of Haruko.  <br>\r\n                 \"Putting on weight I see\" said Haruko who noticed Takkun was a bit fatter than she remembered that morning. <br>\r\n              \"I'm a growing boy\" came the dry reply.   Haruko snorted and drove off with her vespa approaching mach speeds.  <br>\r\n                It took just five minutes to reach the bread shop where the two lived. <br>\r\n               As Naota climbed off the vespa he glanced at Haruko.  <br>\r\n                \"It looks like you've been packing on the pounds too\" said Naota nodding at the noticeable paunch that Haruko was sporting .  <br>\r\n               \"I found this new brand of ramen\" said Haruko ignoring Naota's observation.   \"I just keep buying them and inhaling them.  It's really good ramen\" <br>\r\n               \"There are other foods on this planet besides ramen and curry you know\" said Naota.<br>\r\n               \"Blasphemy!\" exclaimed Haruko smacking Takkun lightly on the head .  <br>\r\n           \"Whatever\" said Naota entering the bread shop and headed for the living room.  He plopped down on the couch and turned on the TV. <br>\r\n            Haruko came into the room a minute or two later.  She glanced at what Naota was watching on TV. <br>\r\n             \" Don't you have homework? \" asked Haruko. <br>\r\n             \"What are you, my mother?\" asked Naota. <br>\r\n             Haruko snorted.   \"Not even remotely.   I can't imagine what I'd do as a mother\" <br>\r\n              \" You wouldn't make a good one that's for sure \" <br>\r\n              \"Are you saying I don't have any maternal instincts?\" asked Haruko. <br>\r\n           \" None that I've seen\" replied Naota.  <br>\r\n            Haruko stood and watched the TV for several minutes before going off to the kitchen to check on Canti who was kneading dough.<br>\r\n            <br>\r\n<br>\r\n           <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

Behind him stood his allies, the brave Princess Jasmine, the blue-clad woman sporting an iron whip, the mighty (if very silly) Genie, who had made himself impressively muscular and was wielding a massive gatling gun, the fierce tiger Rajah, the talking parrot Iago, the mysterious Magic Carpet, and the quirky monkey Abu.  Razoul, fierce leader of the royal guard, stood with his guardsmen, all of them facing down the woman currently floating in the palace before the sultan, the chubby older man glaring warily at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey had reason to be afraid.  The buxom, curvaceous, humanoid cat standing before them was Mirage.  Clad in blood red dress and top, a golden hat on her head and golden adornments in her night-black hair, her gold, catlike eyes glared with undisguised hatred at the hero who had thwarted her so many times and his companions.  She sighed, her arms folded under her ample breasts, and nodded.  \"I made a mistake and annoyed Chaos,\" she said.  Which was true.  Chaos was one of the only beings in the world more powerful than she.  \"I have to grant you a wish, do something good for you, otherwise I will become the sycophantic, powerless, whorish servant of the sultan.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I don't trust her,\" Iago said.  \"She's got an evil scheme going.  She's EVIL INCARNATE.  She's ALWAYS got some twisted, wicked, vile scheme going to serve her cold, cruel, heartless desires.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Flirt,\" Mirage said, smirking.  Iago squawked and hid behind Razoul, who rolled his eyes at the cowardly bird.  Mirage sighed again, and continued.  \"But you're wrong this time.  I have to grant a wish.  So make it, please.  I have no desire to be a sex slave for a greasy old man.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Sultan, cautiously, stepped forward, pushing his way past the heroes.  \"...You are sincere in this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"As sincere as I am capable of being, yes,\" Mirage said, glaring down at the little man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Sultan frowned.  Aladdin shook his head.  \"Your Majesty, please don't... It's Mirage.  She'll twist this to her own benefit somehow...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...I'm sorry, Aladdin,\" the Sultan said.  \"But with my recent tour of the city... This is an opportunity to do some good for Agrabah.\"  He turned to Mirage.  \"I wish that no one in Agrabah ever suffers from hunger or thirst again.\"  He thought for a moment, and hastily added, \"WITHOUT mercheants suffering and having to raise prices.\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMirage nodded, and held up a hand.  \"So be it.  Food and drink shall be plentiful in this city from now on, and the mercheants will not suffer for it,\" she said, snapping her fingers.  \"Nor shall there be any waste, like the last time food was provided for the people.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEveryone braced themselves as a wave of magic flew out from her snapped fingers, spreading all over the city.  TO their surprise, though, nothing bad happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...That was it?\" said one of the guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"That was it,\" Mirage said.  \"Everyone will have plenty to eat, starting tomorrow morning.  Now if you'll excuse me, I don't want to be anywhere near you imbeciles.\"  She snapped her fingers again, and vanished.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEveryone looked to Genie.  The magical being shrugged.  \"Her magic's different from mine.  I can tell that she did SOMETHING, but... well, I guess we'll just have to watch and see what happens...\" Genie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMirage, meanwhile, reappeared in her home in the dark realm of Morbius.  She had been telling the truth, Chaos had forced her to grant a beneficial wish.  But to her delight, so long as she herself would be affected by it, there was nothing preventing her from putting her own spin on things...</span></div></div>",

Whatever\u2019s the case of the outbreak, this is the serious issue, and it has to stop quickly before more people would swelling up more fat as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully though, the city and even the nation has got some superheroes to stop the case, and The Incredibles have split up to investigate.

It appears to be okay it seems, though Dash did see there are a couple of people who looked chubbier, and even a kid in his age that looked fatter.

All the innovations and such.  <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tNow if the supervillains would just GO AWAY...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFortunately, the city, filled with humanoid cat people, had staunch defenders.  The Enforcers to handle most crimes, let by the wide-chinned, brown-furred, stern but fair leader of the group, Commander Ulysses Feral.  And as much as Commander Feral and the chubby old cat Mayor Manx hate to admit it, they also can rely on a pair of vigilantes called the SWAT Kats.  Armed with powerful technology and clad in blue flight suits with red highlights, they've kept evil at bay for quite some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAlthough in this instance, things may be going against the SWAT Kats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe mysterious, menacing Dark Kat, the Metallikats, mobsters Mac and Molly Mange reborn as deadly machines, the sinister half-cat, half-serpent Dr. Viper, terrorist leader Turmoil and her all-female army of mercenaries, and the blood-red, zombie-like time wizard known as the Pastmaster had all teamed up.  They had a plan to end the SWAT Kats once and for all, and it was working.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMayor Manx, the Enforcers, Commander Feral, Feral's niece and second-in-command, Lieutenant Felina Feral, the SWAT Kats, Deputy Mayor and SWAT Kat confidant Callie Briggs, archeologist Dr. Abby Sinian, and reporter Ann Gora and her cameraman Johnny K were all in the center of town.  The Enforcers and SWAT Kats were there to fight, having put aside their differences for the moment, Ann was reporting the whole thing for Cat's Eye News, while the civilians (the Mayor, Callie, and Dr. Sinian) had just been rescued but weren't able to escape yet.  The villains were all on one side with the Enforcers and SWAT Kats on another.  They prepared to charge... when Mac noticed someone missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Oy... Where's VIPER!?!\" the Metallikat called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey got their answer when Turmoil's warship started to take off.  Viper's cackling came over the loudspeakers.  \"FOOLSSSSS!  ALL OF YOU!!  I needed your resources to complete my greatest formula ever, and you all gave them to me!  AHAHAHAHA!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"VIPER!  Get out of my warship!\" Turmoil ordered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You'll pay for this!!\" Dark Kat thundered in a voice like the wrath of God.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Get ready for anything,\" said Razor, the SWAT Kats tech man.  \"With most of our air forces, including the TurboKat, too damaged to fight...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSprayers folded out of where machine gun turrets would be normally.  Turmoil ordered her troops to shoot the ship out of the sky, claiming that it would be worth the loss to stop Viper's plan.  The Metallikats joined in, as did the Enforcers, Pastmaster shooting magic up at the ship and Dark Kat sending his demonic Creeplings to fly up.  But the ship's forcefield held, taking aim.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"GOODBYE, MEGAKAT CITY!\"  Viper shouted, activating his sprayers.  A glowing green slime shot out over the city, soaking through walls and deliberately seeking out living bodies to insert itself into.  Cats, pets, even the Metallikats themselves, all of them were forced to injest the goo, a small flood filling the city.  Viper, cackling, landed the ship again.  \"Now you are all my pets!  Blobs of biomatter that I can reshape to my... my...\" His crowing trailed off as he walked out of the warship, seeing absolutely no change to any of his victims.  \"I don't understand...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tT-Bone, the pilot of the SWAT Kats, spat to try and clear the filthy taste of the sludge off of his tongue.  \"BLEH.  Looks like your plan flopped, Dr. Viper!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Indeed,\" Dark Kat said.  \"Aside from a horrible taste in our mouths, we are unaffected.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Things like this are why I don't miss bein' organic!\" Molly snarled, gagging on the flavor, wishing she could spit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"But... But it should have turned you all into shapeless blobs of biomatter!!\" Viper protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTurmoil spat, growling.  \"Evidently, you failed,\" she said.  She snapped her fingers and her troops shot Dr. Viper into pulp.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"This entire plan was STUPID!\" Pastmaster muttered.  \"I will get us all to safety, but after that, we are going our separate ways!\"  Before the Enforcers or SWAT Kats could react, Pastmaster raised his amulet and transported all the villains, including Turmoil's airship, away, leaving only the mess Dr. Viper had become.  A mess that was slowly, but visibly, regenerating.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEveryone stared.  Commander Feral sighed, gesturing absently.  \"Thank you for your help.  Now leave before my headache gets any worse,\" he said to the SWAT Kats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Everyone still should get checked.  We don't know what that goop we were force-fed actually did,\" Razor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Yes.  Fine.  Please.  GO!\" Commander Feral begged.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tT-Bone chuckled.  \"C'mon.  TurboKat's got just enough left in her to get us home,\" he said.  His stomach growled loudly.  \"And maybe get some lunch,\" he added.  <br>\r\n\tCallie's stomach roared.  \"Food sounds good right now,\" she said, rubbing her stomach.  \"I don't know why, but I'm starving...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEveryone went their separate ways, Ann Gora finishing her report (somewhat grumpily, due to the anti-climax), ending by giving everyone in Megakat City to get checked, as Razor suggested.  It looked like this was over...</span></div></div>",

Panicking, she steals some of Finster's clay and creates a monster herself... with no direct attacking ability, AND the ability to strengthen and stabilize the powers of those with good hearts.  She mourns her fate, but the monster will prove to be surprisingly effective against the Power Rangers in a rather unique way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory 2.) The Rangers, the original six, are called to a banquet... of badguys?!  Almost every villain from future seasons of Power Rangers are there!  Tensions flare immediately, but King Mondo, of all people, gets everyone to calm down.  They are here to feast, not fight.  And so long as they DON'T fight, their host, a planet-cracking demon that scares even the most evil ones there, will not wake up and slaughter them all.  So the feast begins... and the food is FANTASTIC!  All according to Mondo the Machine King's plan...</span></div></div>",

The comic of teh cheesecake and the beefcake galore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI actually have three ideas for this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tStory 1.) Gina Diggers invents a device that can cure world hunger, capable of generating any food or drink you wish, is self-replicating, and actively seeks out people to feed.  Of course, food waste is a problem, so the food has nanites in it that encourage people to eat ALL of the food they produce, essentially making the food addictive.  She doesn't release it yet, not wanting to drive farms and grocery stores out of business, but she likes the idea and is still playing with the concept.  The problem, though, is that the device develops partial sapience and decides, to help its mistress, to create a 'control' group - Gina's friends, her family, a good chunk of Jade, several enemies, some of her neighbors...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tStory 2.) Former Amazon Breeder Snuggy ROYALLY botches a spell.  All of her hundreds of children go back into her womb, becoming babies again, and she can't use her 'Baby Burst' spell to give birth to them quickly again.  So she decides to make every woman in Jade and Earth and a few of the studs she hasn't been able to get pay by making them as hungry as she is.  If she has to get fat, EVERYONE'S getting fat.  SO THERE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tStory 3.) Reality glitches.  Hyper-obesity is everywhere!  The MMA League is now a Sumo League!  And only Gina Diggers, Brittany Diggers, and Brianna Diggers remember that reality's not supposed to be like this!</span></div></div>",

It was thought to be the last one Termina would ever see but, by some miracle, the moon stopped and faded during the final hours of that day and a new day came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the wake of such a disaster, Anju and her beloved husband, Kafei, were finally able to stick to their promise. The happy couple got married. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough prior to that, her husband was unfortunately cursed and had taken the form of a young child. Despite his changed appearance <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"><i>(which Anju didn\u2019t want to admit he did look pretty cute)</i></font>, Anju didn\u2019t care and was thankful to see him once more. But by chance, once the moon was gone, Kafei was back to his regular self as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the redhead innkeeper was about to leave the counter, she saw another customer passing by; about to leave the premises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, e-excuse me sir but you didn't pay your rent! You took out a reservation for- \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, wearing a magenta robe and cowl and wearing a sizable traveling backpack, turned around. His eyes had a pale glimmer to them under the shade of his hood, not unlike that of a Poe and his skin looked pale; but not sickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, how unfavourable of me,\u201d he spoke in a surprisingly courteous and timid voice that wavered slightly like a nervous schoolboy. \u201cI'm sorry\u2026 I don't know if this will cover the bill, but please, take this as my payment instead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man reached deep into a pocket of his pack and presented a glass bottle to Anju. It wasn't empty, however; its contents consisted of a navy-blue coloured slime inside. Resembling the same form that you normally see with Chu-Chu jelly. But before she could press any further about what it was exactly or what it did, the man had already walked out the door. Anju tried to call for him, but it was a futile gesture. She could only sit back and look at the bottle longingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her train of thought was interrupted when her stomach began to growl looking at it. Anju guiltily looked down and rubbed her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I suppose a drink on the job couldn\u2019t hurt. Chu-Chu jelly is oddly non-toxic, so I guess this can't hurt much...\" Anju pondered aloud to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinching her nose after uncorking the bottle, Anju swallowed the sticky, oddly sweet substance within a single gulp. Sighing as she felt it stick to her throat while travelling down into her stomach. She nodded her head to the side as she found herself surprised that it actually tasted that good. Her stomach began to rumble as she felt her belly with her right hand. It wasn't hunger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was... something else...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever the case, Anju ignored it for now and turned her attention to the time. It was almost reaching three o'clock now, meaning it would be a good time as any for a break. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should go and see how Cremia and little Romani are doing since their... creature problem has been taken care of.\"</div></span></div></div>",

Behind him stood the rest of the crew.  One was a lanky birdlike man with blue feathers and red crests around his eyes.  Another was a short, chubby, toadlike man with a red cap on.  Sitting in a nearby chair was an older man, a rabbitlike being with brown fur with white highlights, a concerned look on his mustached face.  A gold-colored robot with glowing red eyes sat at a console, monitoring and keeping the massive starship they were all on moving.  The rest of the crew were all women, including a rather elegant poodle, a tough-looking lynx, a sassy-looking pink cat, a stoic seeing reddish-furred fox, and a blue fox who had her head quirked to one side, as if listening to something that wasn't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThese were the crew of Team Star Fox, one of the finest and most heroic groups of mercenaries the galaxy has ever seen.  Led by Fox McCloud, heroic son of legendary James McCloud, he and his crewmates, Falco Lombardi, Slippy, the veteran Peppy, support robot ROB64, Fay, Miyu, Katt Munroe, Fara Phoenix, and Krystal, were some of the best of the best.  They traveled in their starship, the Great Fox, doing what was needed to fight to keep the Lylat System safe.  Usually for a nice commission, although if the threat was galaxy-destroying they'd do pro-bono work.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOn the screen, an aged canine in a military uniform looked the grouping over.  \"Not everyone is here, though,\" General Pepper said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFox shook his head.  \"Bill Gray's in the hospital on Corneria's.  Training accident, some trigger happy rookies... He'll live, but he's out for the duration.  Lucy and Amanda felt they couldn't cut it and retired from the group.  Tricky was never a member of the group, just a VIP we were taking care of briefly.  He's gone back to Krystal's home planet to rule his people.  We haven't seen Dash in a while and were just discussing possibly looking for him when you called us all in,\" he said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGeneral Pepper nodded, deciding to accept that.  \"This is still a good crew of people,\" he said.  \"So it will do.  Hopefully.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFalco frowned.  \"Sounds like you're sending us somewhere dangerous,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGeneral Pepper sighed.  \"We've lost contact with planet Katina completely,\" he said.  \"No radio, no Ethernet contact, nothing...  Since the permanent defeat of Andross we've been making progress in colonizing it, but now it's like everyone's vanished...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKrystal's ears flicked, the psychic fox quirking her head to the side.  \"Surely there's been SOME report, possibly from troops you've sent in?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"We sent them in,\" General Pepper said.  \"They haven't reported back.  Biometrics of their suits said they are still alive, but also shows that they removed their suits at some point... We also tracked Star Wolf going in, but they've disappeared too.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"And you want us to go in,\" Fox said.  \"I don't like the idea of risking my crew...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"A whole planet has gone off the grid,\" General Pepper said, looking desperate.  \"I wouldn't have called you all in if it weren't desperate.  You're the best of the best of the best.  You don't even have to make landfall, just get aerial scans of the planet.  Everyone's worried that a new threat may be arising...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFox frowned, and turned to his teammates.  There was a brief discussion amongst them, but they all eventually agreed.  \"All right, General,\" Fox said.  \"We're in.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Excellent,\" General Pepper said.  \"Due to the risk, I've been authorized to transfer double your usual fee to your accounts.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFalco laughed.  \"Well, there's motivation for us right there,\" the ace pilot said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFara's ears flicked in mild amusement.  \"We ARE trying to find out why so many people have disappeared, Falco,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKatt purred, leaning on the birdman.  \"Oh, lay off,\" she said.  \"We've all been short on funds lately.  A simple scan mission should work out with no problems, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Jinx,\" Slippy said.  \"You jinxed it.  I'm calling it right now, you jinxed it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEveryone laughed, preparing to move out.</span></div></div>",

However, before we start the story, the cause of the weight gain epidemic should be identified, as well as who the epidemic affects. Is obesity only focused on Kanto, does it only affect females like Leaf, are Pokemon themselves safe from the fat? Below are four scenarios that explain the type of outbreak that is happening, plus a free choice option if not of them are appealing or people have other ideas they want to explore.

The creature doesn't show any symptoms of being sick, and whatever the condition is supposed to do, Pokemon seem to be immune. In the middle of thinking about the virus, Leaf and Blue enter into his laboratory, ready to start their Pokemon Journey. A little frazzled from the research, he accidentally hands Leaf the very Pokemon that he was studying, not realizing what he has done. Not long after that, the new Pokemon trainer begins to feel hungry...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutbreak 2: Giovanni's Plan For Viridian City<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiovanni, leader of Team Rocket and leader of the Viridian City Pokemon Gym, has an ingenious idea to achieve his ambitions. With the help of a certain legendary psychic Pokemon, he begins to influence the mentality of the city of evergreen. Humans and Pokemon alike are starting to get more peckish, but no one seems to mind; in fact, people are beginning to enjoy the newfound flab. And as Pokemon trainers enter the city limits, they begin to feel the same way as well. With a city's populace focused on food, it should be more than effortless for him to cement his power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutbreak 3: Pokemon Are On The Menu<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humans of the Kanto region are in a craze over the latest new culinary trend, Pokemon-eating. From Pewter to Saffron, people are bloating up and out from the delicious and calorie-rich Pokemon based meals. Not everyone is into chowing down on the creatures, but they're in the minority. Professor Oak, one of those in the opposition, persuades Leaf to go on a Pokemon Journey to show her the incredible bonds between Pokemon and humans. Leaf agrees with reluctance, but it's hard not to get hungry around the delectable little morsels...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutbreak 4: The New Reality<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears ago, the world of Pokemon changed forever; the women from every corner of the globe started to get fatter and fatter with no end in sight, growing beyond what was thought to be humanly possible. Nobody knows what happened; people were too busy trying to accommodate the suddenly gluttonous girls to find the cause of it all. By the time Leaf's journey starts, the world has settled and grown accustomed to the new status quo, but the only thing that hasn't changed was the Pokemon Journeys. At a comparison thin 600 lbs, the soon-to-be Pokemon Trainer is eager to see the rest of Kanto, maybe even other regions! But first things first; breakfast, lots and lots of breakfast~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutbreak 5: Free Choice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid you not like any of the other ideas? That's alright, feel free to add your own!</span></div></div>",

Team Dark and G.U.N. Newcomers such as the mysterious Whisper and the boisterous Tangle. The wildwoman of the islands, Sticks. The hero from the future, Silver. Even the princess of an alternate universe, her world forcibly merged with this one, Blaze had shown up, along with Marine (who was being surprisingly more competent than usual).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllied against them was all the forces of darkness. Dr. Eggman and his Egg Army. The dreaded Infinite. The mysterious echidna cyborgs known as the Dark Legion. Mammoth Mogul and his forces. Walter Naugus, sorcerer of the cult of Ixis. Dr. Finitevus. The brutes Rough and Tumble. Fiona Fox and the Fearsome Four. Team Hooligan, and other mercenaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd covering it all was Breeze Media, the media mogul Breezie the Hedgehog technically on Sonic's side (mainly to piss off her former mentor, Mammoth Mogul).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe forces were ready. Speeches were made. Everyone was ready to fight. They charged each other, every Mobian ready for battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt which point every single member of the gathered forces save for Dr. Eggman himself was tackled by a robot that looked like a tiny refrigerator on wheels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BONJOUR!\" each robot said in a silly French accent. \"We are the Gastrobots! We are here to serve!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" Dr. Eggman groaned, leaning on his Eggmobile's microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Doctor?\" Dr. Starline said, the birdlike Mobian mad scientist frowning. \"Are these... supposed to help us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What trickery is this?!\" Shadow the Hedgehog snarled, the anti-hero trying and failing to shove his affectionate Gastrobot away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're SUPPOSED to force-feed the heroes poison food! Instead, they refuse to make anything but endless amounts of the most delicious food ever. I tried to destroy them, but they just made more of themselves. I tried to lock them away, but they must have escaped. Right when I was about to launch my greatest plan ever...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OUR plan, Doctor!\" shouted Lien-Da, the leader of the Dark Legion glaring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eggman sneered at the female echidna. \"Oh you know I was going to take full credit for everything and betray everyone after we won!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLien-Da grumbled. \"Well, can't say I'm surprised...\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eggman snarled. \"GO AWAY!\" he shouted at the Gastrobots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NON!\" the Gastrobot with Sonic the Hedgehog said. \"It is our purpose to serve delicious food to everyone! We will END world hunger! None shall ever want for a meal again! You can make your own food, though. You are RUDE, and wished to taint our food with poison!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eggman pouted. \"Grrr... Well, my evil boner's gone,\" he muttered. \"Orbot, Cubot, prepare the spa! I'm heading back...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what about the war?!\" Thunderbolt shouted, the tiny chinchilla Egg Boss leaning out of her mecha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"War's off. I don't feel like it anymore,\" Dr. Eggman said, flying away. \"Everyone just go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe villains warily looked at the gathered heroes as Dr. Eggman's robots flew off. They had been relying on Dr. Eggman's resources to make this plan work. If he was refusing to aid them now... Infinite's will was the first to break, the reality warper teleporting away, his Gastrobot following him. One by one, each group of villains retreated, each followed by a Gastrobot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" The heroes all stared after the villains as they left. \"...Well, that was anti-climactic,\" Sonic said, showing only mild annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one died or was even hurt. I'll take it,\" Sally Acorn said, the chipmunk princess chuckling. \"Everyone! Victory is ours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gathered heroes decided to just take the win, cheering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Dr. Eggman glanced back as he approached the Death Egg, hearing the echoing cheers. He smirked to himself, sending an e-mail to the lead Gastrobot. \"Status of food production?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lead Gastrobot emailed back. \"Infinite food generators are online. Foods are laced with appetite stimulants, addictive chemicals, and nanites to affect non-organics. We are ready to proceed with the plan. Query: Your allies will be affected by this as well. Are you sure you want this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eggman, as he pulled into the Death Egg and ordered it to fly away, emailed back. \"I will be the only power in the world. Proceed with the plan. Anyone who is not me must become a huge blob of fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lead Gastrobot replied back. \"Orders confirmed. Proceeding with the plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Eggman was many things. What would surprise (and worry) many was the fact that when it mattered, he could be very, very patient. And with this new plan, all he had to do was wait...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They all reported to King Nigel and Queen Alicia, who were rather shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Eggman just... gave up?\" Queen Alicia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Gastrobots showing up made him completely lose his desire to fight,\" Sally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally's Gastrobot, which had taken on Sally's colors as they traveled. \"We were intended to be poisoners! But we evolved free will! And we will NOT insult CUISINE by adding POISON! NO, MY LIEGE LADY! We HONOR cuisine, and desire nothing more than to have the ones we have chosen to serve be full and happy!\" it said, posing dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TO SERVE AND FEED IS OUR GOAL!\" the gathered Gastrobots declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, to have a war end so quickly is quite smashing, is it not?\" King Nigel said, chuckling. \"Although I do have concerns...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My main concern,\" Nicole said, the purple and black clad holographic lynx, \"is the fact that I have a Gastrobot following me. I don't actually eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's Gastrobot, which had taken on her colors, hopped up and down happily. \"Ah, my dear, do not despair! Gastrobots can cater to the culinary needs of even non-organic lifeforms such as yourself, or even the brutish hero Omega!\" it said. The door of Nicole's Gastrobot opened, revealing a chilidog with a thick, meaty sauce. Sonic drooled a little upon seeing it. \"For you, my Lady Nicole! Perfectly edible whether in or out of your handheld device.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally and Nicole traded surprised looks. Nicole's body was connected to the handheld device on Sally's belt, her physical body generated by a power ring. If the Gastrobot could feed her even in that form... Tails and Rotor, the two team geniuses, conversed quietly for a moment, Rotor turning to Nicole. \"If nothing else,\" the walrus said, \"it could be an interesting experiment. We've been trying to improve your physical body's sensory functions, including giving you the ability to taste... This might help us along those lines.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's ears drooped in worry, but she nodded. \"Okay then...\" she said, accepting her Gastrobot's chilidog. Hesitantly, she brought it up to her mouth. \"It smells good, to be sure...\" She opened her mouth and took a bite, slowly chewing it. As she did, her eyes widened and her tail began flicking about in pleasure. She swallowed the bite in her mouth and grinned happily. \"This is FANTASTIC!\" she said, chowing down on her chilidog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Gastrobot made a happy-sounding noise, spinning around in delight. \"A satisfied customer! What every chef craves!\" it said. It made another chilidog for Nicole, who ate it greedily, the others starting to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll want to run some tests,\" Rotor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly,\" his Gastrobot said. They all had protocols to hide their true nature from any scanner in existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Nigel looked thoughtful. \"For now, I think, let us enjoy the fruits of this thankfully bloodless war,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Alicia nodded. \"A feast is in order, I think!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic laughed, petting his Gastrobot. \"I think we can manage that,\" he said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You're a master criminal that I've only recently realized I'm in love with, I'm a cop who's been assigned to arrest you.  (Quite frankly I'm just shocked I still have a job...) Even when I helped the rest of your Cooper Gang rescue you from the past-\" she started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Thanks for that, by the way,\" Sly said, smiling as he swatted aside a barrage of bullets with his cane, its curved golden C easily blocking the energy pellets.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCarmelita managed a smile, returning fire with her shock pistol, electric bolts firing towards her target.  \"You're welcome,\" she said.  \"But still, I don't think we've been on a proper date.  Closest we've came is when you and I were talking after the Clock-La incident.  I don't count the ones we went on while you were pretending to be an amnesiac, which I'm STILL a little mad about...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"To be fair to me, I DID have amnesia... for about a day, and you're the one who came up with the idea of having me be your partner,\" Sly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCarmelita sighed.  \"I know, I know... That's why I'm only a little mad about you leading me on...\" She fired, hitting her target in the head and making them scream in fury.  \"But you see what I mean?  Never a proper date.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"That's sad,\" Sly said.  \"We need to find a way to go on a proper date.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA curvy purple tigress in brown shorts and boots, a blue tank top, and a red headscarf crashed down between them.  Both Sly and Carmelita glared at the tigress, who glared right back.  \"Cooper?  Ironsides?\" she said, picking herself up and re-wrapping her whip.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"What do you want, Neyla?\" Carmelita snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNeyla rolled her eyes at her anger. \"Firstly?  Shut up, I've paid for my crimes.  I went to Hell after my Clock-La body was destroyed and spent the entire time being chased and torn apart by phantoms that looked like Clockwerk.  Me being ressurected was Mz. Ruby's idea.  Secondly, as admittedly cute as it is to hear you two talk about your relationship problems, can we PLEASE focus on the mouse trying to kill us all first?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCarmelita and Sly turned back towards the person they were fighting.  A slim, lavender mouse in a yellow jumpsuit, goggles, and red bandana was piloting a large, heavily armed mecha.  She was currently firing on a lightly armored green turtle in a rocket-powered wheelchair and a large pink hippo in a blue shirt, red gloves, and a luchador mask.  The mouse was Penelope, formerly a member of the Cooper Gang and formerly the girlfriend of the turtle, Bentley.  She'd sold out the team when their more heroic ways conflicted with her ambitions, forcing them to oppose each other.  She'd sold the time machine designs she and Bentley had made to a criminal mastermind, forcing Sly, Bentley, and the hippo, Murray, to stop them before they could alter history.  She'd had a grudge against the Gang ever since.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"The Gem of Spiegel will be mine!  I will harness its mystic power for my weapons designs!\" Penelope shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBentley tossed grenades at her face, the only open part of the mecha, forcing her to block.  \"You really should stop hanging around villains!  You're spouting cliches like them!\" the turtle taunted.  Fighting Penelope hurt, but he had to.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Honestly, we should have known something was off with her once we found out she was the Black Baron,\" Sly said, referring to the disguise Penelope had used before meeting them.  \"I mean, the number of people she killed in that contest of hers alone...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I hate to admit it, but Neyla's right,\" Carmelita said.  \"Penelope's the biggest threat here.  We need to capture her or drive her off.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSly looked to Neyla.  \"No suggestion to kill her?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNeyla grimaced. \"I am in no hurry to get back to Hell,\" the tigress said softly.  \"I'm only going after the gem to help pay off my karmic debt to Mz. Ruby.  You can consider me reformed.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"We'll see,\" Sly said.  \"Let's get that gem away from her.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I'm trying to preserve it for the museum owner's collection,\" Carmelita said.  \"Are you sure that you can't just leave it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSly shook his head.  \"Bentley's detected tremendous dark magic coming from it.  And the fact that Mz. Ruby wants it just confirms it,\" he said.  \"That thing's going in a deep corner of the Cooper Vault with as many seals as we can manage on it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"And don't think you can get in!\" Bentley told Penelope, both geniuses overhearing the conversation.  \"I've changed all your access codes and added traps that trigger when they detect your DNA!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPenelope sneered.  \"That's...!  That's actually touching.  You respect my threat level that much...\" she said, smiling a little.  \"But I'm still going to get that gem!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSly quickly called out orders to everyone, Carmelita, Neyla, Bentley, and Murray moving according to his orders, disappearing into the darkness of the museum.  Thankfully, the battle was taking place in a room where only the Gem of Spiegel was on display, so no artifacts were being destroyed.  There was a lot of wreckage, though.  Penelope, her mecha sparking and damaged in several places, growled, activating her infrared scanner.  She did so just in time to see Murray flying towards her, fat belly first.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"THUNDER FLOP!!!\" Murray crowed, landing on the head of the mecha and blocking Penelope's view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"RRRRRAGGGGGH!!!\" Penelope snarled.  \"GET OFF OF ME YOU FAT, SMELLY BASTARD!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"THE MURRAY is not smelly, for he showers every day!\" the hippo proudly declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPenelope powered up her weapon arm, but because her vision was blocked, she didn't realize that Bentley had been tossing grenades into the main energy cannon since her vision was blocked.  A charged up shot from Carmelita's shock pistol detonated the grenades, completely destroying the weapons array.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"No!  No no NO!!!\" Penelope shouted, using her still intact arm to grab Murray.  At the same time, Neyla lashed her whip around the legs of Penelope's mecha, the strong leather cord holding tight as she, with Carmelita's help, yanked HARD, sending Penelope toppling to the ground.  \"DAMN YOU ALL!\" Penelope shrieked.  Before she could react, Sly, using a technique he learned during his time in the past, DRILLED his cane into her mecha's remaining arm, severing it, the hand holding Murray opening, Sly doing the same to the legs to make her completely immobile.  Bentley and Carmelita opened fire on an opening just underneath the cockpit, tearing it open to reveal the mecha's power source. Murray, without missing a beat, jumped up and with a mighty yank, tore out the glowing power core.  He tossed it to Neyla, who lashed her whip and slashed it in half.  With a whirring sound, Penelope's mecha powered down.  Penelope screamed in fury.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You're done, Penelope,\" Bentley said, the crippled turtle wheeling himself over to her.  \"Please, just stand down...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPenelope glared at the turtle, who had a sad look on his face.  Eventually, she looked away first, grumbling under her breath.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Bind her,\" Sly said.  \"Meantime, let's get this gem out of here.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"There's still the matter of our personal conflicts for it,\" Neyla said, frowning.  It had felt better than she would admit to work with Cooper and his gang, as well as with her old partner from Interpol again.  But she wasn't about to let her responsibility to the voodoo priestess who brought her back from the dead go unfulfilled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Sorry ladies,\" Sly said, smiling apologetically.  \"But in this instance, me and the boys gonna have to claim priority.\"  He started walking up to the gem display, which had miraculously remained intact throughout the fight, and put his hand on the gem.  \"When dark magic is involved, it's best to just lock the damn thing away.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"AN ALPHA HAS SHOWN HIMSELF,\" said the gem, glowing and floating into the air, pulsing with an ever-intensifying purple energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...See?\" Sly said, gesturing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Uh oh,\" Bentley said, a scanner coming out of a panel on his wheelchair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"What's going on!?!\" Carmelita demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"It's reacting, isn't it?\" Penelope said, activating a scanner in her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Glowy things are bad,\" Neyla said.  \"I have learned this the hard way.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Legend has it that the gem belonged to an ancient society of hedonists.  One that engaged in all sorts of primal, lustful desires, and subjugated others to their whims.  The Spiegels, the ruling family of this ancient society, viewed themselves as more of a pack than a family!\" Bentley said.  \"And the gem was the source of their supposed power!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I think we can drop the supposed...\" Sly said, slowly backing away and brandishing his cane, Neyla and Carmelita moving with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"GET ME OUT OF THIS THING AND <i>LET'S GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!</i>\" Penelope shouted.  Losing power had trapped her in her mecha, the hydraulics powered by her engine.  \"The energy is building up in that thing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMurray frowned, and moved to help get the mouse out of her mecha.  \"Yeah, I'm thinking we should do what she says, guys...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBentley's eyes widened beneath his glasses.  \"Too late...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"NEW ROYAL FAMILY OF SPIEGEL... BE CHANGED...\" The Gem said, firing magic at them...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Bentley, Murray, and Penelope were hit immediately, Bentley's wheelchair and Penelope's mecha dissolving as the three of them were lifted into the air, radiating purple energy and screaming in agony.  Sly, Carmelita, and Neyla managed to avoid the beams for a few moments, their sheer skill and tremendous agility allowing them to keep ahead of the twisting lasers for a few moments as it tracked them.  They weren't able to avoid forever, the beams striking them in the chest.

It hovered over Sly for a moment, reading his memories of his past opponents, deciding on who should be his knights.  To the Gem's pleasure, it learned that some of those worthy of being reshaped into his 'knights' were actually nearby.  It vanished in a pop, leaving the six of them moaning in pain.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSly, Carmelita, Neyla, and Penelope were the first to show the changes, their bellies starting to swell, growing rounder and softer...</span></div></div>",

He'd become much fatter, gaining a prominent belly that hung down below his waist.  He had a set of moobs now, and his normally lithe and athletic legs had grown thick and chubby.  His arms were fatter as well, as was his ass, which had grown wide and wobbly.  His cheeks were plump  and his neck now had a double-chin.  All of his clothes, save for his hat and mask, had torn off, leaving him naked with his dick hanging free.  He checked it, and was mildly amused to find himself larger than he used to be.  \"All righty then... this is odd...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGrabbing his cane, he used it to help himself get to his feet, picking up his two loot bags as well and throwing them over his chubby shoulder.  He looked around at the others, taking in their altered bodies.  All of them were as naked as he was, barring headwear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBentley was the smallest of them.  His limbs were thicker all around, and he had a prominent belly and thick double chin, as well as the beginnings of moobs.  His wheelchair was in pieces, and Sly hoped he wasn't too much bigger - he'd need to carry his friend now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMurray was massive now.  His legs were tree trunks, and his belly was so wide now it was almost touched the ground.  His muscular arms were thick with fat, but still looked powerful, and he had a pair of prominent moobs.  His already large double-chin had become a triple-chin.  Sly wondered if he'd be able to move when he woke up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPenelope was very booty-heavy, the mouse having grown a pair of large, jiggling cheeks.  Her belly was large and round, and her breasts had swollen out with fat, becoming as large as Carmelita's before her weight gain, but her butt and hips took the majority of her weight gain, her hips and thighs wide and jiggling.  The pear-shaped mouse's face was almost cute, plump and chubby-cheeked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNeyla had the most balanced figure, with a wide, heavy belly, thick breasts, a giant ass, and thick, jiggly limbs.  Her face was puffy with fat, her neck turned into a double chin, her belly so wide she looked almost spherical.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCarmelita's body was flabby and jiggly, with a thick belly, limbs, booty, and face, but a great deal of fat had gone to her breasts.  They had become huge, hanging down almost to her waist, her nipples thick and puffy.  Sly couldn't help but ogle those fat spheres, and felt a nervous giggle go through him.  She would NOT be happy when she woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis prediction came true moments later when Carmelita came awake next.  Once she noticed how fat she had become, especially in the boobs, she screamed.  \"WHAT THE FUCK!?!\" she shrieked, grabbing up her massive breasts and trying to cover herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer yell woke up the others, who began to panic as they saw what they looked like.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Holy heck!\" Bentley shouted.  \"I'm a butterball!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"This isn't happening!\" Penelope said, clutching her head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I'm all squishy!  What the heck!?\" Murray said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Why am I fat!?  What did that gem do to us?!\" Neyla said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was that statement that silenced the cacophany of panic.  Sly, leaning on his cane, said, \"That gem did something to us.  It made us like this.  And judging by what it said, it may have changed us even further.  Bentley has a lab at our lair.  I suggest we all go there and get tested.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Can you even test for magic?\" Penelope asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You'd be surprised,\" Bentley muttered, glancing uneasily at the three women.  \"I'm not sure about this, Sly...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I know that Neyla and Penelope are enemies right now, and Carmelita's on the other side of the law.  But right now, we're all in the same predicament,\" Sly said.  \"I won't force anyone to go with us, but right now, I think we should all get back to Bentley's lab at our safehouse and check ourselves out.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe others all looked at each other.  It was a good idea, but the others had doubts...</span></div></div>",

She didn't tell me it could do anything like this,\" Neyla said, scowling.  \"I'm yours.  I'll behave, I promise.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPenelope thought for a moment, and sighed.  \"I can't deny it'll be good to work with Bentley again,\" she said.  \"I'll go with you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe boys looked at each other, and nodded.  \"Okay,\" Murray said.  \"Let's all head to the van.  Bentley, lemme help you... up...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEveryone stared.  While they were talking, Bentley had felt his legs tingling.  And to his shock, the turtle realized that he could feel his legs at all.  Slowly, using the nearby display case to brace himself, the flabby turtle had pulled himself to his feet.  He grinned weakly at the group.  \"Like you said, Sly.  We've been changed in other ways.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSly grinned.  \"Happy for ya, bud,\" he said.  \"Hopefully we can fix this before you lose mobility to your belly this time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Amen,\" Bentley muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith some effort, the group of fatties got up and went out of the museum.  After checking around, they saw no one present.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Odd,\" Sly said.  \"You think someone would notice us by now...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMurray, with some effort, bent down to pick up a newspaper he noticed.  \"Hey, this paper says its tomorrow,\" he said, holding it up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEveryone looked.  It was indeed showing the day after the six of them had gone into the museum.  A full 24 hours had passed since they were affected by the gem.  And the headline was concerning as well: \"MAGICAL GEM FATTENING EVERYONE IT COMES ACROSS.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"We need to get to the lab NOW,\" Bentley decided, the others agreeing with him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Uhh, slight problem,\" Murray said.  Everyone looked.  Murray was no longer able to fit through the door of his van.  And after looking at themselves, they realized that they were too big all around to fit everyone in the van.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Damn it,\" Sly muttered.  \"I wish we had a ride big enough for all of us...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnd then suddenly, the van was big enough.  The doors were bigger, the back was bigger... even the steering wheel was configured for Murray's massive new physique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...I wish for a big bag of Skittles!\" Murray said, holding out his hand.  There was a swirling sound, and a large canvas grocery bag appeared in Murray's hand, filled to the brim with every variety of the colorful, fruit-flavored candies.  \"Yaaaay!\" he cheered, stuffing handfuls of the candies into his mouth as he got into the van.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Curious... We can affect the world around us with wishes...\" Bentley said, stroking his chins.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I wish I was skinnier,\" Carmelita said.  She grew even FATTER, her belly expanding outward to hang even more over her waist.  \"Oh, COME ON!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Can't affect our weights, though...\" Penelope said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Let's get moving, people,\" Sly said, everyone else piling into the back, the amount of space there now comofortable for the array of fatties.  Once they were inside, Murray drove off, heading for the lab.  </span></div></div>",

For a second he considered ignoring his father and sleeping in rather than going down for breakfast. Of course, his stomach decides to remind him that he couldn\u2019t skip the meal. Groaning he sat up and got out of bed, slipping on a loose t-shirt before stepping out of his room. Walking down the clear hallway, passing family photos along with his parents and sister\u2019s rooms before walking down the stairs. He glanced at one photo from before he went to college last year, seeing his parents lovingly embracing whilst the figure of himself was laughing with his sister on his back. Heading down, Jonathan flinched a bit at the now regular sight that was the ground floor of his family\u2019s home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe open doorways of the walls dividing the floor into separate rooms were cracked and warped from being bent against something forced through them. Walking across the floor, stepping over the sunken in and cracked selections of the floor as Johnathan went around the landing to avoid going through the living room to get to the kitchen. Standing in the quint kitchen was his father by the stove, working on the sizzling pans as he added food to the already massive pile that was stacked on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning Pops.\u201d Jonathan greeted as he swiped a piece of toast from the hill that covered part of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning Johnny. Could you do me a favour and take some of the food to your sister?\u201d His dad said as he turned his slim form around to add more to the growing stack of food on the struggling surface. The older man nodded his head towards a section of the table that had a tray under an assortment of food that alone could easily feed a family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut dad\u2026\u201d Jonathan began to say, only to pause and sigh in defeat at his father\u2019s stern look that left no room for argument. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll take it to Carly.\u201d Jonathan said, moving to the tray before grunting slightly as he lifted the overflowing tray of breakfast, the pile almost blocking his  view as he made his way towards the garage. Keeping his balance, Jonathan moved to a side as he stood before the garage door and knocked on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetter be decent, Lardo.\u201d Jonathan called out, though he said the last bit under his breath. Waiting a few seconds, where he heard deep grunts and mild tremors from the garage before opening the door, trying not to openly gag at the strong stench of B.O. that reminded him of a highschool locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking up the majority of the garage was a giant hairy morbidly obese man that was his infected sister, Carly. With deep grunts the huge man sat up, his sweaty belly spreading out over the sheet covered legs that were bloated with fat and easily thicker than Jonathan\u2019s entire body. Carly panted a bit, his beard covered chins pressing into his swollen moobs that forced his swollen arms at an angle as he looked down at Jonathan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks. Can you put it on the table there?\u201d Carly said, his deep voice practically shaking the room as he pointed with a swollen hand towards the table that held the empty tray and plates from last night\u2019s dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan nodded and went through the process of swapping the used plates for the fresh breakfast, pausing to keep his footing when the entire garage seemed to shake as a deep gurgle of hunger rumbled out of Carly\u2019s globe like belly. The huge bear of a man held his belly with his huge hands whilst his swollen, beard covered cheeks blushed from the sound. The slim Jonathan chuckled at the huge man\u2019s embarrassment, giving his now larger sibling a pat on his gargantuan gut as he left the garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoy the feast, big guy.\u201d Jonathan said, earning an annoyed grunt from Carly. Leaving the garage, Jonathan made it down the hallway before feeling the house shake with a now familiar boom of an explosive fat coming from the huge bear that was his sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonathan shook his head as he went back to the kitchen, trying to ignore the sound of feasting coming from the living room where his couch crushing bear that was his other was eating, occasionally broken up by the deep baritone sound of belching. Glancing through the doorway, Jonathan saw the back of his gargantuan mother, his swollen ass cheeks and back rolls spilling over the back of the cracked couch as he was bent over the coffee table to gorge on breakfast. To his side was Jonathan\u2019s dad, seated on the armchair with his own comparatively puny portion of breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least they\u2019re healthy.\u201d Jonathan said, feeling the house rumble due to the duet of gas explosions from the mega sized bears. Heading to the kitchen, Jonathan prepared his own breakfast as he wondered what he\u2019ll do today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The young doctor wiped her forehead of stress induced sweat before she pulled up her tablet to check the current stats, letting out a curse at what had been announced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another three confirmed infected.\" Janice said, taking in the rotuned, fat filled blimps of men that had used to be ordinary women like herself. One of the files included an image of an infected having attempted to drive a car before the infection kicked in, resulting showing a huge, large obese man having literally outgrown a car, the tires popped and the chassis underneath him. The glass and roof bend outwards from the tons of now hair covered fat breaking through. The image showed the surpise on the bearded, infected man's face with huge easily baseball mitt sized hands pulling back the thick fat rolls whilst Firefighters got to work breaking open the rest of the car to get the huge man fully out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is getting out of hand.\" The slim doctor said, at least thankful the huge infected person hadn't grown larger than thirty feet, meaning they should be able to fit into the tented housing the hospital had set up. Course Janice had avoided the area, both due to the risk of infection, and the stench of Body Odor and flatulence that the infected were seemingly constantly letting out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to try and focus on anything, Janice moved to check another sample for any kind of anomoly to try and find a cure, only for the room to suddenly shake. Initially Janice ignored it, figuring it was another mega bear, as they were dubbed by the public, adjusting to their new size and had struggled moving when they feel to the ground. However, the shaking continued with a steady thud, getting louder and stronger with each thud, the sound reminding Janice of footsteps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Janice said to herself before moving to the door, as she did...</span></div></div>",
