What time was it anyway? He picked up his digital clock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2:00AM.  He looked back out his window. It wasn't raining out, in fact there wasn't a cloud in the sky as far as he could tell, so it wasn't thunder that had woke him up. He didn't see any planes flying overhead which would explain the rumble but not the flash of lighted. Ever since his neighbor Ash had disappeared things had gotten pretty weird around town.  Some people speculated the weirdness always seemed to occur every  thirty years or so like in that Stephen King Novel. What was it called?  He was too tired to think. <br>\r\nHe looked out the window  and shook his head. If  nothing happened within the next ten seconds he was going back to be--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFLASH!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Will was blown outward  from his bedroom along with the window a part of the wall. As he tumbled and Spun he managed to grab hold of a branch from the tree growing in front of the house. The action had given him just enough time to see the swirling vortex  of energy that was trying to suck him up before there was a loud snap and the tree limb he was holding broke off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't entirely sure what happened next. He'd never been sucked into a tornado, but he imagined it must be like what he was experiencing at that moment. He tumbled head over heels through flashes of greens and blues for what seemed like forever. The next think he knew he was:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The second thought was, where the hell was he? The hard boulder he was laying on should've given him a clue, but the truth was where ever he was it was so dark that he couldn't see anything. The place did smell....like Lucky Charms or Fruit Loops. It took him a moment to realize that what he was laying on wasn't rock. He broke a piece off and taste tested. It was a large chunk of dried---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the entire structure he was in was suddenly lifted upward, and then it was moving. If he\u2019d been a fan of the Twilight Zone it probably would\u2019ve clicked in what was going on. Instead he was in a complete shock when the roof of the structure was torn open with a loud cardboard sound and light streamed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking Will looked skyward for a moment, not seeing anything. Then he felt everything being lifted and then everything tipped, the contents of the structure, along with Will tumbling like an avalanche out the opened roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight into the largest bowl he\u2019d ever seen in his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoughing up dusty sugar but thankfully unhurt, he looked skyward and if he wasn\u2019t so congested from the sugary powder would\u2019ve scream up at the giant creature above him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it? </span></div></div>",

Oh, hi, Leah.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane stirred her cereal causing a Whirlpool effect. Will hung on for dear life and cried out \"PLEASE STOP!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut between Jane's attention on her conversation and the sound from the radio, his cry fell on deaf ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, I've been up for a while. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane scooped up a spoonful of cereal and held it too her mouth as she listened to the conversation on the other end of the line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I'm surprised her mother let her do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later the spoonful was in her mouth. She chewed slowly as she listened intently. She glanced at the clock on the wall and swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh My. I didn't realize how late it was. Talk to you later, Leah.\" She hung up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she just eaten Will, or was he still in the bowl?</span></div></div>",

Here, a bee would be the size of a midsize car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing he found out right away, as he climbed, that the process of climbing a oversize plant straight up wasn't as easy as it was often portrayed in those movies he watched. His legs and arms were burning by the time he got high enough to see over the lawn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Will had thought the world was big before, it had gotten a whole lot bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScaled up to who knew what scale was a building. A building that was meant to house giants. He was either still dreaming (Doubtful from the feeling in his arms and legs) or he'd found a one way ticket into the Twilight Zone. The more he looked at the immense building, Will  couldn't help but think it looked familiar. He studied it more closely, where had he seen it before. Then his eyes went wide as something in his head clicked. He knew the building. More importantly, he knew who lived there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No freak'n way....\" he gasped.</span></div></div>",

Will couldn't help but saw this house somewhere in a show he watched before but couldn't put his finger on it, what was it? He also remember the people who lived in a home like that but all he could remember was a family of five. \"I don't seem to remember the names of those family but from what I know...they don't seemed to be completely human.\" he said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe take another at the house and wondered if it's a good idea to go into that home for safety. He doesn't want to end up getting stepped on or even eaten that's for sure. Suddenly, he heard a rumbling sound coming from his stomach. He must be hungry by now but unfortunately, there's no food around this back yard however. At the house, he saw two back doors that leads to the inside. In his mind, he remembered that one of these doors leads to the kitchen. After a few minutes of trying to remember, he finally realized that it was the door on the left. \"I know it's a long road ahead but I'm not going to stand here and wait.\" He said as he slowly gets down from the tall flower and into the ground. Looking ahead, he made his way across the vast jungles of grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been about an hour and a half, but Will managed to see a clearing along the way. Afterwords, he finally found himself in a pathway that leads to the door. \"There it is!\" he said as he saw the door that was still far ahead. Will just hope he's correct on this as he made another dash towards it. After a good 30 minutes or so, he finally managed to get in front of the enormous door. \"So...this is how big the giants in this world are...\" Will said as looked above to see how huge the door was to his puny bug-sized form. He quickly shook his head and focus on the his destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill slowly approached the small space (which was big enough to for a tiny creature like him to crawl under) and take a small peak. Fortunately he was right, it did in fact lead to the kitchen as he could see a dining table, a refrigerator, a sink and pretty much anything else what he normally find in a typical kitchen. Will quickly crawl underneath the door and into the massive house of the giants. So far, no giants are in this room yet so he must look for some pieces of food to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill surveyed across the floor and spotted the dining table. \"I wondered if anyone in this family ever left something for me to eat.\" he said as he rushed towards under the table and saw a few crumbs all over the spot. Feeling a rumble from his stomach once more, he began to eat the crumbs, one by one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating a few of them, he noticed that these crumbs won't really fill stomach too quickly and decided to leave the table. After he left, he saw something on the shelf that he could try to get food from: a box of cookies. \"Now how I'm I going to get up there?\" he said. Just as he was about to go towards the shelf, he quickly freezes when he heard a faint sound coming from the next room. It sounded like....footstep! \"Oh crap, it must be one of the giant inhabitants!\" he said. He wanted to run and hide, but he realized that it was too late because he can hear the door about to open. Will watched as the door soon opened to reveal a...</span></div></div>",

In this case Rather than dealing with the previous main Character Ash,  this interactive will be about a new character, a 17 year old named Will who has also found himself in a reality where cartoon characters are not only flesh and blood but hundreds of feet tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make it easier for some of you to Add to this Interactive I've decided to Add a choice between having the Characters the same age as they are in the cartoon, or a few years older.   For the younger incarnations don't do anything too adult. Keep it Honey I shrunk the Kids level adventure, but for the older incarnations pretty much anything goes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill is Tiny in this interactive.  Not quite an inch tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThemes I'd like to see<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware and aware<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMistaken for a bug or toy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFoot/ footplay <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVore / Mouth Play<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExploration.
